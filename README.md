## **Press Releases:** 

Note: since house.gov and senate.gov pages are retired once the respective member leaves office (i.e. retirement, resignation, promotion, or death), press releases by members who were not serving at the time of the web scraping (March 2019) were not collected as they are essentially lost.

#### **109_to_114:** 

Press releases for members of Congress serving continuously between the 109th session and 114th session of Congress. Per the note above, members of this list must also be currently in office.

#### **2014_close_elections:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were elected in 2014 in a close election (i.e. winning with a vote margin of 5% or less).

#### **2014_newly_elected:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were newly elected to office in 2014. Members who had previously served as a US Representative or Senator (i.e. an individual elected to the Senate in 2014 who had previsouly served as a US Representative) were excluded as they do not appropriately represent the sample group.
