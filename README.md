## **press_releases:** 

Note: since house.gov and senate.gov pages are retired once the respective member leaves office (i.e. retirement, resignation, promotion, or death), press releases by members who were not serving at the time of the web scraping (March 2019) were not collected as they are essentially lost. An exception was made for former-Senator John McCain, whose press releases were scraped with initial test code before his death.

### **109_to_114:** 

Press releases for members of Congress serving continuously between the 109th session and 114th session of Congress. Per the note above, members of this list must also be currently in office.

### **2014_close_elections:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were elected in 2014 in a close election (i.e. winning with a vote margin of 5% or less). One member (Jim Costa) was excluded from the list as he assumed office in 2005 and thus may not appropriately represent the sample group. Per initial note, members of this list must also be currently in office.

### **2014_newly_elected:** 

Press releases for members of Congress who were newly elected to office in 2014. Members who had previously served as a US Representative or Senator (i.e. an individual elected to the Senate in 2014 who had previsouly served as a US Representative) were excluded as they do not appropriately represent the sample group. Per initial note, members of this list must also be currently in office.

## **tweets:** 

All tweets were scraped with Tom Dickinson's script, which can bypass the 3.2k tweet limit that Twitter's API faces. Dickinson's original code can be found [here](https://github.com/tomkdickinson/Twitter-Search-API-Python). A modified version of his script for the purpose of this study is provided in the **tweets** folder. Members' tweets can be found in the corresponding **109_to_114**, **2014_close_elections**, and **2014_newly_elected** folders.
