For Sonoma County, Cristina Montoya, Cotati Police Dispatcher and Clerk, and Santa Rosa Fire Captain Don Ricci have been selected. “In our district and across our state, this year has been a challenging one for our law enforcement and first responders.

A statement from Thompson on his support is below. “Climate change is the most existential threat we face today. I have long said that if we do not act now nothing else we do matters because there won’t be a planet to pass on to our children. That’s why I am a proud, original cosponsor of the Green New Deal, a resolution stating the steps we must take to address climate change. Today the United States Congress is making a bold statement about climate change. We are saying that we must take this threat seriously, that we must take action, and that we must use every tool at our disposal to get this done. This includes strengthening our resiliency against future disasters exacerbated by climate change, modernizing our infrastructure, deepening our renewable energy capacity, and mitigating the negative health and economic impacts we are already experiencing due to climate change.

02.05.2019	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement in reaction to the President’s State of the Union Address. “Tonight’s address was what we have come to expect from this President – empty rhetoric aimed at fulfilling useless campaign promises and calls for unity that are not reflected with action. I was disappointed the President did not even mention gun violence prevention or efforts to combat climate change. I was also disappointed with continued discussion of the wall on our southern border. I have said before and will say again – there is no need for a border wall that is just a 7th Century solution to a 21st Century problem. Democrats are ready to work to fund smart, effective and technologically-advanced security solutions to keep our nation safe, just not a useless wall. “The President discussed several areas where he would like to work in a bipartisan manner – including health care, infrastructure and growing our middle class – issues I have long worked on in Congress. While I welcome his ideas and participation, our new majority is not waiting around. In fact, we have already started, and we will continue to work to make health care more affordable and accessible, and modernize our infrastructure for the 21st Century, no matter what the President tweets about tomorrow. “As with anything this President does, the proof is in his action and not just his words. It remains to be seen what action he will take. I said after the election and I say again tonight – I will always work with anyone, regardless of party, who has ideas to help our district and our nation. Regardless of what was said tonight, I will keep working to advance policies that put our community first and help our district move forward.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means where he chairs the Subcommittee on Tax Policy. Rep. Thompson is Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force.

02.04.2019	Washington – Today Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that his guest to the State of the Union will be Dr. Joseph V. Sakran, Assistant Professor of Surgery, Associate Chief of the Division of Acute Care Surgery, and Director of Emergency General Surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Sakran was nearly killed by a gunshot wound as a teenager and has spent his life working to care for trauma victims, including those injured by gun violence. “Dr. Sakran knows the lasting trauma gun violence has on its victims. He has seen it as a first responder, as a surgeon in the emergency department, and firsthand as a survivor of gun violence himself. He has dedicated his life to caring for fellow survivors and I am humbled to have him as my guest to this year’s State of the Union address,” said Chairman Thompson. “His own story and the stories of far too many survivors he has cared for in the emergency department are powerful reminders of the work we must do to help prevent future tragedies. His presence will send a message that Congress will act to help prevent gun violence and to honor those victims like Dr. Sakran and his patients.” “It is my honor to join Congressman Mike Thompson at the State of The Union,” said Dr. Sakran. “His strong voice on ending gun violence in America is a clear demonstration of his commitment on ensuring the safety of the American people.” Each year for the State of the Union address, Members of Congress can offer one ticket to a guest of their choosing. These slots are often used to highlight issues of importance to the member and their work in Congress.

Thompson also released the full membership of the Task Force for the current Congress, including new members. “After last year’s historic election and with our new majority ready to hold hearings and cast votes, I am honored to announce the leadership for the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force in this 116th Congress. These members hail from across our country, bring a diverse skillset and have already shown dedication and conviction on this issue. They have what it takes to combat gun violence,” said Chairman Thompson. “Together, I know we can take the action the American people have been demanding.” New Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Vice Chairs are Representative Jason Crow (CO-06) and Representative Lucy McBath (GA-06). "I have long said our leaders need to lead from the front. As a country, we can no longer afford to allow the gun manufacturers and special interests to dictate our policy on gun violence prevention. My community knows the horror of gun violence all too well and it is my goal that we never see what happened in Aurora, what happened in Columbine occur ever again.” said Vice Chair Crow. “As Vice Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I look forward to advocating for the thousands of families nationwide who have been impacted by gun violence and pushing Congress to take long-awaited action." “The pain of losing a child to gun violence never ends. That pain drives me to fight for common-sense gun reform every single day. Thank you to Congressman Thompson for his leadership, and for the opportunity to serve as a Vice Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, where I will continue to work to keep families like mine from experiencing the horror and heartbreak brought on by gun violence,” said Vice Chair McBath. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Task Force to ensure the safety of our communities. Our nation deserves common-sense solutions for every student who has ever been afraid to go to school, for the parents who have ever worried if their child would come home, and for all who know that our country can do better.” New Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chief Whip is Representative Ted Deutch (FL-22) and Deputy Whips include Representative Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Representative Jahana Hayes (CT-05) and Representative Marc A. Veasey (TX-33). “Last November, the American people sent to Washington a historic gun safety majority in the House of Representatives,” said Chief Whip Deutch. “With this mandate, we will pursue sensible and effective policies to reduce gun violence plaguing every part of our nation. We have a responsibility to pass laws that will make all Americans safer from gun violence, whether they’re our children in schools or our law enforcement officers patrolling the streets. Through this Task Force we will work to guarantee gun violence prevention remains a top priority for Congress.” “It’s unconscionable that so many of our fellow Americans are killed and wounded by gunfire every year – especially when we have the tools to stop this violence,” said Deputy Whip Madeleine Dean. “We can save lives right now by requiring universal background checks and other commonsense gun safety measures.” “Thank you to everyone for their consideration in selecting me to serve as Whip for the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,” said Deputy Whip Hayes. “I am committed to working with my colleagues on common sense gun reform legislation that will keep our communities safer and protect the rights of responsible gun owners. It has been a generation since Congress passed any major legislation to address this growing concern and we owe it to our children to no longer remain silent on this issue.” “I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson as a Whip for the Gun Violence Prevention Taskforce,” said Deputy Whip Veasey. “It’s critical that we work across the aisle to pass common sense firearm safety in the 116th Congress to end the cycle of violence from mass shootings that are haunting this country.” Returning Vice Chairs include Representatives David Cicilline (RI-01), Val Demings (FL-10), Robin Kelly (IL-02), Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18), Grace Napolitano (CA-32), Ed Perlmutter (CO-07), David Price (NC-04), Kathleen Rice (NY-04), Bobby Scott (VA-03), José E.

01.31.2019	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. John Katko (NY-24) announced they have reintroduced the bipartisan and bicameral Mental Health Access Improvement Act. This bill would expand access to mental health services for seniors by allowing Medicare coverage to include marriage and family therapists and mental health counselors. “Far too many of our seniors don’t have adequate access to mental health care at a time in their lives when they are at greater risk for mental illnesses. Left unaddressed, this access gap can exacerbate other health problems and increase health costs. This is an unacceptable outcome for our nation’s older Americans,” said Thompson. “That’s why I’ve once again introduced the Mental Health Access Improvement Access to ensure seniors can see a wide range of qualified mental health professionals through their Medicare. This bill is an important piece of ensuring we are providing for the health of our nation’s seniors.” “I’m proud to join my colleague Rep. Thompson to re-introduce this important bipartisan legislation to improve access to mental healthcare. This measure will not only increase access to care for older Americans in communities nationwide, but it will help alleviate the strain on our nation’s mental health and addiction workforce,” said Katko. “I’ll continue to fight at home in Central New York and in Washington to ensure individuals and families receive the care they need. Under current regulations, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers and psychiatric nurses are currently recognized to offer covered mental health services under Medicare. This does not include mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists who have the same training and education but are not able to be reimbursed by Medicare and thus more expensive for seniors. This bill closes that gap by adding those providers to the list of those accessible to Medicare beneficiaries. A bipartisan companion bill was introduced in the Senate by Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and John Barrasso (R-WY). ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.30.2019	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Rob Wittman (VA-01) announced the bipartisan and bicameral reintroduction of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA), a bill that authorizes $60 million per year for wetlands conservation from 2020 to 2024. A bipartisan companion bill was also introduced in the Senate by Senators Martin Heinrich (D-NM), John Kennedy (R-LA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Tom Carper (D-DE). “Our nation’s wetlands contain some of our most beautiful spaces and habitats that are home to a variety of diverse species. Conserving those wetlands is also a critical part of preventing future storm damage and soil erosion,” said Thompson. “That’s why I am honored to reintroduce the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, a bill that funds conservation and mitigation projects at wetlands across our nation. We know that this works, in fact it’s one of our most cost-effective conservation projects. Since 1991, outside partners have invested more than $3 billion to match federal investments of $1.5 billion, well-exceeding match requirements. These investments create local jobs and boost local economies and I am proud to be fighting to ensure this program gets the funding it needs from Congress.” “Washington should be doing more to identify those federal programs, like NAWCA, that have proven to be successful. NAWCA matches funding from private, state, local partners that then contribute to job creation in our communities,” said Wittman. “Protecting, restoring, and managing wetland habitats is important, and it is critical that we invest efficiently to conserve these areas for the use and enjoyment of future generations.” “For more than 30 years, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act has been a proven, cost-effective program for conserving our nation’s vital wetland and waterfowl habitat,” said President of Ducks Unlimited Rogers Hoyt. “The introduction of this bill is a strong first step to ensure the next generation of Americans, especially waterfowl hunters, have access to the same natural resources we enjoy today. We thank Representatives Thompson and Wittman for supporting the NAWCA program and look forward to working with Congress to pass this bill.” The North American Wetlands Conservation Act works to reduce wetlands disappearance by leveraging federal investment to raise contributions from private organizations like landowners, businesses, and state and local governments that support conservation grants. Lands protected under NAWCA offer hunting, fishing, wildlife viewing and other tourism opportunities in which over 100 million Americans participated and spent over $150 billion in 2016 alone. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.30.2019	Washington – Today Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05) lauded the announcement from House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerold Nadler (NY-10) that his committee would hold a hearing entitled “Preventing Gun Violence: A Call to Action” next Wednesday, February 6 at 10am. This is the first hearing on this topic in nearly a decade and since the Democrats retook the majority. A statement from Thompson is below. “The U.S. House of Representatives is finally taking action to prevent gun violence – our new majority is answering the call of the American people. For six years, our Task Force implored the previous majority to hold hearings and we were denied. This is a new day – we will have a hearing and we will get results. I am deeply grateful to Chairman Nadler for his leadership on this issue. This is just the beginning and I look forward to having a vote on H.R. 8, my Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and taking action the American people have been demanding. No longer will Congress be silent on this issue.” Thompson is the lead author of H.R. 8, a bipartisan bill that expands background checks on all gun sales. The bill currently has 229 cosponsors, including 5 Republicans.

01.28.2019	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Dave Joyce (OH-14) announced they have reintroduced the Portable Fuel Container Safety Act, a bill that directs the Consumer Product Safety Commission to put forth a standard requiring Flame Mitigation Devices like flame arrestors to be used to prevent fire accidents. “Far too many tragic and deadly fires and explosions happen because fuel containers are not safe enough for everyday use. When my constituent Margrett Lewis brought this problem to my attention and shared her family’s powerful story, I knew that Congress needed to take action,” said Thompson. “My bill will help prevent fires like the one injured Margrett and badly burned her daughter and keep other families safe from this kind of preventable fire. I will fight to pass this bill in our new majority and implement this commonsense safety measure.” “I’m proud to join Rep. Mike Thompson in re-introducing this commonsense, public safety legislation,” said Joyce. “By ensuring portable fuel containers come equipped with basic safety measures, we can help prevent dangerous accidents that threaten the lives of thousands each year.” Under current standards, flammable or combustible liquids can ignite within their containers causing more than 160,000 fires, injuring nearly 4,000 people, and killing 454 each year. Flame arrestors can help prevent these types of accidents, but currently there is no requirement for them to be used for the consumer containers found in most homes and for everyday use. The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act would establish safety standards to help prevent these tragic accidents. The legislation is endorsed by the American Burn Association, the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the International Association of Fire Fighters, the National Association of State Fire Marshalls and the National Fire Protection Association. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.08.2019	Washington – Today Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05), Congressman Pete King (NY-02), Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler (NY-10), Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), House Judiciary Subcommittee Chairwoman Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18), Congressman Brian Mast (FL-18), Congresswomen Robin Kelly (IL-02), Congressman Fred Upton (MI-06), Congresswoman Lucy McBath (GA-06), and Congressman Chris Smith (NJ-04) announced the introduction of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, legislation that requires background checks on all firearm sales. The 10 bipartisan, original coauthors introduced this legislation on the eighth anniversary of the Tucson shooting where 6 were killed and 13 were wounded by gunfire, including Former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords. Bill text is available here. “Since the inception of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force after the shooting at Sandy Hook, we have been working across the aisle to help prevent gun violence. Today we take a decisive step forward to help save lives right away. As a gun owner, hunter and supporter of the Second Amendment, I am honored to join with Democratic and Republican colleagues to introduce my universal background checks bill that will help keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them,” said Chairman Thompson. “From the public polling to the ballot box, the American people have spoken up and demanded action to help end the tragedy of gun violence that far too many in our country face every day. We will continue our fight and we will deliver.” “There is no single law that can put an end to mass shootings or gun violence, but there are certainly proactive steps we can take to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill. When background checks are used, they keep guns out of the hands of people we all agree shouldn’t have guns,” said Congressman King. “As government officials it is our responsibility to protect our citizens, and when it comes to gun violence we must do more. The overwhelming majority of Americans want to see action, and we owe it to the victims and their families to prevent such tragedies from occurring again. I am proud to be the lead Republican sponsor of this legislation.” “The background check requirement for firearms sales in current federal law is riddled with loopholes that make it far too easy for dangerous people to get guns. It is time we expand these checks to include all gun sales,” said Chairman Nadler. “The American people overwhelmingly support universal background checks which will make us safer from gun violence, and I am proud to cosponsor this critical legislation.” “Background checks are a proven, effective measure in keeping our communities safe,” said Congressman Fitzpatrick. “This common-sense legislation protects the constitutional rights of law abiding Americans while seeking to prevent felons, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill from lawfully purchasing a firearm. Congress owes our nation’s families and children bipartisan gun safety reform, and the introduction of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 brings us closer towards fulfilling that obligation.” “Everyone agrees our schools, movie theaters shopping malls, streets and communities need to be safer. But we need a comprehensive approach that goes beyond just arming more people with more guns to make this happen. One way that we can come closer to ending the scourge of gun violence is ensuring that guns do not get into the wrong hands to begin with,” said Chairwoman Jackson Lee. “This is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation and I commend all of my colleagues for their tireless work on this important initiative.” “Serving in the military, I held my fellow soldiers as the last breath went out of them. Our students, teachers, parishioners, mothers, fathers or any other civilian should never have to confront this tragedy,” said Congressman Mast. “As Members of Congress, we weren’t sent to Washington to do just what’s easy — we were sent here to take action and that's exactly what this bill is: a unified effort to save lives." “For too long, Congress has ignored the gun violence epidemic that claims American lives each and every day. With H.R. 8, Congressional Democrats are taking a commonsense, bipartisan and broadly-supported step forward toward a future where no mother has to bury her child because of gun violence,” said Congresswoman Kelly. “We know that background checks work to reduce gun violence and gun violence deaths. As we continue working to prevent gun violence, we know that good gun safety policies must be coupled with investment and re-investment in our communities so young people pick up hammers and computer skills, instead of guns and bullets.” “This common-sense, bipartisan bill will help keep our communities safe from gun violence by expanding existing background checks and keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals,” said Congressman Upton. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we continue to tackle unacceptable gun violence in a bipartisan manner.” "Seven years ago, gun violence ripped my son away from me. For my family and the 96 American families who lose a loved one to gun violence every single day, background checks are long overdue,” said Congresswoman McBath. “I am proud to co-sponsor this bill as a necessary step to making our schools, movie theaters, and public spaces safer for our families." “During my tenure in Congress, I have always supported reasonable laws that protect Second Amendment rights while ensuring that felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others do not have access to guns,” said Congressman Smith. “This common-sense legislation would further this end by strengthening protections against unlawful gun purchases — closing the ‘private sale loophole’ and listing all those prohibited from buying a firearm in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.” ### The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was established after the tragedy at Sandy Hook and has grown to a membership of more than 165.
12.18.2018	Washington – Today Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that he and other Vice Chairs of the Task Force have asked each incoming committee chair to holding hearings on gun violence issues of jurisdiction to their committee. “The American people want Congress to do everything in its power to address gun violence and the new majority will take action. That’s why the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force called on all the incoming committee chairs to hold hearings to address issues of gun violence pertinent to their committee work, from public health to funding for research to school safety. We can and we will work to keep our communities safe from gun violence.” A summary of the request made to each incoming committee chair is below. The letters were signed by Chairman Thompson and Vice Chairs David N. Cicilline (RI-01), Val Demings (FL-10), Elizabeth Esty (CT-05), Robin Kelly (IL-02), Grace Napolitano (CA-32), Ed Perlmutter (CO-07), David Price (NC-04), Kathleen Rice (NY-04), and Bobby Scott (VA-03). Committee on Agriculture: The Committee represents and serves the diverse agricultural sectors. You know as well as anyone that the tradition of responsible rural gun ownership is the story of our Nation. From safe storage to training and education, rural gun owners have been at the forefront. Hearing from responsible gun owners about their support for commonsense legislative reforms will be key to building our coalition. Committee on Appropriations: Democrats on the Committee on Appropriations have long fought to provide resources to the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence. As hearings are held on the Fiscal Year 2020 appropriations bill, the critical CDC funding should be at the top of the list for consideration. The Committee on Appropriations should also conduct hearings to assess current funding needs for programs designed to address all different aspects of gun violence in the U.S., including community-based violence intervention programs to suicide prevention and education initiatives. Committee on Armed Services: Mental health screenings before enlistment and at the end of service can be an effective tool to identify who are mentally fit to handle a firearm. Presently, these screenings are insufficient and resources scarce. Congress should look at ways that we can ensure that guns are kept out of the hands of people who should not have them. Committee on Budget: Gun violence is estimated to cost the American economy at least $229 billion every year, including $8.6 billion in direct emergency and medical care. Congress must look at budget priorities and how funding can be made available to necessary programs and agencies. We can’t come at this issue of gun violence piecemeal. We need an organized approach across all budget categories to identify where we can make smart investments to reduce gun violence that will save lives and offer long term cost savings. The Committee on Budget is uniquely situated to do so. Committee on Education and Labor: In 2018, there have been at least 82 incidents of gunfire on school grounds. The Administration’s response has been to propose arming teachers. Any consideration of gun violence must look at how we keep students, teachers, and staff safe. In addition, the Committee may also consider examining the role that therapists and mental health specialists in schools, as well as the shortage of mental health professionals nationwide, as part of its comprehensive look into the issue. Committee on Energy and Commerce: Gun violence is a public health crisis. Health professionals are coming together to demand reform and to bring their unique perspective to confronting the trauma of gun violence every day. Hearing from these professionals about their daily interactions with survivors and victims would be invaluable. In addition, as part of its consumer safety agenda, the Committee might consider looking into Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations, including smart gun technologies. Committee on Financial Service: Banks and companies across the country are cutting ties with the gun lobby and manufacturers. They have found that the gun lobby is not important to their bottom lines and that they can play a role in ending gun violence. In addition, corporate leaders are taking a stand and finding innovative ways to change the conversation and could be a valuable resource on the topic. Committee on Foreign Affairs: This Administration is looking for any way it can to loosen gun regulations, including moving certain responsibilities from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce and other agencies. Overturning such longstanding policy is a gift to manufacturers and does nothing to make the world safer from gun violence. Any effort to weaken regulations on international sales and exports requires close Congressional attention and oversight. Committee on Homeland Security: Public gatherings large and small have become a target of mass shooters and domestic terrorists. Sadly, ensuring that public events are secure against these threats is part of our way of life now. There are a number of methods to reduce the window of opportunity for a shooter and respond effectively. Unfortunately, gun violence is now a major homeland security issue and we ask the Committee to hold a hearing. Committee on Judiciary: As the committee with the largest jurisdiction, we look forward to working with Chairman Nadler to address a wide range of issues, including universal background checks, gun violence restraining orders, trafficking, domestic violence, ATF reform, assault weapons and magazine size, and other issues important to our Task Force members. Committee on Natural Resources: Incidents like the Bundy takeover show how extremists are using public lands to promote and grow anti-government movements. Bundy is not unique in this action; it is taking place on public lands across the country. Heavily armed militia do damage to public lands and prevent others from using them. This is just one issue of many the Committee might want to examine. Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: Investigations have shown there are strong ties between the gun lobby and Russian agents who interfered in our elections. This partnership to undermine our democracy while also pushing an extremist gun agenda deserves a thorough investigation by your esteemed investigative team. Committee on Science, Space and Technology: Firearm technology is advancing at a faster pace than policy. From 3-D printing to smart technology to online apps, technology is changing the way guns are sold and used. It is time Congress start more closely examining these trends and technologies and your Committee is uniquely positioned to do so. Committee on Small Business: Gun violence is an economic issue. Studies have found that an increase in gun violence in neighborhoods can lower the number of businesses and jobs created. This factor is too often ignored, and small business owners and their employees will continue to suffer until this crisis is addressed. Your Committee is uniquely suited to take this issue on. Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure: Many states with the strongest gun laws still see high numbers of gun deaths. Criminals are using what is called the “Iron Pipeline,” to traffic guns from states with weak gun laws. Our transportation systems should not be used to undermine our gun laws and we ask that the Committee consider investigating how our infrastructure is being used to skirt state laws and traffic firearms. Committee on Veterans Affairs: Every day, more than 20 veterans commit suicide, a majority of those do so with a gun. The intersection of gun-related suicides and the veterans’ community urgently needs attention. There are successful programs and innovative proposals that could save the lives of our Nation’s heroes. Committee on Ways and Means: Though mental health is not the leading cause of gun violence we cannot afford to ignore the role it plays. Access to quality, affordable health care can help to reduce the more than 60 suicides by gun that happen every day in America. As part of a robust health care agenda, we ask the Committee to keep the crossroads of guns and mental health on the agenda, including debunking cultural stereotypes about mental health and gun violence. ###
12.17.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02) announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded more than $2.9 million to the Sonoma County Water Agency for relocation of a portion of the water supply pipeline outside a hazard zone, providing for increased resiliency to future disasters. “Ensuring our community is better prepared to withstand disasters is one of my highest priorities in Congress, which is why I am proud to announce this federal funding that will shore up our water transmission systems across Sonoma County,” said Thompson. “Our water infrastructure must be modernized and ready to continue serving the customers who rely on it, no matter the disaster scenario.” “In aftermath of the catastrophic wildfires that rocked Northern California, we must do everything we can ensure our communities are as ready as possible for future disasters,” said Huffman. “I’m glad to announce that the Sonoma Counter Water Agency will receive this federal support to update their water infrastructure to be prepared in case of emergency. We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners to ensure that our districts have every resource needed during the long path to recovery and resiliency.” “We are very grateful for this show of support from our federal partners. This project will increase the resiliency and reliability of our water transmission system,” said James Gore, Chair of the Sonoma Water Board of Directors. “This will help us maintain safe and reliable drinking water for our 600,000 customers in the event of an earthquake. Investing in our critical infrastructure is one of the most important services that government provides.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.14.2018	Washington – Today Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on the sixth anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. “Six years ago, our hearts were broken. Broken for the mothers and fathers whose children never came home, broken for the families of teachers who were dedicated to inspiring the next generation, and broken for the loved ones who pause each day to remember the precious life they lost. Every year since we have been blocked from acting to prevent gun violence. But we will honor their deaths with action – action that will help keep our schools, our children, and our communities safe. We will pass legislation in the next Congress to address gun violence. And we will never forget those lives, the promise they held that was taken too soon. Today, our hearts are heavy. Tomorrow, we will act.” ### The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was established after the tragedy at Sandy Hook and has grown to a membership of more than 145.
12.07.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and Rep. Jim Langevin (RI-02), a senior member of the House on Armed Services Committee, responded to a Department of Defense’s (DOD) Investigator General (IG) report on the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. “Today’s report highlights a clear failure by both the Department of Defense and the United States Air Force to submit information to law enforcement that could have helped prevent this shooting. Putting records in the system helps keep firearms out of the hands of those who are a danger to themselves or others and the DOD and USAF must be held accountable for this grave oversight,” said Chairman Thompson. “This report is yet another indicator of why a strong background checks system is so important and why all relevant entities must have an obligation to information that can help keep people safe. And it’s why I plan to fight for passage of legislation mandating universal background checks in the upcoming, 116th Congress. Background checks work and they will help keep our constituents safer from gun violence.” “The Inspector General’s report is very disturbing. There were six opportunities for the Air Force to ensure this dangerous individual could not purchase a firearm, yet information about his history of violence was never conveyed to the FBI,” said Ranking Member Langevin. “These systematic failures are unacceptable, and I will continue vigorous oversight in Congress to ensure a lapse like this never happens again. The victims of the Sutherland Springs shooting deserved better from our government, and while nothing will bring their loved ones back, we owe it to them to do everything in our power to keep guns out of the wrong hands and stem the tide of gun violence that has taken so many innocent lives.” Because the shooter in Sutherland Springs had a criminal history, that information should have been submitted to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In November 2017, Thompson and Langevin wrote to the Secretary of Defense asking why those conviction records were not submitted. Today, the IG concluded that the United States Air Force clearly failed to follow DOD policy. The report makes recommendations to address this failure. A copy of the letter Thompson, Langevin and 75 other Democrats sent to the Secretary of Defense is attached. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.03.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced a plan has been finalized to expand the American Canyon Post Office by 700 square feet. Construction will begin in January and last around three months. The Post Office will stay open throughout the duration of the expansion. “As our community continues to grow, it’s crucial that essential services like the Post Office are expanded to suit our needs. That’s why I am so proud to announce this expansion so that our American Canyon community has better postal services,” said Congressman Thompson. “With more space and increased customer service capacity, the Post Office will allow the city to better communicate and interact with our district, our state, and our nation.” “A new post office for American Canyon has been a long time coming. American Canyon residents greatly appreciate Congressman Mike Thompson’s leadership in the discussions with USPS officials to bring this about,” said American Canyon Mayor Leon Garcia. “American Canyon has doubled in population to twenty thousand residents since our current post office opened. We all look forward to the completion of this expansion that will better serve the needs of our community.” “We are glad to be giving the community of American Canyon what they have long asked for to meet their daily postal needs – a larger facility,” said Augustine Ruiz, Bay Area Spokesman, United States Postal Service. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.21.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued a letter to fellow House Democrats urging them to join him in supporting Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House of Representatives. Text of his letter is as follows: Dear Colleague, It will come as no surprise that my choice for Speaker of the House of Representatives is Nancy Pelosi. She’s been my pick from day one and it’s because I’ve seen the depth and breadth of what she can accomplish for the American people starting the moment she is sworn in. My support is based on what I’ve seen her accomplish and how she’s brought out the best in our caucus. She identifies the talent and skills of caucus members and allows them to do their good work. The result has been preventing a major depression in 2008, passing the Affordable Care Act with protections for people with pre-existing conditions, implementing a recovery act that put people to work and saved our economy, passing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and helping to pass legislation to provide our veterans with great opportunities. When I ran for Congress the first time it was against a Republican in a Republican-leaning district and I was proud to have her support. My opponent then and every one since has raised her as an issue, but it never worked and it never will. Nancy is a true professional and will lead our party to another great victory in 2020. Under her leadership, we will deliver for the American people. As a Vietnam combat veteran, I know there is no one in our caucus I’d rather share a proverbial foxhole with than Nancy Pelosi. I encourage you to join in support of Nancy and let’s get to doing the work our constituents sent us here to do. Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON Member of Congress ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.15.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Co-Chair of the Natural Disaster Caucus, and Rep. Francis Rooney (FL-19) announced they have introduced H.R. 7131, the PHONE Act, a bipartisan bill to allow survivors of natural disasters who have lost their homes to keep their land line phone numbers at no cost while they rebuild. Thompson’s district was impacted by the Atlas and Tubbs fires in October 2017 and the Mendocino Complex fires in August 2018. Rooney’s district was impacted by Hurricane Irma in September 2017. “Survivors of natural disasters who have lost their homes deserve peace of mind knowing their phone number will be preserved and that they can easily transition back to that piece of normalcy once they have rebuilt,” said Thompson. “After the October 2017 wildfires, several constituents who had their homes destroyed came to me asking if there was anything I could to do restore the landlines they had for decades and today I am glad we have a legislative solution for them and other survivors like them. I will continue working to bring every federal dollar and resource to help my constituents and all survivors of natural disasters recover and rebuild.” “The PHONE Act is common sense bipartisan legislation and will ensure that as victims of natural disasters go through the painful process of rebuilding following loss of property, they will have one less burden to bear,” said Rooney. “The recent devastation in Florida caused by Hurricane Michael is a stark reminder of the need to find every way possible to assist these victims.” You can click here to learn more about H.R. 7131. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.08.2018	Washington – Today Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement after the tragic mass shooting at a bar in Thousand Oaks, California. “Yet again, a nation stands horrified at a mass shooting. Young people trying to enjoy a night of music and friendship were gunned down and a Sheriff’s Sergeant lost his life trying to keep his community safe. My heart is broken and mourning those lives lost and those lives that will never be the same. “And again, Republican leaders will do nothing to prevent these tragic incidents. Our constituents deserve action that will yield measurable results to keep people safe. That is why I will continue to fight to pass commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation now and in the new, 116th Congress.

10.24.2018	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02) announced that the Counties of Sonoma and Mendocino and the City of Santa Rosa will receive nearly $3.5 million in Housing and Urban Development funding for public housing agencies impacted by the 2017 wildfires. Thompson and Huffman advocated for this funding, made available through the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which they both supported. Sonoma County plans to utilize this funding to provide housing to 180 local families. Mendocino County will use the funds to provide rental assistance for 130 families across the county. The City of Santa Rosa will use these funds to provide housing for 40 low-income families still struggling to afford a place to live after last year’s fires. “Ensuring our communities still recovering from last year’s fires have access to affordable housing is a critical piece of our efforts to rebuild. We want to ensure everyone has a roof over their heads that they can afford right here in our district,” said Thompson. “That’s why I am proud to announce today’s housing funding that will go directly into our communities to address this key to recovery. I will not stop working to bring home every federal dollar and resource to support our work on the road to rebuild.” “In the aftermath of the devastating wildfires that rocked our communities, affordable housing must be readily available for our local families who are struggling to get back on their feet,” said Huffman. “I’m glad to see that this vital housing support will finally be allocated to those in need. In the days ahead, I will continue to work with local and federal partners to make sure fire survivors have every resource needed during the long path to recovery.” “This new funding will allow the Sonoma County Housing Authority to house 180 families from our years-long waiting list,” explained Sonoma County Board of Supervisor James Gore. “Sonoma County’s housing shortage became much more severe in the wake of the fires, and low-income working families and seniors on fixed incomes have struggled to find housing they can afford. The Housing Choice Voucher program helps low income members of our community rent homes in the private market, so every new dollar helps us fill critical needs.” "The devastation of the 2017 wildfires will impact the counties and residents for years to come,” said Darcie Antle, Disaster Recovery Finance Director, County of Mendocino. “We are all very appreciative of this funding and wish to extend a special thank you to Rep. Huffman and Rep. Thompson for their continued dedication to help rebuild our communities." “We are pleased to learn of the additional funding allocation that will help support our City’s most vulnerable residents,” said Santa Rosa Mayor Chris Coursey. “A year later, some families are still struggling as a result of the fire’s devastation to our community, and we need all of the help we can get to make sure each of our residents has a safe and secure place to call home.” You can click here to learn more about this funding. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

John Garamendi (CA-03) announced that the Mendocino Complex Disaster Declaration has been amended to offer Small Business Administration (SBA) loans to private non-profit organizations in Lake County.

10.04.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. John Garamendi (CA-03) announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has granted Public Assistance for Lake County for the Ranch and River Fires, commonly known as the Mendocino Complex fires. This declaration allows federal funds to be available to state and local governments provide support and assistance during the recovery process for the Mendocino Complex fires, which began on July 27, 2018 and burned across the region. “As Lake County continues to recover and firefighters continue battling this terrible blaze, our community is once again demonstrating our resilience. This public assistance will give state and local governments the support they need as we work to help our community return to normal,” said Thompson. “Again, I want to thank all the incredible firefighters, first responders, and law enforcement who are still working to fight this fire and keep our community safe. This is another important step on our journey to recovery.” “I appreciate FEMA’s grant of Public Assistance for the victims of the Mendocino Complex fires. This will unlock crucial help as our communities seek to rebuild,” said Garamendi. I thank all the emergency personnel who have been instrumental in saving lives and property and continue to work tirelessly to fight these fires and keep people safe.” Public Assistance is federal funding for local communities to use to repair critical public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure and sewage collection facilities. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and locals governments split the remaining 25 percent. Individual Assistance for Lake County for the Mendocino Complex fires was granted on August 17, 2018, which included federal support for residents who had homes or businesses damaged or destroyed. On August 7, 2018, Thompson and Garamendi, along with Rep. Jared Huffman, lead a bipartisan letter to the President urging him to approve the disaster declaration and make these funds available to fire survivors. Thompson has also prepared a Disaster Guide to help constituents navigate the recovery process that you can read by clicking here. The Mendocino Complex fires began on July 27, 2018 and have burned over 459,000 acres. Over 300 structures were damaged or destroyed. Thousands were forced to evacuate. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.26.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that his legislative language to allow Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Hazard Mitigation funds to cover the costs of fixing underground water systems and remove standing burned trees was included in the final FAA Reauthorization and Disaster Recovery Reform Act that passed the House. This legislation will allow Santa Rosa to use FEMA funds to address outstanding community infrastructure needs, while making the city more resilient. This legislation now heads to the Senate and is expected to be signed into law before the end of September. “Our community is continuing to recover from last year’s devastating wildfires and we have found that not all recovery needs fit FEMA’s current rules and regulations. That’s why I worked with my colleagues in both parties and both chambers to add legislation to this package that will give FEMA the ability to use hazard mitigation funding to address these disaster needs,” said Thompson. “This is a critical step toward removing standing and burned trees and replacing the water system in Fountaingrove that was damaged by fire. I will continue fighting to get our community every possible federal dollar and resource to help in the recovery process.” These provisions were passed in April as part of the initial FAA reauthorization and disaster relief package. Today’s bill reflects a conference committee report that compromises the House and Senate versions. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.13.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) slammed Republicans on the House Committee on Ways and Means for unanimously rejecting his amendment to provide targeted tax relief for victims of natural disasters. The amendment was offered to H.R. 6760, the second iteration of Republican-led tax cut bill, during a markup in the committee. A statement from Thompson on the amendment is below. “In the last year, our district has suffered both the most destructive and the largest fire in California history. The survivors of these fires and all natural disasters should not have to come begging to Congress to get tax relief as they work to recover and rebuild. Last year after hurricanes ravaged his Texas district, Chairman Brady offered a bill that provided targeted tax relief for the victims of disaster that struck his community. Today, he and the rest of the Republicans on the committee rejected my amendment that would provide the same disaster tax relief to all survivors of natural disasters. This is hypocrisy – we shouldn’t be turning our backs on those who need help the most, we should be providing a path for them to get back on their feet.” “The tax plan to which my amendment was offered is reckless policy focused on gifting huge, unpaid for tax cuts for the richest one percent, while eliminating tax incentives for the middle class, and leaving low-income families in the dust. After adding more than $2.3 trillion to the debt, Republicans will use this an excuse to chip away at Medicare and Social Security. By making permanent the cap on State and Local Tax deductions, this bill makes it harder for local governments in states like California to pay for essential services like health care, infrastructure, and law enforcement. Once again, Republican leaders rushed this process with no bipartisan input or opportunity to hear from outside experts to pass this tax giveaway to the richest Americans just in time for the November elections. This is unacceptable, we should instead be working together on policy that will boost wages for everyone, build up our middle class, and help everyone get ahead.” You can click here to watch Thompson’s remarks on his amendment.

08.16.2018	Vallejo – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that the Department of Defense (DOD) has approved an application by the City of Vallejo to begin planning initial repairs to the Mare Island Naval Cemetery, including repairing or replacing fencing, installing a flagpole, and repairing the damaged drainage system. These improvements will be done through the DOD’s Innovative Readiness Training (IRT) program, which is designed to provide training for reserve forces while also bettering local communities through medical or engineering support. “This is an exciting announcement that provides a plan to begin repairs on the Mare Island Cemetery and an important step toward giving our fallen heroes the final resting place they deserve,” said Thompson. “It also highlights the work still to be done to fully restore the cemetery and I will continue fighting for every possible avenue that will allow us to complete this important task.” The City of Vallejo applied for assistance with these engineering projects through the IRT program and was approved through support by Thompson, who has been championing restoration of the cemetery including with a bill that would transfer control from the cemetery to the Department of Veterans Affairs. The work would likely begin in late 2019, subject to the availability of the IRT unit, further cost negotiations with the City, and other necessary advance work, including environmental reviews. You can click here to read more about Thompson’s bill to help restore the cemetery, which has over 70 Democrat and Republican cosponsors and is supporting by 5 major veterans service organizations. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.14.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02) announced that California has been awarded $99.324 million that must be spent on disaster recovery across the state, including in Sonoma County and part of the City of Napa. This federal funding was previously awarded through the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) program as part of an effort to provide long-term recovery from the 2017 wildfires. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has today issued guidance that counties and zip codes in Thompson and Huffman’s districts must receive that funding for unmet needs. “Our district was and continues to be hit hard by fires, but together we are coming back even stronger. Together with local, state, and federal partners, we are addressing the deep impact these fires left on our communities and I am so proud this funding will be provided to help those who need it most recover and rebuild,” said Thompson. “This work continues and I will keep fighting for every possible federal penny to help our district rebuild and be even stronger.” “While the still-raging wildfires continue to inflict catastrophic damage on our communities, I’m glad to see that this much-needed federal support is on its way,” said Huffman. “We will continue to work with local, state, and federal partners to ensure that our districts have every resource needed during the long path to recovery.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD awards CDBG-DR grants to flexibly support many different recovery efforts, including but not limited to housing needs, economic revitalization, and improvements to infrastructure. California received $212 million to go toward unmet needs and mitigation efforts and HUD has announced that no less than $99.324 million must go to Sonoma County, the 94558 zip code in the City of Napa and other areas that have been most impacted by the fires – including Ventura County and parts of Santa Barbara, Clearlake, Redwood Valley and Maysville.

08.07.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Rep. John Garamendi (CA-03), Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02) and 22 other Republicans and Democrats in the California delegation, including Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23) and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA-12), wrote to the President asking him to immediately grant California’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the destructive wildfires that have hit Lake, Mendocino, and Napa Counties over the past two weeks. The letter was also signed by Representatives Ken Calvert (CA-42), Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Ed Royce (CA-39), Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), Grace Napolitano (CA-32), Adam Schiff (CA-28), Doris Matsui (CA-06), Jerry McNerney (CA-09), Jackie Speier (CA-14), Judy Chu (CA-27), Doug LaMalfa (CA-01), Scott Peters (CA-52), Raul Ruiz (CA-36), Eric Swalwell (CA-15), Juan Vargas (CA-51), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Norma Torres (CA-35), Nanette Barragán (CA-44), Salud Carbajal (CA-24), Jimmy Gomez (CA-34). Text of the letter is below and a copy is attached. August 7, 2018 The President The White House Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: Today, we write in support of the State of California’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for Individual Assistance and Public Assistance as a result of the devastating wildfires in Lake, Mendocino, and Napa Counties. California has experienced an unusual amount of wildfire activity—with 16 wildfires burning simultaneously throughout the state. These fires have been exacerbated by the weather, which is exceptionally hot and dry. Daytime highs and nighttime lows have averaged 10 degrees above normal and drought conditions prevail. We appreciate your swift approval of a Major Disaster Declaration for Shasta County for the Carr Fire, as well as of Fire Management Assistance Grants, to help our state fight these devastating fires. As you know, the Carr Fire that began its devastating impact in Shasta County has also crossed into Trinity County, where mandatory evacuation orders were issued and additional assistance may be required. On July 27, 2018, the River and Ranch Fires ignited in Mendocino County and quickly crossed into Lake County. These two fires, collectively known as the Mendocino Complex Fire, subsequently exploded in size, threatening highly populated areas within Lake County. They have scorched more than 280,000 acres and forced the entire population of Upper Lake and the City of Lakeport to evacuate. The Mendocino Complex Fire continues to grow at an alarming rate, and is now the largest fire in our state’s history. It is only 30 percent contained. In addition, on the evening of July 28, 2018, the Steele Fire ignited in Napa County. Though smaller in size than the Carr or Mendocino Complex Fires, the Steele Fire has already been extremely destructive. Residents were forced to flee with almost no prior notice, as the fire destroyed homes soon after ignition. These catastrophic fires are a disaster of major scope and consequence. Therefore, we strongly support the State of California’s request for a major disaster declaration for these communities. We appreciate your consideration of this request and stand ready to assist you in expediting support and resources to the communities afflicted by this terrible tragedy. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Cicilline (RI-01), Rep. Elizabeth Esty (CT-05), Rep. Robin Kelly (IL-02), Rep.

Text of the letter is below and a copy is attached. July 26, 2018 Secretary Mike Pompeo Department of State 2201 C Street NW Washington, DC 20230 Dear Mr. Secretary: As leaders of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, we urge you to suspend plans to grant Defense Distributed a special license to publish gun blueprints online and to maintain the existing ban on publication of any such gun schematics. The State Department’s recent about-face on allowing publication of this dangerous data is both shocking and outside of its lawful authority. Widespread publication of 3-D-printed gun blueprints would be extremely dangerous because individuals prohibited by law from having guns could easily arm themselves. Convicted felons would be able to skip the dealer licensing system, bypass a criminal background check, and print a gun at home using commercially available technology. Firearm traffickers would be able to print unserialized guns, which are untraceable by law enforcement. And terrorists would be able to make guns entirely out of plastic and sneak them through metal detectors. Given the clear public safety threat the publication of these blueprints pose, granting this special license makes no sense. As we understand, until recently, the State Department barred publication of 3-D-printed gun blueprints because it violates the Arms Control Export Act of 1974. Please explain why the State Department’s understanding of the Arms Control Export Act has changed. The State Department must return to its well-reasoned position on stopping the publication of 3-D-printed gun blueprints. We look forward to your swift and detailed response. Sincerely, ### The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was established after the tragedy at Sandy Hook and has grown to a membership of more than 145.
07.26.2018	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that his legislation providing a plan to restore land on Mare Island that the U.S. Navy previously used as a firing range passed as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. Thompson’s legislation requires the Navy to fill depressions left in the earth and provide for environmental mitigation, offering a chance for the area to be open for further economic development for the city of Vallejo. “For too long, the former Mare Island firing range was a blight on our region, standing in the way of further economic success. This legislation provides a path forward, requiring the Navy to take action that both offers a successful transfer to the city and mitigates environmental concerns,” said Thompson. “This is a huge win for the city of Vallejo and our entire region, allowing for further economic success on Mare Island. Thank you to all the local leaders and city officials who stuck with this to ensure the success of this legislation.” You can click here to read Thompson’s amendment. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Ruben Gallego (AZ-07), Rep. Ted Lieu (CA-33), Rep. Anthony Brown (MD-04), and Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20) in denouncing the President’s rhetoric at a summit with Putin in Helsinki. “As a combat veteran, I know first-hand the consequences of poor diplomacy and weak foreign policy. The President abandoned our American values this week by suggesting Putin was not responsible for interference in the 2016 election and belittling the men and women of our intelligence community. As a former member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence for eight years, I know they put their lives on the line to provide information invaluable to our safety,” said Thompson. “What’s more, the President’s ridiculous walk back of his comments do nothing to undo the damage he has caused. He should strongly denounce Putin, clearly articulate that he knows Russia deliberately meddled in our election, and vehemently support the intelligence officers who provide valuable information that keeps our country safe. Putin is not our friend and it’s time for the President to defend our values and our nation.” You can click here to watch today’s press conference. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.12.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) slammed Republican efforts in a House Ways and Means Committee markup to undermine the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by repealing the employer mandate, undermining access to care for patients with pre-existing conditions, and ignoring the long-term impact of Administration-led sabotage of our health care system. “This week’s markup was a sad excuse for action on health care that did not address high costs for consumers. Nor did it address the long-term effects that Republican sabotage of the Affordable Care Act is having on patients across our nation, while adding $92 billion to the national debt with no pay for. While some bills considered made small technical fixes, they do not fix the bigger issue – helping consumers cope with high health care costs that leave them deciding whether to pay their medical bills or put food on the table. “Instead, today Republican leaders were more focused on considering legislation that tears down protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and allows them to be charged high costs or be denied care altogether. The bills reported out of committee today could drive up prices for older Americans, and open access to plans that do not guarantee essential services like maternity care, prescriptions, and mental health. This is an outrage. We should come back to the table and consider legislation that will end the sabotage and make a real difference in lowering costs and improving our health care system.” Click here to watch a video of Thompson’s remarks from this week’s committee markup that concluded today. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.06.2018	Napa – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) sent the following letter to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar following the Department’s decision to deny his request to visit children detention facilities in our region despite following HHS’ protocol. Thompson has been attempting to visit these facilities to check on the well-being of recently separated children under the Administration’s so-called “zero tolerance policy” and to ensure their prompt reunification with their families. Text of the letter is as follows: The Honorable Alex Azar II Secretary of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Health & Human Services 200 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Azar: I made a request to the Department of Health & Human Services (HHS) to see local facilities housing immigrant children, including children who were separated from their parents at the President’s behest under his so-called “zero tolerance policy.” I rearranged my schedule and fully complied with your Department’s required protocols, including providing the required two weeks’ notice, even though I believe that these rules are completely unnecessary. It is unacceptable that you have denied my request and are doing a bureaucratic shuffle aimed at covering up the tragedies of the President’s policy of separating undocumented families. What are you trying to hide? What is it that you don’t want the American people to see? This cover-up is an injustice and an affront to our American values. HHS must open its doors and stop hiding from congressional scrutiny. My constituents and the American public deserve to know what is being done with these separated children and that they are being well cared for by your Department. As important, they need to be reunified with their families as quickly possible. I want to know that HHS is living up to our American values when it comes to the caring for these separated children, and I want to see these facilities with my own eyes. This is a matter of the utmost importance and urgency to our country, and neither I nor my constituents will be satisfied with HHS’ attempts to block or delay tours of these facilities. As soon as possible, I request that I be allowed to visit these facilities as requested. I await your approval of my request. Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON Member of Congress Thompson followed the prescribed HHS protocol, which required two weeks’ notice, and submitted the required paperwork on June 25, 2018 in order to visit children detention facilities in our region on July 9, 2018. Thompson’s facility tour requests has been denied, and multiple requests to speak to Secretary Azar have been rejected. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.28.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that AMVETS (American Veterans) has endorsed his bipartisan bill to repair the Mare Island Cemetery. AMVETS has more than 250,000 members across our nation and has served veterans and their families for more than 70 years. “Ensuring the sanctity of the final resting place of our veterans is integral to respecting their service. I introduced this legislation to ensure the more than 800 veterans buried at the Mare Island Cemetery are properly honored and I’m humbled to have the support of AMVETS as we continue our fight to restore and maintain this landmark,” said Thompson. “We must ensure the cemetery is preserved for generations to come so we can properly honor the sacrifice of our nation’s veterans.” “AMVETS applauds Rep. Thompson for introducing his bill to honor and preserve the memory and legacy of the veterans interred at the Mare Island Naval Cemetery, including three Medal of Honor recipients," said AMVETS National Commander Marion Polk. "That the federal government provided no funding for the upkeep of these heroes' final resting place when it closed the base in '96 has been nothing short of a national disgrace ever since. AMVETS strongly believes Congress must act swiftly to enact this bill and transfer responsibility for the cemetery's upkeep to the department of Veterans Affairs, where it belongs.” H.R. 5588 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to seek out an agreement with the City of Vallejo, under which the city would transfer control of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery to the VA. The cemetery would specifically be placed under the purview of the National Cemetery Administration. The VA would pay no fee to acquire the land, but would assume the obligation of maintaining the cemetery in the future. Click here for the full text of the bill. This legislation is co-sponsored by 68 Democrat and Republican members and is also endorsed by the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), the U.S. Navy League, and thousands of veterans across the country. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.27.2018	Washington – Today Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-05), Doris Matsui (CA-06), Jimmy Panetta (CA-20), and Brad Sherman (CA-30) released the following joint statement after visiting a facility in Virginia that houses children separated from their parents at the border as a result of the Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. “The children we met today have faced unimaginable horrors coming to the United States, and the trauma of that journey is only perpetuated the longer they are separated from their families. Today’s visit only underscored the extreme urgency with which we must work to reunite families and the lasting trauma the Trump Administration’s inhumane policy has caused on thousands of children. While we appreciate that this experienced facility is providing necessary care, no standard of care can meet the needs of children desperate to see their families again and the Administration must present its policy for a swift reunification infrastructure immediately.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.20.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) along with 25 faith leaders from around California’s Fifth Congressional District, released the following statement condemning in the strongest terms the Administration’s directive that separates children from their families at the border. Text of the statement, including signatories, is as follows: In May, this Administration initiated a “zero tolerance” policy for undocumented families entering the United States. Under the new policy, parents are arrested and detained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and separated from their children who are detained separately by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Children may be placed in facilities thousands of miles away from their parents, with no means of communication. This policy has inflicted lasting psychological trauma on children. That is cruel and immoral. Because the causes and effects of this trauma are both well known and avoidable, they must be intentional: the Administration is actively perpetrating child abuse for the purposes of deterring entrance to the United States. Almost without exception, undocumented children arriving in our country have already experienced traumatic events, defined by the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN) as a “frightening, dangerous, or violent event that poses a threat to a child’s life or bodily integrity.”[1] They have suffered violence, poverty or instability in their country of origin, and a treacherous journey to the U.S. border. Such experiences are considered ‘refugee trauma,’ and affect “mental and physical health long after the events have occurred.”[2] In a study of U.S. foster children, who face similar levels of trauma, Casey Family Programs found that relative to the general population, a disproportionate number of kids “had mental health disorders, including a post-traumatic stress disorder rate similar to that of U.S. war veterans.”[3] Federal law recognizes children who arrive at the U.S. border alone require intensive care and services.[4] Extensive regulations govern how HHS must treat unaccompanied minor children,[5] and the federal government provides significant resources focused on mitigating negative responses to trauma that include “intense and ongoing emotional upset, depressive symptoms or anxiety, behavioral changes, regression or loss of previously acquired skills, attention and academic difficulties…and physical symptoms.”[6] Previously, the federal government applied the same principles to custody of unaccompanied minors as govern the U.S. foster care system – whenever possible, children should be with their parents or other kin, so long as it is safe; foster placements should be temporary and high quality; and institutional settings should be a placement of last resort. The evidence to support these principles is not controversial. It served as the basis for the aptly named Family First Prevention and Services Act, the most significant overhaul of our foster care system in decades, passed into law in February of this year. In its justification for legislative action, Congress warned of the “longer-term costs that society incurs because of the developmental risks associated with child maltreatment, trauma, and family disruption,” and bipartisanly held that “the intense emotional trauma associated with entering foster care,” drives “great interest in identifying ways to promote family stability, reduce foster care entries and lengths of stay, and facilitate reunification.”[7] There will always exist unaccompanied childhood arrivals for whom federal custody is the most appropriate placement. Yet in the case of children who’ve been rendered unaccompanied by DHS, the federal government has neglected the central tenant of its own foster care system: the best option for a child is for us to ensure that they can be safe in the guardianship of their parents. Instead, DHS has chosen to separate children who arrive at the border from their parents, no matter their age, thereby intentionally inflicting trauma and violating the principles of our nation’s child welfare system. The effects of such policy are incontrovertible and heartbreaking. Research shows that infants and toddlers have dramatically different needs than their older counterparts; young children in periods of rapid brain development are more sensitive to caregiving than at any other point in their lives. They stand at greatest risk of adverse effect from trauma, and a substantial evidence suggests that the disruption of critical relationships has significant negative long-term impacts on social-emotional health.[8] Though young children are especially vulnerable through family separation, no child is immune to negative consequences. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, separating children from their parents “can cause irreparable harm, disrupting a child's brain architecture and affecting his or her short- and long-term health. This type of prolonged exposure to serious stress - known as toxic stress - can carry lifelong consequences.”[9] Adding insult to injury, DHS has flooded an institutional system designed to care for unaccompanied immigrant minors old enough to travel to the border alone with younger children carried to this country by their parents. In separating children from their families and placing them in institutional settings, this Administration has compounded a foundation of trauma to manufacture a worst-case scenario that precipitates harmful, lasting and even dangerous results. Moreover, this Administration’s policy of separating undocumented minors from their parents undermines the government’s ability to care for children whose only option is federal custody. Recent reports indicate that more than half of “the 550 children currently in custody at U.S. border stations had spent more than 72 hours there, the time limit for immigrants of any age to be held in the government's temporary facilities."[10] Border facilities fall far short of federally mandated standards for shelters.[11] The denial of basic care to incoming children because shelters are filled to capacity with minors who should be with their parents is a disgusting perversion of immigration law. Add the uncertainty of whether parents deported subsequent to their incarceration will be sent home with their children, and what results is a horrific interpretation of federal policy that runs counter to our most sacred American values. The Administration’s cruel family separation policy has intentionally inflicted trauma on children of all ages. This policy stands in diametric opposition to our nation’s child welfare policy, which prioritizes keeping families together whenever it is safe to do so. In addition, this policy is putting undue pressure on our nation’s integral system to assist unaccompanied minors. “Zero tolerance” is a violation of human rights and dignity, and it must end.

05.23.2018	Washington – Today, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force including Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05), Congresswoman Frederica Wilson (FL-24), and Congressman Ted Deutch (FL-22), held a forum with students from around the country, including Charlie Mirsky, 11th Grade, Spanish River High School (FL), Alfonso Calderon, 11th Grade, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (FL), Jennifer Mirbelle, 11th Grade, Miami Northwestern Senior High School (FL), Malachi Dunn, 11th Grade, Hallandale Magnet High School (FL), Ricky Pope, 11th Grade, Miami Northwestern Senior High School (FL), Devery Russell, 12th Grade, Miami Lakes Educational Center (FL), Daniel Gelillo, 12th Grade, Richard Montgomery High School (MD), and Taylore Norwood, 12th Grade, King High School (IL). Students shared their experiences with gun violence and proposals for reform. “Young men and women across the country are marching, mobilizing and demanding action to end gun violence,” said Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. “It was a great honor to listen to the stories of some of these young champions, and to be inspired by their eloquence, persistence and leadership. The Congress must have as much courage as these students have shown, and fight for real action to protect our communities and ensure that no family must endure the heartbreak of gun violence.” “Our students are leading a movement to prevent gun violence and changing the tide of public sentiment for the better. We have seen this before during the Vietnam War and I have no doubt they will change the course of history,” said Thompson. “Today, I was deeply honored to hear students from across the country tell their stories about the unspeakable violence they have faced and present their proposals for reform. We will stand up and speak out together, and we will achieve our goal of enacting policies to prevent gun violence.” “Gun violence is a plague that is infecting our nation. No one and no place is immune to it. Shootings are now taking place in places that were once considered safe havens, like schools and churches,” said Wilson. “The issue of gun violence is like an octopus with many tentacles, each representing a different component, and it is imperative that we figure out how to address everyone one of them.” “Students from across the country are speaking out for their lives. This generation has grown up in the midst of an epidemic of gun violence and mass shootings, and they expect Congress to work to make them safe in their schools and communities. We owe these students so much more,” said Deutch. “I’m proud to stand with my Democratic colleagues who are ready and willing to have a serious gun violence prevention debate, one that respects the Constitution and does everything necessary to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We welcome our Republican colleagues to join us to take action for gun reform now.” Full written testimony from the students is attached and you can watch the entire forum, including over 40 members of the Task Force, by clicking here. ### The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force was established after the tragedy at Sandy Hook and has grown to a membership of more than 145.

05.09.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) urged the President to maintain royalty payments to counties for geothermal energy production that help boost clean energy development and support local economies in counties like Lake and Sonoma Counties in his district. Geothermal royalty payments are eliminated in the White House’s budget proposal for Fiscal Year 2019. He was joined by seven other Democrats and Republicans. “Counties in my district are leading the way in geothermal development that results in cleaner energy sources and these investments can be costly for our communities. So it is fair that royalty payments from that energy production be returned to the very communities that host them,” said Thompson. “That’s why I wrote to the President urging him not to cut those payments. Our district could lose out on valuable resources used to pay for public safety, infrastructure investment, and law enforcement services, while diminishing our capacity to continue investing in local clean energy. This proposal is shortsighted and must be reversed.” Last year, Lake County received over $733,000 and Sonoma County received over $1.3 million in geothermal royalties. “Elimination of federal geothermal royalties will result in the loss of $700,000 per year to rural Lake County, at a time when more cuts simply cannot be borne without major reductions in vital community services including local law enforcement, roads, libraries, parks and services to seniors. These funds are used to mitigate the impacts of the geothermal industry, providing vital services and resources to our citizens,” said Carol Huchingson, Lake County Administrative Officer. “Lake County has been ravaged by wildfire, with five major wildfire disasters over the past three summers and 22 percent of the county’s land mass burned. As a result, the county is already facing a financial crisis. On a per capita basis, Lake County has lost almost double the amount of housing stock than Sonoma did in the North Bay Firestorm of 2017. As a rural county already struggling to recover from the recession, the additional losses brought on by wildfires are pushing an already cash-strapped local government to the brink of financial disaster. The additional loss of geothermal royalties will be devastating to Lake County,” said Lake County Supervisor Rob Brown. “Sonoma County appreciates the Congressman’s continued leadership on this issue,” said Sonoma County Supervisor James Gore. “This elimination would come at a time when we are dealing with revenue reductions, and increased needs, from the 2017 wildfires.” Full text of the letter is below and attached to this release. April 27, 2018 The President The White House Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We are disappointed that geothermal royalty payments to counties were eliminated in Fiscal Year 2019 budget request. We understand and support the need to propose a fiscally prudent budget, but repealing geothermal royalty payments to counties is a short sighted method that does little to address fiscal challenges. In the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress decided that, because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where geothermal development is located, these counties should share in the revenue of the federal receipts. In turn, counties have used these revenues to pay for critical governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. This revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners, and ultimately champions, in the continued development of geothermal energy—a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides well-paying jobs in rural areas. Ending the geothermal revenue sharing plan will have a significant negative impact on our districts, while the overall effect on our nation’s fiscal well-being would be miniscule— less than $4 million in 2019. Many of the counties that receive revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural communities facing precarious budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. We strongly support geothermal revenue sharing with counties and we encourage you to consider it in future budget proposals. We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to working with you to promote geothermal energy production and provide support for the surrounding communities.

05.03.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that 131 other members of both parties support his effort to prevent harmful and last-minute legislative language or riders that could undo or prevent progress on work to prevent violence. “We must have a thoughtful debate about gun violence in this country and consider policy changes deliberately. That’s why we cannot be legislating through riders that don’t receive full and fair consideration and that could have unintended consequences,” said Thompson. “That’s why I wrote to Congressional leaders, urging them to ensure we don’t include any harmful gun-related riders in our appropriations bills that could set back or degrade our efforts to advance policies to prevent gun violence. We must change our laws, but we must do it with serious consideration.” Thompson’s letter was signed by 131 other members of both parties. Text of the letter is below: May 3, 2018 The Honorable Paul D. Ryan The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House Democratic Leader U.S. House of Representatives U.S. House of Representatives H-232, The Capitol H-204, The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515 Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: As the House Committee on Appropriations develops each of the twelve Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations bills, we urge that you ensure the Committee’s legislation not include harmful legislative language, or “riders,” that impact the enforcement of gun laws, the operations of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL), or research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. Gun violence reduction and prevention is an important and sensitive issue. Given the renewed national focus on gun violence prevention, now is not the time to include controversial appropriations riders that negatively impact gun laws. Instead, such changes to gun policy must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through the regular order. This must be done in an open and transparent process where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and debated by the proper committees of authorizing jurisdiction and the entire House of the Representatives. Over the past several years, various appropriations riders related to gun policy have had unintended consequences that could have been prevented had these issues been properly and more thoroughly debated in Congress. For example, the Tiahrt and Rehberg amendments, among others, have prevented law enforcement from requiring FFLs to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of crime gun transfers, and chilled unbiased scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. As the Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations process begins through the respective subcommittees, we urge you to support the development of legislation that is free of harmful gun-related riders. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

04.27.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) lauded the passage of a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration for six years that included his amendment to ensure FEMA mitigation funding can be used to help rebuild and recover from last year’s wildfires, and parts of his legislation to strengthen passenger protections. “As our community continues to rebuild from last year’s devastating wildfires and we work together to meet recovery needs, some of those costs don’t fit neatly into the current rules and regulations. So I worked with my colleagues in a bipartisan way to help address this problem for local governments who are working hard to rebuild,” said Thompson. “My amendment that passed today provides FEMA the ability to use hazard mitigation funding to remove standing, burned trees and replace water systems that have been damaged by a disaster. Our work to provide every possible relief resource to our communities continues. “The FAA Reauthorization also includes critical consumer protection provisions that ensure airline passengers have the rights they deserve. This includes addressing airplane restroom accessibility, prohibiting bumping boarded passengers, requiring that airlines have an accessible passenger rights document, and setting standards for minimum passenger seat size. Consumers deserve to have their rights protected and I was proud to work in a bipartisan way to get this done for airline passengers – it’s the fair thing and the right thing to do.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.24.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced he has introduced a bill to transfer control of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery in Vallejo to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to maintain the cemetery for future generations. “The Mare Island Naval Cemetery is the oldest on the entire West Coast and the final resting place for over 800 of our country’s heroes. A national sanctuary for our veterans, the cemetery should be maintained to the highest standards so our men and women in uniform are honored to the fullest,” said Thompson. “By transferring control of the cemetery from the city of Vallejo to the VA, this bill will help ensure the cemetery can be maintained without being a financial burden to the city. I am proud to work to honor our veterans in this way and want to thank the City of Vallejo and the many local veterans, including Colonel Nestor Aliga, United States Army, Retired, and Captain Ralph Parrot, United States Navy, Retired, who are working to ensure the cemetery remains a beautiful haven for so many. I look forward to working together to ensure we find a solution.” H.R. 5588 directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to seek out an agreement with the City of Vallejo, under which the city would transfer control of the Mare Island Naval Cemetery to the VA. The cemetery would specifically be placed under the purview of the National Cemetery Administration. The VA would pay no fee to acquire the land, but would assume the obligation of maintaining the cemetery in the future.

04.17.2018	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), announced he would cosponsor a resolution to define limited terms for the use of military force in the Middle East. “After today’s classified briefing on Syria, there is no doubt that Congress must pass a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) and specify the limitations under which the president can use military force to protect our national security,” said Thompson. “The president must not conduct action unilaterally – our constitution lays out a process under which the president must work with Congress to specifically define and execute military strategy. That’s why I’ve cosponsored Congressman Schiff’s resolution to narrowly outline the scope under which necessary and appropriate force can be taken under consultation with Congress. We must have a clear strategy, as we cannot commit our men and women in uniform to a drawn out conflict with no clear path forward.” Lead by Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff, H.J.Res. 100, the Consolidated Authorization for Use of Military Force Resolution authorizes the president to use necessary force to protect our nation’s security against Al Qaeda, ISIS, the Afghan Taliban, and other enemies for three years, repealing prior authorizations.

Ted Lieu (CA-33), Rep Seth Moulton (MA-06), Rep. Salud Carbajal (CA-24), and Rep Jimmy Panetta (CA-20) released the following joint statement in reaction to the president’s public and social media discussion of military strategy in response to the apparent chemical attack in Syria over the weekend. “As military veterans, we are profoundly concerned about the president’s reckless use of Twitter and other public forums to discuss the use of military force in Syria. Pictures from Douma this weekend again shocked our entire world, and we must consider action purposefully and deliberately. Yet the president continues to use taunting and flippant language both on Twitter and in public to discuss pulling troops out of Syria before the attack and in considering the use of force in retaliation. “We have looked the horrors of war head on and we know that launching missiles is a serious matter. We know that the president’s strategy is reckless and irresponsible, and that it endangers our men and women serving in uniform. We urge him to stop issuing these public provocations immediately.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.10.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02) announced that California has been awarded $212 million in federal funding through the Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) program to provide long-term recovery from the devastating fires of 2017. Congressman Thompson advocated to the administration and Congressional leadership to help secure disaster relief funding through the Bipartisan Budget Act. “Our district was hit hard by the fires of last fall, but we have come together as federal, state, and local partners to support each other, rebuild, and recover. This is about our community and the people who have been deeply impacted by these terrible disasters and it’s why I am pleased our state has been awarded more than $200 million in CDBG disaster relief funding,” said Thompson. “Our work is not finished; I will continue working with partners from across our district as we rebuild our communities.” “From the Redwood Valley and Potter Valley fires in Mendocino, to the Pocket Fire in Geyserville, to the Tubbs Fire in Santa Rosa, the communities we represent were hit with an indescribable level of devastation from one of the worst wildfires in our state’s history,” said Huffman. “As we join together and move forward in rebuilding our communities, houses, and lives, I’m glad to see California receive this much-needed federal support. I will continue to work with local and federal partners and advocate for all the resources that the North Coast needs during the long road to recovery.” The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) awards CDBG-DR grants to flexibly support many different recovery efforts, including but not limited to housing needs, economic revitalization, and improvements to infrastructure. California will receive $212 million, with $124 million to unmet needs and $88 million for mitigation efforts. The state will determine a recovery plan allotting these funds to the most affected regions and that plan will then be approved by HUD.

04.02.2018	Vallejo – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that the President signed legislation introduced by Thompson to officially rename the Vallejo Post Office located at 2635 Napa Street in Vallejo as the “Janet Capello Post Office Building.” Janet Capello was a lifelong resident of Vallejo who was dedicated to serving her community, always working to improve the lives of those around her. “Janet Capello was an icon of our community, working tirelessly to help others and fighting passionately to improve our entire district. I was honored to know her and honored to fight for the passage of this bill that will memorialize her lifetime of service,” said Thompson. “Her work with the Order of the Sons of Italy helped support so many of our young people pursuing an education and her service to Vallejo improved our community as a whole. Naming this Post Office in her honor will serve as a lasting testament to her love of the people she served.” “Janet Capello was such a powerful force in the fabric of Vallejo. She lived her life as a strong woman of deep convictions—of her greatest passions were the City and especially the Youth of Vallejo,” said Solano County Supervisor Erin Hannigan. “Our new Post Office near her family homestead now bears her name as a tribute to her community spirit. “Janet was an incredible pillar of our Italian community who strived to better every aspect of her environment,” said John Costa, State President of the Grand Lodge of California, Order of Sons and Daughters of Italy in America. “We, as members of the Sons and Daughters of Italy in America, were honored to have known her and to have worked alongside her. This Post Office will be an important reminder to us all to serve our community and those around us and to remember our dear sister Janet. “Janet and I met 21 years ago and she was such a great person in the community. She was somebody to look up to and it was because of her mentorship that I became the ‘Kitchen Queen’ for the Sons of Italy,” said Marlene Parr. “This honor is so well-deserved because of all that she did for the community.” Janet R. Capello was born on May 25, 1935, in Vallejo, California. The granddaughter of Italian-American immigrants, Ms. Capello and her family were lifelong residents of the Vallejo area. An alumna of both Vallejo Central High School and Vallejo Junior College, Ms. Capello spent over forty years working at the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. During her time there, and in the years following her retirement, Ms. Capello rapidly became a mainstay in public life, serving on countless boards, commissions, and organizational leadership teams. Ms. Capello’s deepest passion was the “Sons of Italy” organization. A fiercely proud Italian American, Ms. Capello was a member of Lodge No. 1626 for more than 63 years, and was the first to bring the organization’s “Sons of Italy Scholarship Commission” to Vallejo. In her role as Chairwoman, Ms. Capello helped hundreds of local students attend college, and in her work overseeing the Sons of Italy’s various charitable events, she raised thousands of dollars every year to support Alzheimer’s research at the University of California at Davis. Ms. Capello served at different times as Vice-President of the Grand Lodge of California and as Secretary of the United Lodges, two of the organizations most distinguished posts, and she received the Dr. Vincenzo Sellaro Award, the Sons of Italy’s highest honor, in 2007. In 2012, Ms. Capello passed away at the age of 77. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.16.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that he and a record 182 members of Congress from both parties are requesting $75 million in federal funding for the National Instant Criminal Background Check Systems (NICS). “A strong background checks system helps keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. That’s why I am proud to announce a record number of supporters for my appropriations request for the NICS background checks system,” said Thompson. “This is strong progress, but our work to prevent gun violence continues. Congress should also immediately take up my bipartisan background checks bill, H.R.4240, which will expand the system and close loopholes to help keep our schools, our communities, and our nation safe.” A copy of the letter is included below and a PDF is attached. March 18, 2018 The Honorable John Culberson The Honorable José E. Serrano Chairman Ranking Member House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Science and Related Agencies H-310, The Capitol 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Serrano: As the Committee begins writing the Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we respectfully request funding for implementation of the National Instant Background Check Systems (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-180) at a $75 million level. The Act provides for grants to states to upgrade their electronic databases, incentives for states to transmit electronic records to NICS, penalties for states that do not comply, and requirements for keeping NICS up-to-date, including the removal of obsolete or erroneous records. The Act also provides financial incentives for states to develop “relief from disabilities” procedures for persons who have lost the right to possess a firearm due to a mental health adjudication or commitment but are later determined not to pose a danger to public safety. As you are aware, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. No. 90-618) precludes certain persons, including felons, those adjudicated mentally ill, illegal aliens, drug abusers, and those under a restraining order, from purchasing or possessing firearms. The only way to enforce these requirements effectively is to ensure that NICS has up-to-date records from state and federal sources. At present, millions of records are currently missing from the various databases that make up NICS. Many states do not have the resources necessary to implement the technology to automate criminal history and mental health records, which has allowed persons otherwise prohibited from purchasing or owning firearms to do so in violation of federal law. This remains a serious problem because many states still do not submit adequate numbers of mental health and criminal records to make NICS work as intended. The intent of NICS Improvement Amendments Act is to ensure there are sufficient resources to provide accurate and timely data about persons prohibited from possessing firearms. This cannot be achieved absent adequate funding for NICS. In fact, demand for this funding is increasing every year and we must provide adequate funding to meet this growing need. While the Act authorized a combined total of $1.125 billion from FY 2009 through FY 2013, a total of only $63.567 million was appropriated during that time. We fully understand the current constraints on the federal budget and appropriations process. Keeping citizens safe, however, must be Congress’s top priority. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act has been severely underfunded in years past, and the-all-too-frequent tragedies across our Nation unfortunately show that gun violence is still a very serious issue that plagues our country. Ensuring NICS has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of persons who cannot safely and legally possess them while at the same time protecting Americans’ Second Amendment rights will save lives. Consequently, we respectfully urge the Committee to fund the NICS Improvement Amendments Act at a level that at minimum of $75 million. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Mike Thompson (CA-05), chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, condemned the President’s recently-released gun proposals, releasing the following statement. “As we feared, the President has cowed to the NRA, turning his back on the millions of Americans who have already suffered from gun violence and the many who are vulnerable,” said Thompson. “People across our nation are calling for meaningful action and the White House is merely feigning in order to appease their base.” “While I am disappointed in the President’s reversal, my resolve to force action is only strengthened. We have legislation that is widely supported by Democrats and Republicans in Congress that will strengthen and expand our background checks system and help keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. We must take action to prevent gun violence and keep our schools, our communities, and our nation safe.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.09.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement after four people were shot and killed at the Veterans Home of California in Yountville, located in his Congressional District. “Tonight as a community, we mourn the tragic shooting at the Yountville Veterans Home and the devastating loss for the families, loved ones, and friends of those killed. Law enforcement from our district and around our region responded with truly commendable professionalism and we thank them for their selfless service. “The Veterans Home is a place where veterans receive the help they have earned through their service. Pathway is a program that gives veterans a guide to improve their lives. Those killed were three wonderful and dedicated women who got up every morning to better the lives of veterans.

03.01.2018	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced that he now has 200 co-sponsors from both parties for his bipartisan Thompson-King Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act, a bill that would give states resources to help them submit information to the background checks system. The bill would also expand the system to cover all commercial firearm sales, closing gun show, internet, and classified ad loopholes. “It is clear that members of both parties and the President himself agree – we need a strengthened background checks system to help keep our nation safe. That’s why I am pleased to announce a record number of supporters, Democrats and Republicans, for my bipartisan bill to expand the system,” said Thompson. “This support marks the overwhelming public support for strengthening background checks and the urgent need to take action immediately. Let’s hold a vote now and act to help prevent gun violence.” Republican co-sponsors include Representatives Costello, Curbelo, Fitzpatrick, King, Lance, Meehan, Dent, Donovan, Mast, Ros-Lehtinen, and Smith.

02.27.2018	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, offered a resolution to force a vote on the bipartisan H.R. 4240, the Thompson-King Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act, and H.R. 3464, the Background Checks Completion Act of 2017. H.R. 4240 provides resources to help states strengthen and expand the background checks system and closes a number of gun sale loopholes. H.R. 3464 prohibits licensed gun dealers from selling guns to buyers without licenses without completing a background check. “Background checks are proven to keep our schools and our communities safe from dangerous individuals. We all can agree that we should make the system stronger,” said Thompson. “That’s why I offered a resolution to immediately take up my bipartisan legislation to strengthen the background checks systems in states across our nation. It is shameful that this resolution was dismissed without a vote on strengthening background checks, but I will continue to fight for action that will keep our nation safer from gun violence.” Click here for video of Thompson working to force this bill for a vote.

02.26.2018	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, introduced a discharge petition that would force a vote on the bipartisan Thompson-King Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. This bill provides resources to help states strengthen and expand the background checks system and closes a number of gun sale loopholes. Text of the discharge petition can be found by clicking here. “Every member of ongress knows that we must take action to prevent gun violence. Though we may not all agree on everything, we agree that we must expand background checks,” said Thompson. “Today, I filed a discharge petition on the bipartisan background checks bill that would strengthen background checks systems in states across our nation. This bill is bipartisan and should have a vote immediately. Each day 30 people die are killed by someone using a gun and we cannot let another day pass without action.” A discharge petition is procedure that helps to force widely supported pieces of legislation to the floor. If a majority of members of Congress sign the petition, it is brought to the floor without the approval of the Speaker. This procedure allows the House to take up bills that are supported by the majority of the country but blocked by Republican leaders. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.09.2018	Washington, DC—Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement upon voting for the bipartisan budget deal that passed by a vote of 240 – 186: “Once again, the federal government shut down under a Republican-controlled House, Senate, and White House. “This is not the bill that I would have written, but it is a bipartisan compromise that funds the government, suspends the debt limit, and outlines a budget path going forward. “Critically, the bill provides nearly $90 billion in disaster relief, including fire relief and recovery funds for our district. It ensures that the federal government pays 90 percent of the costs for debris removal which will help our disaster communities stay financially solvent as they deal with the enormous costs of recovering from the fires. And, it provides much needed tax relief that I authored that makes it easier for fire survivors and businesses to rebuild and recover. Local leaders have informed me that that without this disaster relief, our fire communities could go into a financial tail spin. “For all the good that this disaster relief does for our communities, it is appalling that Congress still has not taken action to protect our Dreamers. “At a minimum, Americans deserve a commitment from Speaker Paul Ryan that he will bring the Dream Act up for a vote, and I will continue to put pressure on the Republican majority to take up the bill. “I stood with Minority Leader Pelosi as she held the floor for eight hours in the U.S. House of Representatives, telling the stories of Dreamers, people who are our friends, neighbors, coworkers, and members of our communities. “I also stand with the overwhelming number of our neighbors, the millions of Dreamers, and the 84 percent of Americans that support passage of the Dream Act. “There is still a great deal of work to do in charting a fiscal path for the country. I stand ready to do that work.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.02.2018	Rep. Thompson, former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement on the release of the Nunes memo: Washington, DC – “The decision by the President to release the Nunes memo is in one word: dangerous,” said Rep. Mike Thompson. “As a former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence and someone who has read both the Republican and Democratic memos, I know that this move is a reckless political stunt. Instead of holding this Administration and our Russian adversaries accountable, Mr. Nunes and the President are putting our Republic at risk – something that could cost lives and alliances. This is not America First and it is not an honorable thing to do. This is Nunes and the President First. It is shameful, risky, and a new low.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.30.2018	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), a former member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement regarding the Nunes memo: Washington, DC – The House Select Committee on Intelligence has a long history of integrity and nonpartisanship. It has been dedicated to protecting the United States and its interests by putting national security at the forefront of its work. I was honored to be appointed to the Select Committee for eight years and to serve under three Chairmen – two Republicans and one Democrat. We worked together, putting politics aside. This collaborative partnership made it possible for us to do our job: responsible and effective legislative oversight of our intelligence community and our national policies. To see evidence of how well the Select Committee can work, just look at the bipartisan investigation into the events in Benghazi. After listening to scores of witnesses, reviewing all available materials, and a thorough investigation, the Select Committee came to a unanimous conclusion that there was no deliberate wrongdoing by the Obama Administration. Republicans and Democrats came together in a thoughtful, thorough investigation and put partisan politics aside for an honest accounting. We did this because we believe our national security should not be a political football. People’s lives are on the line. Our intelligence institutions should not be compromised. The partisan Benghazi committee wasted $7.8 million in taxpayer money for a partisan witch hunt which resulted in nothing but discredited talking points for conspiracy theorists. This was unnecessary, wasteful, and an abuse of Congressional resources. However, the possible release of the Nunes talking points memo is a new low. This dangerous and unprecedented action undermines our intelligence community, could potentially reveal sources and methods, and distorts or mishandles highly classified intelligence. It is clear that this is a partisan ploy to defect or harm ongoing investigations into Russian interference in American institutions and elections. The fact that the Republicans blocked a Democratic memo clearly shows that this is not a bipartisan search for the truth. This is just one more act in the Republican circus to block, distract, and impede the Department of Justice and Special Counsel. It is beyond an embarrassment. It is an alarming act that should shock every American. Our intelligence and national security should never be a political tool. Just look to Mike Rogers, former Republican Congressman and Chairman of the Select Committee with whom I served. He has joined countless current and former intelligence experts in opposing the release of the memo. Further, the Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd noted that the memo is based on information neither Mr. Nunes nor most of his staff has actually seen or analyzed. (Click here for full text of letter.) There is still time to prevent this reckless act. The FBI, Department of Justice, and leaders within the intelligence community can advise the President on the dangers this poses to our Nation. The President should not and must not approve the release of this memo. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.26.2018	Napa, CA – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded the Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center $425,000 in Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) grants to support its work to confront violations of the Fair Housing Act. “I’m pleased that these federal dollars will bolster the great work that the Greater Napa Valley Housing Center does for our community,” said Rep. Thompson. “I applaud the Center’s work to ensure equal housing opportunities for everyone in Napa Valley and I look forward to continuing our work together on this important issue.” “Fair Housing Napa Valley is very excited to be awarded this FHIP Education and Outreach Initiatives grant for 2018,” said Pablo Zatarain, executive director of the Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center. “Funding from this grant will supplement FHNV's current fair housing program, funded primarily through a three year, FHIP Private Enforcement Initiatives grant. Both grants will provide needed resources to more effectively meet the housing needs of the residents Napa County. Additionally, the educational services provided to the community through these grants will increase awareness regarding residents' fair housing rights, allowing FHNV to promote and foster inclusive communities and equal housing opportunities for all residents. FHNV is grateful to be awarded both FHIP grants, and looks forward to continuing to serve all residents of Napa County through its comprehensive range of housing services.” Grants issued under HUD’s Fair Housing Initiatives Program allow organizations to provide Fair Housing enforcement through testing in the rental and sales market, to file Fair Housing complaints to HUD, and to conduct investigations. The education and outreach activities the organizations conduct also help to educate the public, housing providers and local governments about their rights and responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act.
01.23.2018	Washington, DC – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Bill Johnson (OH-06), Ben Ray Lujan (NM-03), and David Schweikert (AZ-06) announced they have introduced H.R. 4841, the Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for Safe Prescribing Act, which is designed to improve access to prescription medications for Medicare beneficiaries. “This legislation is another step toward modernizing Medicare and making it work better for patients,” said Rep. Thompson. “By standardizing the way electronic prior authorization systems operate under Medicare—ultimately mitigating delays for seniors needing prescriptions-- we can greatly improve efficiency and patient experience. I’m proud to sponsor this bipartisan bill and I’ll continue to work to help bring Medicare into the 21st century.” “I joined a bipartisan group of my House colleagues in introducing legislation that will improve access to prescription medication for Medicare beneficiaries. This bill would improve the outdated and inefficient prior authorization (PA) process and allow patients to obtain needed prescription drugs without unnecessary delay,” said Rep. Johnson. “There are currently a number of medications that require a prescriber to obtain approval from an insurance plan before dispensing. The process often requires prescribers to make lengthy phone calls or use a fax machine to obtain PA, which causes unneeded delays for patients waiting for their important prescriptions. In the commercial market, a process known as electronic prior authorization is widely used, allowing prescribers to request, and insurers to grant, PA in a fraction of the time. However, for unknown reasons, Medicare has been too slow to adopt this technology. The legislation I co-sponsored encourages Medicare to use this technology, which will help reduce abandoned prescriptions left at the pharmacy, increase efficiencies in the appeals process by reducing claims, and ensure Medicare enrollees get the right treatment at the proper cost share. Many residents of Eastern and Southeastern Ohio are dependent on the Medicare program, and anything that helps them get their needed medication more efficiently is beneficial.” “Too often the prescription authorization process for those enrolled in Medicare is lengthy, confusing and frustrating,” said Rep. Lujan. “The purpose of our bill is to streamline the process, eliminate frustrating delays and allow seniors to get the prescriptions they need with a minimum of fuss,” said Lujan. “By standardizing the electronic prior authorization system, our legislation makes Medicare easier for seniors. That’s good for patients and ultimately good for ensuring the Medicare system operates as cost efficiently and effectively as possible.” “With a large portion of the commercial market effectively using electronic prior authorization (ePA), and a number of states that have standards in place, this legislation is an essential step forward towards standardizing ePA in the Medicare program, the largest payer in the nation,” said Rep. Schweikert. “Standardizing ePA will improve efficiencies in Medicare and ensure safe prescribing for patients. Individuals will no longer be turned away from the pharmacy counter and can begin their doctor-prescribed therapies without delay." A number of medications require approval by a health insurance plan prior to dispensing in order for the plan to cover the medication, a process known as prior authorization (PA). Should a PA not be obtained prior to dispensing, the patient is faced with the choice of waiting for a PA or paying for the medication out-of-pocket. The traditional PA process uses outdated modes of communication which can be burdensome for the provider and pharmacist and often causes undue delays for the patient. Electronic Prior Authorization (ePA), which has seen widespread and successful adoption in the commercial market, automates the process by streamlining communication among providers, payors and pharmacies. This bill would encourage the use of ePA by creating system standards under Medicare, thereby promoting adoption by Medicare providers and bringing appropriate treatments to seniors faster. ###
01.22.2018	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement: “I’m pleased to see the government has been reopened, but I am disappointed that the bill considered today only funds the government through the next 17 days. This stopgap style of governing Republicans have practiced since the beginning of the Fiscal Year in October is unsustainable and does not allow our government to plan and execute our long-term priorities, like infrastructure projects and military readiness. And other urgent issues remain unaddressed in this bill: permanent funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program and for Community Health Centers, funding for Type 1 diabetes research, and a permanent solution for DACA recipients. “And the fact is, this shutdown should have never happened. Republicans control the White House, and both houses of Congress—every step of the legislative process. They should have introduced legislation that could have passed Congress and would have avoided this shutdown in the first place. “Republicans must now begin working in a bipartisan fashion to develop a responsible, long-term budget and end the chaos of the month-to-month funding of our government. They must also keep their promise to take up legislation that will permanently protect the 800,000 DACA recipients who face the threat of deportation from the only country they’ve ever known.” ###
01.20.2018	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: “Today, on the anniversary of President Trump’s inauguration, the government has run out of funding and been shut down. Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress, and they’ve proven today that they cannot perform even the most basic function of government: keeping it running. This is unacceptable. Without a long-term budget at the beginning of the fiscal year in October, Republicans have since passed 3 month-long continuing resolutions to keep the government open, promising they would use that time to negotiate a long-term spending deal. They did not do that. Our government has now screeched to a halt. Federal employees have been furloughed, important government business has been stopped, and countless government services that Americans rely on are no longer available. Republicans must take action immediately to pass a clean continuing resolution to reopen the government and then work in a bipartisan fashion to pass a responsible, long-term budget.”
01.18.2018	Washington, DC—Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced his intent to vote against the Republicans’ latest continuing resolution (CR): “For months now, Republicans have continued to kick our budget problems down the road, passing short-term spending deals with little progress towards a responsible, long-term budget. “When Republicans attempt to pass another CR this week, it marks the fourth time they’ve failed to reach an agreement on a funding plan for Fiscal Year 2018, which began last October. “This time, the majority will use the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) as a bargaining ploy to bring Democrats on board. “I will vote no because their bill not only fails to permanently authorize CHIP, but it fails to provide for dozens of other health services on which these kids and other vulnerable Americans rely. “It also leaves out funding for Community Health Centers and the National Health Service Corps which are integral to the health infrastructure that actually delivers care to CHIP beneficiaries. It also fails to fund the Special Diabetes Program that supports critical research into combatting, preventing, and curing type 1 diabetes. “Seniors and those with disabilities also get a raw deal. Under this CR, Republicans have gutted Medicare by failing to fund crucial protections for beneficiaries, like the therapy caps exceptions process to ensure care isn’t rationed for seniors, or payments for rural ambulance providers who bring care to seniors in remote parts of the country. “Moreover it fails to provide protection for the 800,000 DACA recipients who will be at risk of deportation in a shameful display of this Administration’s perverse understanding of national security. “Republicans are holding children hostage because they can’t muster the votes to keep this government running, and yet they have the audacity to say Democrats don’t care about children’s health. It’s offensive and immoral. This is no way to run a country.”
01.12.2018	Washington, DC – Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Tom Rooney (FL-17) formally established the new Congressional Natural Disaster Caucus. “Over the last year, several natural disasters have torn through communities across the country. Unfortunately, we know none of these disasters will be the last,” said Rep. Thompson. “Our goal with the new Congressional Natural Disaster Caucus is to bring together a bipartisan group of Members of Congress who are committed to improving the way in which we prepare for disasters, respond to them, and ultimately deliver relief to survivors.” “The number of natural disasters that devastated communities from coast to coast in 2017 was staggering,” said Rep. Tom Rooney. “My home state of Florida is no stranger to facing extreme weather and we know these will not be the last storms we will have to face. The new Congressional Natural Disaster Caucus will bring together a bipartisan group of lawmakers who want to ensure we are better prepared to deal with future disasters. I am hopeful that the Caucus will provide a platform for my colleagues and I to examine how Congress can improve not only how we prepare and respond to natural disasters, but ultimately how we deliver relief to the survivors and the impacted communities.” The Congressional Natural Disaster Caucus will serve as an informal, bipartisan group of Members dedicated to natural disaster preparation, response, and relief. The Caucus will provide resources for Members of Congress and their staff to help their Districts prepare for and respond to natural disasters. Thompson and Rooney will serve as co-chairs of the Caucus. ###
01.08.2018	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement about the services he provided to constituents and the legislation he sponsored in 2017: “As a Member of Congress, serving you is at the very heart of the work I do every day. That’s not only by voting and working on your priorities, but by being your champion in the federal government. This includes helping you solve issues with a federal agency, assisting you in collecting money the government might owe you, or simply having an open dialogue about the issues you find most important. “In 2017, I was so proud to be able to help 1,132 constituents navigate an issue they had with the federal government, securing a total of $652,746.87 worth of benefits or payments many were owed. I also had the pleasure of sending over 82,000 letters to constituents to discuss the priorities they care most about. And for those constituents who made a trip out to Washington, DC, I was able to secure them 430 Capitol tours and 181 White House tours. The ability to directly assist constituents like this is one of the highest privileges and joys of my job. “I was also proud to introduce 20 bills and cosponsor 250 other bills and resolutions to advance the priorities of our community. These bills help strengthen our healthcare systems, protect our environment, deliver relief to fire survivors, help reduce gun violence, and much more. These also included several pieces of legislation that were signed into law, including the Jack Alderson Toxic Exposure Declassification Act which gives veterans exposed to toxic substances access to the answers and care they deserve. “As we enter the new year, I want to remind all of those living in California’s 5th Congressional District about the services my office provides directly to constituents. A detailed list of those services can be found here. I am here to listen to you and ensure that your government works for you.” ###
12.21.2017	Washington, DC – Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Jerry McNerney (CA-09), and Eric Swalwell (CA-15) today announced a call on all veterans of the Korean War living in Contra Costa County to contact Rep. Thompson’s Vallejo District Office. The Congressmen are working with the office of the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in San Francisco to facilitate the presentation of medals from the Republic of Korea to Contra Costa County veterans in recognition of their service in the Korean War. “Our nation owes a big thanks to our Korean War Veterans,” Rep. Thompson said. “Thanks to those brave Americans who answered our country’s call to service, South Korea is free and prosperous today. Though the Korean War is often remembered as the ‘Forgotten War’, our veterans will not be forgotten. We‘re asking every veteran of the Korean War in Contra Costa County to contact my office so that they can be recognized for their service and sacrifice.” “Tens of thousands of Americans risked their lives to make South Korea a safe and prosperous country,” Congressman Mark DeSaulnier said. “Their sacrifice is worthy of recognition and is an example of the American ideal of service before self. We ask all Contra Costa veterans of this conflict to come forward and accept the recognition they rightfully deserve.” “We should take every opportunity we have to express our gratitude to our nation’s veterans,” said Rep. McNerney. “I am pleased to join my colleagues in honoring those who served in the Korean War, and to thank them for their sacrifice.” “These veterans served our nation selflessly and should be honored for their bravery and sacrifices,” Rep. Swalwell said. “It’s never too late to give them the recognition and thanks they so richly deserve.” The Congressmen are compiling a list of names of eligible veterans living in Contra Costa County who served in the Korean War so that they can receive an “Ambassador for Peace” medal from the Republic of Korea. The Ambassador for Peace medal is granted by the Republic of Korea to our veterans out of appreciation for restoring and preserving South Korea’s freedom and democracy through their service in the Korean War. The medals will be presented during a ceremony in Contra Costa County to be announced at a later date. Eligible veterans include those involved in either the hostilities or the following United Nations peacekeeping mission between June 25, 1950 and July 27, 1953. Enlisted support personnel who aided in these missions are also eligible (e.g. nurses who served in Japan, sailors who served on support missions). Veterans should contact Thompson’s Vallejo office at (707) 645-1888 or ContraCosta.KoreanWarVeterans@mail.house.gov by Thursday, March 1, 2018 to be included among the veterans eligible for a medal. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.19.2017	Washington, DC - Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued this statement following the introduction of a supplemental disaster funding package for those affected by the California wildfires which delivers $81 billion in additional disaster relief. On Tuesday, Speaker Paul Ryan announced that the supplemental funding package would be added to the continuing funding resolution. “I’m happy to see the House put forth this supplemental disaster funding package that delivers the much needed additional disaster relief for survivors of the California wildfires. It is unfortunate that the Republican Leadership is playing political games and tacking it on to their end of the year spending package. “These fires were the worst in California history, burning nearly 250,000 acres, destroying 8,800 homes and buildings, and, tragically, taking 44 lives. The road to recovery for those affected will be a long one, but I’m glad our Federal government is doing its part to help. “I’m pleased to see the State of California’s request for which I have been pushing is being granted to give us the tools we need to begin the long process of rebuilding the communities affected by the fires. I look forward to continuing to work with my House colleagues to ensure we have all the resources necessary for full recovery. “This disaster package should get a clean up or down vote. Instead, Republicans are pairing it with a bill that kicks the can of fiscal responsibility and funding the government down the road. Our survivors are not political pawns. They have real, urgent needs. They deserve a clean vote." ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.06.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued this statement following House passage of the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017: “Today, just weeks after two of the deadliest mass shootings in modern American history, the House passed legislation that could exacerbate the gun violence epidemic in our country. “Instead of taking action to help protect Americans from gun violence, the House passed a bill that would force states to recognize other states’ concealed carry laws, even those 12 states that don’t have any permitting requirements. Currently, 30 states and the District of Columbia deny permits to people convicted of certain violent crimes. This bill would allow these criminals to carry concealed firearms in those states. “This is a disgrace. And it’s not what an overwhelming majority of Americans want. “For years, I have called on House Republican Leadership to simply hold a vote on various commonsense gun violence prevention legislation—like expanded background checks or banning bump stocks. And for years, they have refused. “It is shameful that the only legislation they will take up on this issue is a bill that makes American communities less safe. “As Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, as a gun owner, and as a father and grandfather, I will continue to do everything I can to advance the commonsense gun policies that will help keep our families and communities safe.” H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Act of 2017, passed the House today in a 231-198 vote. This legislation would force states to recognize other states’ legal standards for allowing residents to carry a concealed and loaded firearm. In 12 states, individuals currently only need to own a firearm to be eligible to concealed carry—no additional screening or permits are required. Under this bill, individuals from those states would now be able to legally carry a concealed firearm in every other state, even those that have additional screening or permitting requirements for their own residents. Additionally, 30 states and the District of the Columbia have laws preventing individuals convicted of certain violent crimes from being issued a concealed carry permit. Under this bill, individuals convicted of these crimes in any other state would now be able to concealed carry in those 30 states and DC. ###
12.01.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) led every member of the California House delegation in urging the Chair and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Appropriations to include the State of California’s current $4.4 billion request for additional fire-related disaster relief in upcoming supplemental disaster relief legislation. “Today, we’re calling on the leaders of the Appropriations Committee to help California communities devastated by the recent fires and grant the State of California’s current $4.4 billion request for further fire-related disaster relief,” said Rep. Thompson. “These were the worst fires in California’s history and, as a result, they left unprecedented damage in their wake. California has outlined the funding we need for relief efforts, and it is crucial that the Federal government steps up to help. This funding is a vital first step in our long-term recovery, and I’ll continue to fight to ensure we have all the resources we need to fully recover and rebuild.” "We are united as a delegation to help our neighbors recover and rebuild from these tragic fires,” said Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23). “California will receive the resources we need in the supplemental package the House will pass – including legislation ensuring wildfire-specific tax relief for affected Californians, just as Congress approved for victims of the recent hurricanes.” “Congress has an urgent responsibility to the California families whose lives have been upended by the disastrous wildfires,” said Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA-12). “We must provide these communities with the resources they need to recover, rebuild and heal during this heartbreaking time. The people of California deserve to know that Congress will be there for them not only now but throughout the long road to recovery.” “In the wake of the worst wildfire disaster we have ever seen, our communities need this federal support to rebuild,” said Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02). “I’m glad to see the entire California Delegation in Congress uniting today to call on the Appropriations Committee to deliver this this overdue disaster aid to Californians. I’ll keep pushing to secure the resources that my constituents need to navigate the long path to recover from this tragedy.” “The California delegation has come together in a bipartisan fashion to work with Governor Brown to provide much needed assistance to California communities affected by recent disasters,” said Rep. Ken Calvert (CA-42). “I recently toured the areas affected by the devastating wildfires with Rep. Mike Thompson because I felt it was important to see the horrific impacts up close and hear from those affected. There’s a tremendous effort being made by FEMA and the other agencies on the ground but we must ensure the areas affected by these disasters have the resources they need.” The House Committee on Appropriations is currently developing supplemental disaster relief legislation that would appropriate funding for ongoing relief efforts in areas recently stuck by natural disasters. The State of California has put forth a $4.4 billion request for supplemental disaster relief to begin long-term recovery and rebuilding efforts in communities affected by the fires. The State’s detailed request can be found here. The full letter to Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member Nita Lowey can be found here. ###
11.30.2017	Washington, DC – Former Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus Chairman Rep. Mike Thompson and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member Raúl M. Grijalva today introduced H.R. 4489, the Authorizing Critical Conservation for Sportsmen and Sportswomen (ACCESS) Act. The ACCESS Act expands access for fishing, hunting, and other recreational activities on public lands and addresses numerous priorities of the sporting and conservation communities. The bill reauthorizes and fully funds several popular conservation programs that protect wildlife and habitat through long-term conservation, land acquisition, and public-private partnerships. It also includes a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund and the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, key programs for sportsmen’s access to public lands that have broad bipartisan backing. “As a lifelong hunter and sportsman, I’m proud to introduce the ACCESS Act, a true sportsmen’s bill that would make a real difference for sportsmen and women across the country,” Thompson said. “Participation in hunting and fishing has declined over the years and we should be working to get more young folks outdoors, expanding access to these recreational opportunities. The programs in this bill have bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate, and I look forward to working with my colleague to move them forward.” “We need to stop letting the gun lobby and its partners in Congress use sportsmen as a shield to advance their agenda. Instead of catering to National Rifle Association lobbyists, our bill expands access to public lands and protects America’s outdoor heritage,” Grijalva said. “Conserving wildlife and habitat while opening up new opportunities for hunters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts is a win for everyone. It may not be how the gun pushers in D.C prefer to do business, but it’s a welcome step forward for sportsmen tired of seeing their priorities hijacked.” Sporting and conservation groups including the National Wildlife Federation, Trout Unlimited, and Backcountry Hunters and Anglers support the ACCESS Act. Collin O’Mara, President and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, praised the bill, saying: “America’s sportsmen and sportswomen are among the finest wildlife conservationists in our nation. The ACCESS Act demonstrates the inextricable role that restoring wildlife habitat and expanding outdoor opportunities play in increasing wildlife populations and preserving our outdoor heritage, from protecting the coldwater streams that trout depend upon, the wetlands and grasslands that waterfowl and upland birds need, and the forests where deer, elk, and turkeys roam. At a time when America’s waterways and wildlife habitat are more at risk than ever from encroaching development, nutrient runoff, invasive species, climate impacts and other threats, this bill will put people to work in communities across the country making sure America’s great outdoors – and the women, men, and wildlife that depend on them – continue to thrive.” Among other measures, the bill: Reauthorizes funding for key conservation programs: North American Wetlands Conservation Act, Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, Land and Water Conservation Fund, National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act, Partners for Fish and Wildlife Act, African Elephant Conservation Act, Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act of 1994, Asian Elephant Conservation Act of 1997, Great Ape Conservation Act of 2000, and Marine Turtle Conservation Act of 2004. Ensures recreational access for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on public lands and clarifies land acquisition and conservation easements for recreational use under existing laws. Encourages fish habitat and aquatic ecosystem conservation by addressing invasive species and establishing partnership grants. Authorizes a prize competition for wildlife conservation technology aimed to prevent wildlife trafficking, promote wildlife conservation, manage invasive species, protect endangered species, and promote non-lethal management of human-wildlife conflicts. # # #
11.17.2017	Washington, DC – Today, the Office of Management and Budget delivered its request to Congress for supplemental disaster relief funding following recent disasters across the country. While the request includes anemic supplemental funding for states ravaged by hurricanes, it contains no funding whatsoever for rebuilding the communities in California devastated by the recent wildfires. Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Jared Huffman (CA-02) released this statement: “This is a new low for this Administration. Either they have forgotten about the thousands of American citizens who’ve lost everything in the California fires, or they just don’t care,” said Reps. Thompson and Huffman. “For weeks, Democrats and Republicans have told the Administration in specific detail what resources Californians need to begin to recover and rebuild. Today, it’s clear those requests have just been ignored. This is outrageous, unacceptable, and a dereliction of the Administration’s duty to help the people of California. “For the Administration to not request even a single additional penny to help rebuild the communities devastated by the worst fires in California’s history is mind-boggling. “Meanwhile, coastal communities from California to Alaska have been waiting all year for fishery disaster relief funding, another bipartisan request that was ignored in this White House proposal. “In the absence of responsible leadership from the President and his Administration, we call on House leadership to throw this offensive request in the trash and work in a bipartisan manner to deliver adequate disaster relief to all Americans who’ve been impacted by the recent hurricanes and fires.” ###
11.16.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued this statement following House passage of Republicans’ irresponsible tax bill: “Today, I voted against the tax legislation that House Republicans have jammed through the House and that would affect each and every American taxpayer for years to come. “They held no hearings. They heard from no expert witnesses. And they unveiled the final bill just one week ago. For something as big as rewriting America’s tax code, this process is wildly irresponsible. “What’s worse than the process is the product. This bill actually raises taxes on many middle class families and adds $2.3 trillion to our already too high national debt, all to give massive tax breaks to the wealthy and corporate interests. Our tax code is a zero-sum game, and these tax breaks come at the expense of the middle class and future generations. “Let’s be clear about what’s going on here. Republicans in Washington are desperate for a win and so are their donors. That is why they’ve jammed through a tax bill in which 70 percent of the tax breaks go to corporate interests. “This is not how a country should be governed. Republicans ought to listen to their constituents—not just their donors—and work across the aisle to deliver meaningful and sustainable tax reform. “I’ll continue to do everything I can to fight this backwards bill as it continues through the legislative process.” ###
11.15.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced a bill to deliver temporary tax relief to survivors of the California fires. “The fires that tore through our California were the worst in our state’s history, leaving communities devastated. The bill I’m introducing today would bring important tax relief to those communities, giving them more tools to begin the process of rebuilding and recovering,” said Rep. Thompson. “Among other things, this legislation will make it easier for people to claim tax deductions for the cost of destroyed property, provide penalty-free access to retirement funds, and give tax credits to disaster-affected employers for wages they’ve paid to employees from disaster areas. This is a great first step to help our community rebuild and I look forward to working with my House colleagues on longer-term relief for the communities hit by these fires.” The bill takes the following targeted actions to help families and communities impacted by the fires: Deduction for Personal Casualty Losses: With respect to uncompensated losses arising in the disaster area, eliminates the current law requirements that personal casualty losses must exceed 10 percent of Adjusted Gross Income to qualify for deduction. Eliminates the current law requirement that taxpayers must itemize deductions to access this tax relief. Penalty-Free Access to Retirement Funds: Provides an exception to the 10 percent early retirement plan withdrawal penalty for qualified fire relief distributions. Allows for the re-contribution of retirement plan withdrawals for home purchases cancelled due to eligible disasters. Provides flexibility for loans from retirement plans for qualified fire relief. Encouraging Charitable Giving: Temporarily suspends limitations on the deduction for charitable contributions associated with qualified fire relief Disaster-Related Employment Relief: Provides a tax credit for 40 percent of wages (up to $6,000 per employee) paid by a disaster-affected employer to an employee from a core disaster area. Special Rule for Determining 2017 Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit: For 2017, allows taxpayers to refer to earned income from the immediately preceding year for purposes of determining the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. ###
11.15.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and David B. McKinley, P.E. (WV-01) introduced H.R. 4392 to reverse a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rule cutting $1.6B for drugs purchased by certain hospitals covered under the 340B program. These cuts jeopardize care for millions by directly reducing revenue to hospitals that care for vulnerable patients in underserved and rural communities, without addressing the underlying price of the drugs. “This rule dramatically undermines the ability of hospitals across the country to deliver care to our nation’s most vulnerable populations. I’m disappointed that CMS did not listen to hospitals, nor a majority of members in the House and Senate, and approved a rule that puts both hospitals and patients at risk,” said Rep. Thompson. “I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stop this rule and ensure the 340B program can continue to serve low-income populations as Congress intended.” “Protecting access to prescription drugs for low income communities should be a priority. Unfortunately, CMS’s misguided rule jeopardizes the ability of rural hospitals to provide vital services. This would have a huge impact on West Virginia hospitals’ ability to provide affordable care. We led a bipartisan letter to CMS with nearly 250 signers, but they didn’t listen. This bill ensures that rural hospitals are able to continue providing affordable services, and gives rural families peace of mind,” said Rep. McKinley. “The AHA thanks Representatives McKinley and Thompson for leading this bipartisan effort to protect patient care by preventing CMS from reducing Medicare Part B payments for some 340B hospitals,” said Tom Nickels, Executive Vice President of the American Hospital Association. “For 25 years, the 340B Drug Pricing program has been critical in helping hospitals expand access to lifesaving prescription drugs and comprehensive health care to low-income patients and other vulnerable populations in communities across the country.” “The AAMC would like to thank Representatives McKinley and Thompson for introducing this important bipartisan bill to prevent major Medicare cuts to safety net hospitals that participate in the 340B Drug Pricing Program,” said Atul Grover, MD, PhD, Executive Vice President of the Association of American Medical Colleges. “This program provides savings to many teaching hospitals, allowing them to maintain vital services for patients at no cost to taxpayers.” “We thank Congressmen McKinley and Thompson for their leadership and support for low-income Americans and their essential hospitals,” said Bruce Siegel, MD, MPH, President and CEO of America’s Essential Hospitals. “They understand the damage this policy will cause to communities in West Virginia, California, and across the country, and we appreciate their efforts to protect patients. We urge all House members to support access to affordable drugs by supporting this critical legislation.” Background On November 1, 2017, CMS cut the reimbursement rate for Medicare Part B drugs purchased by certain hospitals covered under the 340B program by around $1.6B. This legislation would completely negate the effects of this rule. Since 1992, the 340B program has used mandated discounts offered by drug manufacturers to help hospitals and other covered entities provide discounted drugs and lifesaving services to their patients. The CMS rule eliminates funding that hospitals use to support the unreimbursed cost of care for those who need it the most. On September 28, 2017, McKinley and Thompson organized a bipartisan letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma urging the administration to withdraw its harmful proposal to cut the 340B Drug Pricing Program. This letter was signed by 228 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle who understand that protecting access to affordable care is a top priority. To view the text of the bill, click here.

11.14.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released this statement following the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, which included a provision from his legislation, the Jack Alderson Toxic Exposure Declassification Act: “With the passage of this provision, veterans who struggle with health problems resulting from toxic exposure in classified incidents will finally get the justice and resources they deserve,” said Rep. Thompson. “These veterans have served our nation honorably and today’s vote rectifies backwards policies that prevented them from getting the benefits they’d earned.” Veterans who have health conditions that are linked to exposure to toxic substances during their military service are eligible to apply for disability benefits and health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, some military operations and projects that resulted in their exposure to toxic substances remain classified by DoD, despite having taken place decades ago. The provisions from Thompson’s bill, H.R. 3327, the Jack Alderson Toxic Exposure Declassification Act, that were included in the NDAA require the Department of Defense to conduct a declassification review of documents related to any known incident in which no less than 100 members of the Armed Forces were exposed to a toxic substance. Additionally, the Department of Defense yesterday responded to this letter from Reps. Thompson, Jones, and Marshall. In the response, the Department granted their request for a comprehensive report detailing why a DoD contractor tasked with identifying servicemembers and civilian personnel that may have been exposed to toxic substances in classified incidents did not complete work on time and how the funds allocated to that contractor were spent. ###
11.09.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05), member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, released this statement following the passage of the Republicans’ tax bill out of the Committee: “On Monday, we began a committee debate on the Republicans’ tax bill. There were no hearings, we didn’t hear from any experts-- we went straight to debate with a vote scheduled for today. This timeline and process are completely outrageous for something as big as rewriting our tax code. “Worse, today, before we were scheduled to vote on their bill we’d been debating all week, Republicans introduced a new version of the bill with significant changes, and gave Democrats 20 minutes to read it before we voted on it. “20 minutes to figure out how every single American will be affected by a completely new tax code. “Republicans have jammed a tax bill through committee that will: Repeal disaster relief for California fire survivors, families who’ve just lost everything; Repeal the student loan interest deduction, making higher education even more expensive; Repeal the Work Opportunity Tax Credit which has benefitted hundreds of thousands of veterans; Repeal a measure that allows teachers to deduct the cost of school supplies they purchase for their students, punishing them for enriching our children’s education; Repeal the medical expense deduction, which Americans with disabilities, long-term care needs, and high dental expenses rely on to afford care; Limit the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction that California families count on to lower their federal taxes; Limit the mortgage interest deduction that middle-class families use to afford homeownership. “The provisions of this bill that hurts the middle class goes on and on. “To add insult to injury, this bill takes that money from the middle class and adds an extra $2.3 trillion to our nation’s debt to give massive tax breaks to the wealthy and corporate interests, leaving our kids and grandkids to clean up their mess. This is a zero-sum game—corporate and wealthy tax breaks come at the expense of the middle class and future generations. “Desperate for a political win, Republicans have completely shut Democrats out of a process that will have profound consequences on our country, economy, and national debt for decades to come. “This is not how our democracy is supposed to work. I call on all House Republicans to drop this wrong-headed and rushed effort, and work with Democrats on meaningful and responsible tax reform.” ###
11.09.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released this statement urging those whose property was destroyed in the recent fires to submit “right-of-entry” forms to receive free debris removal services from the Army Corps of Engineers: “Debris cleanup is the first and often an expensive hurdle for many people who return to a burned down home. Fortunately, the Army Corps of Engineers will be clearing properties free of charge for all those whose homes were destroyed in Sonoma, Lake, and Napa counties. However, you must fill out and submit ‘right-of-entry’ form to give the Corps permission to access your property. I’ve heard from many constituents who are wary to give their information on this form, but I urge all those who want their property cleared free of charge to submit the form.” More information about the right-of-entry forms and the debris cleanup process can be found here. For those with destroyed property in Napa County, right-of-entry forms must be submitted by 5PM TODAY, Thursday, November 9. The form can be found and submitted at the Planning, Building and Environmental Services (PBES) Department at 1195 3rd Street, Suite 210 in Napa. More information about this process can be found on this County FAQ document or by calling PBES at (707) 253-4417. For those with destroyed property in Sonoma County, right-of-entry forms must be submitted by Monday, November 13. The form can be found and submitted at the right-of-entry processing center at 625 5th Street in Santa Rosa between 9AM and 6PM, 7 days a week.

11.08.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis signed by 76 other Members asking for an explanation as to why the Texas shooter’s military conviction for domestic abuse was not entered into the National Criminal Information Center Database. “[It] was shocking to learn that the Air Force failed to submit Devin Kelley’s conviction record to the National Criminal Information Center database,” the Members wrote. “As a result, Mr. Kelley was able to obtain a firearm and murder 26 people in a church on Sunday, November 5th. The inaction on the part of the Air Force is inexcusable. “The first line of defense in preventing gun violence, is a strong background check system. Every day, background checks stop more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, the system only works when relevant information is added in a timely and accurate manner. “Why was the record not submitted? How many additional records have yet to be submitted? What is your plan is to ensure that all relevant records will be submitted and by when?” The full letter to Secretary Mattis can be found here. ###
11.06.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released this statement following the President’s remarks about Sunday’s mass shooting at a Texas church: “In response to the horrific mass shooting at a Texas church on Sunday, President Trump said it wasn’t a ‘guns situation,’ but a ‘mental health’ problem. While the prevalence of gun violence in our country is much more complicated than that, the President has done nothing to bolster mental health treatment, quite the opposite—he’s undermined mental health services at every turn. He is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act which covers mental health treatment, he has called for drastic cuts to mental health services in his budget, and he’s signed legislation that prevents the Social Security Administration from reporting information about mentally incompetent beneficiaries into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). It’s disgraceful that he would use this argument to dodge a substantive, national conversation about what we can do to help prevent gun violence in our neighborhoods. “If the President is serious about keeping guns out of the hands of the dangerously mentally ill, I urge him to call on House Republicans to take up the bipartisan bill I introduced last week to do just that. The Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2017 that I introduced with Republican Congressman Peter King, would expand background checks to help stop criminals, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill from purchasing a gun. Background checks work. Every day, more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives are stopped from purchasing a gun. This legislation would strengthen that system and keep guns out of the wrong hands. “House Republicans can also bring to the floor, the Safer Communities Act, legislation I have introduced that would strengthen and improve mental health intervention efforts, close gaps in current federal law allowing dangerously mentally ill individuals to possess firearms, and allow the CDC to conduct gun violence research. “While we mourn the loss of the Texans brutally gunned down in their house of worship—many of whom were children—we cannot wait another day to do something to help stop future tragedies like this.” ###
11.03.2017	Washington, DC – Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Peter King (R-NY) today introduced H.R. 4240, the bipartisan Thompson-King background check legislation, officially known as the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2017. The bill, expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. “This is an anti-criminal, pro-Second Amendment bill” said Mike Thompson. “Background checks are the first line of defense in our efforts to keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. The American people have had enough of thoughts and prayers. They want leaders to act. Congress should immediately take up and pass our bipartisan bill to close the system’s loopholes and to strengthen our background check system.” “There is no single law that can put an end to mass shootings or gun violence, but there are certainly proactive steps we can take to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill,” said Peter King. “When background checks are used, they keep guns out of the hands of people we all agree shouldn’t have guns. As government officials it is our responsibility to protect our citizens, and when it comes to gun violence we must do more. The majority of Americans want to see action, and we owe it to the victims and their families to prevent such tragedies from occurring again.” Under the legislation, the current background check system would be expanded to require comprehensive and enforceable background checks on all commercial gun sales, such as those made at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, no system is in place to prevent these same prohibited purchasers from buying identical guns at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad with no questions asked because background checks are not required for these kinds of sales. The Thompson-King bill closes these loopholes. The legislation also supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It provides reasonable exceptions for firearms transfers between family members, friends, and hunting buddies. Under the bill, background checks would continue to be conducted in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. The bill also help strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. ###
11.03.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) release the following statement about the provision in the Republicans’ tax bill that would repeal a tax law that would allow fire survivors to deduct uninsured property loss as a result of a fire: “Buried in the Republican tax bill is one of the most cold-hearted provisions I’ve seen in my tenure in public service. In an attempt to offset the cost of tax breaks for wealthy and corporate interests, Republicans are repealing a measure that allows survivors of fire disasters to write-off some costs of property destroyed in a fire. "Simply put, this is a cruel act against the families who have lost everything in the devastating fires we just experienced in California. "I will not stand for it. "Every single American should be outraged that Republicans now want to take from those who literally have nothing, to give tax breaks to the wealthy. "This does not reflect the values of our country. Our country stands up and lends a helping hand to those who have been struck by disaster—it doesn’t swoop in and pick their pockets while they’re down. "I will fight the repeal of this deduction tooth and nail, and I urge my Republican colleagues to drop this flawed bill all together.” ###
11.03.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released this statement following the introduction of the House Republicans’ tax bill which would add trillions of dollars to our national debt: “For years, I have worked for responsible and bipartisan tax reform that is built from the middle class out. The tax proposal that House Republicans have unveiled today could not be further from these principles. The proposal they’ve introduced favors corporations over middle class families and gives tax breaks to the wealthiest among us, adding $1.5 trillion to our debt, sending the bill to our kids. “This Republican plan would make sweeping, irresponsible changes to our nation’s tax code. No hearings are scheduled, no expert witnesses will be heard from—nothing. And they’re calling for a vote next week. They’re hoping they’ll be able to quickly jam this through the House, simply to gain a political win. “This is unacceptable. “Let’s be clear about what this bill is: it’s a plan that adds $1.5 trillion to our national debt to give tax breaks to wealthy and corporate interests. This is wildly irresponsible. Instead of building a tax plan from the middle class out, Republicans want to slash taxes for corporations and the wealthy at the expense of middle class families, and, in some cases, raising effective tax rates on middle class families. This bill would also repeal the State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction which would force Californians to pay more than their fair share in federal taxes. We are already sending more to DC than we get back—this makes it worse. “I urge my Republican colleagues to drop this wrong-headed and backwards bill, and I, once again, invite them to work with both sides of the aisle on responsible tax reform that works for all Americans, not just the wealthy.” ###
10.26.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and Ed Perlmutter (CO-07), Vice-Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, introduced H.R. 4142, the Safer Communities Act of 2017, legislation aimed at reducing and preventing gun violence by keeping guns away from people who should not have them. The legislation closes the gaps in current federal gun policy by clarifying and expanding existing federal prohibitors related to mental health, substance abuse, history of violence, and other risk factors; provides states with the tools needed to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws; provides resources for mental health crisis intervention services; and improves records reporting into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). “After nearly every gun violence tragedy, we’ve heard many say that guns are not the problem, mental health is. The Safer Communities Act we’ve introduced today would address that problem and keep guns out of the hands of the dangerously mentally ill,” said Rep. Thompson. “While those suffering from mental illness are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violent crimes, we recognize that improving our mental health system, and keeping firearms from those with other risk factors such as a history of substance abuse disorders and violence, can help prevent gun violence. And by improving intervention services, boosting evidence-based research, and giving law enforcement more tools to get guns out of the hands of those who pose a danger to themselves or others, we can make our country safer and get people the help they need, while also respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.” “This is a common sense proposal to reduce the likelihood of individuals suffering from mental illness from accessing firearms. It’s important to keep guns away from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others and instead provide them with the mental health services they need,” said Rep. Perlmutter. “We’ve seen far too many tragedies in our communities and we must take steps to prevent future tragedies by making gun violence less easy, less frequent and less deadly.” The Safer Communities Act of 2017 clarifies and expands existing federal prohibitors to help keep guns away from those who are determined to pose a danger to themselves or others. Specifically, the legislation prohibits the purchase or possession of a firearm by individuals subject to involuntary outpatient commitment if a court finds they pose a significant and dangerous threat to themselves or others. Current federal law has been interpreted to apply only to inpatient commitments. Recognizing that states play an important role in preventing gun violence and ensuring safe communities, the legislation provides states with the tools needed to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws. Specifically, it further supports federal and state partnerships by providing grants to states to strengthen gun violence prevention laws that prohibit individuals with certain risk factors such as a history of dangerous mental illness, substance abuse, and violence from possessing firearms. For example, states could: Create laws that enable law enforcement to petition for a warrant to temporarily remove firearms when there is probable cause to believe that an individual poses an imminent risk of harm to self or others. The process by which a warrant is obtained and a gun is removed must be consistent with due process; and Create laws that temporarily prohibit the purchase and possession of a gun after an involuntary hospitalization on an emergency basis due to serious mental illness; The legislation also requires the FBI to expand its current alert system so state and local law enforcement can pursue cases where prohibited persons try to purchase guns – particularly those prohibited due to serious mental illness. Thompson and Perlmutter’s bill also provides resources for mental health crisis intervention services, boosts mental health research, enhances information sharing and research on gun violence, and improves the submission of mental health records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm. The bill changes the outdated and stigmatizing “mental defective” terminology currently used in federal firearms statute and replaces it with “ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.” Finally, Safer Communities Act of 2017 establishes a minimum restoration standard, ensuring a fair restoration process of firearm ownership rights that balances public safety with individuals’ rights. One year after an individual’s involuntary commitment ends, they may petition the court to have their rights restored. The application must be accompanied by a clinical opinion of a psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed mental health professional. After considering a variety of factors, the judge would determine if restoring gun ownership rights is compatible with the public interest. ###
10.26.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-05), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27), Jared Huffman (CA-01), Alcee Hastings (FL-20), Debbie Wasserman-Shultz (FL-23), Charlie Crist (FL-13), Stephanie Murphy (FL-07), and Peter King (NY-2) introduced H.R. 4148, the Small Business Disaster Relief Act, bipartisan legislation to improve the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) disaster relief efforts. This legislation would give SBA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency more flexibility in setting the terms and conditions of disaster loans to businesses vital to recovery such as debris removal, gasoline supply, and telecommunications. It would also authorize SBA to make grants to small business development centers to provide technical assistance to small businesses after a disaster, and encourage SBA to use local district offices to expedite the processing of disaster loan applications. “The fires that have torn through Northern California have burned 200 businesses to the ground, devastating not only business owners and employees, but the people who count on their services,” Rep. Thompson said. “Today, we’re putting forth the bipartisan Small Business Disaster Relief Act to improve the way the Small Business Administration delivers vital relief aid to businesses that have been impacted by wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. By helping local businesses restart critical services in disaster-struck areas, we can speed up the overall recovery and rebuilding efforts in these communities.” “South Florida small businesses are still feeling the impacts of Hurricane Irma and we must continue to work arduously to help them recover,” Rep. Ros-Lehtinen said. “I cosponsored the Small Business Disaster Relief Act with my colleague, Mike, in order to expedite loans to small businesses that need financial help. Allowing for greater flexibility regarding these loans will assist those whose businesses are their livelihoods and incentivize job creation in our community as those impacted get back on their financial feet.” ###
10.23.2017	Washington, DC – Today, 36 members of the California Delegation sent a letter to Rep. Kevin Brady and Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairmen of the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance committees, respectively, expressing deep concern about any proposed changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction as indicated in the “Big Six” framework. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxable income, and was written into the federal tax code since the inception of the income tax in 1913. The Representatives, in the letter, state, “The average value of the SALT deduction for a California household is $18,438. The vast majority of these filers are homeowners, many of whom counted on the deductibility of state and local taxes when determining the affordability of their homes. Our constituents made these purchasing decisions with the understanding that their property taxes would be deductible. Repealing SALT could endanger their financial security and make California homes less affordable for current homeowners and for prospective buyers.” The letter, pasted below and available online here, was led by Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Judy Chu (CA-27), and Linda Sanchez (CA-38) who released the following statement: “Californians already pay more to the Federal government than we receive in federal spending, paying about $17 billion more than we received in 2015 alone. Now, we’re being asked to increase our tax burden simply so corporations and the wealthiest few can receive tax cuts. Additionally, this extra tax would cripple families in our districts who bought their homes with the SALT deduction built into their financial planning. These families should not have the ground knocked out from under their feet now just for the sake of a tax plan that already favors the wealthy over the middle class. It’s not just the families who would be hurt by this, it’s communities as well. These local taxes pay for things like better schools and fire departments, and the SALT deduction allows our state and local communities to provide these types of services that benefit those of all incomes. It’s our goal to help more families afford the American Dream, and the SALT deduction plays an important role in helping them achieve that goal.” --- October 23, 2017 The Honorable Kevin Brady The Honorable Orrin Hatch Chairman Chairman Committee on Ways and Means Committee on Finance U.S. House of Representatives U.S. Senate Washington, DC 20515 Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Chairman Brady and Chairman Hatch: As members of the California Congressional Delegation, we write to express our deepest concerns about any proposed changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, as indicated in the “Big Six” framework. The SALT deduction allows taxpayers to deduct state and local taxes from their federal taxable income, and was written into the federal tax code since the inception of the income tax in 1913. It has fostered a strong partnership between federal and state and local governments, and we oppose any change that would damage this cultivated relationship. SALT ensures that the income of our residents is not taxed twice – once by the state or local entity, and again by the federal government. In 2015, over 6.1 million California households claimed the SALT deduction. Of those claimants, 82.57% were families earning less than $200,000 in household income. The average value of the SALT deduction for a California household is $18,438. The vast majority of these filers are homeowners, many of whom counted on the deductibility of state and local taxes when determining the affordability of their homes. Our constituents made these purchasing decisions with the understanding that their property taxes would be deductible. Repealing SALT could endanger their financial security and make California homes less affordable for current homeowners and for prospective buyers. At the same time, California has a negative balance of payments to the federal government, meaning the state pays more in taxes to the federal government than it receives in federal spending. In 2015, Californians paid approximately $17 billion more in taxes than they received in federal investment. Elimination of SALT would unfairly penalize a state that contributes more than it receives in assistance. It is important to note that elimination of this deduction would also have an impact on those in our state who do not claim the deduction. SALT supports a strong partnership between the federal government and state and local entities, allowing them to use tax dollars to fund critical public expenditures. Local taxes fund infrastructure, teachers, fire fighters, police officers, and more. According to 2014 Census data, almost 80% state and local expenditures went to public services including education, public welfare, hospitals, transportation, and public safety. The elimination of SALT would pressure state and local governments to make cuts and take in less revenue, resulting in the elimination of projects and services at the local level that benefit those of all incomes. The California Association of Counties, the Office of the Governor, and numerous local mayors have all expressed strong concerns about the elimination of SALT. Any change or modification to this deduction would increase the burden on middle class families and hurt our local economies. We urge you to reconsider this decision, and we appreciate your consideration of our request.

10.19.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05), Bradley Byrne (AL-01), Derek Kilmer (WA-06), and Randy Hultgren (IL-14) introduced the Career Advancement Through New Skills Act, legislation that would incentivize employers to invest in their employees, giving them the necessary training to close the skill gap that exists between employers’ needs and employees in many industries. “The nation’s skills gap is significant. Small businesses across the country report being unable to find qualified applicants and CEOs report shortages of workers for skilled, well-paying jobs,” said Rep. Thompson. “This bill would help narrow that gap by encouraging businesses to invest in the education and training of their employees, helping workers expand their skills while earning money and advancing their career, and giving employers the skilled workforce they need to build their businesses.” The legislation introduced today would create a tax credit for 25% of the first $5,000 that an employer spends on qualified education and training expenses for an employee. These qualified education and training expenses include the cost of programs or trainings to maintain or improve the skills of workers to meet the employer’s needs. “As a Congress, we should always be looking for new ways to help Americans gain the skills they need to succeed in today’s 21st Century economy,” said Rep. Byrne. “Training programs are more important than ever before in connecting Americans with high paying jobs and closing the skills gap that is plaguing many industries today. Through this bipartisan legislation, we can make a real impact by encouraging employers to take a direct and active role in job training.” “Giving seasoned employees the opportunity to learn and build new skills while on the job helps our economy grow,” said Rep. Kilmer. “The federal government can and should be a partner in supporting classes and training offered by companies that can give more stability to their workers and put them in a position to earn more money.” “One the greatest challenges facing workers today is connecting the skills and knowledge they have with the jobs that actually exist. Similarly, small businesses have trouble finding qualified applicants for the jobs of the 21st century. This bill encourages these employers to put resources toward training and educating workers for the jobs that exist now,” said Rep. Hultgren. “Let’s help the backbone of our economy—small businesses—create opportunity for their workers in order to grow.” ###
10.14.2017	Santa Rosa, CA – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released a fire recovery guide to help those affected by the Northern California Fires find and apply for the resources available to them to help them recover. “Our region has experienced the worst fires in California’s history. These fires forced thousands of people to evacuate their communities, destroyed thousands of homes, and left many families with nothing,” said Rep. Thompson. “This guide will help individuals, families, and businesses navigate the resources available to them to get our community back on its feet. “Our recovery is only just beginning. Please know I am committed to working with our local, state and federal officials to ensure that the federal government provides all necessary resources to support our community in this time of recovery. And, I stand ready to help expedite any support and resources that our communities need to rebuild and repair our homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Should you need anything, my staff and I are here to help.” The guide can be found here and includes information about all the current resources available to victims, including FEMA assistance, tax relief under the Internal Revenue Service and Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, and Small Business Administration loans. The guide will be updated when and if more resources become available. ###

10.13.2017	Napa, CA - Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) made the following statement following the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) approval of Individual Assistance disaster relief for Napa County and partial approval of Public Assistance for Solano County: “I’m pleased to announce that today FEMA has approved Individual Assistance disaster relief funds for those impacted by the fires in Napa county, and Public Assistance disaster relief funds for Solano County,” said Rep. Thompson. “These funds will allow us to bolster our ongoing firefighting efforts, and will also help individuals rebuild and recover homes and property lost in the fires.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved disaster funds for Solano County for Categories A and B Public Assistance (PA) which provides assistance for “emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities” and debris removal. With this approval, all counties affected by the fires in Northern California have now been granted Public Assistance funds by FEMA. “The Public Assistance that has been granted to Solano County will fund much needed debris removal that will help first-responders to continue to effectively fight these fires. The funds will also allow for other emergency work and for the repair or replacement of fire-damaged facilities.” The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) also approved Individual Assistance for Napa County which will be granted to individuals to help rebuild, repair and replace housing and assist with other disaster-related expenses. “The approval of the Individual Assistance funds is the first step on the long road to recovery for Napa County and will be a tremendous help to families who have lost everything. “Throughout the week, I’ve been in touch with FEMA and other federal agencies to get our community the resources we so desperately need to fight these fires. While we’re still battling these flames, I’m glad our Federal government is working with us to take proactive action to aid our eventual recovery efforts. I'll continue to work with the Administration to ensure further assistance for all the impacted counties is quickly approved so we can begin the long process of rebuilding our community together."
10.13.2017	Napa, CA- Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement following the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) decision to extend the deadline to file certain individual and business tax returns for victims of the wildfires in Lake, Sonoma, and Napa Counties: “The wildfires that are burning through our community have completely uprooted the lives of thousands, often in ways we wouldn’t think of, ” said Rep. Thompson. “Since these fires broke out, I’ve heard many constituents voice their concern that they would not be able meet the deadline to file their taxes. This is the last thing folks should worry about right now. That’s why I’ve been working closely with the IRS to find a solution. “I’m happy to announce that the IRS has decided to extend the deadline for various tax filling and payment deadlines to January 31, 2018 for many who have been devastated by these fires. This will give families and businesses a little peace of mind as they rightly focus their energy into recovering and rebuilding.” The full announcement from the Internal Revenue Service can be found here.
10.12.2017	Santa Rosa, CA - Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) made the following statement following the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) approval of Individual Assistance disaster relief for Sonoma County: "I'm happy to announce that today FEMA approved Individual Assistance disaster relief funds for Sonoma County. This money will bring relief to individuals and families who have lost homes and property in the fires to help them recover and rebuild. "Since the fires broke out in our community, I've been in close contact with FEMA and the White House to ensure that federal relief is quickly approved. Earlier this week, the President declared the fires major disasters, allowing FEMA to provide emergency assistance for immediate logistical needs. This approval of Individual Assistance is the first step on the long road to recovery for Sonoma County and will be a tremendous help to families who have lost everything. "Given the incredible damage we've already seen in Sonoma County, FEMA was able to quickly assess the extent of the devastation in the county and approve the relief. But others will also need assistance. I'll continue to work with the Administration to ensure Individual Assistance is approved for the other counties in our District that have been devastated by these fires."
10.10.2017	Napa, CA – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on the Administration’s partial approval of the federal disaster assistance requested by the State of California for areas impacted by the ongoing fires in Northern California: “The approval of these federal disaster funds is an important step in our recovery. They will help our cities and towns repair the damage that these fires continue to inflict on our community,” said Rep. Thompson. “The emergency Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation funds that were approved are crucial, and I look forward to working with the Administration to ensure the full Public Assistance and Individual Assistance funds that were requested by the State of California are also approved. The approval of those funds will be the next important step for our community, and for those individuals who have lost everything, to recover and rebuild.” The Administration today approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for Categories A and B Public Assistance (PA) which provides assistance for “emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities” and debris removal. Full Public Assistance funding would allow local communities to use to repair critical public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure, power generation facilities, sewage collection facilities, and drainage channels. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and locals governments split the remaining 25 percent. Hazard mitigation was also approved. This is funding for local communities to repair facilities in a way that will help make sure they are better able to withstand future fires. The Administration did not yet approve or deny Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for Individual Assistance (IA). This is funding for individual families to help rebuild and repair housing. FEMA is still reviewing the State’s request for IA and a decision on IA funds will be made by the Administration at a later date. ###
10.05.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led a letter to the President urging him to take action to prohibit “bump stocks,” the accessory that allowed the Las Vegas shooter’s semi-automatic weapons to function as fully automatic weapons. The letter was co-signed by the 13 vice-chairs of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. In June 2010, the ATF issued a letter in which it found that bump stocks are considered a “firearm part” and cannot be regulated under the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act. “We are urging you to instruct the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to issue a clarification that bump stocks should be considered prohibited accessories under the National Firearms Act,” the Members said. “We believe that the ATF was incorrect in its assessment and ask that you instruct Acting Director Thomas Brandon to immediately issue a correction. Doing so is a necessary act to protect our communities from these dangerous firearm accessories.” “Bump stocks are a workaround existing law that make semi-automatic firearms function like full automatics,” said Chairman Mike Thompson. “These devices drastically increase the weapons’ lethality. We don’t know how many lives could have been spared in Las Vegas had the shooter not had bump stocks, but we know we must act to address this loophole.” The full letter to the President can be found here.
10.04.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led a letter to the President asking him to meet with the Task Force to discuss how to protect Americans from gun violence while also protecting individuals’ Second Amendment right. The letter is co-signed by the 96 members of the Task Force. “Like you, we were shocked and saddened by the mass shooting in Las Vegas,” the Members wrote. “This year, we have lost more than 11,000 people in America due to gun violence. More than 23,000 have been injured. We think that you will agree that this is wrong and that the senseless horror must be addressed. “For years, we have extended our hand and asked the Republican Leadership to come to the table to work with us to find a solution. At every turn, they have refused. “That’s why we are asking you to meet with members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. You have the power to make real change in America and protect our communities from the senseless gun violence like we saw in Las Vegas. Together, we can find common ground that respects and supports the 2nd Amendment while keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them – criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. We are reaching out to you, please: join us in the fight to end gun violence.” The full letter to the President can be found here. ###
10.02.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, issued this statement following the tragic shooting near the Mandalay Bay Casino in Las Vegas that claimed 58 lives and injured more than 500: “Today, the nation woke up to an unimaginable horror. In an act of violence unlike any we have ever seen before, one gunman killed at least 58 people and injured 515. This is the deadliest shooting in our history. Families have lost loved ones and the wounded will face a lifetime of physical and mental health effects. “This should serve as a wakeup call to our nation, but most importantly to our lawmakers. In Newtown, we saw 27 lives – including small children – senselessly ended. Americans demanded action. The Congress did nothing. When a madman entered a theater in Aurora and killed 12, Congress did nothing. When a white supremacist entered a church in Charleston and killed 9, Congress did nothing. When a man driven by hate entered a nightclub in Orlando and killed 49, Congress did nothing. When their own colleagues were fired upon at baseball practice, Congress did nothing. “What is it going to take? If Congress does nothing, its Leadership is complicit. “Instead of giving us a vote on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to expand the background check on gun purchases, the Republican Leadership is pushing a bill that will deregulate silencers. If the American people knew that in the face of the gun violence epidemic, the only gun provisions this Congress is considering is a proposal to make it easier for more people to get silencers, they would be appalled. “This isn’t about helping hunters or sportsmen, this is about making more money for gun manufacturers. Their sales are slumping. They need a new revenue stream. Imagine if car sales were falling and we lowered the standards of requirements to get a driver's license. We would never do that for cars. Why would we do it for something as lethal as a silencer? “That’s why I am calling on my Republican and Democratic colleagues to come together. This is not a partisan issue. This is an issue about saving lives and repairing our communities. I have introduced a resolution that would establish a Select Committee on Gun Violence that would consist of equal numbers of Republicans and Democrats and require them to submit a report to Congress on how we can work together to prevent gun violence. We can protect 2nd Amendment rights while making our communities safer. And we can do it together as a nation and as Democrats and Republicans. “So, while we keep the victims, survivors and their families in our thoughts and prayers, we must act. We must come together. Now is exactly the time. Let’s put party aside and come to the table with solutions. Lives depend on it.” ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as well as the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.

09.28.2017	Washington, DC – On Wednesday, September 27, 2017, Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA), David P. McKinley (R-W. VA), and David Kustoff (R-TN) joined 228 bipartisan members of Congress to send a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma urging the administration to withdraw its harmful proposal to levy cuts on certain hospitals participating in the 340B Drug Pricing Program (340B program). On July 13, 2017, CMS released the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) proposed rule for 2018. The rule would dramatically cut the reimbursement rate for Medicare Part B drugs purchased by certain hospitals covered under the 340B program. These cuts jeopardize care for millions by directly reducing revenue to safety net hospitals that care for vulnerable patents in underserved and rural communities, without addressing the underlying price of the drugs. “This program is a lifeline for the hospitals that serve our most vulnerable patients. These arbitrary cuts will do nothing to improve patient care, or address rising costs in the Medicare program. Instead they simply jeopardize access to the treatments and services that 340B hospitals provide,” said Rep. Thompson. “There is robust bipartisan agreement that CMS should go back to the drawing board to prevent harm to patients across the country.” “Protecting access to prescription drugs for low income people should be a priority. Unfortunately, CMS’s misguided proposal would jeopardize the ability of hospitals to provide vital services to vulnerable populations,” said Rep. McKinley. “Our letter shows strong bipartisan opposition to this proposed rule, and hopefully will convince CMS to change course. We must address the high costs of drugs, but this is not the way to do it.” Congressman Kustoff said: “For 25 years, the 340B program has expanded vital health services to our rural and low-income communities in West Tennessee. CMS’s proposed rule change would slash funding and strip safety net hospitals of the ability to serve those who need medical care the most. We must responsibly address rising prescription drug costs without putting the most vulnerable patients at risk. I hope this overwhelming, bipartisan opposition to the 340B rule change demonstrates the significance of supporting rural and safety net hospitals.” “The AHA thanks Representatives McKinley, Thompson, and Kustoff for leading this bipartisan effort to protect patient care by urging CMS to rescind its misguided proposal to reduce Medicare Part B payments for 340B hospitals,” said Tom Nickels, Executive Vice President of the American Hospital Association. “For 25 years, the 340B Drug Pricing program has been critical in helping hospitals expand access to lifesaving prescription drugs and comprehensive health care to low-income patients in communities across the country.” “The AAMC thanks Representatives McKinley, Thompson, and Kustoff, along with a majority of House members from both sides of the aisle who have signed on in opposition to this proposal that would weaken the safety net by arbitrarily reducing Medicare payments to hospitals participating in the 340B program,” said Atul Grover, MD, PhD, executive vice president of the Association of American Medical Colleges. “This program is vital to the nation’s health because, at virtually no cost to taxpayers, it strengthens the ability of hospitals to care for underserved populations and provide critical health services to some of America’s most vulnerable patients.” Since 1992, the 340B program has leveraged mandated discounts offered by drug manufacturers to help hospitals and other covered entities provide discounted drugs and lifesaving services to their patients. CMS’ proposed rule will eliminate funding that hospitals use to support the unreimbursed cost of care for those who need it the most. The full letter can be found here. ###
09.27.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05), member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, issued the following statement following the unveiling of the Ryan-McConnell tax cut plan: “Comprehensive tax reform must be built from the middle class out, stimulating economic growth by supporting working families,” said Rep. Thompson. “The framework Republicans unveiled today does not give any specifics as to how the middle class will benefit. And despite the President’s assurances to me yesterday that the Republican framework would not benefit the wealthiest among us in any way, this plan seeks to lower individual taxes for the highest earners by dropping the tax rate on the highest incomes, creating new loopholes for the owners of pass-through businesses, and repealing the alternative minimum tax. “Further, the Republican plan does not detail how these across-the-board tax cuts would be paid for which would significantly add to our deficit, creating a much bigger problem for us down the road. “If the President and Congressional Republicans are truly committed to bipartisan tax reform, as they say they are, I’m hopeful this framework is merely a starting point and that discussions about a responsible tax reform package can begin between Democrats and Republicans.”
09.26.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement following a meeting with the President and a bipartisan group of members of the House Committee on Ways and Means at the White House: “Today’s meeting with the President was an important first step towards bipartisan tax reform,” said Rep. Thompson. “It was the first opportunity we’ve had to get a bipartisan group of House Ways and Means Committee members and the President around a table to begin a discussion about comprehensive tax reform. The President listened to both Republican’s and Democrat’s priorities for tax reform and stated he is committed to bipartisan tax reform. I hope this is the first of many discussions between House Democrats, Republicans, and the White House to ensure tax reform is done in a responsible manner. “As I’ve said before, in order for a tax reform bill to receive my support, it must be bipartisan, revenue-neutral, and built from the middle class out. I’m hopeful Democrats and Republicans can work together to get this done.”
09.19.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on ' Graham-Cassidy,' the latest proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA): “This latest attempt to repeal the ACA would be even more disastrous for the American people than the bills we've considered previously,” said Rep. Thompson. “It would eviscerate protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, eliminate tax credits that many rely on to afford their health insurance, and be particularly devastating for the people of California.” “By repealing protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions, Republicans would force massive premium hikes for those individuals, essentially stripping them of their health insurance, and leaving them with no treatment options. This is unacceptable. “This bill would also eliminate the tax credits that so many Americans count on to be able to afford their insurance. In California alone, these credits help 90 percent of Covered California enrollees afford their monthly premiums. "It would gut the Medicaid program that supports seniors, disabled Americans, children, and low-income individuals access healthcare. California would be one of the hardest hit by these cuts, costing California $57 billion over the next ten years. “I urge Senate Republicans drop this bill, return to regular order, and start working with Democrats to make the commonsense fixes we all know our health care system needs. Throwing our system into chaos is not the answer and is incredibly irresponsible.”

09.13.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Representative Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and two-time co-chair of the Congressional Sportsman's Caucus, issued the following statement on the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, following a markup on the legislation: “The SHARE Act is being billed as a ‘sportsmen’s package’, but the drawbacks for outdoor recreationists in this bill outweigh the benefits,” said Chairman Thompson. “The bill includes a number of anti-conservation provisions, jeopardizes lives by weakening gun regulations, and opens up law enforcement officers personally to frivolous litigation. “The bill would give States the ability to override federal fishing rules in federally-managed waters. This could be devastating not only to species, but also to the long-term viability of fishing industries and the countless jobs they sustain. Overriding the science that drives fishing in federal waters is short-sighted and counter to our economic interests. California’s National Marine Sanctuaries alone generate more than $140 million a year in economic impact from commercial fishing. “The North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) is a long-standing program that has been extremely effective in leveraging non-federal funds to protect, restore, and manage wetland habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife. However, this bill would prohibit NAWCA from using funds for land acquisition, one of the core purposes of NAWCA: to protect and conserve wetlands for public benefit. Conservation projects like the California Delta and the Suisun Wetlands have been greatly enhanced because of NAWCA land acquisition. The beauty and diversity of wetlands like these belongs to all of us and must be protected. Wetlands across our country also support a $2.4 billion recreation industry fueled by hunters, birdwatchers, boaters, photographers, and many more. “This bill would also deregulate the sale of firearm silencers. Advocates of this provision claim it serves to protect gun-owners’ hearing, a laughable assertion if the consequences weren’t so serious. Silencers do not actually silence gunfire, despite what we’ve seen in movies, they simply disperse the sound. We’ve all become too familiar with mass shootings in this country, and the deregulation of silencers could take future active shooter situations from bad to worse, preventing law enforcement from pinpointing active shooters. “Further, the SHARE Act would open up our law enforcement officers to personal legal liability for doing their jobs when they inquiry about interstate firearm transportation during routine stops. This is absolutely ridiculous—we need to be making law enforcement’s job easier, not opening up individual officers to lawsuits. “I deeply regret that my colleagues in the majority party have failed to take into account the priorities of hunters, anglers, and other outdoor recreationists while crafting this ‘sportsmen’s package.’ I hope they will listen to the folks they are trying to help and make significant changes to the bill. Until then, I will continue to strongly oppose the legislation."
09.13.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Representative Mike Thompson (CA-05), member of the House Ways and Means Committee, issued to following statement following the Committee’s vote to approve his bill, H.R. 3727: “I’m thrilled that the House Committee on Ways and Means voted to approve my bill making telehealth services more accessible to seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans,” Rep. Thompson said. “This is an issue that I’ve championed since my days in the State Senate when I expanded telehealth in Medi-Cal, and I’m glad to see the committee take this step in expanding the use of telehealth in Medicare. “This bill would give Medicare Advantage plans the ability to deliver services to their enrollees via telehealth by adding these services as a basic benefit. It’s past time for Congress to come the conclusion that California reached long ago: telehealth saves money, and it saves lives by making healthcare services and providers more accessible. “With this legislation, Congress will also clarify that practitioners may use telehealth in chronic care management. Giving doctors coordinating care for patients with multiple, chronic illnesses is commonsense. They should be able to use telehealth to address hurdles like checking in on a patient who doesn’t have access to transportation, or talking with patients in rural areas who we know suffer from more chronic conditions than their suburban and urban counterparts. “While I’m happy with our committee’s vote today, this is just a small step in the right direction. We have a ways to go before we can say we’ve fully empowered providers to use telehealth to deliver timely, appropriate, quality care to their patients, and I look forward to the work that lies ahead.”
09.08.2017	Washington, DC – This week, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Rep. Lynn Jenkins (KS-02) introduced H.Res. 503, a resolution recognizing the importance of cancer program accreditation in ensuring access to high quality cancer. “The last thing any cancer patient should have to worry about is the quality of the care they will receive,” said Rep. Mike Thompson. “Accredited cancer programs give patients the full range of quality services and supports they need, giving them peace of mind as they focus on their treatment and I’m proud to introduce this resolution recognizing the importance of guaranteeing patients they’ll be receiving the best care possible.” “Those suffering from cancer need all of the support and help they can get to defeat this terrible disease,” said Congresswoman Jenkins. “Having an accredited program ensures folks know they are attending a high-quality cancer program as well as giving cancer programs a goal to aim for. We are fortunate to have multiple accredited programs in Kansas, and I am proud to recognize their services and what they have accomplished.” Cancer Programs led by the American College of Surgeons, including the Commission on Cancer and the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, are consortiums of professional organizations dedicated to improving survival and quality of life for cancer patients through standard-setting, prevention, research, and other mechanisms. The American College of Surgeons Cancer Programs are committed to delivering comprehensive, high-quality, evidence-based, patient-centered care. This is accomplished, in part, through cancer accreditation programs,” said David B. Hoyt, MD, FACS, Executive Director of the American College of Surgeons. “We’re excited to see that Rep. Jenkins and Rep. Thompson recognize the College’s role in accreditation and in establishing a framework for providing the best care to all cancer patients.” Voluntary accreditation of cancer centers demonstrate a program’s commitment to providing high quality, comprehensive care to patients and their families. Patients treated by accredited centers have access to the full continuum of patient-centered care including patient navigation and care plans that detail treatments received and provide detailed information on future care needs. According to a study in the Journal of Surgical Oncology, accreditation is an important factor in improving oncologic outcomes through compliance with standards that include continuous quality improvement. ###
09.05.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement in response to President Trump’s decision to end the Deferred Action of Childhood Arrivals (DACA) initiative: “I strongly condemn President Trump’s decision to end the DACA initiative, creating fear and confusion for the 800,000 DREAMers in the United States. “DREAMers embody and practice the best of our American values: hard work, patriotism, and action. They are our neighbors, colleagues, soldiers, educators, engineers, doctors, and entrepreneurs. They are as much a part of our communities and collective American story as any one of us. “I urge President Trump to reconsider this decision and act to defend DREAMers as he’s previously promised to do. As a Member of Congress, I will continue to do everything I can to protect DREAMers, including calling on House Republicans to bring the DREAM Act to the Floor for a vote.”
08.21.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) led a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis urging him to begin the process of renaming military installations across the country that are named for Confederate figures. The letter is co-signed by 21 other Members, including House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Adam Smith (WA-09). “As a veteran, I know what a high honor it is to have military installations named for heroic Americans,” Said Thompson. “It is an honor that no Confederate figure should enjoy. Their actions and ideology were repugnant and they should not be celebrated by the country they fought to dissolve.” The 22 Members note that these installations are named for individuals who do not represent the best of the United States Military, and they call on Secretary Mattis to use his power as the Secretary of Defense to rename the installations. “Several of our installations bear the name of figures who fought against our Nation as part of the Confederacy. These designations only serve to promote a dark and divisive time in our history and do not uphold the best of our country,” the Members wrote. “In your role as Secretary, we ask that you begin a process to reevaluate the naming of these installations and develop a plan to rename them to better honor the true spirit of our Nation.” In the letter, the Members also commit to working with Secretary Mattis to ensure he has the necessary resources to initiate and complete the renaming process. The United States currently operates 10 military installations across the country named for Confederate figures: Camp Beauregard, LA; Fort A.P. Hill, VA; Fort Benning, GA; Fort Bragg, NC; Fort Gordon, GA; Fort Hood, TX; Fort Lee, VA; Fort Pickett, VA; Fort Polk, LA; and Fort Rucker, AL. Read the full letter here. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as well as the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.
08.04.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $2,371,715 High School Equivalency Program grant for Santa Rosa Junior College. The funding made available by this grant will be used to provide children of migratory and seasonal farmworkers the opportunity to complete high school equivalency and continue on to higher education. Under the High School Equivalency Program (HEP), migratory and seasonal farmworkers (or children of such workers) who are 16 years of age and older and not currently enrolled in school are given the opportunity to obtain the equivalent of a high school diploma and, subsequently, to gain employment or begin postsecondary education or training. "HEP opens the door of opportunity and allows students to achieve goals they may not have considered if it were not for this program,” said Rep. Thompson. "I am proud to have helped secure these federal funds, which will help make sure all students have access to a quality education.” Through HEP, students receive instruction in English or Spanish to prepare them to complete the High School Equivalency exam. The program also provides tutoring, books, support services, and assistance seeking post-secondary education, improved employment or to enter the military. “We’re so grateful to receive this grant, which will help so many future students who have faced great challenges. The HEP grant is truly transformational, supporting education for migrant farmworkers and their children so that they can achieve a better life. We greatly appreciate Congressman Mike Thompson’s support,” said Dr. Frank Chong, Santa Rosa Junior College Superintendent and President. Sonoma and Napa counties together account for 10 percent of the migrant students in California. In 2015, only 63 percent of Sonoma County migrant high school seniors graduated, compared to the state average of 81 percent. SRJC’s HEP program aims to close this gap, providing a bridge to educational opportunities and improved socio-economic status for migrant students. “The HEP program does more than provide a path to education for the student; it has a multi-generational impact on the families of the HEP student. Inspired by the success of one family member, other family members have enrolled and the entire family becomes a HEP success story,” said Catherine Prince, HEP Director at Santa Rosa Junior College. “This year, one of our most inspirational graduates was a woman in her 50’s who has worked in the fields all her life. This spring, she not only completed her HSE but also completed a certificate in Floristry from SRJC. Seeing her succeed has inspired many of our younger students to push hard to fulfill their dreams. We are inspired daily by our students, their drive and fortitude and celebrate their success as they move forward.” Funded by the US Department of Education’s Office of Migrant Education, the HEP program is a national program working specifically with seasonal and migrant farmworkers and their families. ###
07.25.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) applauded the passage of H.R. 3178, the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017, a package of bipartisan Medicare reforms. The bill, which was reported out of the Committee on Ways and Means on July 11, 2017, was approved today by a unanimous vote in the House of Representatives. H.R. 3178 included two provisions authored by Rep. Thompson: Expanding Access to Home Dialysis Therapy: Medicare does not reimburse for telehealth services delivered to patients suffering from End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), or kidney failure, at home. However, many of these beneficiaries often seek access to dialysis treatment in their own homes. Telehealth could allow for necessary visits and monitoring without expensive or difficult trips to a provider’s office. This bill allows beneficiaries with renal failure to use telehealth for home dialysis monitoring. Orthotist’s and Prosthetist’s Clinical Notes as Part of the Patient’s Medical Record: In some cases, the Medicare claims review process has led to payment denials for medically necessary prosthetics and orthotics. This provision allows prosthetists and orthotists—who evaluate and fit beneficiaries for orthotics and prosthetics—to submit additional evidence of medical necessity to support providers’ records. “When you’re at your sickest or most vulnerable, you deserve access to the care and services you need without having to jump through hoops,” said Thompson. “Dialysis can be an uncomfortable, difficult procedure. Depending on where you live, it might be hard to find a treatment center nearby. My provision will allow Medicare beneficiaries to receive dialysis from the comfort of their own home while using cutting-edge telehealth services to monitor the procedure. Telehealth saves lives and cuts cost. This is a win-win for everyone. “Likewise, patients in need of prosthetics or orthotics shouldn’t be delayed by unnecessary red tape. Reducing Medicare fraud is extremely important, and we can do so without jeopardizing the care beneficiaries need and deserve. I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure we take care of the millions of men and women who rely on Medicare.” The Medicare Part B Improvement Act also included provisions to improve access to home infusion therapy, extend a demonstration project for the treatment of critically ill patients at home, address an accreditation backlog of dialysis facilities, and clarify physician anti-kickback laws. The bill will be referred to the Senate for further consideration, where these provisions have similar bipartisan support. Thompson spoke in support of the bill today on the House Floor. Text of his remarks as prepared are below. Video of Thompson's remarks on the Floor may be found here. ******** Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of this legislation. Patients and providers in my District and across the country will benefit from these important improvements, and I’m proud to support them. Two provisions come from bipartisan bills that I’ve worked on for several years. The first helps patients get the devices they need, while keeping fraudulent providers out of Medicare. The change we’re debating today will ensure that any documentation created by the device experts will be included in a patient’s medical record to support the physician’s directions. The second provision that I authored comes from the comprehensive telehealth packages that I’ve been working on with Rep. Black and our colleagues on Energy & Commerce, Reps. Peter Welch (D-VT) and Gregg Harper (R-MS). This change will allow for virtual visits and remote patient monitoring for kidney failure patients living at home. Letting these patients to utilize telehealth ensures that they can access the services they need from the setting they prefer: their homes. This bill is another step forward in the expansion of telehealth, but we can do more. And our telehealth bills offer a menu of options for moving forward: policies like paying for tele-stroke services, or adding telehealth to the Medicare Advantage program have bipartisan support among both our House and Senate colleagues, as well as a broad coalition of stakeholders. And we know they won’t break the bank. I’ve worked on telehealth for decades. When I was in the California State Senate, I wrote the state’s first telehealth legislation to bring critical services to folks enrolled in the state Medicaid program. That was 1996. Now it’s 2017, and we still haven’t passed comprehensive telehealth legislation that would expand access for Medicare beneficiaries. It’s long past time for Congress to come the conclusion that California reached long ago: telehealth saves money, and it saves lives. I’m optimistic that the passage of this bill is just a small sample of what’s to come for telehealth. # # #
07.20.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Don Young (AK-01), Walter B. Jones (NC-03), and Roger Marshall (KS-01) introduced bipartisan legislation that would declassify documents related to any known incident of toxic exposure that affected members of our Armed Forces. On July 14th the House of Representatives passed the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act. Missing from the bill was a bipartisan amendment introduced by Reps. Thompson, Don Young, and Walter B. Jones would have declassified a 50-year-old DoD project that exposed servicemembers to biological and chemical weapons. “Congress is complicit by not considering the amendment in the Defense Bill that would have declassified documents related to the decades old project called Project 112,” said Thompson. “These veterans served honorably for the security of our nation and we must not stop helping them find justice.” Thompson’s stand-alone bill, H.R. 3327, the Jack Alderson Toxic Exposure Declassification Act, would require the Department of Defense to declassify documents related to any known incident in which no less than 100 members of the Armed Forces were exposed to a toxic substance. “Existing policy prevents veterans from accessing their service records because many of the files have been locked away in a vault and someone hid the key,” said Thompson. “After their military service ended and they needed their records to establish service-connected conditions to determine care and benefits with Veterans Affairs, they couldn’t provide adequate documents because DoD had not made it its priority to disclose them.” Veterans who have health conditions that are linked to exposure to toxic substances during their military service are eligible to apply for disability benefits and health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, some military operations and projects that resulted in their exposure toxic substances remain classified by DoD, despite having taken place decades ago. “We have a duty to make certain our servicemembers’ health is protected both in and out of service,” said Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). “I am pleased my colleagues in the House are continuing our efforts to assist veterans struggling to access classified military records that may prove their exposure to toxic substances. These records not only provide veterans with the necessary documentation to receive the benefits they deserve, but will also help future generations of servicemembers.” This piece of legislation introduced today is the House companion to Senators Moran (R-KS) and Tester’s (D-MT) bill, the Gary Deloney and John Olsen Toxic Exposure Declassification Act. “Our courageous veterans deserve the best possible healthcare, not just when they return from service, but throughout their entire lives,” said Congressman Jones. “Unfortunately, that is impossible when pertinent military documents regarding toxic exposure are classified. It is time we change this policy so our veterans can receive the proper treatment for their service-connected conditions.” “Safeguarding and preserving the rights of our currently-serving military men and women and our veterans should be a priority of every Member of Congress. As a physician, I know the importance of having access to all information relating to the health of a patient. Our veterans deserve that courtesy and necessity. Members of our Armed Forces should, at the very least, be given the information on any potential health concerns they are predisposed to during their time of service,” said Congressman Marshall. “When it comes to toxic exposure, the effects often manifest themselves much later. I am grateful for the opportunity to help introduce this legislation with my colleagues, which will make stronger and more complete our mission to better the care of every person who has served and is serving." #-#-#
07.18.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced an Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) of $521,364 in federal funding to the City of Santa Rosa Fire Department (SRFD), which will be used to purchase 112 self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBAs). The new units will replace the entire current fleet of worn and aging SCBAs. This grant was made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. “These funds will help the Santa Rosa Fire Department replace critical equipment used by firefighters on a daily basis. This will protect firefighters in dangerous environments and benefit our entire community,” said Thompson. “I am a proud supporter of the FEMA AFG Program and will continue working to make sure our cities and towns have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.” "This grant will provide SRFD with a measure of much needed financial relief,” said Scott Westrope, SRFD Battalion Chief – Training and Safety. “Purchasing new SCBA units without the help of this grant would force us to reallocate funding for basic department needs and day-to-day operations. This grant will allow us to continue to provide our current level of service to the community and hopefully, with help from an improving economy, will allow us to maintain our financial status in the continuous effort to replace equipment as it wears out and becomes obsolete.” The FEMA AFG Program provides grants to first-responder organizations to obtain equipment, vehicles, and training. Additional information about the AFG Program can be found on the FEMA website at https://www.fema.gov/welcome-assistance-firefighters-grant-program. ###
07.18.2017	Washington, D.C. — Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D. (R-TX), Congresswoman Debbie Dingell (D-MI), Congressman Peter Roskam (R-IL), and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement after the reintroduction of H.R. 3263. The bill extends the Independence at Home Medical Practice Demonstration Program (IAH) from five to seven years. IAH has proven successful in cutting costs while providing valuable increases in benefits to high-need beneficiaries. “This is a commonsense program that will help our most vulnerable senior beneficiaries and taxpayers,” said Congressman Burgess said. “Under IAH, high-need patients will continue receiving individual care in the comfort of their homes while providers at hospitals, emergency rooms, and nursing homes are able to spend more free time with their patients. IAH is improving the quality of care and its provider groups are generating significant savings.” “IAH has a proven track record of keeping people in their homes and helping them get the care they need, all while saving taxpayers money,” said Congresswoman Dingell. “I’m pleased to be working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to extend this critical program for two more years.” “The IAH demonstration focuses on reducing costs where they are the highest and improving care for those with the greatest need, all while protecting the viability of Medicare,” said Congressman Roskam. “The services provided through this demonstration save taxpayer dollars and ensure Americans have convenient access to the care they need.” “The IAH demonstration improves access, quality of care, and quality of life for our most ill Medicare patients while saving taxpayer dollars,” said Congressman Thompson. “It’s an important program that works and this bipartisan bill will make sure seniors are able to keep taking advantage of it.” Created in 2010, IAH provides home-based primary care to high-need Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions, helping them to avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and nursing home admission. The types of beneficiaries enrolled in IAH currently account for the majority of Medicare costs, and are expected to account for increasing costs over the next ten years. In the program’s first year alone, there were both increases in the continuity of care for Medicare beneficiaries and an estimated $25 million in savings. In 2015, the program was extended for an additional two years with bipartisan support. H.R. 3263 builds upon the prior successes of the program’s first five years both by continuing the demonstration program for beneficiaries and by allowing providers to enroll additional beneficiaries in the demonstration. ###
07.17.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), in response to an epidemic of passenger safety and comfort incidents, introduced legislation last week to establish protections for air travelers. The bill, known as the Air Passenger Protection Act, would implement and expand a broad range of safeguards for airline customers, including those whose flights are delayed or cancelled and those whose luggage is lost, damaged or stolen. Among other provisions, the bill would also require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to promulgate equipment standards for airplane seats and bathrooms. “Over 140 million Americans will travel by plane this year,” said Thompson. “They deserve to know their rights, and they deserve to have those rights protected. There is inadequate recourse for passengers when disputes arise, and most are unaware of the options available to them in the first place. As recent events have shown, the laws and penalties currently in place have failed to get airlines to appropriately identify and protect their passengers’ rights. This bill is an important step towards fixing that problem.” Thompson’s bill would require airlines to maintain certain reserves of staff and equipment, aiming to minimize delays and cancellations, and would codify protections for passengers whose in-air amenities (wireless internet, entertainment, etc.) are damaged or inoperable. Overall, the bill’s provisions would: Disclosures: Require airlines to disclose – in plain language, in writing and in prominent locations on their websites – the rights, responsibilities, liabilities and obligations of passengers, including the recourse available to them in the event of delays or cancellations. Responsibility for Delays or Cancellations: Specify which causes of delay or cancellation are considered “beyond the control” of airlines (severe weather, natural disasters, etc.) and which are not (personnel shortages, unanticipated demand, etc.). Honesty: Impose fines on airlines that deceive or mislead customers as to the cause of a delay or cancellation. Seat and Bathroom Sizes: Require the FAA to develop and promulgate standards for seat and bathroom sizes. Damaged Amenities: Require airlines to refund a portion of the ticket price if promised amenities (televisions, wireless internet, headphones, entertainment, etc.) are damaged or inoperable, and to refund the full cost of in-air purchases (wireless internet, entertainment, etc.) that do not work as promised. Frequent Flier Disclosures: Require airlines to report basic statistics on their frequent flier programs and to inform passengers at least 12 months in advance before a reduction or devaluation of FFP benefits. Thompson has been a longtime advocate for passenger rights. In 2007, he introduced legislation requiring airlines to provide food, water, medical treatment and restrooms to passengers stranded on tarmacs for more than two hours. That provision, along with a requirement that passengers be permitted to deplane after three hours, was signed into law as part of the 2007 FAA Reauthorization bill. Thompson has also backed numerous proposals to support airports in small or rural communities. ###
07.13.2017	Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) spoke against a decision to exclude a bipartisan amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2018 to declassify a Vietnam Era project that intentionally exposed servicemembers and civilians to deadly chemical weapons. The House Committee on Rules did not make in order the amendment to H.R. 2810. This action blocks consideration of the provision that was offered by Representatives Thompson, Young (R-AK), and Walter B. Jones (R-NC). The amendment would have required the Department of Defense (DOD) to declassify and disclose information related to Project 112/Project Shipboard Hazard (SHAD). Should the DOD deem the information could not be declassified due to national security concerns, they would have been required to brief Congress explaining why. “The DOD continues to stonewall American veterans who were intentionally exposed to Sarin and other chemical agents by their own country, and Congress is complicit by not considering this Amendment,” said Thompson. “To sweep this under the rug is a shame. These veterans served honorably for the security of our nation and when they need it most, this rule effectively turns Congress’s back.” The issue garnered support from American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America as well as Members of Congress in both chambers. “Veterans were exposed to several extremely hazardous agents, including Sarin and VX during Project SHAD and now suffer from debilitating health care conditions,” said Carlos Fuentes, Veterans of Foreign Wars National Legislative Service Director. “The time has long passed when the classified information from this operation would be dangerous to release but the wounds inflicted on these veterans will always be relevant.” Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) has a similar amendment he is introducing in the Senate when NDAA is scheduled for a Senate vote. “Often, the impacts of toxic exposure don’t appear until long after service members have returned home from the battlefield and military records are filed away,” said Moran. “We have a duty to make certain our servicemembers’ health is protected both in and out of service, and providing access to classified military records that may prove exposure to toxic substances is critical to veterans applying for VA benefits and service-connection.” Thompson spoke in opposition to the amendment exclusion today on the House Floor. Text of his remarks as prepared and video are below. Click the image to watch Thompson's floor speech or visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEL91h1__Pw. Mr. Speaker rise in opposition to the rule. I submitted a bipartisan amendment along with Don Young (AK) and Walter Jones (NC) that would declassify a 50-year-old DOD project that sprayed biological and chemical weapons on our servicemembers and civilians, and it was not made in order. Convulsions. Paralysis. Respiratory failure. Death. Those are just a few of the most severe side effects of Sarin gas – a chemical weapon so deadly and debilitating it was outlawed as a weapon of mass destruction. When the Syrian military released Sarin on civilians and children this year, they were broadly criticized and our own military retaliated. But in the 60s and 70s the United States Department of Defense sprayed biological and chemical weapons like Sarin, VX nerve gas, and E. Coli. on our own servicemembers. In the years since, many of those exposed have suffered debilitating health effects. For 40 years DOD has not provided a comprehensive public accounting of these tests nor have they notified all of the veterans and civilians who were potentially exposed. We cannot allow this information to continue being released piecemeal. These veterans cannot wait any longer. Their health continues to decline, and some have already passed away. To sweep this under the rug is a shame on us, for these veterans served honorably for the security of our nation. These tests were an ugly part of our history. They put veteran lives at risk. And our veterans have every right to know. I yield back. ###
07.13.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) applauded the passage of the Medicare Part B Improvement Act of 2017 (H.R. 3178), a package of bipartisan reforms to Medicare which included two provisions he authored.

The second would improve how Medicare evaluates whether prosthetic or orthotic devices are medically necessary, ensuring patients can receive the devices they need. “When you’re at your sickest or most vulnerable, you deserve access to the care and services you need without having to jump through hoops,” said Thompson. “Dialysis can be an uncomfortable, difficult procedure.

Washington - Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Don Young (AK-01), and Walter Jones (NC-03) introduced a bipartisan amendment in the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2018 to declassify Project 112/Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD), a Vietnam Era project that exposed servicemembers and civilians to some of the deadliest chemical agents on Earth: Vx Nerve Gas, Sarin Nerve Gas, and E. coli. The amendment would require the Department of Defense to declassify Project 112/Project SHAD and disclose information related to the project. If the DOD finds the information cannot be declassified because of national security concerns, they must brief Congressional defense committees in a classified setting explaining why the information cannot be declassified. “For over 40 years the DOD has continued to drag their feet on releasing information, and have not made it a priority to notify those potentially exposed,” said Thompson. “We cannot allow this information to continue being released by piecemeal.” “Often, the impacts of toxic exposure don’t appear until long after service members have returned home from the battlefield and military records are filed away,” said Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). Moran has a similar amendment he will introduce when the NDAA is scheduled for a Senate vote. “We have a duty to make certain our servicemembers’ health is protected both in and out of service, and providing access to classified military records that may prove exposure to toxic substances is critical to veterans applying for VA benefits and service-connection. Our veterans and their families deserve the benefits they have earned, and I commend Congressman Thompson and Congressman Young, as well as the Vietnam Veterans of America, for their commitment to this issue and urge the House to quickly pass the SHAD amendment.” The American Legion, Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America have all come out in support of the amendment. “On behalf of the 2 million members of The American Legion, we are pleased to support the SHAD amendment to the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act, as currently written, that would declassify records associated with the Project 112 and Project SHAD chemical and biological warfare test programs,” said Charles E. Schmidt, National Commander of The American Legion. “From 1962 to 1974, the Department of Defense conducted vulnerability tests involving approximately 6,000 servicemembers, many of whom experienced serious health implications as a result. This amendment would help veterans exposed to chemical and biological agents get the access to care and benefits they have earned through their service. We applaud Representative Thompson for his leadership on this important issue.” “Veterans were exposed to several extremely hazardous agents, including Sarin and VX during Project SHAD and now suffer from debilitating health care conditions,” said Carlos Fuentes, Veterans of Foreign Wars National Legislative Service Director. “The VFW would like to thank both Senator Moran and Representative Thompson for their bipartisan leadership on this important issue. The time has long passed when the classified information from this operation would be dangerous to release but the wounds inflicted on these veterans will always be relevant.” The amendment is currently being considered by the House Rules Committee. If the amendment is made in order, it will be voted on by the full House of Representatives. “Human experimentation on our servicemembers and civilians was a dark time for country,” said Thompson. “We owe it to our heroes to be open and honest about what the government did to them.” ###
07.12.2017	Washington, D.C. - Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today voted against the House Majority’s California water bill, H.R. 23. The legislation will jeopardize jobs, undermine existing state law, and override long-standing environmental protections without creating any new water. This latest attempt by the Majority to prioritize special interests in the San Joaquin Valley is being rushed to the House Floor without consideration by the House Committee on Natural Resources. H.R. 23 is opposed by Governor Jerry Brown, Attorney General Xavier Becerra, Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Kamala Harris (D-CA), and the Delta Counties Coalition along with numerous conservation, refuge and fishing industry groups. The Majority did not include an Amendment to H.R. 23 offered by Representatives Thompson, Bera (CA-7), DeSaulnier (CA-11), McNerney (CA-9), and Swalwell (CA-15) to delay implementation of the bill until it was determined that the legislation would not have a negative impact on the quantity, quality, and safety of drinking water in the California Delta region. The bill passed out of the House along a nearly party line vote of 230-190. Thompson spoke in opposition to H.R. 23 today on the House floor. Text of his remarks as prepared and video are below. Visit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGRkQoQmZW4 or click the above link to see Rep. Thompson's remarks. “Mister Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. I rise on behalf of the fishermen, the landowners, the Delta and North of Delta farmers, the conservationists, the sportsmen, coastal communities, the Counties in my district, and the water users across the state that will be harmed by this bill. This is a shameful effort to take care of the San Joaquin Valley’s massive agribusinesses at the expense of everyone else. More times than I can count, I’ve stood on this floor with my colleagues from California to explain that our state’s water system is complicated. There are hundreds of stakeholders, and decades of rules, laws, and court cases from every level of government and industry that regulate the delivery of water to users across the state. And once again, this body is proposing to do an end run that delicate balance to benefit one interest. That’s wrong. Once again, we’re gutting federal protections for fish and wildlife that support the state’s $3.6 billion hunting and angling industry, and $1.4 billion salmon industry. Once again, we’re pre-empting California laws and regulations, telling states across America that we’re okay with the federal government undermining state and local experts from coast to coast. But this time, we’ve gone further - this bill isn’t just about water anymore. It’s about giving contractors a pass on their obligations to be good stewards of the resources they’re using in the Central Valley of California. It’s about reneging on this body’s commitment to the restoration of wildlife and habitat that have suffered the consequences of water management plans that already puts them last. It’s about cutting stakeholders out of the picture and determining winners and losers in statute. Taking a blunt axe to our state’s water system over the objection of the Governor, both of our Senators, and many of our colleagues in the House is wrong for California. It won’t alleviate water shortages. It will kill jobs. And it will ruin drinking water for millions. We need real solutions that are based on sound science and that work for everyone. This bill is not the solution. It’s bad for California’s economy, bad for state sovereignty, and bad for our environment.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. ###
07.11.2017	70% of Americans have thought about their preferences if they face a debilitating illness or condition, but only one-third have completed an advance directive Legislation is the first of its kind to be endorsed by the Right to Life Committee Republicans, Democrats work together to encourage Americans to complete ‘advance directives,’ plans for life-sustaining health decisions Washington – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Bill Cassidy, MD (R-Louis.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), and Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and U.S. Reps. Diane Black (R-Tenn.), Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), and Peter Welch (D-Vt.) today reintroduced legislation to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to create electronic advance directives, legal documents that allow patients to clearly articulate their preferences for their medical care should they suffer from a debilitating illness or condition. The Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act would offer a small, one-time financial incentive to encourage Medicare beneficiaries to provide clear legal guidance to their medical providers and family members should they become incapable of speaking for themselves. This legislation would incentivize Medicare beneficiaries themselves to create and register a certified and secure advance directive online. In addition, the bill would provide beneficiaries with access to a website with model advance directives representing a range of options. According to a 2006 study by the Pew Research Center, 70 percent of Americans have thought about their health care preferences should they be faced with a life-threatening illness or injury, but only one-third have completed an advance directive. Under the Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act, Medicare beneficiaries would be able to voluntarily create and register an electronic advance directive with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) at any time. Advance directives would be created through, and maintained by, outside organizations certified by CMS, and could be modified or terminated at any time by the beneficiary. An advance directive would include any written statement that outlines the kind of treatment and care a beneficiary wants or does not want under certain conditions, and can include identification of a health care proxy. Beneficiaries would also receive a small, one-time incentive for registering an electronic advance directive. To address concerns about confidentiality, the Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act requires both CMS and outside groups maintaining advance directives to hold the highest standards for privacy and security protection as well as system functionality. CMS would only keep track of the certified organization through which a beneficiary has created an advance directive and would not keep a database of these documents. The bill does not interfere with any state laws governing advance directives. Read a one-page summary of the legislation here. “Every person has a right to determine their own end-of-life care,” said Rep. Thompson. “This bill will help put Medicare patients in charge their own end-of-life care decisions by providing them with the tools they need to direct their own care. I worked on this issue in the California State Senate, and I am proud to continue this effort to empower patients.” “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with my colleagues to empower patients to make their own health decisions on their own terms,” said Sen. Coons. “This bill will encourage more Americans to think about what kind of medical care they wish to receive should they not be able speak for themselves, which will reduce confusion and heartache and allow patients to spend their final days as they see fit. The breadth of supporting organizations just reinforces the overwhelming need to encourage people to have these difficult, but critically important conversations.” "This legislation gives patients greater power and incentive to consult with her or his Doctor to decide end of life issues,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Empowering patients to control their own health care decisions is an important personal priority of mine. As a doctor, I’ve learned that the best patient relationships are partnerships – with doctors providing information, so patients can make the best informed decisions,” said Sen. Barrasso. “This bill will help more Medicare patients communicate their personal decisions to both their families and health care providers. This will ensure that more patients get the care at the end of their life that they want.” “Life-threatening illnesses and injuries are devastating for both patients and their loved ones,” Sen. Bennet said. “Advance care planning would provide seniors the support they need to manage their end-of-life care when they are most vulnerable. By encouraging seniors to make proactive plans, family members will face less confusion and more Americans will have ownership over their health care decisions.” “Allowing patients to communicate their wishes with caregivers empowers them to take charge of their health care in the event they are unable to speak for themselves. By encouraging Medicare beneficiaries to plan ahead, their personal wishes are honored and made a priority,” said Rep. Black. “I am very proud to sponsor a bipartisan piece of legislation that keeps patients’ rights at the forefront of treatment based on their own values, not the priorities of the government or their doctors. As a nurse, I have too often seen families go through tremendously painful situations while making decisions for their loved one, and it is my hope that this bill offers some peace of mind in difficult circumstances.” “This is an important piece of legislation that allows the very personal wishes of an individual to be respected when it comes to their care,” said Rep. Collins. “This bill will help ease the burden on loved ones and would provide clear guidance to healthcare providers when an individual has lost the ability to make and clearly communicate their desires.” “Advance directives empower seniors to specify their health care preferences well in advance of a debilitating or terminal illness,” said Rep. Welch. “Having this important discussion with families and doctors in advance will give them peace of mind knowing that their wishes will be met should they not be able to make their own treatment decisions.” “As staunch advocates for the patients we serve and our profession, we support legislation that empowers patients to plan in advance for the unforeseen and unimaginable. This bill would encourage Medicare beneficiaries to create advance directives to ensure individuals have provided clear guidance to their medical providers and family members about their health care decisions. This is why ANA applauds the reintroduction of the Medicare Choices Empowerment and Protection Act,” said ANA President Pamela F. Cipriano, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN. The bill is supported by the National Right to Life Committee, Coalition to Transform Advanced Care, National Partnership for Hospice Innovation, American Nurses Association, Third Way, Healthwise, MyDirectives, Center for Practical Bioethics, Get Real Health, Coordinated Care Health Network, Cerner and Altarium, American College of Emergency Physicians, and Zen Hospice.

07.10.2017	Vallejo, CA – Yesterday, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced his recipients for the Fifth Congressional District American Dream Awards. This award recognizes the achievements of eighteen immigrants in Thompson’s district who have made remarkable contributions to our communities in the areas of Arts and Culture, Professional Achievement, Entrepreneurship and Innovation, or Community Service. Our district is filled with great immigrants who are proven job creators, philanthropists, and community leaders. They make our district better through their hard work and perseverance. Though the new administration has spoken harshly against immigrants and refugees, Thompson continues to promote tolerance and acceptance. “We are a nation of immigrants, of brave men and women who left their lives and everything familiar behind them for the chance to build something better, be part of something greater,” said Thompson. “The dream of our forefathers continues to inspire a new generation today. I’ve met so many immigrants in our district—and all across our nation—who have built amazing businesses, given back to their communities, and enriched the lives of everyone they meet. If I could, I would have honored them all. At the very least, I want to make it clear that our district would not be nearly as vibrant or successful without their contributions. I’d like to thank them all for sharing their stories in their own words, and congratulate them on everything they’ve accomplished.” The full list of awardees is: Luisa Acosta - Lake County Gustavo Brambila - Napa County Amelia Ceja - Napa County Evelyn Centeno – Contra Costa County Sonu Chandi – Sonoma County Nataly Deherrera - Solano County Mayor Myrna De Vera - Contra Costa County Miljenko Grgich - Napa County Art Ibleto, the “Pasta King - Sonoma County William Kim - Solano County Newton Luu and Jackie Truong – Contra Costa County Manuel Mendoza - Lake County Dr. Maryam Mohsenzadeh – Napa County Dr. Marlene Quilala - Lake County Carmela Sandoval and Maria Sanchez - Solano County Suzanne Smith – Sonoma County Click here to view pictures from the award ceremony and read bios of the winners.

06.30.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced his proposal to protect families who want to pass their farm or business to the next generation. The Family Business Preservation Estate Tax Act would create a deduction to allow families to pass their business onto their descendants as long as it remains with the family. “Building a legacy for your children and grandchildren is a key part of the American Dream, and families deserve to know they won’t lose what they’ve built—especially after losing a loved one,” said Thompson. “Many family farms are rich in land but cash poor. A major tax on their estate could force them to sell off the very assets they worked so hard to build. That isn’t right. While some have proposed simply wiping out the estate tax altogether, we should address this specific issue without creating a new fiscal hole by fully repealing the tax.” “There’s a better way. We can protect farms and family businesses. We can be fiscally responsible and compassionate to families who want to preserve their legacy. We don’t have to throw the baby out with the bathwater by repealing the entire estate tax. We can address specific concerns, solve problems, and protect family legacies.” Currently, the estate tax applies on estates valued at over $5.49 million for an individual and $10.98 million for a married couple. Thompson’s proposal would create a deduction of up to $5.49 million—indexed for inflation—for family-owned businesses, and family-owned farms would also have the option to deduct the entire value of their farmland. Families could benefit from the deduction as long as they continue to operate the business for at least 10 years. Thompson is a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Subcommittee on Tax Policy. ###
06.27.2017	Washington – Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Doris Matsui (CA-06), Jerry McNerney (CA-09), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), and Anna Eshoo (CA-18) released the following statement in response to findings that California WaterFix “will not jeopardize or threaten endangered species, or adversely modify their critical habitat” in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta: “This announcement could cripple the long-term stability of Delta fish and wildlife and the thousands of jobs they support. It is a bleak example of prioritizing South-of-the-Delta water users over the health of the Delta. The Administration’s determination that the proposed California WaterFix project is compliant with the federal Endangered Species Act, despite various findings of adverse effects to endangered salmon and steelhead during construction of the tunnels, undermines the critical importance of the environmental review process established under the Act. “Simply put, the mitigation proposed under WaterFix isn’t sufficient to address these impacts. Even under adaptive management – upon which the findings of no adverse impacts rely heavily – we are not confident that the needs of species and habitat will be met. “The WaterFix project still fails to satisfy the co-equal goals of providing a more reliable water supply for California and protecting, restoring, and enhancing the Delta ecosystem. We continue to oppose the project as proposed, and will fight for better federal recognition of the devastating effect these tunnels will have on the Delta, and the communities who rely on it for their livelihood. It’s long past time to abandon this effort to extract even more water from this fragile, over-tapped estuary, and channel our energy towards working together on projects that enhance the long-term reliability of our water system without destroying the Delta.” ###
06.26.2017	Washington – Today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its score of the Senate Republicans’ healthcare bill. It found an additional 22 million Americans would be left without health insurance if this passes. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—senior Member of the House Committee on Ways and Means—released the following statement: “No matter what the Republicans do to their bill, the end result remains the same: millions more Americans will be forced to go without health coverage. Why? Because this isn’t a health bill. It’s a tax break for billionaires and big businesses, and it’s not what the American people want. Let’s listen to our constituents. Let’s put this bill aside and work together on a bill that actually helps hardworking families, one that helps more people get quality health insurance without breaking the bank.” The full CBO report can be found here or at https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/115th-congress-2017-2018/costestimate/52849-hr1628senate.pdf. ###
06.21.2017	Washington, DC – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) presented Vallejo resident and high school student Alannah Elyse Ruiz with a Congressional Award Gold Medal. The medal is bestowed upon young Americans who complete at least 400 hours of community service, 200 hours of personal development and physical fitness activities, and a four-night educational expedition or excursion. “Alannah is a shining example of the great deeds our youngest generation can accomplish,” said Thompson. “Earning the Congressional Award Gold Medal is not easy, but Alannah demonstrated great determination and sincerity throughout her journey. Her work with foster kids, her hours in local soup kitchens, and her mentorship at Kaiser Permanente’s Surgery Department have all been an inspiration to her peers—and to me. I am tremendously proud to present Alannah with this award.” To earn her Gold Medal, Alannah: Completed 400 hours of volunteer public service as a teen mentor at Kaiser Permanente Tutored children and teens in foster care Volunteered at a soup kitchen in Solano County Spent 400 hours practicing and improving her volleyball skills Completed 200 hours of training for her first 5K run Planned and organized a weeklong cultural immersion trip to Aruba For more information on the Congressional Award or to see how you can participate, visit: https://congressionalaward.org/ ###
06.14.2017	Washington – In the wake of the shooting at today’s Congressional baseball practice and subsequent threats that have emerged online, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement: “Hatred has no place in our politics. Violence is not the way we settle our differences. Today’s attack on Members of Congress was cowardly and inexcusable, and threats and statements that appeared afterwards on social media are inflammatory and counterproductive. We are better than this. “The rancor and venom I have witnessed lately is poisonous, and it has to stop. We will destroy ourselves if we do not step back, take a deep breath, and remember that we are all Americans. We all care deeply for our country and our countrymen. There is much more that unites us than divides us, and I urge us all to stand together in support of all those wounded today, their loved ones, and their families.” ###
06.14.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement after a gunman opened fire on Republican Members of Congress, their staff, and Capitol Police who were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game: “My heart goes out to Majority Whip Steve Scalise and the others wounded in this morning’s cowardly attack. It is especially shocking that it took place at an event meant to bring Members together in friendship and fellowship. Though we are all disturbed by today’s shooting, it will not divide us. Today we are all Americans, and we all stand together in wishing everyone affected a quick recovery. “I also want to thank the Capitol Police, whose actions this morning saved countless lives and prevented further carnage. You are heroes, and no words can capture the full extent of our gratitude.” In May, Thompson proposed forming a bipartisan, Select Committee to study the causes and impacts of gun violence. As Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Thompson will be speaking with his colleagues on both sides of the aisle about moving forward together in the hopes of preventing another such attack. ###
06.12.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force—made the following statement to mark the one year anniversary of the shooting at Orlando’s Pulse nightclub. “A year ago today, forty-nine men and women left their homes intending to meet friends, listen to music, and have fun. Instead, their lives were cut tragically short, and dozens of others were wounded and traumatized. No one should have to endure such a horror. Today, we remember those who were taken from us far too soon, and we stand with those who have survived and endured. But we can do more. “In the year since the Orlando shooting, Congress had not held a single vote to reduce gun violence or prevent another tragedy. This is shameful. The men and women who lost their lives deserve action. They deserve justice. They deserve something beyond moments of silence. It is time for Congress to talk about the epidemic of gun violence plaguing our country. We cannot wait for another tragedy.” Forty-nine people were murdered in the massacre at Pulse nightclub. It remains the deadliest mass shooting in the United States’ recent history. ###
06.08.2017	Washington – Today, Former FBI Director James Comey testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee on the ongoing investigation into the Administration’s alleged tied to Russia and the reasons why the President abruptly fired him last month. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—former Member of the House Intelligence Committee—released the following statement: “Director Comey’s testimony revealed a disturbing and repeated pattern on the part of the President. Those repeated requests that Dir. Comey drop the investigation into Michael Flynn raise serious red flags. I am glad that Special Prosecutor Mueller continues to investigate the possible obstruction of justice. We need to know the extent of the connections between the administration, the campaign, and Russia, and if the President has any conflicts of interest that could lead him to put Russia’s interests ahead of our families.” ###
06.08.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on his vote against repealing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: “We saw what happened when Wall Street was allowed to gamble with Americans’ money before, and the result was the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. People lost their savings, their homes, their retirement accounts, everything. Congress passed Dodd-Frank in the wake of 2008 to protect hardworking families. Repealing these protections leaves everyday Americans at risk again. We cannot let folks lose their livelihoods again. That’s why I voted against the repeal of Dodd-Frank, and why I’ll continue to oppose any measure aimed at undermining consumer protections for the middle class.” ###
06.05.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced he had joined the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus. The Caucus was formed to find solutions to the challenges presented by our changing climate, including rising sea levels, saltwater encroachment, warmer winters, and other threats. “Climate change is a growing threat to our community, our country, and the entire world,” said Thompson. “In our district alone, we’ve seen how increased flooding critically damages farms, homes, and roadways—and that’s just one of many impacts. The President’s withdrawal last week from the Paris Climate Agreement makes it clear we cannot rely on the White House to solve our problems; we must take action ourselves. That’s why I’m proud to join the Climate Solutions Caucus as we work with business leaders, local organizers, leading researchers, and others to protect our environment, economy, and natural resources.” The Climate Solutions Caucus is currently comprised of 40 Members—20 Democrats and 20 Republicans. It is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, and Members must join with a colleague from across the aisle. Thompson joined with Rep. Claudia Tenney (NY-22). ###
06.02.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force—released the following statement on National Gun Violence Awareness Day: “Every day, another family mourns the loss of a child, a sibling, a parent, or a friend because of gun violence. As a country, we’ve grieved for those lost in the tragedies of Newtown, Aurora, Tucson, Orlando, and too many other communities. And through it all, Congress has turned a blind eye. “Not anymore. Today, I am proud to join thousands of activists across the nation in wearing orange and demanding to be seen. We need real solutions to put a stop to the carnage. As Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, I have worked hard on proposals to close loopholes in our background check system and form a select committee to study the causes of gun violence. Enough is enough. It is time for Congress to see the problem plaguing our country and do something to stop it.” As a Vietnam veteran, sportsman, and hunter, Thompson is a proud supporter of the Second Amendment. He works hard on solutions to curb gun violence without infringing on Americans’ constitutional rights. He has proposed several measures to address gun violence, including: Forming a Select Committee to investigate gun violence and develop comprehensive solutions Closing loopholes in our background check system that allow some firearm purchasers—such as those at gun shows or on the internet—to buy a gun without a check Cracking down on straw-purchases and illegal gun trafficking Strengthening the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by ensuring records are up to date ###
05.31.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement on the President’s decision to withdraw from the landmark Paris Climate Agreement—a landmark achievement during President Barack Obama’s term to combat climate change: “Pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement is incredibly shortsighted. Whether the President wants to admit it or not, the climate is changing. Walking away or turning a blind eye cannot change the facts. Instead, the President risks grave consequences not just for our environment, but for our economy and our future. “We have already seen the devastating effects of climate change in California and across the world. Droughts threaten farmers and agriculture. Severe floods devastate our infrastructure. These problems will only worsen until we take action. I will continue to support California’s efforts to combat climate change and reduce our impact on the environment. If the President will not lead the way, our communities will.” ###
05.25.2017	Washington – This week, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) and Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-PA-05) introduced H.R. 2599, the Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2017. This legislation will provide much needed protections for Medicare beneficiaries and other patients receiving prosthetic and orthotic services. “Medicare beneficiaries in need of prosthetic and orthotic services deserve to know they’re getting the very best care,” Mike Thompson said. Keeping fraudulent providers out of Medicare will ensure patients get the treatment they deserve, and has the added benefit of reducing costs.” “As a former recreational therapist and licensed nursing home administrator, I understand the challenges that those who have suffered serious injuries are facing,” GT Thompson said. “It is our duty to ensure these individuals are not being subjected to further hardships and financial burdens as a result of fraud in the O&P sector. The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2017 will strengthen the quality of care while reducing costs within the Medicare program—I am proud to introduce this important bipartisan measure.” The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act (BIPA), which was signed into law in 2000, mandated that a “practitioner” or “supplier” had to be certified in order to be paid for certain orthotic and prosthetic services under Medicare. However, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not enforced these provisions since their enactment. This has led to an uptick of fraudulent payment to unlicensed providers, leaving Medicare patients vulnerable to substandard, and in some cases nonexistent, care. The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2017 would: Require CMS to reimburse only those providers who have been accredited or licensed in orthotics and prosthetics; Link the eligibility for payment to the qualification of the providers and the complexity of the device to patient needs for the purpose of targeted care; Establish orthotists and prosthetists as Medicare providers, distinguishing them from suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment (DME); Clarify that notes taken by orthotists and prosthetists regarding a particular patient should be considered a legitimate component of the patient’s medical record. ###
05.25.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force—led 134 Members of Congress in calling for the establishment of a Select Committee on Gun Violence. This bipartisan committee would be comprised of six Democrats and six Republicans, all tasked with studying the causes of mass shootings, rates of gun violence in large metropolitan issues, the effect of gun violence on public health, and other critical topics. “For too long, the causes and impacts of gun violence have gone largely unstudied because of legislation Congress passed more than twenty years ago,” said Thompson. “In recent years, our country has endured some of the most horrific mass shootings in our history. Despite tragedies in Newtown, Orlando, and Tucson, Congress has been silent. It has debated no bills, considered no proposals. And Americans continue to die. It has to stop. “This Select Committee is an important first step to keeping Americans safer. It would be wholly bipartisan and entirely focused on how to stop some of these tragedies. We need to have an honest, frank conversation about gun violence. We need both Republicans and Democrats to come to the table to offer solutions instead of standing by and allowing more innocents to die. We have the opportunity to do something that could save lives, and it is our responsibility to do so.” The Select Committee on Gun Violence would study and make recommendations to address the following: The causes of mass shootings Methods to improve background checks on firearm purchases Connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals Federal penalties for the trafficking and straw-purchasing of firearms Loopholes that allow some domestic abusers to access to firearms Linkages between firearms and suicide The effect of gun violence on public health The correlation between state gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence The importance of having reliable and accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our nation The implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the Second Amendment to the Constitution Rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas ###
05.25.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced a House Resolution disapproving of the President’s irresponsible and negligent handling of classified information. This resolution comes in the wake of reports that the President shared critical intelligence information with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. “As a former member of the House Intelligence Committee, I know firsthand how important it is to protect our allies and sources who provide us with crucial information on terrorist activities,” said Thompson. “We rely extensively on foreign contacts to remain updated on ISIL, Al Qaeda, and other terrorist groups. When the President shared sensitive information with the Russians, he jeopardized a source in a potentially dangerous situation. Russia is not our ally. The President should not endanger our sources in an attempt to curry favor with the Russians. The safety of Americans has to come first, and that safety depends on a network of foreign intelligence sources who need to know their information—and positions—will remain secure.” Israel was widely reported to be the source of the information the President shared. Yesterday, Israeli Defense Chief Avigdor Liberman confirmed Israel had changed its intelligence-sharing protocols with the United States after the President’s disclosure.

05.24.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Senior Member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee—released the following statement on the updated review by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) of the Republicans’ repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA): “Despite assurances from Speaker Ryan and the President, today’s CBO score confirms that their reckless repeal of the ACA will leave 23 million more Americans without health insurance. That’s unacceptable. Republicans claimed they would replace the ACA with a better healthcare bill, but instead they drafted and passed a bill that would rip healthcare away from families, allow states to end protections for pre-existing conditions, and let insurers charge seniors more just because of their age. This bill is a disaster, and if the President signs it into law, he will be signing away healthcare for men, women, and children all across the country.” The CBO’s full report can be found here, or at https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52752. Thompson voted against the Republican plan, and has spoken out forcefully against it in Congress and at town halls across the Fifth District. ###
05.24.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) and Patrick Meehan (R-PA-07) rejected proposed cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund that were included as part of the President’s budget. The Representatives released the following statement: “The Administration’s budget request for the Land and Water Conservation Fund is totally inadequate and undermines our nation’s ability to preserve our natural and cultural heritage. LWCF has broad support among both Republicans and Democrats, and we are dismayed to see the budget call for an nearly 85 percent cut to such a popular and vitally important program for our economy and for our public lands. We urge our colleagues to reject this harmful proposal and provide LWCF with the robust funding it needs to continue protecting our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges and historic places across the country. “The outdoor recreation economy supports tens of thousands of jobs across the country and relies on LWCF to maintain our country’s natural infrastructure, and our most treasured outdoor places. Sportsmen rely on this program to maintain and expand access to public lands so that hunting and angling remain cherished American traditions open to all. LWCF also ensures that families living in urban areas have easy access to parks and open space; hiking and riding trails; and neighborhood recreation facilities. We were proud to lead the effort of more than 200 Democrats and Republicans in calling for robust LWCF funding, and we will continue to lead that effort during the budget and appropriations process.” In March, Thompson and Meehan led the call to ensure LWCF has the full funding it needs.

05.24.2017	Washington – As the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations begins work on its bills for Fiscal Year 2018, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force—led 120 bipartisan Members of Congress demanding that important funding bills be free from harmful gun language, or “riders.” In previous years, gun riders on appropriations bills have had serious consequences and hindered gun violence prevention. The Dickey amendment, for example, has had a chilling effect on the studying of gun violence in America. “Our communities have been devastated by gun violence, and the American people have had enough,” said Thompson. “After countless mass shootings and acts of violence in our communities, our nation is keeping a close eye on the actions we take to address our gun policies. Any changes to our laws should be taken seriously. Amendments should be debated and thoroughly vetted—not tacked on to must-pass appropriations bills. Attaching harmful riders would be irresponsible and disrespectful to those who lost their lives to gun violence.” The full text of Thompson’s letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and Leader Nancy Pelosi can be found here or by visiting https://mikethompson.house.gov/sites/mikethompson.house.gov/files/FY18_Gun_Riders_Letter_FINAL.pdf. ###
05.23.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) strongly condemned the President’s proposals to cut basic services for our families and communities. The President’s plan builds on cuts he first proposed in his “Skinny Budget,” and it breaks his pledge to avoid cutting Medicaid and Social Security. “With this budget, the President launched a full-throated attack on middle class families,” said Thompson. “His budget would make sweeping, unprecedented cuts to Social Security, Medicaid, and so much more. It would rip food away from hungry seniors and leave our families and neighbors with little support. I strongly oppose cuts that would destroy programs important to hardworking men, women, and families.” The President’s budget slashes $1.4 trillion from programs our families and communities depend on to get by. Included in his budget are: $610 billion in cuts to Medicaid $191 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which helps feed nearly 44 million people-including kids—every year $143 billion from federal student loans, including the elimination of federally subsidized loans and loan forgiveness programs for nurses, police officers, and teachers $100 billion from the Highway Trust Fund $48 billion cut from Social Security’s disability program $40.4 billion in cuts to the Earned Income Tac Credit and Child Tax Credit $38 billion from Farm bill programs, including a cap on crop insurance premium subsidies 31.4 percent cut to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 20.5 percent cut to the Department of Agriculture ###
05.19.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05), Gregg Harper (R-MS-03), Diane Black (R-TN-06), and Peter Welch (D-VT-AL) introduced two pieces of bipartisan legislation to expand access to telehealth services under Medicare. Rural and underserved communities often struggle with inadequate access to healthcare due to provider shortages and lack of resources. Metropolitan areas can face similar challenges because of urban isolation and cultural barriers. The Representatives introduced a package of bills to combat these issues and improve access to care by taking advantage of ongoing advancements in telemedicine. The Medicare Telehealth Parity Act and CONNECT for Health Act of 2017 would expand the list of providers eligible to provide telehealth services, remove geographic barriers to telehealth care, and expand the services eligible to be offered via telehealth. The bill would also allow remote patient monitoring for patients with chronic conditions, allowing them to more easily receive in-home dialysis, hospice care, home health services, tele-stroke services, and eligible outpatient mental health services. “Telehealth saves lives and reduces costs; it’s a win-win for both patients and providers,” said Thompson. “We’ve all seen how technology has made us more connected in our daily lives. These same advances allow physicians to provide more patients with better healthcare—especially patients in rural, difficult-to-access, and underserved communities. Unfortunately, regulations haven’t kept pace with the times. These commonsense, bipartisan policies will allow us to make sure every American gets the best care and the best treatment—no matter where they live. The Caucus will give us a venue to collaborate with our interested colleagues to advance the delivery of care via telemedicine.” “With an aging population that is placing an unprecedented demand on the health care delivery systems, there is a growing need for finding alternative solutions to deliver quality and affordable health care to underserved and rural areas, like my home state of Mississippi,” said Harper. “This quality, bipartisan legislation will help reshape the way we think about access to health care in Mississippi and throughout our country and will contribute to the twenty-first century innovations that will bring down costs and tighten the access gap for those who need it most. I am honored to continue to work with Reps. Mike Thompson, Diane Black, and Peter Welch on these important issues.” “My many years as a nurse, especially my time spent working in long term care, taught me that if Medicare is to provide real benefit to seniors while ensuring real efficiency for taxpayers, it must embrace the advances in technology and innovation that are already taking place across the health care sector.” said Black. “That is what telehealth is all about—promoting cost savings and quality care through the use of technology like remote patient monitoring services. Harnessing the power of telemedicine is a win for seniors, a win for providers, a win for taxpayers, and a win for rural Tennessee.” “All Americans need access to quality, affordable health care no matter where they live. Federal policy must keep pace with advancements in telemedicine technology,” Welch said. “Our caucus will strongly advocate for the expansion of cost effective and convenient telehealth services that ensure access to quality health care in rural America.” The Medicare Telehealth Parity Act would phase in the expansion of telehealth services by: Removing the geographic barriers under current law and allow for the provision of telehealth services in rural, underserved, and metropolitan areas Expanding the list of providers and related covered service that are eligible to provide telehealth services to include respiratory therapist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, and audiologist Expanding access to telestroke services, regardless of where the patient is located; Allowing remote patient monitoring (RPM) for patients with chronic conditions such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes; and Allowing the beneficiary’s home to serve as a site of care for home dialysis, hospice care, eligible outpatient mental health services, and home health services. The CONNECT for Health Act of 2017 would: Expand originating sites for telehealth care Create a Medicare Remote Patient Monitoring benefit for certain high-risk, high-cost patients Lift restriction on the use of telehealth in Accountable Care Organizations, and Medicare Advantage Urge the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the applicability of telehealth in projects before the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) Authorize a study on the use of telehealth services once restrictions have been lifted. Thompson, Harper, Black, and Welch also announced the formation of the Congressional Telehealth Caucus. This bipartisan group will discuss how best to improve remote care to Americans who need it most. ###
05.18.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Chairman of the Congressional Wine Caucus—met with members of the Mexican American Vintner Association (MAVA) visiting Washington to discuss how they are growing their businesses and strengthening our local economy. Among those who visited Thompson were representatives from Mi Sueño Winery and Ceja Vineyards. Click here to watch the video here or visit https://youtu.be/m_W_AKN2jCs. “Many Mexican American vintners built their businesses literally from the ground up,” said Thompson. “They came to our country with dreams of a better life, worked the soil, tended the grapes, and did the back-breaking labor required to start their own vineyards. And now they have built incredible, enduring legacies for their families and our district. They are living proof that the American Dream is alive and well. It was truly an honor to speak with them today about everything they’ve accomplished and discuss how Congress can support their efforts to grow and expand.” “This is still a country where there are great opportunities,” said Amelia Ceja of Ceja Vineyard. “You have to work harder if you are a Mexican woman, but still one’s dreams can be achieved. The wines we brought with us to Washington have been touched by so many highly skilled laborers. They have been made with so much pride and love, and we have to show the world that we are bringing what is great from our own culture and adopting what is great from this culture. We have two amazing cultures that we can all help to make better.” “From the first moment I set foot in a wine cellar, I felt at home,” said Rolando Herrera of Mi Sueño Winery. “I feel very thankful to God and life for opening the doors to winemaking and grape-growing and farming. Mi Sueño was born in 1997. We started with two hundred cases of chardonnay… today, we make about ten thousand.” You can see more about their stories by watching the video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_W_AKN2jCs. ###
05.18.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—senior Member of the House Ways & Means Committee—wrote about his goals for tax reform in The Hill. “We can make our tax code fairer, more competitive, and more efficient, but it shouldn’t be done by saddling our kids with a ballooning national debt, “ Thompson wrote. “Nor should Congress make promises it cannot keep. “Simply slashing the corporate tax rate to 15 percent is not going to help middle class families—especially when the beneficiaries are businesses that already pay little in taxes and keep shipping jobs overseas. “Instead, we should focus our attention on helping hardworking families. I’ve spoken with a number of my constituents trying to provide for their kids while also going back to school so they can land a promotion or expand their career. They could benefit from expanding access to the American Opportunity Tax Credit.” Thompson wrote this piece in advance of today’s Committee hearing on tax reform. The entire op-ed can be found online at https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-budget/334048-lets-make-the-tax-code-fairer-for-the-struggling-middle?rnd=1495121751. ###
05.17.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) signed a discharge petition to force a vote on HR 356, a bipartisan bill that would establish an outside, independent commission to investigate the President’s ties to Russia. The petition comes in the wake of last night’s allegations that the President asked former FBI Director James Comey to drop his ongoing investigation into former national security advisor Michael Flynn’s connections to Russia. “If true, last night’s revelation about the President trying to pressure Dir. Comey into dropping his investigation is a gross abuse of power,” said Thompson. “It has all the hallmarks of a cover-up, and makes it clear we need an independent, outside investigation to get to the truth. The President is rapidly losing credibility, and the integrity of our institutions is at stake.” A discharge petition is a rarely-used procedure by which a bill can be brought to the floor once it reaches 218 signatories. A discharge petition was used in 2015 to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank and in 2002 to trigger a vote on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. ###
05.10.2017	Washington - Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on the President's decision to remove Director James Comey from his position at the FBI: "Throughout the 2016 election, Director Comey made numerous, conflicting choices about what information to reveal and what to withhold. His dismissal is not the end of this story. We can't let his firing distract us from this week's revelations by former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Russia interfered in our elections. That's a fact, and it cannot be forgotten or pushed aside. We need a special prosecutor to learn just how deep this rabbit hole goes and take action before they try these tactics again." ###
05.09.2017	Napa, CA – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced the start of the Summer Reading Challenge. Open to students from pre-K through the 8th grade, the Challenge encourages kids in our district to read as many—or all—of the books on the Library of Congress and American Library Association’s Summer Reading List. The list is divided into four age groups, with 25 books in each category. Students who participate in the challenge are eligible for special recognition from Thompson’s office. “A good book opens countless doorways—both to new worlds within its pages and bright futures right here,” said Thompson. “The Summer Reading Challenges encourages our kids to keep reading, experience new perspectives, and enjoy wonderful stories.” Students interested in participating can sign up with Thompson’s office at https://go.usa.gov/x5MVg.

05.04.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) voted against the Republicans’ American Health Care Act (AHCA), which repeals key provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The bill was previously introduced in March, when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated it would cost 24 million Americans their health coverage. Since then, Republicans added provisions to let insurers price people with pre-existing conditions out of the marketplace and allow states to bring back lifetime limits on care and gut essential health benefits like hospital stays, ambulance services, and prescription drug coverage. Republicans did not wait for the CBO to score the amended bill before rushing it to the floor. “This was a terrible bill in March, and it is a worse bill today,” said Thompson. “We already knew it would leave millions of Americans out in the cold and cause healthcare costs to skyrocket. Now, Republicans want to break their promise to protect people with pre-existing conditions by allowing insurers to price them out of coverage. That’s not protection, it’s extortion. Americans deserve better. I’ve spoken with thousands of my constituents who overwhelming oppose this bill. Republicans ought to listen to the people they serve, not a President who wants to make good on a campaign slogan despite what it will cost hardworking men and women across the country.” Earlier this week, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) estimated that healthcare costs across California’s 5th Congressional District would rise by an average of over $4,000 per year by 2020 for Covered California enrollees. Additionally, the AHCA would: Rob $75 billion from Medicare Cut funding for Planned Parenthood and prohibits people from using their tax credits for plans that cover reproductive health. Plans in California would not be eligible for a tax credit. Raise the average annual premium for a 60 year old to $17,500 per year. The Republican repeal has been opposed by the AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital Association, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, and numerous other patient advocacy groups. ###
05.03.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) voted for a bipartisan omnibus bill to avert a disastrous government shutdown. The compromise includes robust funding to treat and prevent devastating illnesses, maintain our background check system for gun purchases, combat the opioid epidemic, and more. It also blocked American tax dollars from being used for a border wall and prevented the defunding of Planned Parenthood. “While this may not be a perfect budget, it is a fair compromise that protects the programs hardworking people rely on,” said Thompson. “Despite the President’s threats to cut the National Institutes of Health (NIH), we were able to secure the additional funding needed to find new treatments for cancer, ALS, and other devastating illnesses. It also preserves funding for our background check system so we can continue to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. We won major victories for the millions of Americans who rely on Planned Parenthood for their healthcare, and prevented what could have been a costly and chaotic government shutdown.” The omnibus includes: A $2 billion increase in funding for medical research at the NIH, including Vice President Biden’s cancer moonshot An additional $600 million to combat the opioid epidemic $73 million for the National instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, and others who should not have them $1.1 billion for disaster assistance for regions affected by storms and flooding $3 billion for border security—which cannot be used for the construction of a border wall or the hiring of additional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents Additionally, the bill stops Planned Parenthood from being defunded and prevents funds from being denied to so-called “sanctuary cities.” ###
05.03.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27) introduced the Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and Their Families Act. This bipartisan bill would make it easier for non-citizen servicemembers, veterans, and their families to become naturalized. “If you put your life on your line to serve our country, protect our freedoms, and keep us safe, you shouldn’t have to worry about your immigration status,” said Thompson. “More than 20,000 brave men and women currently serve in our Armed Forces as non-citizens. They risk so much for our country, we should make sure they and their families have a clear path to citizenship, free of bureaucratic red tape or undo hassle.” “The thousands of non-citizen servicemembers who proudly risked their lives every day by serving in our armed forces should be afforded every opportunity to pledge allegiance to the American flag, a commitment that is already inscribed in their hearts,” said Ros-Lehtinen. “I’m proud to join Mike in reintroducing the Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and their Families Act so that those who have bravely fought to preserve our freedom are also able to enjoy those same freedoms. Our bill would also recognize the sacrifices of military families by allowing them to expedite their petitions for lawful permanent residency. After the honorable service of these brave man and women, we should be working toward welcoming their loyalty and removing barriers so that they, along with their families, can also contribute to our communities.” This bill would: Help veterans and servicemembers who have served honorably become U.S. citizens Make it easier to reunite active-duty, lawful permanent residents with their nuclear family members Keep families of military personnel together While current law allows for expedited naturalization for many non-citizens in our Armed Forces, not all honorably discharged veterans or servicemembers are eligible. This bill would extend expedited naturalization eligibility to those not currently covered, such as soldiers who served in the armed conflicts in Kosovo and Bosnia in the 1990s. It would also ensure nuclear family members of military personnel also have access to these expedited petitions, and would be exempt from the numerical caps that limit the number of petitions granted each year. Thompson is a Vietnam combat veteran and the Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus. ###
05.03.2017	Washington – Today, Mike Thompson (CA-05), Chairman of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, joined Fmr. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, lawmakers, and activists to demand action from Congress. Despite horrific mass shootings like those in Tucson, Sandy Hook, and Orlando, Congress has failed to pass a single bill aimed at reducing gun violence. Recently, Republicans and the President have actually taken steps to weaken the background check system and make it easier for criminals to buy firearms. “Too many innocent lives have been lost to gun violence,” said Thompson. “The American people have spoken loud and clear: they want action. They want Congress to do its job and pass common sense solutions like making sure that all commercial sales require a background check. It’s not an unreasonable request. I am proud to stand with my former colleague, Gabby, and everyone who has been impacted by gun violence on working on ways to keep our kids, police officers, and communities safe.” Thompson is the lead Democrat on the bipartisan King-Thompson background check legislation, which will be reintroduced later this year. Their bill requires background checks for commercial gun sales, closing loopholes that allow purchases over the internet and at trade shows to occur before a check is complete. ###
05.02.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement on the new study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) on the impact of the Republican healthcare repeal on California. CBPP found that the Republicans’ repeal plan would cause health costs—including premiums, deductibles, and co-pays—to rise by an average of $3,689 per year by 2020 for Covered California enrollees in Napa County. “The President says he wants to make healthcare more affordable, but his bill does exactly the opposite,” said Thompson. “I’ve held numerous town halls and spoken with thousands of men and women in our community who made it very clear they can’t afford to see their costs go up and they don’t want their benefits to shrink. The President’s bill undermines consumer protections and gives corporations and high income earners a massive tax break while raising prices for everybody else. This would be a disaster for hardworking families in our district.” CBPP found that on average in California, costs would increase by about $2,800 per year for those enrolled in the marketplaces; enrollees in some Counties could see their costs rise as much as $5,000 on average.

04.28.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced a bill to designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 2635 Napa Street, in Vallejo, California, as the “Janet R. Capello Post Office Building.” “Janet was a remarkable woman who dedicated her life to helping our community, and renaming this building is a fitting tribute to her legacy,” said Thompson. “For years, Janet worked closely with the University of California – Davis to raise funds for Alzheimer’s research. She was also a devoted member of the Order of the Sons of the Italy, where she helped hundreds of local students attend college through their scholarship program. I take deep pride in introducing this bill today so that we can honor Janet and everything she did for Vallejo and California.” Thompson worked closely with Solano County Supervisor Erin Hannigan while drafting this bill to recognize Capello. “It is such an honor to recognize the many contributions that Janet Capello made to our community,” said Hannigan. “She was a strong advocate of higher education and of the cultural diversity of the City of Vallejo.” Capello passed away in 2012 at the age of 77. Naming this Post Office in her honor has special significance, as her family immigrated to Vallejo in the 20th Century and were the original owners of the land on which the building now stands. 51 Members of the California Congressional Delegation joined Thompson in cosponsoring this bill. ###
04.26.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement opposing an amendment endorsed by the Freedom Caucus and introduced by Rep. Tom MacArthur that would let states greenlight dramatic premium increases for sick Americans and gut essential health benefits like coverage of prescription drugs, mental health services, hospitalization, and other key services. “Once again, the Republicans are moving to gut our healthcare system rather than improve it,” said Thompson. “This amendment does nothing to restore care for the 24 million Americans projected to lose coverage if the bill passes. In fact, by allowing insurers to raises premiums on Americans who are or ever have been sick, we could see millions more priced out of the market. This amendment is catastrophic—and Republicans know it. That’s why they made sure House Republicans and their staffs are exempt from the changes. If it’s not good enough for Members of Congress, it’s not good enough for the people we represent.” The MacArthur amendment would modify the Republicans’ previously proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) found that the plan would cause 24 million Americans to lose their health insurance by 2026. This amendment could increase the number of Americans without insurance even further by allowing insurers to raise premiums for those with pre-existing conditions. It would also allow states to deny consumer protections and essential health services, forcing Americans to pay more for less coverage. ###
04.26.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement in response to the President’s recently unveiled tax plan: “After months of promising to reveal specifics about the ‘biggest tax cut in history,’ the President sent out his Treasury Secretary to instead deliver a one-page outline. This is severely lacking in details. The only thing clear about this proposal is that the President is interested in giving himself and his wealthy friends a major tax break. “A blanket repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is a significant giveaway to the richest among us. This is often the only tax people like the President pay. Reforming the AMT so hardworking families can benefit is one thing. Fully repealing it would be a giveaway for more of the richest Americans. It is neither fair nor responsible to force the middle class to carry even more of this country’s tax burden. “The President’s outline is also at odds with what we have seen from Speaker Ryan and Ways & Means Committee Chairman Brady. Once again, the Administration and Congressional Republicans have proved they aren’t on the same page or even reading from the same book. This chaos and confusion will hurt everyone. “Lasting tax reform needs to be bipartisan and it needs to be paid for. The President’s outline is neither. The last time Congress seriously addressed our tax code was in 1986, and it was done with both parties at the table. Taxes impact all of us, and so we all have the right to make sure the people we serve get a voice in these discussions.” ###
04.26.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement in response to the President’s executive order directing the Department of the Interior to review national monuments created since January 1, 1996 that span at least 100,000 acres. This includes Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument in Northern California. “Berryessa Snow Mountain enjoys broad support from our community, local stakeholders, business leaders, and state and local governments,” said Thompson. “For nearly a decade, I worked with more than 65 elected officials, 200 businesses, 29 landowners and farmers, and over 35 conservation and recreation groups who shared the vision of seeing Berryessa Snow Mountain become a National Monument. We held field hearings, conducted tours, and even brought the Department of the Interior to the land to see firsthand its value and importance to our region. “The Monument is now a vital and thriving part of our region’s identity. I am fully confident that any good faith review will reaffirm the merits of Berryessa Snow Mountain and confirm our community’s support for its designation as a National Monument. Overturning its designation would be grossly out of step with the will of the public. Berryessa and the other monuments under review underwent a robust, exhaustive development process. I will oppose any effort to undermine the Antiquities Act, gut protections for federal lands, or overturn the designation of Berryessa Snow Mountain as a National Monument.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is comprised of over 330,000 acres in Napa, Yolo, Solano, Lake, Colusa, Glenn, and Mendocino counties. It was formally designated as a National Monument on July 10, 2015 by President Barack Obama. ###
04.20.2017	Napa, CA – Yesterday, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) held town hall meetings in Napa and Martinez with Ranking Member John B. Larson (CT-01) of the Social Security Subcommittee to discuss their plans to strengthen Social Security. Each month, more than 130,000 men and women in California’s Fifth Congressional District receive nearly $170 million in benefits. Social Security is a lifeline for millions of families in California and across the nation, which is why Thompson and Larson introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to raise benefits, cut taxes, and prevent seniors from retiring into poverty. “Americans worked hard to earn their Social Security, and they deserve the peace of mind that comes from knowing their retirement is secure,” said Thompson. “In eighty years, Social Security has never missed a payment. It is the most reliable government program, but it’s fallen behind the times. No one who’s worked hard and played by the rules should retire into poverty, so our plan would raise benefits across the board and make sure the new minimum benefit is well above the poverty line. We can protect seniors and make sure Social Security is solvent for our kids and grandkids, and we can do it without cutting benefits or hiking the retirement age.” “Social Security is the bedrock of our retirement system. It is America’s insurance program that workers pay into for retirement, disability, and survivors benefits. The common sense steps laid out in the Social Security 2100 Act will expand benefits and make the system solvent for the next 75 years and beyond. I thank Rep. Thompson for introducing this bill with me and for inviting me out to his District to discuss with seniors how the Thompson-Larson plan will help them,” said Larson. Thompson and Larson discussed their proposal with seniors in Napa and Martinez, hearing firsthand how Social Security impacts those in the Fifth Congressional District and sharing how the Social Security 2100 Act can help them. The Social Security 2100 Act would: Increase benefits by an average 2 percent for all beneficiaries. Cut taxes by raising the income thresholds before Social Security is taxed. Currently, individuals who earn $24,000 a year and couples who earn $32,000 a year are taxed on benefits they receive. This plan would raise those thresholds to $50,000 and $100,000 respectively, resulting in a tax cut for about 11 million Americans. Raise the new minimum benefit for Social Security to 120 percent of the poverty line, preventing seniors from being able to retire into poverty. Change the formula for calculating the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) to better reflect the actual expenses seniors face. Ensure millionaires and billionaires pay their fair share by scrapping the cap on contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund for those earning $400,000 a year or more. ###
04.17.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) returned from a Congressional trip to South Korea and Japan, where he met with leaders to discuss our security in the region. During his trip, Thompson inspected the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between South Korea and North Korea, discussed defenses with General Vincent K. Brooks, met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe, and attended numerous briefings related to national defense. “Now more than ever, we must work arm-in-arm with our allies to preserve the security of the region,” said Thompson. “North Korea’s failed missile launch this weekend is not the end of their attempts to develop weapons capable of striking us here in America—and they are already capable of attacking our allies in South Korea and Japan. This is a complex and ongoing situation, and it cannot be solved by issuing threats or sending a single boat into the region. Maintaining stability will take a united coalition. It will require thoughtful, appropriate responses to North Korea’s aggression, not a unilateral approach. Neither the United States nor the President should act unilaterally whenever military force is concerned. Both Congress and our allies in the region have a role to play in any action.” Tensions have continued to climb between the United States and North Korea throughout the week. Yesterday, North Korea tried and failed to launch a medium-range ballistic missile. Their nuclear and missile programs remain in development. During his trip, Thompson: Toured the Yokosuka U.S. Naval Base in Japan Attended roundtable discussions on East Asian security and the implications for the United States Met with Prime Minister Shinzō Abe of Japan Met with Members of South Korea’s Parliament Toured the Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea Attended roundtable discussions on economic and security concerns on the Korean peninsula Met with North Korean defector Thae Yong-ho, former North Korean deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom and the highest-ranked official to defect For additional photos of Thompson’s trip, please click here or visit https://mikethompson.house.gov/newsroom/photo-galleries/2017-congressional-trip-to-south-korea-and-japan. ###

04.07.2017	Washington – Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—a Vietnam veteran and Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus—released the following statement on the President’s launch of 59 Tomahawk missiles on a Syrian airfield. “The use of chemical weapons is deplorable no matter who uses them or why. Bashar al-Assad actions against his own people is an atrocious violation of international law and an immoral act. He must be held accountable. “Nonetheless, Congress did not authorize the President’s airstrikes last night. Congress has a constitutional responsibility to debate and approve any use of military force. We cannot recklessly risk American lives or embroil our troops in another complicated, ongoing conflict in the region. “As a combat-wounded veteran, I appreciate the gravity of a decision to authorize military force. This latest atrocity proves that Assad is dangerously unstable and should not be in power. The situation in Syria has been one of the most devastating crises in history, and Assad’s attack this week proves matters will only get worse. The President cannot resolve this with one airstrike. Congress has a role to play in our future actions, as do our global allies. We must build an international coalition to coordinate humanitarian support and achieve a resolution to the conflict.” Thompson has previously expressed concerns about both Assad’s violence towards civilians and Russia’s support of his regime. He remains concerned by the escalating actions of Assad’s regime, and continues to call for an international coalition to protect innocent lives. ###
04.05.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) joined Rep. John B. Larson (CT-01) and more than 150 original cosponsors in introducing the Social Security 2100 Act. This bill would increase Social Security benefits for all beneficiaries, reduce taxes, and prevent seniors from retiring into poverty. “Social Security is the bedrock of our retirement program and a lifeline for seniors,” said Thompson. “Millions of seniors rely on Social Security for most of their income—especially after the 2008 financial crisis wiped out so many traditional pensions. Congress needs to make sure Social Security continues to fulfil its promise to men and women who worked hard, played by the rules, and paid into the system all their lives. “This is personal for me. My grandmother worked her entire life, but when she retired, she received a pension of only about $50 a month. If it weren’t for Social Security, she wouldn’t have survived. Millions of American families can share similar stories. I’m proud to join Rep. Larson in introducing this plan to raise benefits and strengthen Social Security for generations to come.” The Social Security 2100 Act would: Increase benefits by 2 percent for all beneficiaries. Cut taxes by raising the income thresholds before Social Security is taxed. Currently, individuals who earn $24,000 a year and couples who earn $32,000 a year are taxed on benefits they receive. This plan would raise those thresholds to $50,000 and $100,000 respectively, resulting in a tax cut for about 11 million Americans. Raise the new minimum benefit for Social Security to 120 percent of the poverty line, preventing seniors from being able to retire into poverty. Change the formula for calculating the Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) to better reflect the actual expenses seniors face. Ensure millionaires and billionaires continue to pay into the Social Security Trust Fund at the same rate as everyone else. Later this month, Reps. Thompson and Larson will hold a series of Town Hall Meetings in California’s Fifth Congressional District to discuss this proposal and hear from local seniors. Additional details to follow. ###
04.04.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Pete King (NY-02) led 167 bipartisan Members of Congress in calling on appropriators to provide funds to strengthen our criminal background check system. Thompson and King requested funding to implement the National Instant Background Checks Systems (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act, which gives grants to states seeking to upgrade their electronic databases. “The safety of Americans relies on keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them—and we do that by making sure their names are in our background check system,” said Thompson. “Studies have shown there are huge backlogs of names still waiting to be entered into NICS. These people are criminals and domestic abusers whom the law has found should not have a gun—but they may still be able to get one if they can pass a background check. We must make sure states have the resources needed to keep our background check system current.” “When background checks are used, they keep guns out of the hands of people we all agree shouldn’t have guns. It is estimated that four out of ten gun buyers do not go through a background check when purchasing a firearm—meaning those with criminal records can easily bypass the system. As government officials it is our responsibility to protect our citizens, and when it comes to gun violence we must do more. I will continue to push for action and support efforts to reduce gun violence which includes keep our background databases current,” said King. Background checks have prevented more than 2.4 million gun sales since they began in 1994, keeping firearms out of the hands of felons, fugitives, the dangerously mentally ill, and domestic abusers. Unfortunately, NICS—the database used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to purchase a gun—is missing information. Because of this, people who otherwise should not be able to pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy a firearm. The full text of Thompson and King’s letter can be found here: https://mikethompson.house.gov/sites/mikethompson.house.gov/files/NICS_FY18.pdf. ###
03.31.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—Co-Chair of the Land Conservation Caucus—led an effort to support funding for the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA). In a letter to Chairman Ken Calvert and Ranking Member Betty McCollum of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, Thompson called attention to the importance of our wetlands in preventing flooding, reducing damage from storm surges, and mitigating the effects of soil erosion. “Our wetlands are a critical habitat for a number of species, and they play a key role in minimizing the damage from storms and severe weather,” said Thompson. “As a duck hunter myself, I know firsthand how important it is to protect these key habitats. While our country has lost much of its original wetlands, NAWCA has helped conserve and restore more than 33.4 million acres. It is one of our most cost-effective conservation programs. Every dollar the federal government invests is matched by an average three dollars from non-federal partners. And that money goes right back into our economy, as many of the lands NAWCA protects are used for hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation—a $646 billion industry. Studies have also shown NAWCA creates about 7,500 jobs each year. Clearly this program is working, and Congress should make sure it gets the funding it needs.” “NAWCA continues to be a critical tool to help conserve America’s most vulnerable wetlands. We are blown away by the bipartisan support shown in the Dear Colleague letter and the leadership of Representatives Thompson, Young, LaMalfa and Lowenthal. Ducks Unlimited looks forward to continuing to work with members on both sides of the aisle to secure the funding this program needs and deserves,” said Whitney Tawney, Senior Water Policy Advisor, Ducks Unlimited. The U.S. has lost roughly 52 percent of its original wetlands. Every year, an addition 80,000 acres of wetlands disappear. NAWCA helps reduce that trend by leveraging federal dollars to raise contributions from private landowners, corporations, nonprofits, state and local governments, and other organizations in support of conservation grants. In the last 20 years, $1.48 billion in federal funding has been matched by $4.34 billion in non-federal partner contributions. NAWCA has strong support from farmers, ranchers, all 50 state wildlife agencies, and countless other groups. Demand for the program continues to outstrip available funding on a yearly basis. This year, more than 100 bipartisan Members cosigned the letter—the highest level of support it has seen since 2008. The full text of the letter can be found here. Thompson is also a member of the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, and he is leading legislation to reauthorize NAWCA for the next 5 years. ###
03.28.2017	Napa, CA – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) formally announced Magrit Mondavi as the recipient of a special, posthumous Woman of the Year Award. In February, Thompson accepted nominations from across the Fifth Congressional District for his annual awards honoring women who make an impact in our community. In light of Mondavi’s lifelong devotion to our community and the arts, Thompson presented a special recognition to her daughter, Annie Roberts. “Magrit was known throughout our district as the First Lady of Napa,” said Thompson. “Her work at Mondavi Winery helped put us on the map and her Summer Concert Series attracted artists and musicians from around the world. As she and her husband made their business a tremendous success, Magrit always made a point to give back, endowing the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science and the Mondavi Center for Performing Arts at the University of California – Davis. Magrit’s lifelong passion for the arts will live on in the next generation of winemakers, chefs, and artists.” Mondavi was also known for organizing cooking classes that paired Mondavi wines with the finest in French and American food. She was the co-author of Annie and Magrit: Recipes and Stories from the Mondavi Kitchen, which she wrote with her daughter, Roberts. She passed away in September of 2016. This is the third annual Woman of the Year Awards. Thompson created the award in honor of Women’s History Month.

03.24.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement after Republicans pulled their repeal of the Affordable Care Act: “The American people made their voices clear in the days leading up to this vote. They believe—as I do—that healthcare is a right, not a luxury. The Affordable Care Act brought 20 million Americans into our healthcare system. It provided peace of mind for Americans with preexisting conditions and chronic illnesses. The bill Speaker Ryan pulled today would have stripped care away from many of them. It would have forced the middle class to pay more while billionaires got a trillion dollars in tax cuts. It is no wonder Americans overwhelmingly opposed it. “And now it is clear even the Republican party could not unite behind this bill. The time has come to put aside bad policies and focus on the American people. They deserve quality, affordable healthcare. The ACA has done a tremendous amount of good, but it could be even better. If Republicans decide they want to fulfil their campaign promises to cover more Americans for less money, Democrats would be willing to work with them. But a bill that would have cost 24 million Americans their health insurance while raising prices and cutting benefits does not meet that standard. “We saw today that some members of the Republican party will never be satisfied unless the Affordable Care Act is crumpled up and thrown away. But the overwhelming majority of Americans don’t want to see their healthcare snatched away from them. So let’s work across the aisle. Let’s remember that despite our different parties, most of us want to see Congress work. We want to protect the people we serve. We’ve done it before. We can do it again.” ###
03.24.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—senior Member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee—spoke on the House floor against the Republican bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act. His remarks are as follows: Watch Rep. Thompson’s remarks at https://youtu.be/XaBgjX7LHhA. “Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bad bill. It’s not a step towards fixing the bill. This is a step towards destroying healthcare. “It was bad when it ripped healthcare away from 24 million Americans. It was bad when it created an Age Tax, forcing seniors to pay five times that of what other people pay. It was bad when it forced hardworking Americans to pay higher premiums and deductibles while billionaires get a trillion dollar worth of tax cuts. And it was bad when it shortened the life of Medicare. “But today it got worse. “Today Republicans gutted coverage for emergency services, prescription drugs, hospitalization, mental health coverage, and preventative coverage. This bill also prevents millions of veterans from getting healthcare. “This is a truly bad bill. “It will cost millions of Americans their healthcare. It will force them to pay more for fewer benefits. And it gives the richest Americans a huge tax cut. This is a tax cut bill, not a healthcare bill, and the American people deserve much better. I urge everyone to vote no on this bad bill. “Thank you, I yield back.” ###
03.22.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Paul Cook (CA-08) introduced the Earthquake Mitigation Incentive and Tax Parity Act of 2017 to exclude incentives for residential seismic retrofits from federal taxation. These earthquake mitigation measures are already tax-free at the state level in California. “The South-Napa earthquake damaged more than 1,500 homes in 2014, making it clear we need to do more to help residents prepare for disasters,” said Thompson. “These tax incentives will encourage homeowners to make the necessary retrofits to protect their homes—reducing damage from earthquakes, saving lives, and saving the government money in the long run. California has already seen the value of these retrofits, which is why they are exempt from state taxes. It is time for the federal government to follow suit.” “This legislation would bring federal tax law into sync with California law to encourage residents in earthquake-prone regions to take preventative measures to safeguard their homes,” said Cook. “Current federal law penalizes Californians with taxes, which leaves families and structures less safe. We need to eliminate these tax penalties and this bill is a step in the right direction.” The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services established the California Residential Mitigation Program to help residents protect their homes from earthquake damage. Their Earthquake Brace + Bolt program provides homeowners up to $3,000 toward a retrofit, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 on average. “Californians who take the steps to retrofit their older house by registering and qualifying for an Earthquake Brace + Bolt grant, and then doing the work to strengthen their house before the next damaging earthquake, should not be penalized by being taxed on their incentive grant,” said Glenn Pomeroy, CEO of CEA. As a senior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, Thompson introduced this bill to bring federal tax law into step with state policy. Currently, the federal government taxes residents on grants they receive too safeguard their homes from earthquakes. Thompson’s proposal would eliminate those taxes, giving homeowners greater incentives to take steps to protect their homes before a disaster. ###
03.22.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) joined Vice President Joe Biden and House Democrats in a press conference to highlight the impact and success of the Affordable Care Act. Seven years ago today, President Barack Obama signed the landmark healthcare bill into law, giving more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans access to the care they need and deserve. “As Republicans prepare to dismantle our healthcare system, it’s important to take stock of everything the ACA has given American families,” said Thompson. “Millions have gained health coverage when before it was always out of reach. Millions more no longer have to fear being denied or dropped from their plans because of a pre-existing condition. Healthcare is not a luxury, it is a right. The success of the ACA and the widespread support I have seen in our district and across the nation proves that. I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to listen to the folks back home who don’t want to—and shouldn’t have to—lose the coverage they’ve worked hard for.” Tomorrow, the Republicans are poised to introduce their ACA repeal bill in the House. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated it will cost 14 million Americans their healthcare next year—and 24 million their coverage by 2026. After the so-called “manager’s amendment” was passed Monday, those numbers are projected to get worse. As a senior member of the Health Subcommittee, Thompson previously tried to amend the Republican bill during a 17 hour markup to protect the markets California and other states have built. Unfortunately, Republicans did not entertain any bipartisan amendments. ###
03.21.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) called for improvements to low-income housing tax credits, which encourage property owners and private investors to invest in affordable housing. Tax credits are awarded to developers, who then use them for affordable housing projects that otherwise would not be profitable because of low rents. Thompson cosponsored the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act of 2017, which reforms these credits to increase access to affordable housing. “A roof over your head is a basic right, and no one should have to make do without one,” said Thompson. “Low-income housing tax credits are one of the most important tools we have to encourage developers and property owners to offer affordable housing. In areas with high costs of living, it can be all too easy for landlords to keep raising rents. These credits allow them to keep rents affordable, and the improvements we’re making will help more hardworking families in our district find a place to live.” Low-income housing tax credits have helped finance more than 7,000 units in California’s 5th District since they were first created in 1986. The bill has been referred to the Committee on Ways and Means, of which Thompson is a senior member. ###
03.16.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05)—senior Member on the House Tax Subcommittee—released the following statement on the President’s budget for fiscal year 2018: “American families deserve a budget that prioritizes their health, safety, and well-being. Unfortunately, the President’s budget outline slashes funding for medical research, affordable housing, infrastructure, disaster relief, and so much more. “Our roads, bridges, and transit systems are not Democratic or Republican. They are American, and traditionally we have all come together to put Americans back to work by funding much needed repairs. Instead—as our infrastructure continues to crumble—the President proposed eliminating a Transportation Department that provides almost $500 million in road projects. “Likewise, cancer, ALS, and other severe illnesses don’t discriminate based on party. That’s why we all have a responsibility to fund life-saving medical research. Even Newt Gingrich has called for robust funding of the National Institutes of Health. Instead, the President slashed its budget by nearly 20 percent. “This proposal is narrow-minded and misguided. The President’s budget would kill jobs at the EPA, hamstring our ability to negotiate overseas, and cut countless critical agencies. In return, billions of taxpayer dollars would go towards a pointless border wall. We can and should do better.” The President’s budget outline includes proposals to: Cut funding at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by 30 percent, eliminating 50 programs and 3,200 jobs Eliminate $35 million for Section 4 Affordable Housing Cut funding at the State Department by 29 percent Cut funding at the National Institutes of Health by nearly 20 percent Cut $667 million from FEMA pre-disaster mitigation programs Eliminate the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program Eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (PBS) Direct $4.3 billion towards building a border wall ###
03.16.2017	Washington – Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Anna Eshoo (CA-18) reintroduced the Fair Access to Health Care Act, legislation to expand the eligibility for premium tax credits for people living in high-cost areas who purchase health insurance through the federal and state exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “No one should have to go without the healthcare they need," said Thompson. "The ACA has been tremendously helpful for many working families, but some hardworking Americans in particularly high-cost areas still struggle to afford health insurance. They shouldn’t be left behind. I’m proud to work with Rep. Eshoo to help more Americans get the care they need." “The ACA has been successful in helping lower income Americans buy private health insurance with subsidies adjusted to their income level,” Eshoo said. “While this is tremendously helpful to millions of individuals and families, there are others in high-cost areas who cannot benefit because the threshold to qualify for subsidies does not account for the high cost of living.” Eshoo continued, “The Fair Access to Health Care Act ties health insurance subsidies to the cost of living of a geographic area instead of to the national federal poverty level. In doing so, we can improve the ACA by expanding access to health insurance, help the middle class and improve our nation’s health." Currently the ACA allows those making between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to qualify for premium tax credits to help them purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. At this level, an individual making up to $45,960 and a family of four making up to $94,200 qualify for premium tax credits. However, the income threshold used to determine eligibility for these tax credits doesn’t take into account the cost of living for different geographic areas. A family living in New York City or San Francisco is treated the same as a family living in areas with a lower cost of living. The Fair Access to Health Care Act would allow the premium tax credits offered through the ACA to be increased proportionally based on an area’s cost of living. ###
03.13.2017	Washington – Today, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its official score of the Republicans’ Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal. According to their analysis, 24 million Americans could lose their health insurance by 2026 if the Republicans push forward with their reckless repeal. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: “The President and Republican leadership would rip healthcare away from hardworking families and seniors in order to give tax cuts to billionaires and big corporations. It’s extremely telling that the very first section in their bill does not address rising out-of-pocket costs, access to doctors, or any of the challenges real Americans face. Instead, it gives a big tax cut to insurance companies that pay their executives multimillion dollar salaries. “The CBO’s report makes it clear that gutting our healthcare system will not bring prices down or help more Americans afford insurance. Instead, it will snatch coverage away from those who need it the most. More Americans will be forced to go without healthcare—or rely on emergency services in a time of crisis. If they can’t afford the bills, American taxpayers will have to pick up the costs—all so big businesses can get tax cuts on their bonuses. This isn’t healthcare. It’s wealth care.” According to the CBO, 14 million would lose their health coverage in the next year under the GOP’s repeal. That number would rise to 21 million in 2020 and 24 million by 2026. The full CBO report can be found online here: https://mikethompson.house.gov/sites/mikethompson.house.gov/files/CBOAmericanHealthCareAct.pdf. ###
03.10.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and nearly two hundred Democrats introduced a bill to prevent the President from banning refugees and Muslims from entering the country. Thompson is an original cosponsor of the Statue of Liberty Values Act 2.0 (SOLVE Act 2.0), which defunds the President’s Executive Order and states that it will have no effect. “The President’s Executive Order puts Americans at risk,” said Thompson. “By turning our backs on refugees and the most vulnerable families in the region, we risk undermining the coalitions we need to build in order to defeat ISIL and other threats. The President’s ban also plays into the hands of terrorist recruiters. “Our refugee vetting system is already as stringent and thorough as it gets. Claiming otherwise is completely disingenuous. As a nation of immigrants, we should not turn our backs on families and refugees simply seeking safety, shelter, and the American Dream.” Thompson also co-sponsored the original SOLVE Act, which opposed the first iteration of the President’s refugee ban. ###
03.09.2017	Washington – Today, Republicans pushed their Affordable Care Act (ACA) repeal bill through the Committee on Ways and Means without proper review from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Outside estimates have projected that a repeal of the ACA would result in roughly 3 million jobs lost--including nearly 350,000 in California--and millions more Americans losing their health insurance while also adding more than $600 billion to the national debt. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement against the bill: “Many Americans are still just getting back on their feet after the financial crisis of 2008,” said Thompson. “The last thing they need is for Congress to pull the rug out from under them, but that's what this bill does. Rather than focus on putting Americans back to work, it gives billionaires and big corporations generous tax breaks. This is a misguided and reckless policy that will hurt our job market, reduce access to healthcare, and make Americans pay more for less. I will continue to fight for the hardworking families across our community and throughout the country who've worked hard, played by the rules, and deserve access to affordable healthcare." The Committee's markup lasted more than 17 hours, during which time they rejected every Democratic amendment to safeguard consumer protections. ###
03.08.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced an amendment at the Committee on Ways and Means to allow states to keep their existing healthcare system rather than repeal it. It would provide states the option to retain their existing marketplaces, benefit protections, and cost sharing and premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Republicans rejected the proposal. “If the Republicans want to insist their plan will give Americans more choices, then they should allow them the choice to keep the healthcare and tax credits they already have,” said Thompson. “In California, our state exchange has enrolled nearly 1.5 million people and saved consumers more than $300 million in premiums. It’s working well—in sharp contrast to the estimates we’ve seen about the Republicans’ bill. Repealing would cause families to lose their healthcare, devastate the job market, and could force steep hikes in many premiums. I am disappointed that Republicans—despite promises about choice, flexibility, and state’s rights—would not give states the option to keep the stable, healthy marketplaces they have already built." In his written testimony to the Committee, Peter V. Lee, Executive Director of Covered California, said, “the Affordable Care Act is working and we at Covered California have built a sustainable and competitive marketplace. In addition to our 1.4 million consumers, approximately 900,000 Californians who do not get subsidies benefit from the lower rates, protections and the more consumer-centric competitive marketplace that we foster.” “The ACA and Medicaid program are essential to the mission of the community health centers, and by extension, the health of local communities. They ensure access to care for the vulnerable people and communities we serve,” said Redwood Community Health Coalition (RCHC). RCHC is a coalition of 17 community health centers and clinics in Marin, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo Counties, including Ole Health, Sonoma Valley Community Health Center, and Santa Rosa Community Health Centers. ###
03.06.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement about the President’s executive order banning Muslims and refugees from entering the United States: “This newest ban is just as dangerous and reckless as the original. Barring refugees and turning our back on the most vulnerable among us makes it significantly harder to form the sort of coalitions necessary to defeat ISIL. In fact, this order will likely be a prime recruitment tool for terrorists. The President says he wants to keep Americans safe, but his actions put us all in considerable jeopardy.” Thompson previously spoke against the President’s first iteration of the travel ban, and signed an amicus brief in Darweesh, et. Al. v. Trump challenging its legality. ###
03.02.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) introduced a bipartisan resolution honoring March as Women’s History Month—the origins of which are rooted in California’s Fifth Congressional District. “For too long, the impact and contributions of women were minimized and ignored,” said Thompson. “It took the Education Taskforce in Sonoma County launching a Women’s History Week in March of 1978 to begin a national conversation about the role women have played in shaping America and the world. Schools and communities across the nation joined in the commemoration, and it has grown and expanded since then. In March—as we should throughout the year—we recognize the women who have made breakthroughs in science and medicine, the leaders who shaped our government and politics, the businesswomen and entrepreneurs who drove innovation, and the countless women who changed the course of history in numerous ways.” Last month, Thompson’s office opened nominations for his annual Woman of the Year Awards, which recognizes exceptional women across the District for their work in the community. Winners will be announced at a ceremony later this month. Additional details will follow. ###
02.28.2017	Washington – Tonight, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement after the President’s address to a Joint Session of Congress: “It is one thing to say you want to invest in Americans, it is another thing entirely to actually do it. Once again, tonight’s address showed the sharp divide between the President’s words and his actions. He spoke of draining the swamp and tackling corruption, but his administration is mired in scandals and appears troublingly close to Russia. He says our healthcare system is a disaster, but that we should care for those with pre-existing conditions and support those who need help affording coverage through tax credits—two principles of the very system he wants to dismantle. He at long last condemned the threats against our Jewish communities, but he continues to employ Steve Bannon and others who promote white nationalism and anti-Semitism. “Giving rousing speeches is the easy part. Drafting policies, paying for them, and taking action is difficult. The American public cannot be fooled by soaring rhetoric. They want—and deserve—results. So far, the Administration has delivered only chaos, conflicting viewpoints, and hints of corruption. “I wanted very much to see the new side of the President that we were all promised. I hoped he would make overtures to the millions of Americans he has alienated with his Muslim bans, deportation squads, and border wall. Unfortunately, we heard much the same speech he has delivered since the stump. “The President was right about one thing: Americans are capable of great achievements. But we need real policies, real proposals, not campaign slogans and alternative facts.” ###
02.27.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) denounced rising anti-Semitism sentiments, exemplified by multiple bomb threats against Jewish Community Centers and schools as well as vandalism in Jewish cemeteries. “These threats must stop,” said Thompson. “I commend the authorities for acting swiftly and decisively to investigate each incident, but I am deeply alarmed by the rising level of anti-Semitism in the country. That is why I joined over 150 of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in calling on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Attorney General, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to treat every incident seriously and take immediate action against those who wish harm on the Jewish community. Hatred of any kind cannot be tolerated.” The full text of the letter can be found at https://mikethompson.house.gov/sites/mikethompson.house.gov/files/2.22.17final_joint.pdf or below: February 22, 2017 The Honorable John F. Kelly Secretary U.S. Department of Homeland Security 3801 Nebraska Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20016 The Honorable Jeff Sessions Attorney General U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530 The Honorable James B. Comey Director Federal Bureau of Investigation 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20535 Dear Secretary Kelly, Attorney General Sessions, and Director Comey, We write to express our deep concern regarding the recent spate of anonymous bomb threats made via telephone against Jewish Community Centers (JCCs) across the nation. We urge the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice to swiftly assess the situation and to advise Congress on what specific steps are being taken, or will be taken, to deter such threats from being made, to identify and prosecute the perpetrators for violations of federal criminal laws, and to enable JCCs to enhance security measures such as physical barriers and guards, in the event that an individual seeks to act upon these threats. This is not an idle concern, given that there have been at least three casualty-causing attacks at JCCs or other Jewish institutions in the last two decades-in 2014 at a Kansas JCC, in 2006 at the Jewish Federation of Seattle, and in 1999 at a California JCC. This is a national problem and, as such, it requires a national solution. In the first two months of 2017 alone, there have been 68 incidents targeting 53 JCCs in 26 states, according to JCC Association of North America. A number of JCCs, such as the Roth Family Jewish Community Center of Greater Orlando, have received multiple threats. These phone calls have an immediate emotional impact, of course, but they also have an economic impact. JCCs provide a range of educational and community services for Jewish and non-Jewish individuals and families, with a particular focus on children and youth. The individuals who make these calls no doubt recognize that bomb threats, particularly when repeated, can compromise and even destroy a JCC's financial future. We urge you to approach this issue with a sense of urgency, and to work in partnership with state and territory governments, local law enforcement officials, JCC Association of North America, individual JCCs, and Jewish community institutions and leaders to address the threat in a holistic manner. We look forward to your response regarding the specific steps being taken to prevent and respond to this threat. Sincerely, ###
02.25.2017	Santa Rosa, CA – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and CA Sen. Mike McGuire spoke with more than 1,000 attendees at a Healthcare Town Hall at Piner High School. As the President and Congressional Republicans move forward with their plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (ACA), constituents in Santa Rosa voiced their concerns and defended their right to access healthcare. Watch the full town hall at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJH_T15JBV8 “More than 20 million Americans have gained health coverage since we passed the ACA—and many of them have made it clear they don’t want to lose it,” said Thompson. “Hearing from my constituents directly and sharing their stories with my colleagues back in Washington is a powerful tool to push back against the worst proposals. Gutting our healthcare system will have real impacts on real people. I want to thank Sen. McGuire and all the lawmakers who joined us for everything they’re doing to protect healthcare in our state. We have a tough battle ahead of us, but I’m committed to fighting for the rights we all deserve.” "President Trump is wrong," said McGuire. "The Affordable Care Act is not failing, its very popular and working beyond expectations in California. We need to do whatever we can to save the ACA now – and then we need to take the next steps of exploration to fund a Single Payer system. We need to acknowledge that access to affordable care is a basic human right – and we cannot afford to continue down a path of haves and have nots when it comes to caring for our family, our friends, our neighbors. We are lucky to have great representatives in Congress who are working to make this happen." On Friday, a draft of the Republican proposal to repeal the ACA was leaked to Politico. It would cause premiums to rise—especially for seniors—and would likely result in a loss of coverage for millions. Other lawmakers at the meeting included: CA Sens. Ed Hernandez and Bill Dodd and CA Assemblymembers Jim Wood, Marc Levine, and Cecilia Aguiar-Curry. Hernandez and Wood chair the Health Committees in their respective chambers. Expert panelists included: Deborah Kelch Executive Director, Insure the Uninsured Project Mary Szecsey, Executive Director, West County Health Centers Chris Manson, Regonal Director, St Joseph Health, Northern California Connie Barker, a homecare worker who will tell her ACA story Dr. Nina Weiler-Harwell, AARP California Associate State Director ###
02.24.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced Chief Andrew Bidou of the Vallejo Police Department will be his guest for the President’s upcoming address to a Joint Session of Congress. “Chief Bidou has been an outstanding leader in our community,” said Thompson. “He and other law enforcement officers risk their lives to keep us safe. As the President and Republican leadership continue to push policies that would undermine the safety of our first responders, I wanted to make it clear that I stand with those who put their lives on the line every day.” “I am honored to be Congressman Thompson's guest to the President's address to the joint Session of Congress,” said Chief Bidou. “Congressman Thompson works so hard for the people of his district and he is a steadfast supporter of law enforcement. I stand with him in protecting second amendment rights while advocating common sense gun regulations that protect our first responders and community.” Thompson, Bidou, and other Members of Congress and law enforcement officers will be holding a press conference in advance of the President’s address to discuss the dangers of deregulating silencers and mandatory concealed carry reciprocity. Further details on the press event to follow. ###
02.24.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement on the President’s remarks about our nuclear arsenal: “Nuclear non-proliferation is not a ‘bad deal,’ and the United States is already at the top of the pack when it comes to our arsenal. Expanding our nuclear capabilities—or even simply suggesting it—could kick start a new arms race and make us all considerably less safe. Once again, the President has demonstrated a troubling lack of understanding when it comes to our military capabilities and decades of foreign policy. As a former member of the Intelligence Committee, I know for a fact that we already have the strongest nuclear forces in the world, not to mention conventional forces. The President needs to realize that his remarks are no longer meant to gin up support on the campaign trail. They have real—and potentially disastrous—consequences for the entire country.” ###
02.22.2017	Washington - Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) led a group of 41 lawmakers in urging the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to cease displaying the word "Police" on jackets and vests during enforcement operations. "This is a matter of public safety," said Thompson. "Suggesting ICE officers are members of local law enforcement undermines the relationships immigrant communities have established with police departments. Crimes may go unreported because victims fear they or their loved ones could be reported to immigration officials. Witnesses may not come forward for fear of being reported. This weakens public safety, and undercuts local law enforcement." Thompson led this initiative after representatives from local police and sheriff's departments voiced their concerns about ICE's practices. The full text of the letter can be found here and below: The Honorable John F. Kelly Secretary of Homeland Security Washington, D.C. 20528 Dear Secretary Kelly: We are writing regarding the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) practice of displaying the word “Police” on jackets and vests during immigration enforcement operations. Local law enforcement in our Congressional districts have expressed serious concerns that this practice causes confusion and undermines their officers’ efforts to build trust in our immigrant communities. We respectfully urge you to direct ICE to remove the word “Police” from all ICE gear. Other federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigations, simply display the agency name or abbreviation on gear without adding “Police.” However, pictures currently posted to the ICE website demonstrate that ICE does not follow this common practice – vests and jackets worn by ICE officers display the word “POLICE” in capital letters above “ICE.” This is a public safety issue. Undermining the relationships law local enforcement has built with immigrant communities prevents them from effectively policing. Crimes may go unreported because victims fear their immigration status may be reported to immigration officials. Witnesses may not come forward out of fear of being deported. This weakens public safety and undercuts local law enforcement. We urge you to direct ICE to immediately remove the word “Police” from all ICE gear. Thank you for your attention in this matter. Sincerely, The Undersigned
02.16.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) voted against a proposal that would allow states to pull funding from Planned Parenthood and other community health centers that offer reproductive health services. “Millions of women rely on Planned Parenthood and similar clinics for birth control, mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, and so much more,” said Thompson. “Stripping them of funding because they also offer comprehensive reproductive health care will put countless of our most vulnerable women at risk. These women are often low-income and have few options when it comes to their healthcare, and Planned Parenthood relies on public funds to provide them with care. This is a callous and purely political move that puts women and families at risk.” H.J. Res 43 would provide congressional disapproval of a rule passed under the Obama Administration ensuring Title X funding for health centers that offer comprehensive reproductive services. Clinics like Planned Parenthood are already barred from using public funds for abortion services, so the funding received under Title X goes to preventative health services and other treatments. ###
02.15.2017	Napa, CA – Nominations are now open for Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-05) annual Woman of the Year Awards. Each year, in honor of National Women’s History Month, Thompson recognizes exceptional women across California’s Fifth Congressional District for the work they do in our community. Past recipients have been philanthropists, business leaders, educators, public servants, and more. “Throughout history, women have made tremendous impacts in science, industry, government, the arts, and every other facet of our society,” said Thompson. “But too often, their accomplishments and achievements have not received the recognition they deserve. That changes with us. It’s my privilege to accept nominations for our Woman of the Year Awards. If you know a woman who’s made an impact in our district, please let us know. I look forward to recognizing all our winners next month.” All nominations must be received by February 26, 2017. Completed forms can be emailed to CA05.Nominations@mail.house.gov. Winners will be announced at a public ceremony in March. Nomination forms and additional information can be found online at https://mikethompson.house.gov/woman-of-the-year. ###
02.14.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement commending the confirmation of David Shulkin for Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs: “I had the pleasure of working with Dr. Shulkin to expand access to service dogs for veterans with PTSD. During that time, I found him hardworking and capable—and completely devoted to improving the health and well-being of our veterans. Clearly the Senate agreed, as their unanimous vote to confirm him shows. As a veteran myself and Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus, I look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin to continue improving the care and services at the VA.” Dr. Shulkin has been the top health official at the VA since 2015. ###
02.14.2017	Washington – Following the resignation of Michael Flynn as National Security Advisor, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: “Michael Flynn’s resignation is only a chapter in this story, not the end. His ties with Russia remain an ongoing concern. He cannot be a sacrificial lamb for an administration that has already displayed a troubling closeness with the Kremlin. We must continue the investigation into Flynn’s communications with the Russian ambassador. The safety and security of Americans depends on it.” ###
02.03.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) cosponsored two bills to protect the rights of immigrants. The DREAMers, Immigrants, and Refugees (DIRe) Legal Aid Act would provide help the most vulnerable among us get legal assistance should they face detention or deportation. As we saw this weekend, hasty executive orders can leave even documented immigrants at risk. Thompson also joined the Build Bridges Not Walls Act to block the President’s order to build an expensive, insulting, and ultimately futile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. “We are a nation of immigrants, and we must uphold the values and principles that inspire so many to seek out their own American Dream,” said Thompson. “Throughout this week, my office helped constituents who had been affected by the President’s executive order. Thankfully, a husband and wife who were stranded in Nairobi made it home safe after I worked with federal agencies on their behalf. “Clearly we must take steps to protect those who are simply hoping to build their lives here in America. For many DREAMers, America is the only home they know. Deporting them would be cruel and unnecessary. While ‘Build That Wall,’ might have worked as a campaign slogan, it fails as public policy. It would bleed the middle class of their tax dollars without doing a thing to fix the real problems. I am proud to cosponsor these measures to protect immigrants, and I look forward to the day when we can work on actual, bipartisan immigration reform.” ###
02.02.2017	Washington – Today, Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05) of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force forcefully spoke against H.J. Res. 40, which would undermine the background check system for firearm purchases by prohibiting the Social Security Administration (SSA) from reporting the names of beneficiaries who cannot responsibly own a firearm to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), passage of this resolution would prevent the SSA from passing a substantially similar rule in the future—barring the agency from being able to report those who should not have firearms to the NICS background system indefinitely. Click above to watch Rep. Thompson’s full remarks or visit: https://youtu.be/xlRXZe_v0oI “I am a gun owner and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, but this resolution is not about denying the right to own a gun—it is about upholding the law. And the law is very clear about who should be reported to the NICS background system. This law was passed more than a decade ago to keep guns from those who cannot responsibly own them. … “Passage of this resolution would put Americans at risk. It would prevent the SSA from reporting the names of those who should not have a gun—indefinitely. If there are concerns about this rule, we can revise it. But the CRA process is not a revision. It would ban the SSA from even trying to fix the rule. This is a dangerous overstep, and I urge every Member to consider the safety of our districts. No one wants another Virginia Tech. No one wants another Newtown.” The SSA regulation complies with the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, which requires federal agencies to submit the records of individuals prohibited from possessing a firearm under existing federal law to NICS. The regulation states that the SSA will only report individuals who meet both of the following criteria: They have a very severe, long-term, mental disorder that prevents them from holding any kind of job—even part-time or below the minimum wage. Legal, medical, and lay evidence have indicated they are not capable of managing their own benefits. ###
01.31.2017	Washington – Today, the President announced his nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: “As our country faces significant challenges from gun violence to access to healthcare, we must have a Supreme Court that reflects the values and ethics of the American people. I am deeply concerned that Judge Gorsuch is out of step with our country. “His opinions have empowered employers like Hobby Lobby to deny workers access to reproductive healthcare. He has also weakened laws aimed at reducing gun violence—even in the wake of mass shootings. This is not a pick meant to bring the country together or soothe fears that our basic rights are being eroded. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to oppose this nomination and insist the President put forward a candidate that truly reflects our morals as a nation.” Gorsuch is considered a staunch conservative who is even further right than the late Justice Scalia on a number of topics, including the legal precedent that requires courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous wording in broad statutes. ###
01.30.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) urged his colleagues in the Senate to reject the President’s choice of Betsy DeVos for Secretary of the Department of Education. “Throughout her testimony, Ms. DeVos displayed a troubling failure to grasp even the basics of education policy,” said Thompson. “Last year, Congress came together to make bipartisan, bicameral reforms to our education system. It would be tragic to see those efforts undermined or undone completely by someone so plainly unqualified for the job. We hold our students to standards before giving them a passing grade. We should do no differently for our Education Secretary. I urge the Senate to reject Ms. DeVos and insist the President nominate someone up to the task.” DeVos has no professional experience in education. Her advocacy work has often undermined the very public schools she would represent as Secretary. During her testimony, she also appeared unaware of the differences between measuring growth versus measuring proficiency—a question that has dominated education policy for decades. ###
01.30.2017	Washington – Today Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) cosponsored a bill to overturn and defund the President’s executive orders banning refugees and those from Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States. “These bans are not just anti-Muslim, they are anti-American,” said Thompson. “Barring refugees or members of any religion runs counter to our country’s principles, values, and history. I stand in strong opposition, and will do everything in my power to see they are reversed. “I had the deep privilege of working with a refugee from Afghanistan. He put his life on the line serving as a translator for our troops, and later worked as an intern in my office. I am better for having known him, and our country is better for having opened its doors to him. This is the America we must protect—not one that would let hate and fear govern its policies.” Thompson is the cosponsor of the Statue of Liberty Value (SOLVE) Act, which would defund the President’s executive order and establish that it has no value. ###
01.27.2017	Washington – Today, the White House announced it was ending outreach on enrolling in health insurance through HealthCare.gov. Open enrollment lasts through January 31st, and has traditionally been a time when interest in coverage surges. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: “It is irresponsible to try to keep Americans in the dark about enrolling in health insurance. Regardless of whether the President wants to repeal the ACA, it remains in place. Americans have a right to know when open enrollment ends and how they can get coverage before the deadline. To pull the plug on outreach we have already paid for is both a waste of money and a callous disregard for men, women, and families in need of healthcare.” In the three years since the marketplaces launched, the final day of enrollment has been the second-biggest day of enrollment—topped only by December 31st, the deadline for people seeking coverage effective January 1st. The last week of January traditionally draws younger enrollees, who often wait until the last minute to sign up. For this reason, HHS had planned a major advertising campaign specifically aimed at younger adults—which is now being halted. A drop in younger enrollees could result in the risk pools in the Marketplaces being less healthy, driving up future premiums. As of December 24th, more than 11.5 million people nationwide had signed up for 2017 federal marketplace plans, an increase from 2016. In California, outreach and marketing is coordinated through Covered California, and will continue as planned. Since enrollment opened in November, 1.3 million people have renewed coverage in California, and over 300,000 have signed up for the very first time.

01.26.2017	Washington - Today the President signed an executive action to force American taxpayers to pay for a wall along the Mexico border. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement: "The time for campaign slogans has past; the time for comprehensive solutions is upon us," said Thompson. "The President's border wall is a profound waste of taxpayer money, and it does not address the real problems in our immigration system. Democrats and Republicans have come up with bipartisan solutions before. I hope we can do so again, rather than waste time and money on fulfilling a misguided campaign slogan." Experts have estimated that the President's border wall would cost American taxpayers between $8 - 25 billion. ###
01.23.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) denounced the President’s executive action to reinstate the global gag rule. This rule prevents the United States from providing aid to foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that engage in abortion services or advocacy with non-U.S. funds, depriving vulnerable women across the world of access to critical medical services. Currently, these NGOs run HIV/AIDS clinics, offer birth-control, and provide counseling services to women—many of whom are victims of violence, rape, and other horrors. “It is shameful that after millions of women worldwide took to the streets to voice their concerns, the President would ignore the will of the people and reinstate this harmful rule,” said Thompson. “Women are suffering the ravages of violence and disease across the world. Denying them access to medical care is needlessly cruel, and to do so immediately on the heels of the 44th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade just adds salt to the wound.” ###
01.23.2017	Washington – Today, Congressional Wine Caucus Co-Chair Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) applauded a new trade enforcement action to ensure both imported and local wines have equal access to grocery store shelves in Canada. Currently in British Columbia, only wines produced in the province can be sold on grocery store shelves. This week, the United States challenged that regulation for discriminating against U.S. wine producers. “Our American wineries make some of the best wines in the world, and denying them access to grocery stores in British Columbia not only hinders the growth of our entrepreneurs, but denies Canadians access to our products,” said Thompson. “It is encouraging that British Columbia wants to open grocery stores as a new distribution channel for wine, but as a member of the WTO, any expansion must include products from around the world. Any trade partnership must be based on a level playing field where everyone has a chance to grow their economy—including American winemakers.” Under the WTO dispute settlement process, the U.S. and Canada undergo consultations to resolve this complaint. If a mutually-agreed upon solution cannot be reached during the consultation period, the U.S. may request a dispute settlement panel to examine the matter.

01.13.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) voted against S.Con.Res.3, a budget resolution that begins the process to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “Today the Republican Majority in the House looked a lot like the dog that caught the bus as they took the first step in their campaign promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act,” said Thompson. “I do not believe they have fully thought this through. “Thirty million people could lose their health coverage. Protections for pre-existing conditions will evaporate. Children will no longer be able to stay on their parents’ insurance policies. Three million jobs across the country are at risk. Hospitals will lose the resources and funding they need to keep our families healthy. California hospitals stand to lose over $14 billion, and my district alone would lose roughly $343 million. It is clear this slash and burn approach will cost Americans dearly.” ###
01.13.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) spoke on the House floor in defense of the Affordable Care Act. Click the image to watch Rep. Thompson’s full remarks or visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxBA9shvJds “For seven years, all we’ve heard from Republicans regarding healthcare is repeal and replace. After seven years and more than sixty votes, they still have not come up with the replace. This isn’t just a talking point. This is literally a matter of life and death for people—like Raymond from Napa in my District, who was diagnosed with stage 3 renal cancer in 1996. “His premiums rose year after year until we passed the ACA. Before the ACA, Raymond worried about losing his insurance because of his pre-existing condition. In fact, his cancer returned in 2014. Thanks to the ACA, he got the treatment he needed. “What are Republicans going to do for Raymond if they repeal the ACA and his premiums go up? Or his insurance drops him because he had cancer over 20 years ago? Or he hits his lifetime cap on coverage? Republicans need to ask themselves if they’re willing to return Americans like Raymond to a time when the care they needed was always beyond their grasp.” ###
01.12.2017	Washington – Yesterday, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) won a spot on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. The subcommittee has jurisdiction over healthcare, health delivery systems, and health research. “With Republicans primed to gut health coverage for millions of Americans, it is more important than ever to stand up and speak out for those at risk of losing everything,” said Thompson. “My district has spoken loud and clear. Those with pre-existing conditions like cancer or Type 1 Diabetes are scared of returning to a time when they could lose healthcare right when they need it the most. Others who had exceeded the former lifetime caps worry they will once against have to choose between buying groceries or staying healthy. I am honored by this appointment to the Subcommittee on Health, and I will fight for my constituents and all Americans against reckless plans to dismantle their healthcare.” ###
01.11.2017	Washington – Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05), Jerry McNerney (CA-11), and Doris Matsui (CA-06) reacted to the Secretarial Order from outgoing Interior Secretary Sally Jewell that outlines actions for the next administration to take to address the effects of drought and climate change on California's water supply and listed species. The order provides a timeline and directions to the new administration for the construction of the WaterFix tunnels: “The proposed WaterFix tunnels threaten to decimate the Delta’s ecosystem, destroy thousands of jobs, and risk the livelihoods of countless Californians. We were deeply disappointed to see Secretary Jewell and the Obama administration make this a priority despite repeated assurances that they did not support this project. The tunnels are a narrow-minded approach that will do great harm to the Delta region, and should not become a top-priority for the next administration.” ###
01.04.2017	Washington – Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) applauded the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s approval of Globalstar's modified plan to establish a new wireless network. A previous Globalstar proposal may have interrupted Bluetooth and wireless devices using the same bandwidth, including hearing aids. The amended plan will significantly lessen the potential for interference, ensuring individuals with hearing loss can use the wireless features of their hearing devices without interruption. “I commend the FCC and Globalstar for recognizing that Americans with hearing loss should not have to face a disruption in their hearing devices,” said Thompson. “Innovation drives our economy, but it should not come at the expense of the health and well-being of the public. This modified plan is a strong compromise to allow the development of new technology without posing a risk to Americans with hearing impairments.” Andrew Bopp, Executive Director of Hearing Industries Association, noted that rapid advances in wireless technology have enabled people with hearing loss to connect directly through their hearing aids to the telephone, music players, television and other devices. He adds that “HIA deeply appreciates the efforts of Rep. Thompson to insure that new interference issues do not emerge to prevent people from accessing these features.” As Co-Chair of the Congressional Hearing Caucus, Rep. Thompson sent a letter to Chairman Tom Wheeler of the FCC in April of 2016, expressing concerns about the impact Globalstar's previous proposal may have had on people with hearing loss. In his letter, Rep. Thompson requested that the FCC verify that any proposals would not harm the availability of Bluetooth or similar features for hearing assistance devices. Furthermore, Rep. Thompson called for testing of the proposed technology to determine its viability. ###

12.08.2016	Washington, D.C. –U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement today in response to the inclusion of a controversial California water provision in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act (WIIN). “This misguided provision threatens aid to Flint and billions of dollars for projects across our country, all to satisfy thirsty agriculture interests in California’s Central Valley. It is opposed by the White House, and Members of the Delta delegation in Congress. Even our Senators do not agree on whether this is best for California. The blind disregard for facts and expert feedback by the sponsors of this measure is downright dangerous. “The provision would pump more water south from the Delta in violation of bedrock conservation laws, setting a terrible precedent for environmental protections nationwide. Approval of this bill is an implicit vote against the Endangered Species Act. “Notwithstanding the much-needed funding for critical infrastructure in this title, I have serious concerns about the advantages given to certain construction projects without proper oversight. Furthermore, this leaves the door open for federal funding of California’s controversial Delta tunnels proposal. The bill would kill thousands of jobs across our state and the Pacific Northwest, all for the empty promise of funding from Republican-controlled spending committees. “Should this pass, not only would our district, Delta and North of Delta agriculture, and salmon habitats of California suffer, but Republicans have provided on-the-record assurance that they’re not finished -- this is just a preview of the catastrophic environmental policy to come. Now is not the time to undermine the protections for communities and ecosystems that Congress has fought to protect, it’s the time to stand strong and support them. “The provision should be removed from the WIIN bill to ensure passage of the underlying bipartisan package, so we can finally authorize infrastructure projects and the long-overdue aid to residents of lead-poisoned Flint, Michigan, without jeopardizing the water supply of millions of Californians.”
12.06.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement today in advance of the 75th anniversary of the attack on the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. “Seventy five years ago today more than 2,400 brave Americans lost their lives in the devastating attack on the U.S. Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. Today, as we commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the ‘day that will live in infamy,’ let us remember all those who lost their lives and the families they left behind. Let us remember the more than 1,100 servicemen who were wounded in the attack, and all those who rushed to their aide. And let us never forget the incredible heroism shown by all on that terrible day. Our country owes a great deal of gratitude to our Greatest Generation. They faced one of the darkest days in our history with courage, strength and patriotism. They freed Europe and Asia from the grips of fascism and ended Hitler’s despotic reign of terror. And they returned home to build our great country. Our deepest and most heartfelt thanks goes out to them and their families, today and every day.” # # #
11.30.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, passed the House of Representatives today as a part of a larger bill, the 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 34), which combined a number of healthcare provisions. Thompson’s legislation would allow small employers to continue to offer Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or HRAs, as a benefit for their workforce. Employees can use the account to pay insurance premiums, or pay for qualified health expenses. The law gives small employers who are not obligated to offer health insurance a way to help employees purchase a quality, affordable health insurance plan that fits their individual budget and healthcare needs. The bill changes Treasury Department rules limiting the use of HRAs for small businesses. Thompson’s legislation was included in the bill text of the 21st Century Cures Act, a package of bipartisan, bicameral health provisions. The bills included in the package will improve our mental health system, provide funding for opioid abuse programs and strengthen the Medicare program for millions of beneficiaries. Further, the legislation will provide more than $4 billion in additional funding to the National Institutes of Health to support Vice President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot and other initiatives. Finally, the bill streamlines the Food and Drug Administration’s review of medical products to bring much-needed treatment to patients faster, while protecting the high standards of the drug and device approval processes. “By allowing small business owners to offer the support of an HRA, my bill will help small business owners who want to do right by their employees and offer health benefits despite not have the capacity to provide employer-sponsored coverage,” said Thompson. “My Small Business Healthcare Relief Act will make a big difference for hard-working folks across our country, and I’m proud to see my legislation included in the broader 21st Century Cures Act, which will help us make significant progress when it comes to keeping Americans healthy, and keeping America on the forefront of medical innovation.” "As a key driver of efforts to include HRAs in some type of year-end legislation, the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) was thrilled to see it added to the 21st Century Cures Act. We applaud Representatives Thompson and Boustany for championing this cause and pushing to get the bill approved," said NAHB Chairman Ed Brady, a home builder and developer from Bloomington, Ill. “This is a critical step in allowing small business owners to provide health care for their employees and protect employers against outrageous fines.” On September 13, 2013, The Department of Treasury issued guidance disallowing businesses from using HRA’s as a tax-free means to reimburse employees, stating these arrangements were disqualified under Affordable Care Act’s annual dollar cap. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act restores flexibility and choice into the marketplace by: Ensuring that small businesses are allowed to use pre-tax dollars to give employees a defined contribution. Allowing employees to use these funds as an HRA to purchase health coverage on the individual market, as well as for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses. Protecting small business employers from being unnecessarily financially penalized for providing this option to employees. The legislation is budget-neutral, meaning it won’t add a single dollar to our deficit. The bill is supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB), the National Association for the Self-Employed, and the Coalition for Affordable Healthcare (CAHC). The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act previously passed the House of Representatives in June as H.R. 5477. The 21st Century Cures Act now goes to the Senate for consideration and passage. ###
11.21.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson and Santa Rosa-based national non-profit Canine Companions for Independence held a press conference today at Canine Companions' Santa Rosa campus. The event highlighted the recent launch of a pilot program through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that offers service dog benefits to veterans with mental health diagnoses, including post-traumatic stress (PTS). In addition to Rep. Thompson, a veteran and Co-Chair of the bipartisan Military Veterans Caucus, CEO of Canine Companions Paul Mundell also spoke, as did Bay Area Navy veteran Randy Wight who brought along his Service Dog Neo. Following the speaking program, there was a live demonstration of the PTS service dogs' commands by Canine Companions professional trainer and Army veteran, Chelsey Darrow. At Rep. Thompson and Canine Companions' request, the VA launched a program that will pair 100 veterans who experience a mental health diagnosis that limits their mobility, including their ability to conduct normal social activities and navigate public spaces, with a highly trained assistance dog. Until now, the VA had only offered benefits for service dogs to veterans who experienced a physical disability, such as blindness, deafness and loss of limb. “I’ve seen firsthand the tremendous benefits service dogs provide for our veterans dealing with invisible wounds of war, like PTS and traumatic brain injuries, and I’m so glad that by hosting today’s event, others will be able to see those benefits firsthand too,” said Rep. Thompson. “I’ve been so proud to work with Canine Companions for Independence to make the service dog benefit available through the VA for veterans with mental health conditions, and to significantly reduce the time it takes for veterans to be paired with a service dog. Because I strongly believe that service dogs are not just changing lives, they’re saving lives among our veterans with PTS.” "The service dog pilot program will provide the opportunity for veterans with PTS to fully engage the numerous benefits of a highly trained assistance dog,” Canine Companions for Independence CEO Paul Mundell stated. “Thanks to Congressman Thompson and the VA for taking this important step.” “My Canine Companions Service Dog Neo picks up dropped items, opens and closes doors, can pull my wheelchair and helps me get up from the floor after exercising at the gym,” shares Navy veteran Randy Wight. "I can’t imagine life without Neo. He watches over me wherever I go, whatever I do. Neo is the perfect wingman, he has my back." # # #
11.04.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson awarded fellow Vietnam veteran Jeffery Spratt of Yountville with the medal he earned for his honorable service to our country. Though Mr. Spratt was awarded the Bronze Star, it was never recorded on his DD-214, the form used to verify military service, and was therefore not official. In addition, Mr. Spratt was awarded additional medals that were not recorded on his DD-214 and were never received. By working with the Napa County Veterans Service Office, specifically with Veterans Service Officer Patrick Jolly, Mr. Spratt was able to correct his DD-214 so that it accurately reflected the medals he was awarded. In addition to the Bronze Star, Mr. Spratt was awarded the Vietnam Service Medal with Four Stars, the Machine Gun – Expert Medal, and the Leadership Preparation School – Fort Ord, CA Medal. Mr. Spratt chose to have fellow Vietnam veteran Congressman Mike Thompson award his now-official Bronze Star publicly in order to raise awareness about the importance of making sure the DD-214 form is correct as it is used to not only verify medals that were awarded during a veteran’s service, but eligibility for benefits as well. The medal presentation was also intended to shed light on the Napa County Veteran Service Office and Thompson’s office, both of which can be an invaluable resource for veterans trying to correct any issues with their DD-214 or benefits in general. “It was a high honor to award my fellow Vietnam veteran Jeffrey Spratt with the medals he was awarded for his honorable service to our country,” said Thompson. “As Mr. Spratt’s experience makes clear, when it comes to making sure that your DD-214 is correct, our Veterans Service Officers are an invaluable resource. It’s my hope that Mr. Spratt’s story will encourage others to look into their DD-214 and contact our Veterans Service Officers – or my Napa Office – for help.” “People like Patrick Jolly, our own Napa Valley Veterans Service Officer, has spent countless hours devoting time and energy to see that we veterans are entitled to what is deserved and provided by the Veterans Administration,” said Jeffrey Spratt. “The sad commentary is that even today many vets are not aware of their benefits and for whatever reason will not come forward or do not know how to. Many give up once they are turned away, but Patrick Jolly and his staff are there to help you fight again for what you deserve. In the case of my award the Bronze Star, Patrick Jolly discovered it wasn't even recorded, so after 50 years here's the acknowledgement. Fellow veterans, and friends and family of our veterans: contact your local advocate and get started today.” # # #

10.26.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Co- Chair of the House Military Veterans Caucus, led his bipartisan Co-Chairs in sending a letter to Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning asking him to grant an exception to the requirement that current and former service members who enlisted in the National Guard between 2006 and 2008 repay unauthorized bonuses. “It’s wrong to require service members and veterans to repay enlistment bonuses that were issued in error,” said Thompson. “The brave men and women who serve our country in uniform shouldn’t be the ones paying the price for others’ mistakes. Given that the Secretary of the Army has the authority to grant an exception to these repayment requirements, he should do so without further delay. As a veteran myself, I won’t stop fighting until this egregious situation is resolved and these debts are forgiven.” The Secretary of the Army has the authority under law to grant an exception to repayment requirements if the repayment is determined to be “against equity and good conscience, or would be contrary to the best interest of the United States.” The letter asks the Secretary to grant an exception on these grounds given the length of time since the bonuses were awarded and the misleading tactics used by the California National Guard, and others, during this period. Thompson, himself a veteran, was appalled to learn that thousands of current and former soldiers in the Army National Guard, including 9,700 in California alone, are being asked to repay enlistment bonuses they were awarded eight to ten years ago. Upon learning of this unacceptable situation, Thompson immediately took action to help his fellow veterans find relief from this unfair financial burden. In addition to Thompson, the letter was signed by Representative Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), Thomas J. Rooney (R-FL) and Collin Peterson (D-MN). The full text of the letter is copied below. Dear Secretary Fanning, As co-chairs of the House Military Veterans Caucus, we were appalled to learn that thousands of current and former soldiers in the Army National Guard are being asked to repay bonuses they were awarded when they enlisted eight to ten years ago. We understand that these unauthorized bonuses were particularly common within the California National Guard, which is in the process of attempting to recoup bonuses from 9,700 current and former members of the Guard. The men and women who bravely signed up to serve their country should not be punished because recruiting and retention officials and their supervisors made mistakes and used misleading language in their contracts. Many individuals chose to enlist because the bonuses they were offered provided much-needed financial relief to their families. Many also went on to serve multiple combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is egregious to ask for these bonuses to be paid back a decade after they were awarded when these funds are unlikely to be readily available. We understand that Sections 303a and 373 of Title 37 of U.S. Code require the Secretary of the Army to recoup bonuses when service members do not fulfill all the requirements laid out in their enlistment contracts. However, the law also authorizes the Secretary to provide exceptions to these repayment requirements “if the Secretary concerned determines that the imposition of the repayment and termination requirements with regard to a member of the uniformed services would be contrary to the personnel policy or management objective, would be against equity and good conscience, or would be contrary to the best interest of the United States.” Given the well-documented unethical and unlawful practices by the California National Guard during the period in which these soldiers enlisted and the amount of time that has passed since these bonuses were awarded, we believe asking for recoupment is clearly against equity and good conscience and is not in the best interest of the United States. We understand that the California National Guard has set up a task force to help service members file for financial hardship waivers and have inaccuracies corrected through the Board for the Correction of Military Records. However, it is disrespectful to these individuals’ service and sacrifice to subject them to these onerous and bureaucratic processes because of actions that were, again, no fault of their own. We ask that you use the authority currently available to you to grant an exception to the repayment requirements for the impacted current and former service members that have been identified for bonus recoupment. Thank you for commitment to the men and women who help keep our nation safe. Sincerely, # # #
10.26.2016	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Co-Chair of the House Military Veterans Caucus, today issued the following statement after Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that the Pentagon will halt efforts to recoup bonuses that had been issued to members of the California National Guard in error. Secretary Carter stated that the suspension will continue until a fair, equitable, and timely process is implemented for those impacted. The Secretary asked that this improved process be implemented by January 1, 2017, and that all pending cases are resolved by July 1, 2017. “Secretary Carter’s announcement today that efforts to recoup unauthorized payments to current and former members of the California National Guard is an important first step as we work to do right by our heroes,” said Thompson. “While it’s important that collection efforts are halted as we work to find a solution, we can’t stop there. The Secretary’s announcement doesn’t guarantee that impacted service members and veterans will be relieved from their obligation to repay these bonuses. The brave men and women who answered our country’s call to service shouldn’t be left footing the bill for others’ mistakes, which is why I’ll continue working with my colleagues in Congress to make sure that these debts are forgiven.” Yesterday, Thompson led the House Military Veterans Caucus in sending a bipartisan letter to Secretary of the Army Eric Fanning asking him to grant an exception to the requirement that current and former service members who enlisted in the National Guard between 2006 and 2008 repay unauthorized bonuses. Thompson, himself a veteran, was appalled to learn that thousands of current and former soldiers in the Army National Guard, including 9,700 in California alone, are being asked to repay enlistment bonuses they were awarded eight to ten years ago. Upon learning of this unacceptable situation, Thompson immediately took action to help his fellow veterans find relief from this unfair financial burden. ###
10.13.2016	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today visited the Veterans Home of California-Yountville with Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert A. McDonald. Thompson invited Secretary McDonald to visit the veterans’ home in Yountville so that the Secretary could see the important services provided to veterans firsthand and discuss ways in which the home can work in partnership with the federal government. The Secretary also learned about Pathway Home, a non-profit based at the Yountville home that provides support to veterans transitioning to civilian life, with an emphasis on student veterans. California Secretary for Veterans Affairs Vito Imbasciani also participated in Secretary McDonald’s visit. “I’m honored that Secretary McDonald accepted my invitation to visit our veterans’ home in Yountville,” said Thompson. The Veterans Home of California-Yountville is a great example of our federal and state government working together alongside private partners to provide our veterans with the care they need. As a veteran, I firmly believe that one of our country’s greatest responsibilities is to care for the men and women who bravely served our country in uniform. Many thanks to Secretary McDonald, Secretary Imbasciani and everyone with the Yountville veterans’ home for coming together this morning to ensure that our partnership remains strong and that our heroes in Yountville have the best possible care and support.” Participants at this morning’s visit include: Don Veverka, Administrator for the Veterans Home of California-Yountville; Bonnie Graham, San Francisco Veterans Affairs Health Care System Director; State Senator Lois Wolk; Assemblyman Bill Dodd; and other officials from the Pathway Home. Founded in 1884, the Veterans Home of California-Yountville is one of the oldest in the nation and with about 1,000 residents it’s the largest veterans’ home in the United States. The veterans who reside at the home served in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Desert Storm, and in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Pathway Home is a non-profit based at the Veterans Home of California-Yountville that provides support to veterans transitioning to civilian life, with an emphasis placed on supporting student veterans. Thompson has long been an advocate for the Pathway Home and has fought to secure funding for federal programs, such as a grant program for Veterans Student Centers, that the Pathway Home would be eligible to receive. Thompson also introduced legislation that was signed into law in 2014 that launched a pilot program to allow service members and veterans to receive treatment for post-traumatic stress (PTS) and traumatic brain injuries (TBI) at certain non-VA centers like the Pathway Home that offer innovative treatment options. # # #

Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant of $125,000 to the City of Lakeport, which will be used to retain a law enforcement officer who will serve as a liaison to Lakeport’s business community and neighborhood groups to support Lakeport’s crime reduction efforts. The grant was made available through the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). “By allowing the Lakeport Police Department to hire an additional officer, these federal funds will go a long way towards helping our law enforcement officers make our community safer,” said Thompson. “I am a proud supporter of the COPS Hiring Program and will continue working to make sure our cities and towns have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.” Lakeport Chief of Police Brad Rasmussen and Lakeport City Manager Margaret Silveira said, “We are very excited to have been selected by the Department of Justice COPS program for this grant. This offers us the opportunity to provide a business and neighborhood liaison to work closely with our business and neighborhood groups to address crime issues affecting the community. We appreciate the support of the Congressman’s office, as well as numerous community groups including the Chamber of Commerce, Main Street Association, Lakeport Economic Development Advisory Committee, Workforce Lake, and the Lake County Probation Office for their support of this community policing officer.” The COPS Hiring Program offers grants to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire new or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts.

09.25.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Jared Huffman (CA-02) today announced that they are calling on all veterans of the Korean War living in Sonoma County to contact Rep. Thompson’s Santa Rosa District Office. Thompson and Huffman are working with the office of the Consulate General of the Republic of Korea in San Francisco to facilitate the presentation of medals to Sonoma County veterans from the Republic of Korea in recognition of their service in the Korean War. “Our nation owes a big thanks to our Korean War Veterans,” said Rep. Thompson. “Thanks to those brave Americans who answered our country’s call to service, South Korea is free and prosperous today. Though the Korean War is often remembered as the ‘Forgotten War’, our veterans will not be forgotten. I ask every veteran of the Korean War to contact my office so that they can be recognized for their service and sacrifice.” “Although the Korean War did not receive the same level of public attention as many others, we must never forget how these servicemen answered the call and valiantly served their country,” said Rep. Huffman. “I urge all Korean War veterans to come forward so that we can properly recognize and honor these brave individuals for the sacrifices they have made in service for our country.” Thompson and Huffman are compiling a list of names of those veterans living in Sonoma County who served during the Korean War. They hope to have a complete list so that every Korean War veteran in our County can receive an “Ambassador for Peace” medal from the Republic of Korea. The Ambassador for Peace medal is granted by the Republic of Korea to our veterans out of appreciation for restoring and preserving South Korea’s freedom and democracy through their service in the Korean War. The medals will be presented during a ceremony hosted by Thompson and Huffman in Sonoma County to be announced at a later date. Veterans should contact Thompson’s Santa Rosa office at (707) 542 – 7182 or Sonoma.KoreanWarVeterans@mail.house.gov as soon as possible to be included among the veterans eligible for a medal. # # #
09.23.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson today announced two U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) grants totaling more than $1.4 million for the Family Justice Center Sonoma County (FJCSC). The first grant, known as the Pathway to Justice, Healing and Hope grant, will allocate $666,666 to the FJCSC to develop models for serving victims of multiple incidents of domestic violence and sexual assault.

Local evaluators will provide a formal evaluation of the project. “Breaking the cycle of repeated domestic violence and polyvictimization in Sonoma County is absolutely critical as we work towards our goal of making sure that no one in our community suffers through domestic violence or sexual assault,” said Rep. Thompson. “The funds made available by this grant will enable the Family Justice Center Sonoma County to help more victims in our community through increased collaboration and expanded services.” “News of this grant is just terrific,” commented Sonoma County District Attorney Jill Ravitch. “The Pathway to Justice, Healing and Hope grant will focus on addressing polyvictimization, which is important for our community as it allows true wrap around services, ensuring there are no gaps in services available to victims. The FJCSC is a uniquely collaborative one-stop center that meets the sensitive needs of our community, and this funding will enhance effective response to violence against victims. Thank you to the Office of Justice Programs for providing this grant and this new opportunity to serve those in need in Sonoma County.” The second grant will provide $750,000 to the FJSCS to support the continued operation of the Improving Criminal Justice Responses Program and to allow for enhanced victim safety and offender accountability in cases of sexual assault, domestic violence, elder abuse, child abuse and stalking by implementing pro-arrest policies as an effective intervention. The grant will support a number of staff positions to provide advocacy, referrals, legal assistance, and ongoing case management to victims. This grant will allow for enhancement of services and support for the underserved Spanish-speaking population in Sonoma County. The SCFJC employs a unique model of collaboration and will partner with the following entities to implement this project: YWCA Sonoma County, Verity, Council on Aging, Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Santa Rosa, and Legal Aid of Sonoma County.

Thank you to the Office of Violence Against Women for this generous grant.” About the Family Justice Center Sonoma County: The Family Justice Center Sonoma County is operated by the County of Sonoma’s District Attorney’s Office and empowers family violence victims to live free from violence and abuse by providing comprehensive services, centered on and around the victim, at one location.

09.12.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus, announced that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has launched a pilot program to offer service dog benefits to veterans with mental health diagnoses, including post-traumatic stress (PTS). This program will pair 100 veterans who experience a mental health diagnosis that limits their mobility, including their ability to conduct normal social activities and navigate public spaces, with a highly trained assistance dog. Earlier this year, Thompson hosted a briefing and demonstration with the Santa Rosa based non-profit Canine Companions for Independence in Washington, D.C. to showcase the benefits service dogs provide for veterans with PTS. After the briefing, Thompson asked senior VA officials to explore making service dogs available to veterans with PTS immediately while we await the completion of a formal study currently underway. Until now, the VA had only offered benefits for service dogs to veterans who experienced a physical disability, such as blindness, deafness and loss of limb. “I’ve seen firsthand the tremendous benefits service dogs provide for our veterans dealing with invisible wounds of war, like PTS and traumatic brain injuries,” said Thompson. “I’m thrilled that more of our veterans will be able to benefit from a service dog thanks to this announcement from the VA and I encourage veterans experiencing PTS or other mental health diagnoses to talk to their doctor about whether they might be able to benefit from a service dog.” “The pilot program will provide the opportunity for veterans with PTS to fully engage the numerous benefits of a highly trained assistance dog,” Canine Companions for Independence CEO Paul Mundell states. “Thanks to Congressman Thompson and the VA for taking this important step.” About Canine Companions for Independence: Canine Companions for Independence provides highly-trained assistance dogs to children and adults with disabilities. Established in 1975, Canine Companions has six regional training centers across the country. Canine Companions is recognized worldwide for the excellence of its dogs, and the quality and longevity of the matches it makes between dogs and people.

09.07.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and John Garamendi (CA-03) today announced that low-interest Small Business Administration (SBA) loans have been made available to business owners and homeowners impacted by the Clayton Fire. While there are no official estimates as to how many businesses and homeowners are eligible to receive these loans, we do know that the owners of the 189 homes and 8 commercial structures that were destroyed may be eligible to receive these loans should they choose to apply and meet SBA criteria. In some situations, renters may also be eligible to receive loans for personal property damages. “The low-interest loans made available by the SBA will help our business owners and our homeowners repair damages to their properties so that our businesses can reopen and folks can get back into their homes,” said Thompson. “This is an important step in our recovery from the Clayton Fire and I commend the SBA for their swift action to help our community get back on its feet.” “The economic effects of a wildfire linger long after a blaze is put out,” said Garamendi. “Smart programs like low-interest SBA loans will help communities affected by the Clayton fire get back to business as usual much faster, and that’s a win-win for everyone.” Businesses and nonprofit organizations may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate, machinery and equipment, inventory, and other business assets. SBA can also lend additional funds to businesses and homeowners to help with the cost of improvements to protect, prevent or minimize the same type of disaster damage from occurring in the future. For small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture, and most private nonprofit organizations of any size, SBA offers Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) to help meet working capital needs caused by the disaster. EIDL assistance is available to businesses regardless of any property damage. Disaster loans up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are eligible for up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property. Interest rates can be as low as 4 percent for businesses, 2.625 percent for nonprofit organizations and 1.563 percent for homeowners. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant’s financial condition. Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application (ELA) via SBA’s secure website at: https://disasterloan.sba.gov/ela Disaster loan information and application forms are also available from SBA’s Customer Service Center by calling (800) 659-2955 or emailing disastercustomerservice@sba.gov. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing may call (800) 877-8339. For more disaster assistance information or to download applications, visit https://www.sba.gov/disaster. Completed applications should be mailed to U.S. Small Business Administration, Processing and Disbursement Center, 14925 Kingsport Road, Fort Worth, TX 76155. The filing deadline to return applications for property damage is Nov. 7, 2016. The deadline to return economic injury applications is June 6, 2017. Representatives from the SBA will be available to answer questions and assist applicants at the Disaster Loan Outreach Center, located at the Lower Lake Historic Schoolhouse Museum, beginning on Thursday, September 8th. Representatives will be on hand Tuesdays – Saturdays, 8:30 a.m. – 5:30 p.m. # # #
09.07.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today sent a letter to Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director Mel Watt to ask that the FHFA issue policy guidance that allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fully participate in Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs across our country. “After years of working to allow more homeowners to be able to take advantage of this innovative financing tool when making energy efficient retrofits to their homes, we’ve finally begun to see progress made the Administration in the past year,” said Rep. Thompson. Now that the FHA has issued policy guidance to allow homeowners with FHA-insured properties to participate in PACE programs, it’s time for the FHFA to follow suit and issue guidance without further delay.” After the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a ruling in 2010 that essentially prohibited federal financing of PACE programs, Thompson introduced legislation, known as the PACE Assessment Protection Act, in three consecutive Congresses to overturn the FHFA’s ruling and has been a leader in the bipartisan effort to encourage the Administration to find a solution that will allow PACE programs to continue. In August 2015, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it intended to allow FHA-financed properties to use the PACE program if it met certain conditions. In July, the Obama Administration made good on that promise, allowing homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages to participate in PACE programs in order to install energy efficient retrofits to their homes. The letter sent to Director Watt today asks that the FHFA follow suit and allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to fully participate in PACE programs across our country. The full text of the letter, signed by ## bipartisan Members of Congress, is copied below: Dear Director Watt: Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing is one of the most creative solutions to our nation’s energy needs and allows home owners, the private sector, and local governments the opportunity to work together to meet the economic and environmental needs of our communities. More specifically, PACE allows qualified property owners to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy improvement projects that help reduce energy costs and increase property values while promoting job creation at no cost to taxpayers. We very much appreciate new guidance issued by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), pursuant to President Barack Obama’s Clean Energy Savings for All Initiative, clarifying that FHA will approve purchase and refinance mortgage applications in states that treat PACE obligations as special assessments. To date, over 400 local governments in California have voted to authorize PACE programs in their communities, and over 70,000 participating homeowners will save 9.1 billion kWh of energy, 3.4 billion gallons of water, and $2.5 billion in utility bills. This guidance will give much needed clarity and encouragement to state and local governments implementing and administering PACE programs. In light of FHA’s guidance and President Obama’s Clean Energy Savings for All Initiative, we urge you again to carefully consider how you and the Federal Housing Finance Agency can support PACE programs. More specifically, we urge you to consider policy guidance ensuring that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can fully participate in PACE programs across the country. Should you have any questions regarding this request, please do not hesitate to contact us or Vernon Baker in Rep. Mike Thompson’s office at (202) 225-3311. Thank you for your time and attention on this important matter. ###
08.10.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1,303,750 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant for Child Start, Inc. The grant will be used to fund Child Care Partnerships between Child Start, Inc. and local private child care centers. These partnerships provide high quality child care and early learning services to young children from low-income families. “All children, no matter who they are or where they’re from, deserve a quality education,” said Thompson. “Through their Child Care Partnerships, Child Start Inc. helps ensure that the youngest children in our community have the opportunity to learn and grow. It is critical for our children to have a solid early educational foundation, one that promotes strong, healthy development. This grant funding will help Child Start, Inc. continue their terrific work in our community, and I am proud to support them.” “We are thrilled to be funded for a second year to provide services through the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grant,” said Debbie Peralez, Executive Director of Child Start, Inc. “This funding allows Child Start to partner with state funded, private child care centers and family child care providers to improve services for our youngest children. Many of the families participating in this program are struggling with poverty while trying to work or go to school and make sure their child is in a quality child care setting. This funding supports providers in attaining education and training and assists with enhancing their environments. The Early Head Start model focuses on smaller group size and nurturing relationships between the child, parents and caregiver to support early brain development, preventative health measures and healthy family relationships, leading to improved outcomes for children.” Child Start, Inc. has supported children and families in Napa County since 1965, and in Solano County since 1996. The program currently serves nearly 900 preschool children and over 170 infants and toddlers, and provides home visiting services to pregnant women. Head Start is a federal program that promotes school readiness for children under age 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants’ increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families.
07.26.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $630,000 Health Resource and Service Administration grant that will fund scholarships for students at Touro University on Mare Island. The grant makes $630,000 available each year for the next four years, totaling $2.52 million. The funding made available by this grant will be used to provide scholarships for 42 students through the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program at Touro University. Each year, 21 students, seven in each class, will receive $30,000. Specifically, of the 42 students who will benefit from the grant over the next 4 years, 14 students will receive one scholarship, 14 will receive two scholarships (one per year) and 14 will have received scholarship funding for all three years. “Every student deserves a fair shot at fulfilling their academic goals and achieving their dreams, regardless of economic status or any other factor,” said Rep. Thompson. “I look forward to seeing students at Touro University benefit from this federal funding in the years to come. I’ve no doubt they will go on to do great work armed with their first-rate education.” “Receiving this scholarship grant is quite the accomplishment for our campus community and a realization of their values, passion and perseverance," Marilyn Hopkins, PhD, Provost and Chief Operating Officer of Touro University California said. "It will allow us to further demonstrate our commitment to the underserved community and allow new students the opportunity to pursue a professional career." "I’m thrilled that we will be able to provide scholarships to our students," said Grace Landel Program Director of Touro University California's Joint MSPAS/MPH Program. "Our mission here at Touro is to train quality PAs to work within underserved populations, to recruit applicants from these communities or individuals with a demonstrated interest in serving these communities, and increase access to care for underserved populations. These scholarship funds will have a tremendous impact on furthering that goal." With this funding, the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students (SDS) program aims to increase the: Number of Touro graduates practicing in primary care; Enrollment and retention of full-time students from disadvantaged backgrounds including students who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups; Number of Touro graduates providing medical care within medically underserved communities (MUCs).
07.22.2016	Sacramento, CA – Last year, after the death of Mr. Henry Trione, Congressman Mike Thompson and State Senator Mike McGuire brought forward an official request to add Mr. Trione’s name to Annadel State Park after his death at age 95. State Senator Mike McGuire authored a resolution which received bipartisan, unanimous support in both the State Senate and Assembly to recognize and honor Henry Trione’s significant positive impact to the creation and preservation of Annadel State Park by adding his name to its title. In addition, the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors, Santa Rosa City Council, both members of Congress representing Sonoma County, the entire State Legislative delegation and the State Park’s Foundation supported this initiative over the last year. After the testimony of over 30 residents in support of the name change and significant discussion, the California State Parks Commission voted unanimously this morning to approve the name change to: Trione-Annadel State Park. “Adding a name to a State Park is serious business and deserves significant consideration and the community must lead in the conversation. Adding Mr. Trione’s name earned a groundswell of support from the neighborhood level and today’s action will forever honor the legacy and contributions of the individual who was responsible for the creation of this beloved State Park,” Senator McGuire said. “It is because of Mr. Trione’s vision and generosity that generations of Northern Californians will love these 5,000 acres for generations to come.” Congressman Mike Thompson has been a leading proponent of honoring Mr. Trione’s legacy by re-naming the Park, Trione-Annadel State Park. “It’s a direct result of Henry Trione’s vision, foresight and sheer determination that we have this magnificent park today,” said Rep. Thompson. “He was a generous man who always put his community and its people first. It is fitting that he be recognized and that his name will live on as an example of selfless dedication and generosity. Henry’s work made the park a reality, and it should bear his name. I commend the California Parks and Recreation Commission for its thoughtful deliberations this morning and I look forward to hiking in the newly named Trione-Annadel State Park in the near future.” Throughout the years, Mr. Trione gave away much of his fortune in support of the arts, social service programs to help the neediest North Bay residents and he spearheaded the effort to create one of Sonoma County’s most beloved parks, Annadel. During the budget crisis in 2012, when state parks were closing down, Henry Trione was the one who personally provided the majority of the funds needed to keep Annadel State Park open and thriving. He helped rally the community to keep the park accessible to the public and under county administration – where it continues to this day.
07.20.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) and Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) today applauded the Obama Administration for its bold new announcement of a cross government partnership, the “Clean Energy Savings for All Americans Initiative,” which includes an expansion of Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs. This administrative action comes after Reps. Thompson and Huffman urged the Department of Veterans Affairs to enable veterans to receive VA-secured home loans to take advantage of PACE programs. Under this new initiative, the Administration will work to ensure that every American household has access to solar power to cut their energy bills, combat air pollution and tackle climate change. The Obama Administration will take several actions to allow American homeowners, including low- and moderate- income households and veterans to use PACE financing. Specifically, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) released guidance outlining how properties with PACE assessments can be purchased and refinanced with an FHA-insured mortgage, the VA issued policy guidance on PACE-financed homes, clarifying when Veterans are able to access PACE programs, and the Department of Energy provided best practices for new and existing residential PACE programs throughout the country, as well as committing to provide technical assistance to support these programs. “By providing homeowners with an innovative financing tool to make energy efficient retrofits to their homes, PACE programs not only enable significant reductions in energy consumption, but they create jobs and can increase a property’s value - without costing taxpayers a dime,” said Rep. Thompson. “I’m glad to see the Obama Administration take this important step to ensure that more homeowners in California and across our country – including veterans – can take advantage of PACE programs.” “PACE financing is truly a win-win: it helps reduce energy consumption and cuts greenhouse gas emissions, while also slashing energy bills for Americans,” said Rep. Huffman. “I thank President Obama and the VA for listening to those of us who have been urging bold action on PACE, for expanding access to these programs to include veterans, and for taking these concrete actions towards a cleaner energy future.” After the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) issued a ruling in 2010 that essentially prohibited federal financing of PACE programs, Thompson introduced legislation, known as the PACE Assessment Protection Act, in three consecutive sessions of Congress to overturn the FHFA’s ruling and has been a leader in the bipartisan effort to encourage the Administration to find a solution that will allow PACE programs to continue. In August 2015, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that it intended to allow FHA-financed properties to use the PACE program if it met certain conditions. This week’s announcement by the Administration makes good on that promise. The Administration announced the following actions: Supporting the Scale Up of Property-Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Financing: Since 2009, the Obama Administration has been working to provide homeowners the opportunity to finance solar and energy efficiency improvements at no upfront cost through a mechanism called PACE, including through the Middle Class Taskforce and by releasing a Policy Framework for PACE Financing Programs. Today, the Obama Administration is taking a number of new actions to allow American homeowners, including low- and moderate- income households and veterans to use PACE financing. This innovative financing mechanism allows homeowners to benefit from energy improvements immediately and pay back the cost over time through their property taxes. If the property is sold, including through foreclosure, the remaining PACE assessment will stay with the energy efficient property and the next owner will become responsible for the remaining PACE assessment. The PACE initiatives announced today will unlock alternative sources of capital for low- and moderate- income Americans and veterans to scale up solar, promote energy and water efficiency retrofits, and create more resilient homes, leading to reduced energy bills, more empowered consumers, and cleaner communities. Issuing Guidance on how to Use FHA Mortgage Insurance with PACE Financing: For more than 80 years, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) has provided low- and moderate- income households and underserved communities access to safe and affordable housing through FHA mortgage insurance. Each day, more than 3,000 people close on a home for which the mortgage is insured by FHA. Today, FHA is releasing guidance outlining how properties with PACE assessments can be purchased and refinanced with an FHA-insured mortgage. This action is intended to support renewable energy and energy efficiency investments in single family housing, support retrofits that boost resilience to climate risks, and remove existing barriers to using PACE financing. The key requirements outlined in FHA’s guidance are – the PACE assessment does not take first lien position ahead of the mortgage and the assessment transfers from one property owner to the next, including through a foreclosure sale. The guidance also requires appraisers to analyze and report on the impact of PACE-related improvements to the value of the property. Unlocking PACE Financing for Veterans: Today, in support of the Administration's longstanding commitment to create a clean-energy economy and help Americans take advantage of clean energy technologies, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is issuing policy guidance on PACE-financed homes. Today's guidance will clarify the circumstances under which Veterans are able to take advantage of PACE programs in conjunction with their VA Home Loan Guaranty benefit, providing a new opportunity for veterans to participate in the clean energy economy and save on their energy bills. Providing Best Practices for New and Existing Residential PACE Programs throughout the Country: DOE is releasing a draft of their updated Best Practices Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing for public comment from stakeholders, including consumer advocates, public policy leaders, and industry. This public comment period is critical to ensuring the highest levels of consumer and lender protections. Across the nation, fifteen states have already adopted residential PACE-enabling legislation. Overall, nearly 100,000 households have utilized PACE programs to finance over $2 billion in energy saving improvements to their homes. The updated guidelines reflect the evolving structure of the PACE market and incorporates lessons learned from various PACE programs that have been successfully implemented since the original guidelines were issued. They provide best practices for residential PACE programs, including protections to both consumers who voluntarily opt into PACE programs, and to lenders who hold mortgages on properties with PACE assessments. The guidelines can also be used by PACE program administrators, contractors and consumers to plan, develop and implement programs and improvements that effectively deliver home energy and related upgrades. DOE’s updated Best Practice Guidelines for Residential PACE Financing rely upon important progress that the Department has made in a critical partnership with industry, including a formal partnership with the Appraisal Foundation to develop guidance on valuation of energy efficiency in residential and commercial buildings that was launched in 2011. DOE is also partnering with the Appraisal Institute to integrate energy efficiency into appraisals and real estate transactions and deliver education and training to appraisers through the Better Buildings Home Energy Information Accelerator, where they have enlisted the support of the Real Estate Standards Organization, the Council of MLS, Homes.com, and National Association of Realtors. Providing Technical Assistance to Make it Easier for States and Communities to Stand Up Smart PACE Programs: DOE will provide technical assistance to support the design and implementation of effective PACE programs, including conducting a series of webinars and online workshops to facilitate peer exchange and provide access to PACE experts; conducting research on the lessons learned from state and local residential PACE programs , including analysis of the impact of PACE on community adoption rates of energy efficiency improvements and per household energy consumption, and various program design strategies, and effectiveness of PACE relative to other financing mechanisms. DOE is also working with State Energy Offices, local government representatives, residential PACE industry representatives, and subject matter experts to focus on residential PACE program design (including consumer protection options) and the development and dissemination of detailed program best practices.
07.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) issued the following statement after Republican Leadership recessed the House of Representatives for seven weeks on Thursday without taking a single vote to address gun violence. “It’s wrong, it’s irresponsible and it’s dangerous for Republican Leadership to send us home without taking a vote to help stop the mass gun violence that’s become far too common in our country,” said Thompson. “More than 30 people are killed every day by someone using a gun. Doing the math, that means by the time the House comes back from the summer recess in 52 days, over 1,560 Americans may have been killed by someone using a gun. We can’t wait for more innocent lives to be cut short by someone using a gun. We need to vote on bipartisan, pro-second Amendment legislation to help keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them: terrorists, criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. And we need to vote now.” House Democrats have been calling on Republican Leadership to allow a vote on bipartisan, pro-Second Amendment legislation, specifically: The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation (H.R. 1217) to close a loophole in our background check system that allows criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check in thirty-four states when purchasing guns online, at a gun show or through a classified ad; The bipartisan ‘No Fly, No Buy’ bill (H.R. 1076) to prohibit individuals on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorists Watchlist from being able to legally purchase guns.
07.11.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today announced that Task Force member Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) will now serve on the Task Force as one of 13 Vice Chairs. The Vice Chairs and Thompson comprise the Task Force’s leadership team. “I am proud to announce that Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee will serve on the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as a Vice Chair,” said Thompson. “With her position as Ranking Member on the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations – which has jurisdiction over gun violence prevention legislation – Sheila will be an effective advocate for our work as a Vice Chair. I look forward to working with Sheila as a Vice Chair as our Task Force continues working to reduce and prevent gun violence while protecting the rights of law-abiding individuals to own firearms.” “I am honored to have been selected to serve as one of the Vice Chairs of the U.S. House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,” said Jackson Lee. “The scourge of gun violence is devastating our communities. Congress has shamefully failed to act on commonsense reforms, like expanded background checks and stricter punishments for illegal gun trafficking and straw purchasing. These reforms protect the 2nd amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners, enjoy overwhelming support from the American people, and will save lives.” After the December 14, 2012, school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Thompson was named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam. The House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has been leading the effort in the House of Representatives to pass commonsense legislation (H.R. 1217) to close dangerous loopholes in our background check system that make it far too easy for criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check when purchasing guns online, at a gun show or through a classified ad.
07.11.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today announced that Task Force member Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA) will now serve on the Task Force as one of 13 Vice Chairs. The vice chairs and Thompson comprise the Task Force’s leadership team. “I am proud to announce that Congressman Mike Honda will serve on the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as a Vice Chair,” said Thompson. “With his position as Ranking Member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science – which has jurisdiction over funding related to gun violence prevention – Mike will be an effective advocate for our work as a Vice Chair. I look forward to continuing our work to reduce and prevent gun violence, while protecting the rights of law-abiding individuals to own firearms, with Mike as a Vice Chair.” As a member of the committee that funds the Department of Justice Rep. Honda, who is also a gun owner, has fought for commonsense gun safety legislation for years. “I am proud to accept the position of Vice Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,” said Honda. “I will continue to fight for real change to our gun safety laws to protect all Americans, especially our youth who are so vulnerable. Reducing needless gun violence is a moral imperative, which is made more clear everyday as we continue to lose innocent lives.” After the December 14, 2012, school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Thompson was named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam.

07.11.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today announced that Task Force member Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) will now serve on the Task Force as one of 13 Vice Chairs. The Vice Chairs and Thompson comprise the Task Force’s leadership team. “I am proud to announce that Congressman David Cicilline will serve on the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force as a Vice Chair,” said Thompson. “With his experience combatting urban gun violence as Mayor of Providence, Rhode Island and his exemplary leadership on our Task Force, I am confident that David will continue to be an effective advocate for our Task Force as a Vice Chair as we continue our work to reduce and prevent gun violence while protecting the rights of law-abiding individuals to own firearms.” "33,000 Americans are killed each year in an incident of gun violence. It's inexcusable that Congress has done nothing to address this ongoing epidemic," said Cicilline. "I'm grateful for the opportunity to help lead this fight as a Vice Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. I look forward to continue working with Chairman Thompson and leaders in the Democratic Caucus to demand commonsense actions to reduce gun violence in the United States." After the December 14, 2012, school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Thompson was named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam.

07.08.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement in response to the shootings in Dallas, Texas. “Last night, a peaceful night was shattered by senseless violence when law enforcement officers were targeted and killed. We cannot allow this epidemic of gun violence to continue devastating our communities. We must come together as a nation to end this horrific violence. Our thoughts and prayers are with Dallas and the families of those who lost their lives.”
06.30.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced the Earthquake Mitigation Tax Incentive Act (H.R. 5610) with Rep. Paul Cook (R-CA), bipartisan legislation to exclude earthquake mitigation incentives from being taxed at the federal level. California has already made these incentives tax free at the state level. The California Earthquake Authority (CEA) and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services established the California Residential Mitigation Program (CRMP) to help Californians strengthen their homes against damage from earthquakes. As the first program developed by CRMP, the Earthquake Brace + Bolt (EBB) Program provides grants of up to $3,000 to help homeowners pay for code-compliant retrofits, which cost an average of about $5,000. A residential seismic retrofit strengthens an existing house, making it more resistant to earthquake activity by bolting the house to its foundation and adding bracing around the perimeter of the crawl space. In order to maximize the value of the incentive, H.R. 5610 would make the incentive tax free at the federal level. “After the South-Napa earthquake damaged more than 1,500 homes in 2014, we need to do everything possible to ensure that our homes are better prepared to withstand the next earthquake,” said Rep. Thompson. “By ensuring that homeowners can take advantage of seismic retrofits without being taxed, this bipartisan legislation will help encourage more homeowners to take preventive measures to strengthen their homes against earthquake damage.” “This bill will bring federal tax law into sync with California law to encourage residents in earthquake-prone regions to take preventative measures to safeguard their homes,” said Rep. Paul Cook. “Current federal law penalizes Californians with taxes, which leaves families and structures less safe. We have to change this, and these tax incentives are a step in the right direction.” “We’ve designed this incentive program to help Californians make their homes safer,” said Glenn Pomeroy, CEO of the California Earthquake Authority. “That’s why this legislation is so important, because people who do the right thing by taking advantage of this program shouldn’t be penalized with a tax. California fixed the problem at the state level, and now it’s time for the federal government to do the same.” On August 24, 2014, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. The earthquake damaged more than 1,500 homes and caused an estimated $362 million in damage to private homes and commercial properties, according to Napa County and the City of Napa. Following the earthquake, Rep. Thompson helped secure Presidential approval of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) disaster funds and Public Assistance (PA) disaster funds as well as Small Business Administration (SBA) loans.
06.29.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today recognized the National Day of Action for Commonsense Gun Violence Prevention with Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (CA-12) Congressman Mike Honda (CA-17), Congresswoman Barbara Lee (CA-13), Congressman Eric Swalwell (CA-15), law enforcement officers, medical professionals, community leaders, advocates, survivors of gun violence, families and kids at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. The National Day of Action for Commonsense Gun Violence Prevention comes after House Democrats sat-in for 26 hours on the House Floor last week to demand that Speaker Ryan and House Republicans allow an immediate vote on bipartisan, commonsense gun violence prevention legislation to help keep guns out of dangerous hands. After Republican Leadership recessed the House of Representatives last week without taking a vote to prevent gun violence, House Democrats held events across our country today to give voice to the overwhelming majority of Americans who want to see Congress take action to curb the epidemic of gun violence in our country. “Today, Americans across our country – from San Francisco, to Chicago, to Baltimore and everywhere in between – came together for a National Day of Action on Gun Violence Prevention to demand that Congress put partisan politics aside and do what it takes to help keep our communities safe,” said Rep. Thompson. “Because whether it’s in a movie theater, on a college campus, at an elementary school, in a church, in a nightclub, or on the streets of our cities – we’ve lost too many innocent lives to gun violence and we can’t sit back and do nothing while more lives are cut short. The time for action is now. My colleagues and I won’t give up until Republican Leadership gives us a vote on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to make sure suspected terrorists don’t have easy access to guns and to close dangerous loopholes in our criminal background check system.” House Democrats are calling on Speaker Ryan and House Republicans to allow an immediate vote on two bills: The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation (H.R. 1217) to close a loophole in our background check system that allows criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check in thirty-four states when purchasing guns online or at a gun show; and The bipartisan ‘No Fly, No Buy’ bill (H.R. 1076) to prohibit individuals on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorists Watchlist from being able to legally purchase guns.
06.28.2016	Martinez, CA – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11) visited the Martinez Early Childhood Center on Monday present a check totaling $4.5 million of federal grant money to support Head Start services throughout Contra Costa County. Specifically, the funding will be used to increase the number of children in high quality early learning programs with local partnerships, increase the rate of pay for Family Child Care Providers, and increase teacher qualifications, educational standards, and family and community engagement. "Head Start and Early Head Start programs are of tremendous value to our community,” said Rep. Thompson. "I am proud to have helped secure these federal funds, which will help make sure all students, regardless of where they live or how much money their parents make, have equal access to a quality education from the day they first step foot in a classroom.” “If our goal is a well-educated citizenry, early education is where we need to start. Research shows that for every dollar we invest in early childhood education, there is a $14 return on investment. As a former Head Start Commissioner, I have witnessed firsthand the positive effects these programs have on exciting students, empowering communities, and strengthening the future of America,” said Rep. DeSaulnier. “There are many winners as a result of this grant for Contra Costa County’s Head Start program,” said Candace Andersen, Chair of the Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors. “A clear benefit, though, is to strengthen existing child care programs and expand their reach. Dozens more children will be brought into the program at an age where high quality early learning has such a major impact.” Head Start is a federal program that promotes school readiness for children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services.
06.24.2016	Washington, D.C.—Today, a bipartisan group of Members in the House, representing vastly different regions of our country, came together to introduce legislation that will deny the sale of firearms to those on "No-Fly" lists. H.R. 5576, the House-companion to the bipartisan Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act led by Sen. Collins (R-ME), was introduced by Reps. Seth Moulton (D-MA), Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), Peter King (R-NY), Mike Thompson (D-CA), Bob Dold (R-IL), Robin Kelly (D-IL), Scott Rigell (R-VA), Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI), and John Carney (D-DE). Specifically, this bipartisan legislation would: Prevent individuals on the “No-Fly” and Selectee lists from legally purchasing firearms and explosives. Create a process for Americans and legal permanent residents to appeal a denial in the Federal Court. Protect ongoing counter-terrorism investigations by giving the Attorney General the discretion to allow gun sales to go forward when a denial would impede an ongoing investigation. Implement a five-year "look-back” provision to immediately notify the Attorney General and federal, state, and local law enforcement if anyone who is or was entered into the broader Terrorist Screening Database attempts to buy a gun from a licensed dealer. Rep. Seth Moulton offered the following statement: “Our constituents didn't send us to Washington to stand in silence. They sent us to Washington to keep our communities safe. This bipartisan bill will help to keep weapons out of the hands of terrorists and those who seek to do our country harm. It’s time to put party aside and come together to make progress for the American people. Today, we’re doing that in Congress.” Rep. Carlos Curbelo offered the following statement: “We must protect Americans from the ever increasing threat of terrorism and violent acts of hatred here at home while we fight radical jihadists overseas. After the horrific massacre in Orlando, and countless other mass shootings across the country, the American people want answers. Congress must act, at the very least, to ensure individuals on the No-Fly list and "selectee" list cannot purchase a firearm. This legislation does just that and ensures due process for law-abiding citizens. I commend Senator Collins and her bipartisan group of colleagues for their tireless work in building significant consensus on this issue. The bipartisan, bicameral effort to pass this legislation should be a top priority for Congress, and I will not rest until we keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous terrorists while protecting Second Amendment rights for law-abiding Americans who pose no threat to the homeland." Rep. Bob Dold offered the following statement: “Stopping gun violence requires more than moments of silence – we need action. I’ve been working to keep guns out of the hands of known or suspected terrorists since my first term in Congress,” Rep. Dold said. “The only way we’re going to actually make progress to keep families safe is through bipartisan action. This bipartisan, bicameral proposal to keep dangerous weapons away from those who wish to do our country harm, while protecting due process, is an important step forward and a bipartisan solution we should all be able to get behind.” Rep. Tulsi Gabbard offered the following statement: "We owe it to the American people to work together to try to get sensible gun control legislation actually passed—and in order to do that, it must be a bipartisan effort. Majorities in both parties agree with the vast majority of the American people—we need to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists. However, we must also ensure that any action we take does not compromise the rights to due process guaranteed to every citizen. There are valid constitutional concerns related to the lack of due process and transparency for those who have mistakenly been placed on the No Fly List and Terror Watch List. This legislation is a bipartisan compromise that will help to keep guns out of the hands of terrorists, while protecting our constitutionally-guaranteed civil liberties." Rep. Scott Rigell offered the following statement: “A terrorist should not be able to fly on a plane or buy a gun. Though that statement reflects common-sense and common ground, legislation that would make it a reality is the subject of divisive debate in Washington. There has always been tension between our liberty and our safety, but advancing both can be done. If a person is deemed too dangerous to board a plane, they’re too dangerous to purchase a firearm. Our legislation affects the approximately 3,000 Americans (or 0.00001% of the population) who our intelligence agencies have determined pose a significant threat to our national security. This is common-sense, bipartisan, bicameral legislation that allows us to achieve both by prohibiting an individual on the ‘No-Fly list or Selectee lists from purchasing a firearm, while also providing a fully sufficient legal mechanism that guarantees due process. I am proud to stand with my colleagues in introducing this needed legislation today." Rep. Mike Thompson offered the following statement: “An overwhelming majority of Americans agree that if you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. Congress has a responsibility to listen to the will of the people, put partisan politics aside and do what it takes to help keep Americans safe by making sure suspected terrorists don’t have easy access to guns. And that’s what this bipartisan, commonsense legislation is all about.” Rep. Peter King offered the following statement: “After September 11th, common sense dictates that the federal government stop gun sales to suspects on the terrorist watch list. Federal law already prohibits nine categories of dangerous persons from purchasing or possessing firearms, including the mentally ill and criminals. Yet, after almost 15 years, we still allow suspected terrorists the ability to purchase firearms . It’s time for common sense to prevail before it’s too late." Rep. Robin Kelly offered the following statement: “Common sense gun violence prevention has been my top priority since being elected to Congress. I am pleased that a handful of brave and honorable Republican colleagues have taken a stand and reached out to work with Democrats on the simplest of measures: keeping guns away from terrorists. The last two days have been a watershed moment. I truly hope that the leadership of Senator Collins is the beginning of bipartisanship in addressing our nation’s gun violence epidemic. This is a problem we can only solve by working together.” Rep. John Carney offered the following statement: "Time and time again we’ve seen the price of inaction on gun control. We’ve seen countless mass shootings and lost the lives of loved ones across the country. The American people are frustrated, as are many of my colleagues here in Congress. I’m proud to help lead this bipartisan effort in the House. The only way we can take meaningful action, action that our constituents are urging us to take, is to work with both sides of the aisle. I hope we can continue to move forward on this common-sense measure to keep guns out of the hands of those wishing to do us harm." Click here for a summary of the legislation.
06.23.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today issued the following statement after Republican Leadership adjourned the House without taking a vote on legislation to prevent gun violence. “For more than 16 hours my colleagues and I sat on the House floor. We sat and we held the floor because we’re done waiting for Speaker Ryan and Republican Leadership to give us a vote on legislation to prevent gun violence. But in an act of shameful cowardice, Republican Leadership refused to listen to the voices of the American people and in the middle of the night they cut and ran. House Republicans have adjourned the House – they chose to go home rather than allow us to take a vote on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to help keep guns from suspected terrorists, criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. What could be so hard about letting the people’s House take a vote? What is the Republican Majority so afraid of?” House Democrats staged a sit-in on the House floor for more than 16 hours to demand that Republican Leadership allow a vote on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to help keep guns out of dangerous hands. House Democrats called on Speaker Ryan and House Republicans to allow an immediate vote on two bills: The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation (H.R. 1217) to close a loophole in our background check system that allows criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check in thirty-four states when purchasing guns online or at a gun show; The bipartisan ‘No Fly, No Buy’ bill (H.R. 1076) to prohibit individuals on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorists Watchlist from being able to legally purchase guns.
06.22.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Democratic Members from the House of Representatives are sitting-in on the House floor to demand that Republican Leadership allow a vote on bipartisan, commonsense legislation to prevent gun violence. “In the wake of the worst mass shooting in our country’s history, the American people deserve more than a moment of silence from their elected representatives,” said Thompson. “They deserve a Congress that will put partisan politics aside and pass bipartisan, commonsense legislation to help keep guns out of dangerous hands. The overwhelming majority of the American people support legislation to close the dangerous loopholes that allow suspected terrorists, criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to buy firearms. Our sit-in represents a simple appeal to Republican Leadership: give us a vote. What is the Republican Majority afraid of?” House Democrats are calling on Speaker Ryan and House Republicans to allow an immediate vote on bipartisan, commonsense gun violence prevention legislation to help keep guns out of dangerous hands, with two bills: The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation (H.R. 1217) to close a loophole in our background check system that allows criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill to bypass a background check in thirty-four states when purchasing guns online or at a gun show; The bipartisan ‘No Fly, No Buy’ bill (H.R. 1076) to prohibit individuals on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorists Watchlist from being able to legally purchase guns.
06.21.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act (H.R. 5477), passed the House of Representatives today. Last week, H.R. 5477 was passed out of the House Committee on Ways and Means. This legislation allows small employers to continue to offer Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or HRAs, to their employees so that they can choose a quality, affordable health insurance plan that fits their individual budget and healthcare needs. Existing Treasury Department guidance under the Affordable Care Act limits the use of HRA’s for small businesses. “The passage of the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is a prime example of what we should be doing in Congress - working across party lines to make health coverage available to our constituents,” said Rep. Thompson. “This legislation will help small business owners, workers and their families. By ensuring that small business owners can continue to offer HRAs to their employees, we not only arm our small business owners with a competitive advantage to recruit and retain employees, but we also help ensure that hard-working Americans can receive quality, affordable coverage.” “The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is a common-sense, bipartisan solution ensuring our small businesses aren’t penalized for trying to do the right thing. HRAs are an affordable solution for both employees and employers to combat the escalating cost of health insurance. I thank my colleague, Congressman Mike Thompson, for continuing to work with me to find ways to increase access to high-quality healthcare for all Americans,” said Rep. Charles Boustany (R-LA). On September 13, 2013, The Department of Treasury issued guidance disallowing businesses from using HRA’s as a tax-free means to reimburse employees, stating these arrangements were disqualified under Affordable Care Act’s annual dollar cap. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act restores flexibility and choice into the marketplace by: Ensuring that small businesses are allowed to use pre-tax dollars to give employees a defined contribution. Allowing employees to use these funds as an HRA to purchase health coverage on the individual market, as well as for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses. Protecting small business employers from being unnecessarily financially penalized for providing this option to employees. The legislation is budget-neutral, meaning it won’t add a single dollar to our deficit. The bill is supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB), the National Association for the Self-Employed, and the Coalition for Affordable Healthcare (CAHC). The legislation now goes to the Senate.
06.16.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today introduced legislation (H.R. 5504) to require that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) be notified when individuals formerly under a terrorism investigation purchase firearms or explosives. “We need to make sure that those responsible for our country’s security have all the information they need to help keep Americans safe,” said Rep. Thompson. “By alerting the FBI when individuals formerly under a terrorism investigation purchase guns or explosives, the FBI can determine if there is new cause for concern, and hopefully, intervene before tragedy strikes.” "Congress must take immediate action to better protect the American people from gun violence and terrorism, and that starts with preventing radicalized, hate-filled individuals from having access to dangerous weapons," said Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-FL). "It’s unacceptable that suspected terrorists can walk into a gun shop and buy a gun. We need to put the partisanship aside and pass this common-sense bill. The families and communities suffering in the wake of this horrific violence against the LGBT community deserve nothing less." “In the wake of the horrific terrorist attack against the LGBT community in Orlando, Floridians from across our state are demanding change. There is no one answer to solve the problem of gun violence in America – but that doesn’t mean Congress shouldn’t try to make our streets safer, to save lives, to prevent another tragedy like the Pulse shooting,” said Rep. Gwen Graham (D-FL). “This is commonsense legislation that will help prevent suspected terrorists from attacking Americans, without infringing on the rights of law abiding citizens. I applaud Senator Nelson and Representative Thompson for their leadership on this issue, and I’m proud to join them in this effort.” “Congress’s continuing silence in the face of modern terror threats is completely unacceptable,” said Rep. Elizabeth Esty (D-CT). “Passing H.R. 5504 is a commonsense step forward we should immediately take to help our law enforcement agencies identify and thwart potential terrorists before they can carry out their plans.” “The presence of an assault weapon enables a gunman to kill many people, in a short amount of time, easily. One cannot kill 49 people, and injure 53 others with a box cutter or a rock,” said Rep. Alan Grayson (D-FL). Currently, not only can individuals on the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist pass a background check and legally purchase guns, but the FBI is not notified when individuals formerly under investigation for ties to terrorism purchase firearms or explosives. Rep. Thompson has sponsored bipartisan legislation (H.R. 1076) to prohibit those on the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist from purchasing firearms and has introduced H.R. 5504 to ensure that after a terrorism investigation is closed, the FBI is alerted should that individual purchase firearms or explosives. Specifically, H.R. 5504 requires that any individual who is, or who has been, under a terrorism investigation be entered into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). NICS is the national database used to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to purchase a firearm. The bill would further require that the NICS system automatically notify the FBI should a background check be conducted for such an individual. Omar Mateen, the gunman responsible for the mass shooting in Orlando, had been removed from the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist before he legally purchased the two firearms he used in the attack. H.R. 5504 is the House companion to identical legislation introduced in the Senate by Senator Bill Nelson (D-FL). H.R. 5504 has 4 original cosponsors, including Reps. Patrick Murphy (D-FL), Gwen Graham (D-FL), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Alan Grayson (D-FL). H.R. 5504 been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary for further consideration.
06.16.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan provision requiring every American flag purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials or supplies that are 100 percent grown, produced or manufactured in the United States, was passed by the House of Representatives today. Thompson's provision passed as part of H.R. 5293, the DOD Appropriations Act of 2017. The provision previously passed in the last Congress as part of H.R. 3547, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 consolidated appropriations bill, was signed into law by the president in January 2014, and was implemented by the Pentagon in 2015. Thompson again introduced this provision to ensure its continued inclusion in DOD appropriations. “I am proud to continue my efforts to ensure that every American flag the DOD buys is made in America, by American workers and with American products,” said Thompson. “This provision is commonsense. The brave men and women who serve our country in uniform should do so under an American-made flag.” Specifically, Thompson's provision applies the Berry Amendment to the American flag. The Berry Amendment, originally passed in 1941, prohibits DOD funds from being used to acquire food, clothing, military uniforms, fabrics, stainless steel and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the United States, except in rare exceptions. Thompson's provision applies the same rules for the DOD's acquisition of American flags, which previously were not listed as a covered item. Precedent already exists for such a provision. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase U.S.-made American flags for servicemembers' funerals. H.R. 5293 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 282-138. The legislation will now go to the Senate for consideration.
06.15.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation, the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act (H.R. 5477), passed the House Committee on Ways and Means today. This legislation allows small employers to continue to offer Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or HRAs, to their employees so that they can choose a quality, affordable health insurance plan that fits their individual budget and healthcare needs. Existing Treasury Department guidance under the Affordable Care Act limits the use of HRA’s for small businesses. “HRA’s ease the administrative and financial burden of providing traditional insurance and allow small business owners to focus on what they do best – running their businesses,” said Thompson. “I thank my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for recognizing the value of HRA’s for our small business owners and for voting in support of my legislation.” “The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act is a common-sense, bipartisan solution ensuring our small businesses aren’t penalized for trying to do the right thing. HRAs are an affordable solution for both employees and employers to combat the escalating cost of health insurance. I urge House leadership to bring this bill to the House floor as soon as possible to grant relief to small businesses suffering under these harsh penalties,” said Rep. Charles Boustany (R-LA). On September 13, 2013, The Department of Treasury issued guidance disallowing businesses from using HRA’s as a tax-free means to reimburse employees, stating these arrangements were disqualified under Affordable Care Act’s annual dollar cap.

The legislation is now eligible for consideration by the full House of Representatives.
06.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11) today announced a $1,062,176 Early Head Start – Child Care Partnership grant for Contra Costa County. The funding made available by this grant will be used to provide Early Head Start services to 72 children and their families at 20 licensed Family Child Care homes and two centers throughout Contra Costa County. The Early Head Start – Child Care Partnership grant is unique in that it allows agencies to partner with local providers who are already serving children through state subsidies, the goal being to strengthen existing programs by bringing Head Start’s comprehensive services directly to children and their families. "Head Start and Early Head Start programs are of tremendous value to our community,” said Rep. Thompson. "I am proud to have helped secure these federal funds, which will help make sure all students, regardless of where they live or how much money their parents make, have equal access to a quality education from the day they first step foot in a classroom.” “As a former Head Start Commissioner, I have witnessed firsthand the positives effects these programs have on exciting students, empowering communities, and strengthening the future of America. Thanks in large part to Head Start services, I have seen students regardless of socioeconomic status across Contra Costa County succeed. I look forward to watching the impact this grant will have on our students and our community,” said Rep. DeSaulnier. "We are excited to have successfully completed an 18 month start up period for this grant and to be formally beginning year one of the five year grant cycle for the Early Head Start –Child Care Partnership. Our partners, the Contra Costa Child Care Council and First Baptist Head Start, are committed to the partnership and are high quality programs to begin with, making the start-up an easy and fruitful process as we learn together. Most encouraging is hearing our regional office remark that they, too, are learning alongside of the newly funded program,” said Christina Reich, Division Manager at the Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services Department. Specifically, the funds will be used to: · Increase Head Start enrollment in Early Head Start; now serving 383 infants and toddlers in Contra Costa County. · Incentivize local partnerships between Early Head Start programs and community-based child care programs to increase the number of infants and toddlers in high quality early learning programs. · Increase rate of pay for Family Child Care Providers, thereby building the workforce. · Increase teacher qualifications, safety standards, educational standards, and family and community engagement opportunities through strict adherence to the Head Start Performance Standards. Head Start is a federal program that promotes school readiness for children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants' increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families.

05.25.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced a $1,843,989.00 Department of Transportation grant for the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. The funds made available by this grant will be used to complete construction of service roads in the safety area of Runways 14 and 32, construct two bridges over the creek and pave 50,000 feet of service roads around the ends of the runways and outside of the safety area. These improvements will ensure compliance with Federal Aviation Administration standards and improve safety by keeping service vehicles off of the runways. Work is scheduled to begin this summer, and is expected to be finished by next summer. “Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport is of tremendous value to our local economy and a huge asset to passengers traveling to and from beautiful Sonoma County,” said Thompson. “I’ve long supported projects to allow our airport to service not only more, but further destinations. And I’m proud to announce these important funds, which will enhance safety, improve airport operations and bring us one step closer to completing the Runway Safety Improvement Project at our airport.” “The completion of service roads at the Airport will allow essential service vehicles access to airport facilities while remaining safely off the runways,” said Sonoma County Board of Supervisors Chairman Efren Carrillo. “This highly competitive funding provides an opportunity to continue implementing the Runway Safety Improvement Project, a comprehensive plan for enhancing safety at the Airport.” Thompson previously announced nearly $40 million of DOT funds for the runway project at Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport in 2013 and $1 million of DOT funds in 2014 for environmental mitigations required to complete the airport’s runway project. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.19.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced the Airline Consumer Protection Act (H.R. 5291), legislation to strengthen consumer protections and improve travel experience for airline passengers. “Everyone has a right to be treated decently and fairly while on a plane or in an airport, even when unforeseen complications arise,” said Thompson. “While we have made progress on issues like extended tarmac delays, passengers are still dealing with shrinking seats and growing fees. This legislation will build on the progress we’ve made to ensure that every passenger is treated fairly when they fly.” Paul Hudson, President of FlyersRights, said “FlyersRights commends Congressman Mike Thompson for introducing significant aviation consumer protection legislation. While much more is needed, this legislation addresses the most pressing issue for airline passengers: the urgent need to stop airlines from shrinking passenger space without limit regardless of health, safety and comfort. By formally refusing to set minimum seat standards in February, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given a green light to a new round of passenger space reductions. Unless Congress acts to stop overcrowding, which it last did in 1855 and 1819 for ships, airline passengers will soon be subject to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous conditions on US domestic routes.” The Airline Consumer Protection Act will: Freeze reductions in seat size until the FAA establishes minimum size, padding, leg room, and aisle width to protect passenger safety, health, and comfort; Increase transparency in ancillary fees and seat assignment policies; and Improve awareness of, and access to, aviation consumer protection information and complaint processes. Thompson previously introduced the Air Passenger Bill of Rights, legislation that required air carriers to provide adequate food, water, temperature controls, ventilation, and working toilets during excessive delays, and offer passengers the option to deplane after three or more hours on the ground. Provisions of this legislation were signed into law as a part of FAA legislation in 2012. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.
05.18.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced a $4,345,012 Department of Health and Human Services grant for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers (SRCHC). The funds made available by this grant will be used to support continued operations at SRCHC for the next year, through May 31, 2017. SRCHC reports that in 2013, the center saw over 41,000 people, over the course of more than 173,000 medical visits. “Santa Rosa Community Health Centers does outstanding work to make sure everyone in our community has access to essential primary health care services, including dental and mental health care,” said Thompson. “I’m proud to announce these important funds, which will allow our health center to continue providing quality, affordable care for those in need in our community in the year ahead." “Federal funding helps keeps our doors open and supports programs that improve quality so we can deliver the best medical, dental and mental health care to the people in our community most in need,” said Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer at Santa Rosa Community Health Centers. “Access to health care is essential for a full life, yet thousands of people in Sonoma County still can’t get the services they need. Funding for community health centers like ours is critical to a healthy community where everyone has the opportunity for a healthy and productive life.” Community Health Centers are locally-controlled, non-profit entities that provide primary care, dental, behavioral health, and pharmacy services in underserved rural and urban areas. Health Centers serve America’s most vulnerable populations, including one in seven of America’s uninsured, one-third of those living in poverty, and one in seven Medicaid beneficiaries. More than 7 million children and over 300,000 veterans get their health care in community health centers. Health Centers specialize in providing cost-effective and high-quality primary and preventive health care that generates $24 billion annually in savings to the health system, due in large part to their success in reducing the need for patients to seek care in costlier settings like emergency departments. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.
05.17.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 11, 2016) – The Small Business Council of America (SBCA), a national nonprofit organization which represents the interests of more than 20,000 privately-held and family-owned organizations on Federal tax, employee benefit and health care matters, presented its 33rd Annual Congressional awards on May 4, 2016. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) received the 2016 SBCA Congressional Award in recognition of his dedication to small businesses across the country and in particular for the introduction and sponsorship of the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act. This bipartisan bill would allow small employers with fewer than 50 employees to offer Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs) to help employees purchase health insurance in the individual market- on and off of the exchange - as well as reimburse employees for qualified health expenses if the employee has qualified health coverage. In 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued guidance prohibiting the use of HRAs for the purchase of health insurance and related medical expenses because it was inconsistent with the requirements of group health plans. Employers who continue to offer HRAs would be subject to a $100 per day, per employee penalty, up to $36,500 per employee per year. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act would allow small employers to offer HRAs to their employees so that they can choose a quality, affordable health insurance plan that fits their individual budget and healthcare needs. “The SBCA applauds Congressman Thompson for reaching across the partisan divide to promote common-sense bi-partisan legislation that will greatly help small businesses and their employees,” said SBCA Chair, Paula Calimafde. “The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, sponsored by Congressman Thompson and Congressman Boustany, will provide a solution to a very real problem and, once again, allow small businesses to help their employees cover the cost of individual health insurance.” “I am honored to receive the 2016 Small Business Council of America Congressional Award,” said Thompson. “Small businesses drive job creation and grow our economy, which is why I was proud to introduce the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, so that our small business owners can afford to provide health care coverage to their employees and focus on what they do best, running their business.” The SBCA also recognized the efforts of Senator Jim Risch, Senator Heidi Heitkamp and Congressman Charles Boustany in promoting and supporting the small business community. The SBCA also honored members of the private sector, including: Robert Kent, of Bethesda, Maryland, Humanitarian of the Year and Troy Guard, of Denver, Colorado, Mort Harris Small Business Person of the Year. SBCA Director, Sandra Turner of Oviedo, Florida, was this year’s Connie Murdoch award winner.

John Garamendi (CA-03) introducing companion legislation to Senator Dianne Feinstein’s drought bill that was heard in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, Water and Power Subcommittee today. The House members included in this joint statement are: Reps. Jerry McNerney (CA-09), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11), Doris Matsui (CA-06), Mike Thompson (CA-05), Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Peter DeFazio (OR-04), Anna Eshoo (CA-18), Michael M. Honda (CA-17), Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), Jim McDermott (WA-07), and Kurt Schrader (OR-05). “Members from the California, Oregon, and Washington delegations have concerns about any legislative proposals that would harm the water quality and supply of our states, disadvantage our local farmers and fishermen, or violate tribal trust responsibilities. While we are pleased that the Garamendi bill includes language from bills that we have offered, the price our states and ecosystems may pay in exchange for longer-term provisions within the proposed legislation is too high. This legislation’s modification of environmental laws not only sets a troubling precedent, but also pressures federal and state agencies to increase diversions from an increasingly damaged ecosystem that is close to a devastating collapse. “Furthermore, House Republicans have indicated that they are looking to conference the Senate version of this bill with Representative Valadao’s H.R. 2898 ­­­– a piece of legislation that we overwhelmingly oppose. Any legislation that emerges from a conference would not be acceptable to many of the diverse stakeholders in our home states. “We understand the immense pressure that severe drought conditions place on water allocations. That is why we have put forth and advocated for policy alternatives that promote greater regional resiliency and more efficient management of our water supply. We remain committed to working together to advance policies that will move us toward a sustainable water future and build the regional self-sufficiency this drought and future droughts require.” The following are statements from individual House Members and Delegations: California “My district contains a majority of the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the heart of California’s water system. I remain deeply concerned with any legislation, including H.R. 5247, that tries to dictate California water policy, especially when it will have detrimental effects on our environment by diverting more water away from the families, farmers, and economies of the Delta. This could also set a dangerous precedent for how we manage our water supply for years to come. I’m committed to working with all stakeholders throughout the state and Congress to build drought resiliency and self-sufficiency in regions across the Nation. This can be achieved by making smart investments in innovative and efficient strategies that will create more water and a sustainable water future for us all,” said Congressman McNerney. “While I appreciate the work of my colleague Congressman John Garamendi, I remain concerned that this legislation continues to micromanage operations in the Bay-Delta to the detriment of fisheries and ecosystems. Sadly, based on the past actions of House Republicans to insert their radical rider into last year’s appropriations bill, I fear this bill too will be hijacked and used to push for more extreme water legislation that will harm California communities and jobs that depend on healthy fisheries,” said Congressman Huffman. “I cannot in good faith cosponsor a bill that will be twisted and distorted in this political process to harm my constituents. I will continue to work with Congressman Garamendi, Senators Feinstein and Boxer, and the rest of my colleagues to promote new investments in water infrastructure and modernize outdated systems, wherever possible, to find a common ground and real solutions.” “We cannot set the needs of one Californian against another in our efforts to find a solution to the state’s drought crisis,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “Sacramento sits at the confluence of the American and Sacramento Rivers, which are directly impacted by Delta operations. I have concerns that the legislation as proposed will negatively impact our region’s economy, drinking water supply, and ecosystem. As our discussions continue, I will do everything I can to address California’s immediate and long term water infrastructure needs, while balancing that goal against Northern California’s needs.” “No part of our state has been immune to the devastating impacts of the drought. Communities have seen their resources stretched thin and ecosystems have been pushed to the edge,” said Congressman Thompson. “This bill is not the solution. Without appropriations from Congress, local communities will never see the infrastructure investments promised in this proposal. In effect, we will be left with a bill that is dangerous and shortsighted. It will undermine water managers’ ability to balance needs across regions, and jeopardize the long-term stability of the Delta. Now is not the time to bend the rules that protect our state’s water system. Instead, Congress should get serious about effective, long-term solutions to the ongoing drought.” Oregon “This bill will have serious implications for the thousands of coastal families whose livelihoods depend on the ocean and waterways of Oregon. We support commonsense solutions to deal with the effects of California’s drought, but not if they come at the expense of Oregon’s fishing industry. Our fisheries and coastal communities cannot afford another setback,” said Oregon Representatives DeFazio, Blumenauer, Bonamici, and Schrader. ### Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.04.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced Stella Li from Benicia High School in Solano County as the winner of the 2016 Congressional Art Competition for the 5th Congressional District. Li’s work, titled “Memories of my Grandmother”, will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year beginning in June. Li and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. in June to attend a ceremony at the Capitol honoring the students who were selected as winners from congressional districts across our country. “Congratulations to Stella Li on being named our district’s 2016 Congressional Art Competition winner,” said Thompson. “I will be proud to see Stella’s “Memories of my Grandmother” as I walk between my office and the Capitol in the year ahead. Every year I am impressed by the creativity and talent of our student artists and this year was no different. Many thanks to every student who participated in this year’s competition, each piece submitted was outstanding.” Li used color pencil and graphite to depict a young girl combing her grandmother’s hair. In her own words, Li said “I’ve loved art for as long as I can remember, but only really picked it up as a hobby when I was 12, when I realized that it would allow me to express anything I wanted, regardless of how shy I was. The piece is a tribute to my grandmother, who I was close to before her death. I wanted to portray a scene that not only showed how warm my memories of her remain, but also revealed her gentle spirit. I’m very excited and honored to have won – I hadn’t been expecting to.” Mr. Dan Frazier, Stella’s teacher at Benicia High School said, “Stella Li’s piece, "Memories of my Grandmother", is a lovely drawing of a remembered family moment done in my Advanced Placement Art Studio class. Stella’s work is a testament to the value of fundamentals in art and a credit to her school. We are super excited to have this chance to recognize one of our own on the national stage! Benicia High Art is based on a marriage of classic principles and the new technologies, and we are supported by a fantastic community here in beautiful Benicia.” Li was one of five regional winners chosen by local artist judges. The four other finalists were: Contra Costa County winner: Nikolas Childers of College Park High School Lake County winner: Lorena Rosiles of Kelseyville High School Napa County winner: Isabel Conversano of Vintage High School Sonoma County winner: Saskia Rechin of Rincon Valley Christian School Li’s work was selected as the winning entry by a panel of local artist judges who chose between her piece and the artwork of the other regional winners from the 5th Congressional District. The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for Members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition. A photo of Li’s piece is included.
04.21.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), vice-chair of the Task Force, and Peter King (R-NY) today led more than 110 of their bipartisan colleagues in calling on Speaker Paul Ryan and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to reject legislative language, or “riders”, that would block efforts to reduce and prevent gun violence in Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 appropriations bills. “These riders are nothing more than legislative tactics designed to circumvent an open debate on gun violence prevention in the House and sneak provisions into must-pass spending bills that undermine efforts to help keep guns out of dangerous hands,” said Thompson and Esty. “There is no justification for preventing scientific research into the causes of gun violence, or for restricting our ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. We ask our colleagues to bring forward clean, responsible spending bills, free from dangerous riders that handcuff law enforcement’s ability to reduce gun violence.” In previous appropriations bills, gun-related riders have been added without open debate and have acted as roadblocks to reducing and preventing gun violence. These riders have prevented law enforcement from requiring federally licensed firearm dealers to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of criminal gun transfers, and stifled scientific research into the causes of gun violence. Thompson’s Task Force recommended that Congress should act to repeal these riders and restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The Task Force urged Congress to fund law enforcement’s efforts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into the causes of gun violence. The full text of the letter is below: Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: As the House Committee on Appropriations develops each of the twelve Fiscal Year 2017 appropriations bills, we urge that you ensure the Committee’s legislation not include harmful legislative language, or “riders,” that impact the enforcement of gun laws, the operations of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL), or research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. Gun violence reduction and prevention is an important and sensitive issue. Given the renewed national focus on gun violence prevention, now is not the time to include controversial appropriations riders that negatively impact gun laws. Instead, such changes to gun policy must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through the regular order. This must be done in an open and transparent process where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and debated by the proper committees of authorizing jurisdiction and the entire House of the Representatives. Over the past several years, various appropriations riders related to gun policy have had unintended consequences that could have been prevented had these issues been properly and more thoroughly debated in Congress. For example, the Tiahrt and Rehberg amendments, among others, have prevented law enforcement from requiring FFLs to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of crime gun transfers, and chilled unbiased scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. As the Fiscal Year 2017 appropriations process begins through the respective subcommittees, we urge you to support the development of legislation that is free of harmful gun-related riders. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

04.21.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is again calling for bids for the Franklin Station Post Office in downtown Napa. At Thompson’s urging, the USPS listed the Franklin Station Post Office for sale in October 2015. Bids were submitted and the USPS entered into negotiations with a prospective buyer. However, the prospective buyer is no longer pursuing the sale, and the USPS is again calling for bids. According to the USPS, the identity of the former bidder and reasons for the withdrawal of the bid will not be made public. Previous bidders must resubmit their bids if they would like their offer to be considered. The USPS will also be accepting new bids. Bids are due by May 3, 2016. Interested buyers should contact Andrew Reeder, with the CBRE Brokerage at (415)772-0162/andrew.reeder@cbre.com. The official listing can be viewed here. “I’m determined to see the Franklin Station Post Office remain standing for future generations,” said Thompson. “I recently met with USPS officials to discuss the sale moving forward, and I’m pleased that the USPS will continue to work with me and our state and local partners to pursue the sale of the post office.” The USPS originally proposed to demolish the building due to the cost of repairing damage caused by the August 2014 earthquake. In August, the USPS agreed at Thompson’s urging to stop pursuing the demolition of the Historic Franklin Station Post Office in downtown Napa and instead pursue the sale of the earthquake-damaged building and property with the stipulation that the buyer repair the building in accordance with all applicable laws and protective covenants intended to preserve the architectural integrity of the building. The Franklin Station Post Office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Franklin Station Post Office was commissioned in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency tasked with carrying out public works projects which employed millions of out-of-work Americans. The ornate post office was built in the art deco architectural style.

04.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means and Co-Chair of the Congressional Wine Caucus, introduced the Wine Excise Tax Modernization Act (H.R. 4934), bipartisan legislation to modernize federal excise taxes on wine to allow winemakers of all sizes and grape growers to create new, innovative products and keep pace with advances in viticulture. U.S. Rep. David Reichert (R-WA) joined Rep. Thompson in introducing this legislation. “The tax code should not be an impediment to growth and innovation,” said Thompson. “That’s why I’m proud to introduce this legislation, which modernizes an outdated tax structure to allow our wine community – which produces the finest wines in the world – to keep pace with changing consumer demands in the years ahead.” “Napa Valley Vintners commends Congressman Thompson and Congressman Reichert for introducing this important legislation and understanding what it takes to keep our industry competitive in the global market. The updated provisions will lower tax rates and reduce some of the unnecessary complication in the tax code, which will be especially helpful for hundreds of our small, family-run wineries,” said Linda Reiff, President and Chief Executive Officer, Napa Valley Vintners. “Winegrowers across the North Coast have been focused on quality and innovation for decades,” said Debra Sommerfield, President of the Lake County Winegrape Commission. “We are grateful for Congressman Thompson’s in-depth understanding of the issues and appreciate him taking steps to support this innovation.” Maureen L. Cottingham, Executive Director of Sonoma Valley Vintners said, “The Wine Excise Tax Modernization Act makes commonsense changes to our outdated tax code that will help advance growth and innovation in our wine community. I applaud Rep. Mike Thompson for introducing this bipartisan bill and look forward to working with him to enact this meaningful legislation.” "Rep. Thompson's proposal for a tax credit is excellent for small producers. This will really level the playing field for small producers and boutique wineries such as ours, and enable us to compete with other big producers," said Frank Kennedy, CEO of Vino Godfather Prohibition Wines. Specifically, the Wine Excise Tax Modernization Act: Simplifies the small producer tax credit and expands eligibility to all producers: This ensures a level playing field for wineries of all sizes, while also encouraging small- and mid-sized producers to grow without fear of facing the steep phase-out of the current small producer credit. Increase the allowable carbonation limit for still wine to 6.4 grams/liter: The current limit is preventing wine producers from developing new products for consumers. The Tax Code should not be an impediment to innovation Eliminates the luxury tax on sparkling wine: The current tax rate for sparkling wine, which is significantly higher than that of still wine, was established after World War II when champagne was viewed as a luxury from France and U.S. consumption was low. It is long past time for this rate to be reduced. Raises the Alcohol-By-Volume (ABV) limit from 14 to 16 percent: Changes in winemaking and vineyard practices have led to a steady increase in the ABV level of table wines, but the Tax Code hasn’t kept pace with these developments. The Wine Excise Tax Modernization Act has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.08.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Jared Huffman (CA-2), along with U.S. Rep. Anna Eshoo (CA-18), yesterday hosted a roundtable with innovative local business leaders at Sonoma State University to discuss how Congress can better support and spur innovation locally and across the country. Yesterday’s discussion was one of many taking place around the country as House Democrats work to craft an Innovation Agenda 2.0. The Innovation Agenda was first launched in 2007 by House Democrats with the goal of ensuring that our country remained the world’s leader of innovation. To develop that plan, Members of Congress held listening sessions to solicit ideas from local leaders in innovation on what the emerging areas in innovation are and how public-private partnerships and other initiatives can stimulate innovation and increase America’s competitiveness. Innovation Agenda 1.0 generated valuable policy ideas, 21 of which were translated into legislative provisions that were signed into law. Now, House Democrats have launched Innovation Agenda 2.0, to build on the progress made by the first Innovation Agenda. “We must ensure that America continues to lead the world in innovation”, said Rep. Thompson. “And to do that, we need to make sure we’re fostering the right environment to allow for the next big breakthrough or technological revolution. And that’s what the Innovation Agenda is all about. Many thanks to my co-hosts and colleagues Jared Huffman and Anna Eshoo and all of our innovative local business leaders for joining in this effort.” “In California, we’re fortunate to be surrounded by brilliant innovators, but we can never take this entrepreneurial spirt for granted,” said Rep. Huffman. “After seeing the many successes of Innovation Agenda 1.0, I was thrilled to join my colleagues in hosting the Innovation Agenda 2.0 event and hear ideas and suggestions from a diverse group of private sector leaders who are on the front line of innovation in my district and beyond. By really putting our heads together and identifying how we can support sustained success, we can help unleash the creativity, vision and innovation that has always made America great and bring those forces to bear on many of today's most pressing problems -- addressing climate change, revitalizing education, expanding economic opportunities, ensuring clean, reliable water supplies, and much more.” "Big ideas combined with smart public policies are essential for our economy and its workforce," said Rep. Eshoo. “Yesterday’s event is about thought leaders and innovators in California's 2nd and 5th Congressional Districts contributing to the national effort of House Democrats to shape an Innovation Agenda that will ensure our workforce is the most competitive and innovative and keep America #1 in the 21st century.” “Eliminating barriers to innovation in the electricity sector is fundamental to our business and for making the grid more reliable, secure, clean and cost effective for consumers. Innovation Agenda 2.0 is an excellent and necessary platform for discussing transformative ideas with the nation’s decision makers which can result in having profound effects on our economy, national and global well-being,” said Jason Simon, Director of Policy Strategy at Enphase Energy. “We are delighted Reps. Huffman, Thompson and Eshoo provided this important opportunity to share big ideas in a venue that has already proven to result in positive economic and societal change.” “We must not forget agriculture and food production in the “innovation” discussion. Wastewater treatment, for instance, is an exciting technology area for farmers and cheese makers because it can both produce energy and reduce water use. I thank Representatives Huffman, Thompson, and Eshoo for holding this important discussion,” said Sue Conley, Co-founder of Cowgirl Creamery. “This roundtable was incredible and inspirational. The Bay Area has so many innovative ideas--from large companies like Google to small businesses, the success we are realizing here, can be successful anywhere in the world.” said Jim Happ, President of Labcon. Aaron Newcomb, President of Benicia Makerspace said, “I was really impressed with the Representatives willingness to host and event like this. It is so crucial for our economy and our educational system. For them to take the time out of their day to come and listen to some of these brilliant people on what can drive the economy forward, it’s fantastic, it really is. This event should happen more often, perhaps on an annual basis.” Bill Kreysler, President of Kreysler & Associates said, “I think for a small company like mine to be invited to a meeting with three Representatives of Congress and other innovation leaders in our community is, to me, innovation in itself, and an example of why I am so optimistic about the future. While everyone seems to be talking about negative things, there are a lot of positive things that are happening that don’t get the recognition they should – perhaps they aren’t newsworthy. But they are important. Yesterday’s meeting is an example of what I think is an important and positive step in improving our country’s ability to compete globally and to help the whole country grow together.” Success Stories from Innovation Agenda 1.0: 671,585 new broadband Internet users connected by the Department of Commerce’s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Dramatic increases in the usage of solar, wind, and renewable fuel technology More solar was installed in 1 week in 2014, than was installed in all of 2006. More than a 300 percent increase in wind energy capacity since the beginning of 2007. 18.1 billion gallons of domestic renewable fuel will be used in 2016, an increase from 7 billion gallons produced in 2007. $850 million in private investment for 34 of ARPA-E’s clean energy and efficiency technologies, building off only $135 million in earlier-stage federal investments. Research and Development funding since 2006: 49 percent increase in funding for the Department of Energy’s Office of Science. 42 percent increase in funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology. 34 percent increase in funding for the National Science Foundation. Spurred new manufacturing processes and technologies by putting America on a path to double funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), which leverages federal, state, and private dollars to help small and medium-sized manufacturers promote innovation. Improved the small business loan program and revived the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program. Modernized the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program by cutting red tape, reducing the lag time between the award phases, and providing additional funding for the commercialization phase.

04.05.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today visited Contra Costa AFL-CIO Labor Council and the United Way of the Bay Area Community Service in Martinez and met with staff and clients of the center’s Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program. The VITA program offers assistance from volunteers certified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to individuals who generally earn $54,000 a year or less, or who have disabilities or limited English language abilities, to prepare their income tax returns. VITA programs also help taxpayers claim refundable tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC). The VITA program is jointly sponsored by the IRS and the American Bar Association and provides grants to non-profit organizations in the community to make these free tax preparation clinics available. “The free tax preparation services offered by the Contra Costa AFL-CIO Labor Council and the United Way of the Bay Area Community Service provide a truly vital service to our communities,” said Thompson. “Every taxpayer should receive the assistance he or she needs to determine what tax benefits they are legally entitled to receive. Far too many hardworking low- to moderate-income workers don’t know they can claim the refundable Earned Income Tax Credit and the refundable Child Tax Credit, which can deliver larger tax refund checks. Thank you to all the IRS-certified volunteers and staff at the Contra Costa AFL-CIO Labor Council and the United Way of the Bay Area Community Service who work hard to provide these invaluable services to taxpayers in our community.” “The Contra Costa AFL-CIO Labor Council and the United Way of the Bay Area Community Service welcome Congressman Thompson to our VITA tax site. We’re proud to offer this vital service to all residents. This year our site is one of 20 in Contra Costa that will serve over 12,000. This site alone has saved over $45,000 for local families this year,” said Mary Harms, United Way of the Bay Area Community Services Director at the Labor Council. Rep. Thompson, a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means which has jurisdiction over all tax policy, also encouraged taxpayers to take advantage of the new myRA program. Launched in November by President Obama and the Department of the Treasury, the myRA is a new simple, safe, no-fee retirement account for those looking for a way to get started saving for retirement. The myRA program provides Americans who don’t have access to a retirement savings plan through work to have a new option of putting some of their tax refund into a myRA account.“Every hardworking American should have access to a reliable option to save for retirement,” said Thompson. “The myRA program provides Americans who don’t have access to a retirement savings plan through work to have a new option of putting some of their tax refund into a myRA account, ensuring they have access to a long-term, stable, safe account where they can build up their savings.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.30.2016	Washington, D.C. – Today, U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) hosted U.S. Rep. John Larson (D-CT) for a town hall meeting in Benicia to discuss the Social Security 2100 Act (H.R. 1391), legislation that if enacted would provide a benefit bump for current and future beneficiaries, cut taxes for Social Security recipients, and keep the system strong for generations to come. “I’m committed to keeping Social Security strong for generations,” said Rep. Thompson. “That’s why I’m a proud coauthor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which not only improves benefits for today’s seniors, but ensures that the promise of Social Security will remain strong for our children and grandchildren. Many thanks to my colleague John Larson from Connecticut for flying out to Benicia to meet with our seniors and share more about this important legislation.” "Social Security is a lifeline for millions, with two-thirds of retirees relying on their benefits for most of their income. That's why I introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to increase benefits, cut taxes, and keep Social Security solvent for generations. I commend Rep. Mike Thompson for his commitment to ensuring that hard working Americans who pay into the system get the benefits that they’ve earned,” said Rep. Larson. Rep. Thompson is a coauthor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Larson. The Social Security 2100 Act provides the following: Tax cut for over 11 million Social Security recipients by raising the threshold on taxation of benefits Benefit bump beginning in 2016 for current and new beneficiaries Protection for low-income workers by raising the minimum benefit Long term protection against inflation for cost of living adjustments (COLA) by adopting the CPI-E formula Extends the solvency of the program by extending the Social Security payroll tax to wages over $400,000. Currently, the Social Security payroll tax only applies to wages up to $118,500. In Solano County alone, Social Security distributes benefits amounting to about $765 million each year. With common sense steps like those in the Social Security 2100 Act, Congress can boost this vital program now and ensure Social Security remains strong well into the future. In fact, the Social Security Administration’s Chief Actuary issued a report verifying that the Social Security 2100 Act would keep the program solvent beyond the next seventy-five years. # # #
03.30.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Jared Huffman (CA-2) today hosted U.S. Rep. John Larson (D-CT) for a town hall meeting in Santa Rosa to discuss the Social Security 2100 Act (H.R. 1391), legislation that if enacted would provide a benefit bump for current and future beneficiaries, cut taxes for Social Security recipients, and keep the system strong for generations to come. “I’m committed to keeping Social Security strong for generations,” said Rep. Thompson. “That’s why I’m a proud coauthor of the Social Security 2100 Act, which not only improves benefits for today’s seniors, but ensures that the promise of Social Security will remain strong for our children and grandchildren. Many thanks to my colleague John Larson from Connecticut for flying out to Santa Rosa to meet with our seniors and share more about this important legislation.” “Our seniors work hard their entire lives to pay into social security, and rightfully rely on it when they retire,” said Rep. Huffman. “Our government must hold up their end of the bargain, and ensure our seniors receive the support that they not only need, but earned. That’s why I am co-sponsoring Rep. Larson’s bill, which offers a sensible, real world solution to make certain that all Americans are provided with this vital social safety net.” "Social Security is a lifeline for millions, with two-thirds of retirees relying on their benefits for most of their income. That's why I introduced the Social Security 2100 Act to increase benefits, cut taxes, and keep Social Security solvent for generations. I commend Reps. Mike Thompson and Jared Huffman for their commitment to ensuring that hard working Americans who pay into the system get the benefits that they’ve earned,” said Rep. Larson. Reps. Thompson and Huffman are coauthors of the Social Security 2100 Act, which was introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Larson. The Social Security 2100 Act provides the following: Tax cut for over 11 million Social Security recipients by raising the threshold on taxation of benefits Benefit bump beginning in 2016 for current and new beneficiaries Protection for low-income workers by raising the minimum benefit Long term protection against inflation for cost of living adjustments (COLA) by adopting the CPI-E formula Extends the solvency of the program by extending the Social Security payroll tax to wages over $400,000. Currently, the Social Security payroll tax only applies to wages up to $118,500. In Sonoma County alone, Social Security distributes benefits amounting to about $1.1 billion each year. With common sense steps like those in the Social Security 2100 Act, Congress can boost this vital program now and ensure Social Security remains strong well into the future. In fact, the Social Security Administration’s Chief Actuary issued a report verifying that the Social Security 2100 Act would keep the program solvent beyond the next seventy-five years. # # #
03.24.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today spoke on the importance of rail safety and observed a training demonstration during the final day of the 3-day Railroad Hazardous Materials Awareness Training. BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad hosted this disaster response training in conjunction with Rep. Thompson, Contra Costa County Fire Departments, the Contra Costa County Sherriff’s Office of Emergency Services and the City of Hercules for local first responders to be better prepared in the event of a train derailment or other accident that involves hazardous materials. “Public safety is priority number one when it comes to transporting hazardous materials,” said Thompson. “I appreciate BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroad for working with my office to provide this week’s training to our local responders. While we certainly hope our first responders never have to use what they learned in this training in a real life situation, we need to make sure our first responders have all the information and training they need to quickly, safely and effectively address emergency situations.” This week’s training is the result of a series of local stakeholder meetings held by Rep. Thompson regarding the safe transportation of hazardous materials by rail. During these meetings, it was identified that our local first responders should have greater access to hazardous materials training. Rep. Thompson then worked with BNSF Railway and Union Pacific Railroads to bring the Railroad Hazardous Materials Awareness Training to Hercules. Rep. Thompson has co-authored and introduced the Crude-by-Rail Safety Act, legislation which establishes comprehensive new safety and security standards for the transport of crude oil by rail. The legislation is designed to help protect communities along the nation’s railway networks. More specifically, the Crude-by-Rail Safety Act would establish new, commonsense federal safety standards for railcars transporting oil across the country. This legislation: • Establishes a maximum volatility standard for crude oil (propane, butane, methane, and ethane) transported by rail • Prohibits use of unsafe DOT-111 tank cars, including the removal of 37,700 unsafe cars off the rail network • Establishes the strongest tank car standards to-date • Requires comprehensive oil spill response planning and studies • Increases fines for violating volatility standards and hazmat transport standards • Requires disclosure of train movements through communities and emergency response plans • Requires railroads to implement a confidential close-call reporting systems Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), Peter King (R-NY), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Robin Kelly (D-IL), Patrick Meehan (R-PA), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Robert Dold (R-IL), Marc Veasey (D-TX) and Daniel Donovan (R-NY) today led 163 of their colleagues in calling on appropriators to provide funds to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm. Right now, NICS is missing information and because of this, people who otherwise would not pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. The letter, signed by 149 Democrats and 14 Republicans, urged the House Appropriations Committee to provide $73 million for NICS in the House version of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. The funds would be used to help states improve data submissions to NICS. “Criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill should not be able to get their hands on guns,” said Thompson. “And the only way to know if someone falls into one of those categories is to conduct a background check. But our national background check system is only as good as the data we put into it. These funds will help states upload information into the system so that prohibited purchasers don’t slip through the cracks.” In January, President Barack Obama announced executive actions to reduce and prevent gun violence. The executive actions announced eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the term “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The executive actions clarify the term to state that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, regularly making gun sales, and/or earning their livelihood from gun sales is “engaged in the business” and therefore must obtain a license and conduct criminal background checks, even if at a gun show or over the internet. As a result of the president's executive actions, it is expected that more sales will go through licensed dealers requiring background checks. Having the most up-to-date, comprehensive information in the system will ensure that these sales don't allow guns to get in the hands of people who should not have them. In the previous Congress, Thompson passed a bipartisan amendment which increased NICS funding to record levels in the FY 2015 omnibus appropriations bill. The full text is below. The Honorable John Culberson The Honorable Michael M. Honda Chairman Ranking Member House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Science and Related Agencies H-309, The Capitol 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Honda: As the Committee begins writing the Fiscal Year (FY) 2017 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we respectfully request funding for implementation of the National Instant Background Check Systems (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-180) at least at the FY16 level of $73 million. The Act provides for grants to states to upgrade their electronic databases, incentives for states to transmit electronic records to NICS, penalties for states that do not comply, and requirements for keeping NICS up-to-date, including the removal of obsolete or erroneous records. The Act also provides financial incentives for states to develop “relief from disabilities” procedures for persons who have lost the right to possess a firearm due to a mental health adjudication or commitment but are later determined not to pose a danger to public safety. As you are aware, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. No. 90-618) precludes certain persons, including felons, those adjudicated mentally ill, illegal aliens, drug abusers, and those under a restraining order, from purchasing or possessing firearms. The only way to enforce these requirements effectively is to ensure that NICS has up-to-date records from state and federal sources. At present, millions of records are currently missing from the various databases that make up NICS. Many states do not have the resources necessary to implement the technology to automate criminal history and mental health records, which has allowed persons otherwise prohibited from purchasing or owning firearms to do so in violation of federal law. This remains a serious problem because many states still do not submit adequate numbers of mental health and criminal records to make NICS work as intended. The intent of NICS Improvement Amendments Act is to ensure there are sufficient resources to provide accurate and timely data about persons prohibited from possessing firearms. This cannot be achieved absent adequate funding for NICS. In fact, demand for this funding is increasing every year and we must provide adequate funding to meet this growing need. While the Act authorized a combined total of $1.125 billion from FY 2009 through FY 2013, a total of only $63.567 million was appropriated during that time. We fully understand the current constraints on the federal budget and appropriations process. Keeping citizens safe, however, must be Congress’s top priority. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act has been severely underfunded in years past, and the-all-too-frequent tragedies across our Nation unfortunately show that gun violence is still a very serious issue that plagues our country. Ensuring NICS has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of persons who cannot safely and legally possess them while at the same time protecting Americans’ Second Amendment rights will save lives. Consequently, we respectfully urge the Committee to fund the NICS Improvement Amendments Act at a level that at minimum matches $73 million. Sincerely, # # # Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.21.2016	Washington, D.C. – Monica Rosenthal of Middletown was recognized as Lake County’s Woman of the Year by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) at a ceremony held on March 20th. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored in recognition of Women’s History Month. “Monica is a tireless advocate for our Lake County community,” said Thompson. “From her work to grow our local economy, to her support for local foster youth and seniors, there is no doubt that our community is stronger today because of Monica’s good work. And after the devastating Valley Fire struck Lake County, Monica repeatedly provided the hard work and leadership needed to bring our community together and move Lake County forward. It’s my honor to recognize Monica as the Lake County Woman of the Year.” Rosenthal’s history of public service exemplifies this year’s theme for Women’s History Month, which honors women in public service and government. She served as the District 1 representative on the Lake County Planning Commission, and for the past five years she has represented the 1st District on the Lake County Farm Bureau Board of Directors. She is currently serving her second term on the Napa/Lake Work Force Investment Board to promote employment training and job opportunities in Lake County. Rosenthal drew on her experience as a small business owner and a community servant to develop and organize the highly successful Economic Outlook and Forecast event held last December. The event, which was attended by almost 200 leaders in our County and business community, explored ways we can grow and stimulate the Lake County economy moving forward. As the Director of the Middletown Area Merchants Association, Rosenthal is an effective advocate for our local business community, especially in the wake of the Valley Fire, which was tough on our businesses. Rosenthal also supports local foster youth and senior programs such as Redwood Children’s Services and the Middletown Senior Center. After the Valley Fire, Rosenthal coordinated the delivery of emergency supplies and donations to communities in need. And today, she serves as the Community Assessment Committee Chair for Team Lake County, the long term recovery volunteer group working to help Lake County rebuild. Rosenthal has lived in Middletown for 20 years. Together with her family, she grows winegrapes and owns and operates Rosenthal Vineyards.

03.21.2016	Washington, D.C. –Linda Parks of Napa was recognized as Napa County’s Woman of the Year by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) at a ceremony held on March 20th. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored in recognition of Women’s History Month. “Linda’s contributions to our community extend far beyond the success of her business,” said Thompson. “Under Linda’s leadership, Lixit enables adults with disabilities to find employment and thereby gain independence. And, Linda is clearly beloved by her employees because there is hardly any employee turnover at Lixit. In fact, the average tenure of Lixit’s staff is seven to fifteen years. Linda is an extraordinary individual and it is my honor to recognize her as Napa County’s Woman of the Year.” Parks is the President and CEO of Lixit Animal Care Products in Napa, which manufactures small animal watering and feeding devices in addition to animal care accessories. When Parks joined Lixit in 1971 as a buyer, there were only ten employees. In 1994 the original owner retired and the employees bought the business using a qualified Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Today, under her leadership Lixit is a thriving business with over 100 employees, many of whom are adults with disabilities. Parks has earned a distinguished reputation in the California business community. In 2015, the North Bay Business Journal named Parks as one of its Women in Business award winners. As a graduate of the Building a High-Performing Minority Business program at the Tuck School of Business, Parks has led Lixit to become a certified women-owned company.

She founded Worth Our Weight (W.O.W.), a culinary and food-service training program offered free of charge to young people who have dealt with significant challenges such as foster care, homelessness or trouble with the law. In addition to providing culinary and food-service training, W.O.W. provides a safe social circle for our young people, where they are less likely to be exposed to gangs or violence. Furthermore, Cheatham ensures the young people at W.O.W. have at least one good meal a day, a necessity that many of her students lack. Cheatham’s service to the Sonoma County community extends beyond W.O.W. She serves on the Community and Local Law Enforcement Task Force, where she facilitates communication between law enforcement officers and citizens of Sonoma County.

03.19.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today joined Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewel, California State Director for the Bureau of Land Management Jerry Perez, U.S. Forest Service Chief Tom Tidwell, California Secretary for Natural Resources John Laird, U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (CA-03), Senator Lois Wolk, Assemblyman Bill Dodd and other community and conservation leaders at a dedication ceremony to commemorate the designation of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument. “After years of tireless work by countless numbers of people, the Berryessa Snow Mountain region finally has the permanent protection it deserves,” said Thompson. “It was an honor to join those who have been incredible partners and supporters in this effort at today’s dedication ceremony.” On July 10, 2015, President Barack Obama used the executive authority granted to him under the Antiquities Act to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Monument. Under this designation, the region will be permanently protected, ensuring continued recreational opportunities and providing a regional economic boost, while also safeguarding the region's beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters – which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Additionally, all currently owned federal lands within the boundary will be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed more efficiently and according to the site-specific needs. Thompson had introduced legislation in the House of Representatives with companion legislation championed by Senator Barbara Boxer in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses to provide permanent protection for the region. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches nearly one hundred miles from Northwest Solano County to the flanks of Snow Mountain. It encompasses nearly 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano Glenn, Colusa and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The area provides habitat to so many kinds of plants and animals that it has been named a biodiversity hotspot. Establishment of a National Monument will improve coordination between federal agencies and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. Studies have shown that a national monument designation could be beneficial to the surrounding economies. A study by the Winters Chamber of Commerce found protected public lands are major contributors to our country’s $646 billion outdoor recreation economy. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. The study also found that local economies surrounding national monuments expanded following the creation of a new national monument. Employment, personal income, and per capita income either continued or improved in each of the regions surrounding the national monuments studied. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. Many nationally recognized recreation and sportsmen groups support a national monument designation. The National Monument designation only applies to land managed by the federal government. Lake Berryessa is not included in the National Monument designation. In addition, the designation protects private property rights and does not impact motorized recreation on Lake Berryessa. All existing grazing will also continue unchanged under the designation. Motorized and mechanized travel will continue be allowed on designated roads and trails. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the National Monument and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The National Monument designation does not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.15.2016	Washington, DC – Yesterday, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council (PFMC), the Federal agency responsible for the management of West Coast salmon fisheries, released three options for California’s 2016 sport and commercial salmon fishing seasons. Each of those proposed options would cut the number of salmon fishing days for commercial fishing by more than 20 percent, with the most restrictive option for Fort Bragg cutting fishing days by 45 percent, representing a significant cut in this iconic and economically valuable fishery. In response to the news, congressional representatives from across the Bay-Delta region voiced concerns about the state of the salmon fishing industry and legislation that would further exacerbate salmon population declines, and urged their colleagues to instead pass comprehensive drought legislation that protects devastated Northern California salmon runs and the economic value they represent. The options proposed by the PFMC include effort reductions that range from 20 percent from last year all the way to complete closures in some areas. The proposed plans are available for public review until early April, at which point a final salmon season will be determined. California’s salmon fishing industry represents an economic value of approximately $1.4 billion, making the dire announcement — especially the option that would entirely eliminate commercial fishing during the coming season — of significant concern to California’s economy and jobs in coastal communities. The PFMC’s announcement yesterday comes at a vulnerable moment for fishing fleets, with fishermen facing simultaneous crises in California crab fisheries and declines in the Klamath salmon fishery and the Bay-Delta salmon fishery. Representatives Matsui, McNerney, DeSaulnier, and Thompson have all supported Congressman Huffman’s Drought Relief and Resilience Act, a range of short- and long-term solutions to stretch water supplies and build new clean water infrastructure, creating jobs without undermining environmental protections, preempting state laws, or redirecting impacts from one drought-stricken area to another. The legislation directs U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in consultation with state and federal agencies, to prepare a plan to address the impacts of drought on the salmon population. “The regulations released by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council for the upcoming salmon fishing season confirm that five years of drought have been devastating for the health of the Delta and the critical species that depend on the estuary for their survival,” said Thompson. “We’re now faced with three options for a limited fishing season, each one more devastating than the last for a $1.4 billion industry that supports 23,000 jobs. This verdict will make painfully clear the importance of sound water management that doesn’t prioritize south of delta interests over an industry on the brink of collapse.” “California’s salmon fishermen will unfortunately face further devastating losses and significant economic hardship this year, worsened by the constant push to divert more water from the Bay-Delta estuary,” said Rep. Huffman (CA-02). “Yesterday’s announcement confirms that this is not the time for Congress to weaken protections for salmon and their ecosystems. Unless we begin enacting both short and long-term solutions to our drought challenges, salmon fishermen will continue to pay the price. That’s why I am urging my colleagues to support my responsible drought legislation to achieve sustainable salmon runs and protect salmon fishing jobs, while building a more robust, resilient water supply for California.” “Our work to protect and restore California’s fisheries is an important element in our overall effort to protect the watershed,” said Congresswoman Doris Matsui (CA-06). “As we consider a balanced approach to the drought crisis, we must protect our region’s ecosystem – including Northern California salmon runs.” “The Pacific Fisheries Management Council report is another reminder that the drought and the resulting environmental degradation are having adverse effects on our West Coast salmon runs. We need to fight for solutions that don't make this problem worse and instead protect the livelihood of the farmers, fishermen, and families that depend on healthy salmon fisheries. We must work together to pass comprehensive legislation that provides drought relief without undermining crucial environmental laws and preserves these salmon runs for this critical industry,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-09). “Californians are counting on us to provide comprehensive and sustainable solutions to increase our water supplies without harming California’s fishing industry. As a former member of the Delta Protection Commission, I understand the importance of salmon conservation which is vital to local industry and to our economy,” said Congressman Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11). # # #
03.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $325,000.00 Department of Health and Human Services grant for Contra Costa County Health Services Department. The grant will be used to expand patient access to substance abuse services, with an emphasis on opioid abuse, for Contra Costa County’s homeless population. “Contra Costa County Health Services Department provides quality, affordable care for those in need in our community, said Thompson.” With this grant, they will be able to better address substance abuse and combat the growing epidemic of opioid abuse, improving health outcomes for homeless individuals in particular. I am proud to support this important work and I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Contra Costa County Health Services Department have the resources they need to meet the needs of our community.” Contra Costa County Health Services’ Health Care for the Homeless Medical Director, Dr. Joseph Mega, MD, MPH said, “We are very thankful to have been awarded a grant that will allow county-wide expansion of life-saving, effective pharmacotherapy and behavioral health support for the treatment of opioid addiction. We plan to use this funding to create an integrated, more easily accessible system to address the complex needs of the homeless. This will include expansion of sites that offer services, adding addiction specialists to our team and expanding licensing for physicians who wish to prescribe medication assisted therapy for opioid-dependent patients. We are hopeful that these services will decrease the rate of overdoses and deaths due to opioids and address one of the major factors contributing to homelessness in Contra Costa County.” Recent reports from the California Department of Public Health indicate that in Contra Costa County, drugs led to over 2,000 emergency room visits, over 550 hospitalizations and 93 deaths. Opioids led to 348 visits to the emergency room and almost 200 hospitalizations. Last week, Rep. Thompson hosted an educational forum on substance abuse and the dangers of self-medication. The forum brought together a panel of leaders in the effort to better understand and more effectively treat substance abuse at the federal, state and local level as well as by community organizations. Panelists provided an overview of the current trends and research of substance abuse and identified resources where community members and their families can go for help. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.14.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $406, 250.00 Department of Health and Human Services grant for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers (SRCHC). The grant will be used to expand patient access to substance abuse treatment and prevention programs, with an emphasis on addressing opioid abuse in underserved populations. “Santa Rosa Community Health Centers provides quality, affordable care for those in need in our community," said Thompson. "With this grant, they will be able to better address substance abuse and combat the growing epidemic of opioid abuse. I am proud to support this important work and I will continue to do everything I can to make sure Santa Rosa Community Health Centers have the resources they need to meet the needs of our community.” “This Substance Abuse Expansion funding from HRSA comes at a critical time for our community as addiction is an increasingly severe problem. Integrating medication-assisted treatment and other recovery services into the health center setting will provide patients with the education and support they need to curb opioid and other drug abuse and link them to treatment options,” said Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer at Santa Rosa Community Health Centers. Recent reports from the California Department of Public Health indicate that in Sonoma County, drugs led to over 900 emergency room visits, over 200 hospitalizations and 23 deaths. Opioids were responsible for almost 200 visits to the emergency room and over 80 hospitalizations. Last week, Rep. Thompson hosted an educational forum on substance abuse and the dangers of self-medication. The forum brought together a panel of leaders in the effort to better understand and more effectively treat substance abuse at the federal, state and local level as well as by community organizations. Panelists provided an overview of the current trends and research of substance abuse and identified resources where community members and their families can go for help. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.10.2016	NAPA, CA - U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and the California Earthquake Authority (CEA) today encouraged Napa homeowners to apply for grants of up to $3,000 made available by the Napa Earthquake Brace + Bolt Program (Napa EBB) to help strengthen their homes against earthquake damage. Registration for the grants, which are funded in part by a grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is open through March 22, 2016. The Napa EBB helps pay for seismic retrofits to houses that are most vulnerable to catastrophic damage in an earthquake: pre-1979 houses that aren’t bolted to their foundations, include a crawl space and have unbraced “cripple walls” (low walls between the foundation and first floor). In a strong earthquake, the crawl space is vulnerable to collapse, causing the home to slide off its foundation. Typical retrofits cost between $3,000 and $7,000 and involve bolting a house to its foundation and adding plywood or OSB bracing around the perimeter of the crawl space. “A brace and bolt retrofit can help prevent catastrophic damage to homes in a major earthquake,” said Thompson. "I encourage all Napa residents to take advantage of this opportunity and apply for Napa EBB grants to ensure that their home will be better prepared to withstand the next earthquake.” “Having earthquake insurance and completing seismic retrofits are two of the most effective steps homeowners can take to prepare for an earthquake,” said Glenn Pomeroy, chief executive officer of the California Earthquake Authority (CEA). “Also, this seismic retrofit would qualify a homeowner who lives in an older house for a discount on CEA earthquake insurance premium of up to 20 percent.” Napa EBB registration is open for homes in 94558 and 94559 ZIP Codes. Homeowners can find out if their home qualifies and apply through March 22nd by going to NapaBraceBolt.com. For homeowners, the Napa EBB grants are tax-free on both the state and federal levels. CEA is a publicly managed, privately funded, not-for-profit organization that provides residential earthquake insurance and works to encourage all Californians to take steps to reduce their risk of earthquake loss. CEA and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services established the California Residential Mitigation Program (CRMP) to help Californians strengthen their homes against damage from earthquakes. EBB is the first program developed by CRMP. CEA recently closed registration for $4.8 million in grants in 18 cities in Northern and Southern California, under its Earthquake Brace + Bolt Program (EBB), which was funded by the State of California and the CEA. More than 4,400 homeowners qualified for 1600 spots. On August 24, 2014, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. The earthquake damaged more than 1,500 homes and caused an estimated $362 million in damage to private homes and commercial properties, according to Napa County and the City of Napa. Following the earthquake, Rep. Thompson helped secure Presidential approval of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) disaster funds and Public Assistance (PA) disaster funds as well as Small Business Administration (SBA) loans. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.08.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today hosted an educational forum on substance abuse and the dangers of self-medication. The forum brought together a panel of leaders in the effort to better understand and more effectively treat substance abuse at the federal, state and local level as well as by community organizations. Panelists provided an overview of the current trends and research of substance abuse and identified resources where community members and their families can go for help. Panelists included Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane; Melissa Jones, Regional Director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; Don Braegar, Chief of the Substance Use Disorder Program with the Policy and Fiscal Division of the California Department of Health Care Services; Dr. Marina Tolou-Shams of the University of California, San Francisco; Cathy Boe, Clinical Supervisor with Aldea Behavioral Health Services’ Wolfe Center; and Garen Staglin, Founder of One Mind Institute and IMHRO. “Substance abuse burdens our country’s healthcare system and impacts the lives of our family members, friends and neighbors,” said Thompson. “We need to do all that we can to better understand, treat and prevent substance abuse. Today’s forum allowed for the collaboration that is needed between all levels of government and community organizations so that we can make meaningful progress to address this issue.” Sonoma County Supervisor Shirlee Zane said, “Long term use or misuse of opioids hijack the brain’s reward system causing permanent alterations in how the brain works. We need to approach and treat addiction like all other chronic diseases. Today’s forum was an invaluable opportunity to collaborate with stakeholders about how we can more effectively address addiction” Melissa Jones, Regional Director for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said, “The Administration is working to reduce the prevalence of substance use disorders through prevention, increasing access to treatment, and helping individuals recover from the disease of addiction. And we do this best when we all work together to develop and deliver innovative programs. I was fortunate to get to hear about the collaborative efforts by state and local government officials as well as other stakeholders doing exactly that.” In regard to his presentation, Don Braeger, chief of the DHCS Substance Use Disorder Program, Policy and Fiscal Division said, “Under this waiver, Medi-Cal members with substance use disorders will get the treatment they need at the right time and in the right place. This organized delivery system will improve treatment and recovery success for these patients.” Cathy Boe, Clinical Supervisor with Aldea Behavioral Health Services’ Wolfe Center said, “It's important to remember that people with substance use problems are doing the best they can, and we need to help them do better. By bringing together leaders in that effort for a collaborative discussion, today’s forum was an important step.” Dr. Marina Tolou-Shams said, “In nationwide surveys, California continues to rank among states reporting the highest rates of illicit drug use; critical forums such as these provide a unique opportunity for us to collectively and collaboratively address a local mounting adolescent and adult public health crisis.” Garen Staglin said, “Brain Health is the nation’s most important un-met medical need. Substance Abuse and addiction are the result of lack of proper care, treatments, and accessibility. Panels such as this will help us raise awareness to get the actions necessary to fill these needs.” The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates the impact of substance abuse on our healthcare system to be around $700 billion annually. Recent reports indicate that in Sonoma County drugs led to over 900 emergency room visits, over 200 hospitalizations and 23 deaths. Opioids were responsible for almost 200 visits to the emergency room and over 80 hospitalizations. In Napa County, drugs were responsible for almost 200 emergency room visits, 45 hospitalizations and 12 deaths. Opioids led to 40 visits to the emergency room and 20 hospitalizations. In Lake County, drugs led to over 200 emergency room visits, almost 100 hospitalizations and 23 deaths. Opioids led to 50 visits to the emergency room and 52 hospitalizations. In Solano County, drugs were responsible for almost 800 visits to the emergency room, over 140 hospitalizations and 21 deaths. Opioids led to 150 emergency room visits and almost 50 hospitalizations. In Contra Costa County, drugs led to over 2,000 emergency room visits, over 550 hospitalizations and 93 deaths. Opioids led to 348 visits to the emergency room and almost 200 hospitalizations.

02.18.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today hosted Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet for a roundtable discussion on SBA disaster loans and a tour of Lixit Animal Care Products in Napa. The roundtable discussion focused on the 2014 South Napa Earthquake and how SBA disaster loans were used to help small businesses, non-profits and others rebuild after the earthquake. Participants in the roundtable included officials from the SBA, the City and County of Napa, the Napa Valley Community Foundation, the Napa-Sonoma Small Business Development Center and local small business owners that received SBA disaster loans after the earthquake. “It was an honor to host SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet at today’s roundtable discussion,” said Thompson. “The SBA has provided over $40 million in assistance since the earthquake to help local business owners repair or replace damages and to help homeowners get back on their feet. The SBA’s disaster loan program is a great example of how the government can help people in times of need." Administrator Contreras-Sweet stated, “Congressman Thompson hosted a great day in Napa today, giving me a chance to see first-hand how SBA is having a positive impact on the region, especially after the 2014 earthquake. SBA was able to come in to the area and offer disaster assistance, to both business owners and homeowners. I'm delighted that the small businesses today affirmed the customer service level SBA's office of Disaster Assistance is delivering commensurate with those of America's top retailers. I stand by the expectation I have set for SBA. We are committed to continuing excellent customer service when Californians are in need.” On August 24, 2014, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. Estimates show that the earthquake caused $362 million in private damage, and $55 million in public damage. Following the earthquake, Rep. Thompson helped secure Presidential approval of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) disaster funds and Public Assistance (PA) disaster funds as well as SBA loans. Since the earthquake, the SBA has provided over $40 million in assistance. The SBA has approved 124 business loans, valued at over $9 million and 971 home loans, valued at over $30 million. Following the roundtable, the Administrator joined Rep. Thompson for a tour of Lixit Animal Care Products. “Lixit is an exceptional small business that we are fortunate to have right here in Napa,” said Thompson. “Lixit has worked with the SBA to build a successful business, creating good jobs for folks in our community. I was proud to share the fine work being done at Lixit with SBA Administrator Maria Contreras-Sweet.” Administrator Contreras-Sweet stated, “Our core services of access to capital, counseling and contracting are there to boost the entrepreneurial success of all small businesses. I am proud to see the work of Lixit, a woman-owned small business exporter that received an SBA loan. They are not only creating jobs for the Napa region, but are providing a sense of dignity and independence to the individuals with disabilities that they have been able to employ.” Based in Napa, Lixit manufactures small animal watering and feeding devices as well as animal care accessories. Lixit has over one hundred employees, including adults with disabilities. Lixit has received financing from the SBA to secure needed capital and was named Northern California’s SBA Business of the Year in 2006.

02.12.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today introduced the bipartisan Resource Protection Act (H.R. 4558), legislation to provide the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) the authority to collect civil damages from responsible parties for intentional injuries to all living and non-living resources within refuge lands and waters. “The USFWS shouldn’t have to use taxpayer dollars to cover the costs of repairing refuge resources that were intentionally damaged,” said Thompson. “My legislation could have saved the USFWS the money it spent to repair damages to the San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Other federal agencies, like the National Park Service, already have the authority to seek damages from responsible parties – and the USFWS should, too.” Currently, the USFWS does not have the explicit statutory authority to seek compensation from responsible parties for National Wildlife Refuge System resources that are injured or destroyed. When USFWS resources are damaged, the costs for repair and restoration fall upon the appropriated budget for the affected Refuge, often at the expense of recreational access and other Refuge programs. Both the National Park Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have the civil authority to address damage to national parks and national monuments, respectively. This legislation would put wildlife refuges, which host more than 48.5 million visitors and support more than $2.4 billion in local economies, on par with other public lands that are afforded this protection. The Resource Protection Act has bipartisan support in Congress and is supported by the National Wildlife Refuge Association. The Resource Protection Act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep.

02.11.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act (H.R. 4521), legislation to transfer recreation management at Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). “I introduced this legislation to put the right federal agency in charge of managing recreation at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “As it is currently structured, BOR - an agency tasked with managing water resources - is managing recreation at Lake Berryessa. BOR shouldn’t be responsible for recreation at the Lake because BOR doesn’t do recreation, BLM does. This legislation has strong support in the local community and has over 150 bipartisan cosponsors in Congress because transferring management to BLM is the right thing to do.” BOR, a water management agency, is currently responsible for managing concessions and recreation at Lake Berryessa. Transferring recreational management authority to BLM will allow for more effective management of concessions and recreation activities, which is needed to enhance the visitor experience, increase tourism and revitalize the local economy. BLM, the agency charged with managing outdoor recreation on our public lands, has extensive experience managing outdoor recreational activities, such as hiking, fishing, camping and boating. BLM is the federal agency best-suited to manage recreation at Lake Berryessa. The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act gives BLM the ability to implement a management plan that is appropriate for the Lake. The bill also provides protections for recreational uses and water rights, while allowing BOR to continue managing the Monticello Dam and its related facilities. The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act is supported by the Napa County Sherriff, the County of Napa and has over 150 bipartisan cosponsors in the House of Representatives. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.12.2016	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s State of the Union Address to Congress: “Tonight, President Obama offered an optimistic and long-term view for the heights our country can reach by working together. “Together we can build an economy where people have good jobs that allow them to get ahead, succeed, save for retirement and enjoy some long-term financial security. We can make it more affordable for kids to realize their dream of a college education. We can help save lives cut short by gun violence by simply agreeing to commonsense steps like closing loopholes that let criminals, terrorists, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill get their hands on firearms. We can address climate change before its impacts become irreversible. And we can root out terrorism and make our world and our country a safer place. “So much good can be achieved by working together. We have accomplished a lot during the President’s time in office but there is more we can do. The political divide in Washington should not be so large that we cannot come together to address our most pressing issues. We have it within our power to improve and save lives – we shouldn’t waste it. “And while we won’t solve all these challenges this year, or during the President’s time in office, this can and should be the year where we start addressing them. There is no excuse to wait.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
01.05.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, was at the White House today as President Obama announced executive actions to reduce and prevent gun violence. “It was an honor to join President Obama today as he announced commonsense steps that will reduce gun violence and save lives. These actions are focused on one main thing: keeping guns away from people who shouldn’t have them – criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Law abiding gun owners will not be impacted, and the communities in which we all live will be made safer,” said Thompson. “The President has done his job. Now it’s up to Congress to do ours. We need to finish the job and make sure anyone buying a gun through a commercial sale gets a background check. It’s our first line of defense against dangerous people getting guns.” The executive actions announced eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The executive actions clarify the term to state that anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, regularly making gun sales, and/or earning their livelihood from gun sales is “engaged in the business” and therefore must obtain a license and conduct criminal background checks, even if at a gun show or over the internet. Thompson sent a letter signed by 114 of his colleagues to the White House in November 2015 urging the President to close the background check loophole through executive action. In March 2015 a coalition of U.S. House members introduced H.R. 1217, the bipartisan King-Thompson background check legislation, officially known as the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015. The bill, authored by Thompson and Pete King (R-NY), expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. The King-Thompson bill was co-authored by Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Bob Dold, (R-IL), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Kathleen Rice (D-NY). Under the legislation, the current background check system would be expanded to require comprehensive and enforceable background checks on all commercial gun sales, such as those made at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, no system is in place to prevent these same prohibited purchasers from buying identical guns at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad with no questions asked because background checks are not required for these kinds of sales. The King-Thompson bill closes these loopholes.

01.04.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today released the following statement on President Obama’s executive actions to help prevent gun violence by expanding criminal background checks: “30-plus people are killed every day by someone using a gun, and the actions taken today by President Obama will help save some of those lives. I applaud this move and thank him for his relentless work on the issue of gun violence. “Make no mistake; the President’s executive actions will make our country safer by helping keep guns out of dangerous hands. And, they will only impact those who we all agree shouldn’t have guns: criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. “Because of the President’s actions, more people will have to get background checks, and that’s a good thing – but it doesn’t let Congress off the hook. Many firearms can still be bought and sold at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads with no questions asked. This allows dangerous people, who otherwise wouldn’t be able to pass a background check, to get guns. “We need to pass the bipartisan King-Thompson legislation that closes these remaining loopholes so criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill don’t have easy access to guns. “The President has done his part, now Congress needs to do ours. Let’s finish the job.” The executive actions announced today eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

01.04.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, returned to Washington, D.C. yesterday to meet with President Obama at the White House this afternoon. The meeting will be focused on measures the president can take to reduce and prevent gun violence. “The Republican leadership in Congress has done nothing as gun violence has seemingly become America’s new normal. The President and Democrats refuse to stand silently by. Today we are meeting with the President to discuss steps the administration can take to make our communities safer by keeping guns away from dangerous people. No one wants criminals, domestic abusers or the dangerously mentally ill to get guns, and that is where our efforts are focused. And since Republicans in Congress can’t even bring themselves to hold a vote, executive action is the best option to make our country safer and save lives.” In November, 2015, Thompson sent a letter signed by 114 of his colleagues to the White House in November, 2015, urging the president to close the background check loophole through executive action. Specifically, the Members of Congress are asked the president to eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Clarifying the term would require sellers determined to be "engaged in the business” to obtain a license and conduct criminal background checks. Currently, background checks are not required by federal law for sales made at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. The full text of the letter is below. President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500-0004 Mr. President: Gun violence continues to go unchecked in our country. Communities are ravaged and lives are senselessly cut short. Every day, close to 30 Americans are killed by someone using a gun. Following yet another horrific mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, it is unthinkable that our country can continue to turn a blind eye to these tragedies. However, despite tragedy after tragedy, the Republican Congress has not been willing to pass any meaningful legislation to strengthen laws to help keep guns out of the hands of individuals who pose an increased risk to public safety. In the face of Congressional inaction, your administration could take an immediate step that would have an important impact on limiting gun violence. Specifically, we urge that you address an aspect of the private sale loophole that allows guns to be sold without a background check, by eliminating the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). However, the regulatory definition of "engaged in the business," is exceptionally vague. As a result, individuals are able to sell guns at a high volume at gun shows, over the internet, or elsewhere without ever having becoming licensed and, in turn, without being compelled to conduct a simple background check before completing a sale. Updating the definition of “engaged in the business” to provide more explicit guidance as to which gun sellers are required to obtain a federal firearms license will help ensure that individuals are not able to continue to exploit this ambiguity in the current regulation and sell guns at a high volume without any oversight by ATF and without conducting background checks. This type of action is not without precedent, as many states have provided this type of explicit guidance regarding which vendors engaged in retail sales in the state are required to collect states’ sales tax. This change would be a positive step forward in closing the private sale loophole, a policy change that roughly 90 percent of Americans support. It would help ensure that those clearly holding themselves out as gun dealers are held to the same standard as the thousands of responsible gun dealers already licensed with ATF across the country. Thank you for your continued efforts to reduce gun violence and for your consideration of executive action that could save lives. We look forward to continuing to work together on ways to prevent gun violence. Sincerely, Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
12.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today the launch of the second annual Congressional App Challenge for the 5th Congressional District. Established by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this nationwide competition invites high school students from all participating congressional districts to compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app,” for mobile, tablet, or computer devices. It is designed to promote innovation and engagement in the STEM education fields. “The Congressional App Challenge is a great opportunity for students to get involved in the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields,” said Thompson. “Over the next ten years, nearly 9 million STEM jobs are expected to be created. However, we also face a shortage of STEM graduates. The Congressional App Challenge will help build interest and encourage our students to pursue an education in STEM fields.” The Congressional App Challenge is open to all high school students who live in or are eligible to attend public high schools located in the 5th Congressional District. In order to participate in the competition, students must submit their app’s source code online by midnight on January 15, 2016 EST, as well as provide a video demo explaining their app and what they learned through this competition process. More details on submitting a contest entry, the rules of the competition, and helpful programming resources can be found at www.congressionalappchallenge.us Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) voted today to pass H.R. 2029, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This measure funds the government for FY 2016. “This bill is far from perfect but it averts a disastrous government shutdown, makes investments that help working people, and will benefit communities in our district,” said Thompson. “Next year we need to build on this compromise and avoid governing from crisis-to-crisis and cliff-to-cliff.” The legislation includes these important measures: Infrastructure: Maintains the funding for the popular TIGER Grants at the 2015 level of $500 million, and provides $353 million for proposed small starts projects. The Small Starts program provides grants for capital costs associated with new fixed guideway systems, extensions, and bus corridor improvements such as Sonoma County’s SMART Train. Fire Management: Invests $4.2 billion for wildland fire management. Solar energy: Extends the solar investment tax credit through 2021 much as Thompson’s New Energy for America Act (H.R.2412) would do. National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS): Provides $73 million to strengthen our background check system to keep guns out of the hands of criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Housing Assistance: Provides $17.7 billion for Section 8 housing assistance, which is a $195 million increase from 2015. Conservation: Includes a three year reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation fund which has contributed nearly $10 million dollars to California’s 5th District since the program started. Additionally, the bill reauthorizes the Pittman-Robertson funding for North American Wetlands Conservation Act grants. Salmon: Provides $91.5 million for salmon management, including funding for threatened and endangered Pacific salmon species. Crude by Rail: Provides Crude oil training program for first responders. This was part of Rep. Mike Thompson’s Crude-By-Rail Safety Act (HR 1804). National Guard: Provides $125 million increase in funding for the National Guard Counter-Drug Program. Law Enforcement: Provides $212 million for the federal COPS program, of which $187 million is for hiring. Additional it provides $347.1 million for Byrne-JAG program, which is a $14.4 million increase from 2015. County of Origin Labeling (COOL): Repeals COOL, which will avoid tariff retaliation on California wine, after The World Trade Organization determined earlier this year that such labeling violates our trade commitments by treating imported livestock less favorably than domestic livestock. Postal service: Provides for the continuation of six-day and rural mail delivery and states that none of the funds provided by this bill may be used to close or consolidate small or rural post offices. Education: The bill restores $2.5 billion in education funding and also makes additional investments of $1.4 billion above 2015, in such areas as Title I that serves 24 million at-risk students. Early Learning: Invests $600 million more than 2015 in Head Start. Medical Research: Provides $2 billion more than 2015 for this life-saving research. The legislation also does not include a number of ideological riders such as measures to defund Planned Parenthood or family planning services, prohibit Department of Justice (DOJ) funds from being used to defend immigration reform policies in court, or blocked efforts to combat climate change. H.R. 2029 passed by a vote of 316-113.

12.17.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.R. 2029, legislation that extends or makes permanent numerous tax provisions but isn’t paid for and would add upwards of $680 billion to the national debt. Those tax provisions made permanent include conservation easements, the research and development tax credit, Section 179 capital expensing for small businesses, and expanded versions of the Child Tax Credit, Earned Income Tax Credit and the American Opportunity Tax Credit for college expenses. “This bill contains a number of polices that I have long supported, and it even includes a conservation provision that I’ve championed since coming to Congress,” said Thompson. “The fact that I’m voting against today’s bill, speaks volumes to just how fiscally reckless this legislation is. We should enact polices like conservation easements and the R&D Tax Credit. They’re good for our country. But we can’t do it by forcing our kids and grandkids to foot a nearly $700 billion bill.” The legislation passed the House by a vote of 318-109. It now goes to the Senate for consideration.
12.16.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on the Dickey Amendment’s, which bans gun violence research by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), inclusion omnibus bill: “The inclusion of this rider is outrageous. 30-plus people are being killed every day by someone using a gun, and House Republicans refuse to even take the most basic steps to help lesson this loss of life. Here’s how you know the Dickey Amendment needs to be thrown out: medical professionals say so, scientific researches say so, and Jay Dickey himself says so. “No one can offer one good reason to keep this ban in place. This rider has prohibited experts at the CDC from researching the causes and best ways to prevent gun violence for nearly 20 years. The omnibus bill gave us a chance to fix that, but once again Republicans refused to simply get out of the way and let our experts do what they do best – conduct research that will save some lives.” On December 1st, former Republican U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey sent a letter to Thompson in which he called for the Dickey Amendment to be repealed, and for federal research to be conducted on the causes of gun violence, provided that nothing is done to infringe the rights of gun ownership. In his letter Dickey writes, “Research could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners, in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile… it is my position that somehow or someway we should slowly but methodically fund such research until a solution is reached. Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.” The Dickey Amendment, authored in 1996, effectively blocked the CDC from carrying out the necessary research to better understand how to prevent gun violence The full text of Dickey’s letter is below. GUN VIOLENCE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH NEEDED December 1, 2015 Many years ago the highway industry took on studying from a scientific viewpoint how head on collisions could be reduced. They didn’t include in their scope of study the elimination of the automobile, which would have been a simple solution, but what came out of this were three or four foot barricades that are placed in between lanes of traffic in our interstate highway system. We have all seen these fences, but what isn’t generally known is how overwhelmingly successful this project has become. Back in 1998, I took part in cutting off gun violence research dollars at the federal level because of what was considered a misapplication of the dollars by the CDC. I have recently expressed my regrets that we didn’t continue that research with the provision that nothing shall be done in this project to infringe the rights of gun ownership as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution in the Second Amendment. Research could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners, in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile. There is no ready answer to the question “How are we going to accomplish the desired result of reducing gun violence under these circumstances?” For sure the same dilemma faced the scientists in the highway industry some years ago. The highway industry answered the question of how to reduce traffic fatalities through scientific research. In the same way, scientific research should help answer how we can best reduce gun violence. Even though my opinion and the opinion of my colleague, Dr. Mark Rosenberg, have been spread to media outlets all over our country, there has been only one member of Congress who has expressed any support for this endeavor. I can tell that member that though there is no groundswell of agreement, at least I have not been tarred and feathered and run out of town…yet. To sum this up, it is my position that somehow or someway we should slowly but methodically fund such research until a solution is reached. Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.

12.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement calling on omnibus negotiators to end the 19-year-long ban on federal research into the causes and best ways to prevent gun violence: “Doctors agree, medical professionals agree, even the author of the amendment agrees: it’s time to do away with the Dickey Amendment and let our experts do what they do best – conduct research that will save some lives. For nearly 20 years, experts at the CDC have been prohibited from reaching the causes and best ways to prevent gun violence. The omnibus bill gives us a chance to fix this.

12.07.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1,975,339 Emergency Relief (ER) grant for the repair or reconstruction of federal-aid highways and roads on federal lands that have suffered serious damage as a result of the Valley Fire. The funds come from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). “The Valley Fire caused untold amounts of damage to critical infrastructure, and we’re just in the initial stages of the repair process,” said Thompson. “It’s going to be long way back. There is a lot of rebuilding in front of us, and road repairs are a big part of it. These funds will help us continue our progress.” ER funds are awarded to a State after the President or the Governor issues a formal emergency declaration and the State files a request for ER for the cost of damages to its eligible highways. Eligible repair work includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential traffic, minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining facilities as well as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition. The Valley Fire has caused significant damage to area highways. The highway damage involves pavements, signs, guardrails and safety features, destabilized slopes and embankments, and debris from trees and burned structures.

12.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today filed a discharge petition to bring H.R. 1076, the Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act of 2015, to the floor for a vote. For a discharge petition to be successful, a majority of the House must sign it. If a majority signs the petition, then the House must hold an up-or-down vote to bring the bill to the floor for consideration. The legislation, authored by Rep. Peter King (R-NY), and co-authored by Thompson, would prohibit the sale of firearms to individuals on the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) Terrorists Watch List. This legislation was originally crafted in 2007 and endorsed by President Bush’s Justice Department. It has bipartisan support in the House. Thompson spoke today on the floor about the discharge petition. The text of his remarks is below. “Mr. Speaker, terrorists shouldn’t be able to legally buy guns. “However, right now, someone on the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist can go into a gun store and buy a firearm of their choosing – legally. “Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the U.S. “Last week, House Republicans voted three times to protect the ability of suspected terrorists to continue buying guns. “This made our country less safe. “That’s why I just filed a discharge petition that would allow us to vote on a bipartisan bill to close the terror list loophole. “The bill makes sure those on the FBI’s Terrorists Watchlist can’t walk into a gun store, pass a background check, and buy a gun. “If House Republicans are concerned about the accuracy of the list, let’s scrub the list. “If you agree that terrorists shouldn’t be able to have guns, then put your name down in writing and let’s have a vote.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.02.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today released a letter from former Republican U.S. Rep. Jay Dickey in which he calls for the Dickey Amendment to be repealed, and for federal research to be conducted on the causes of gun violence, provided that nothing is done to infringe the rights of gun ownership. The Dickey Amendment, authored in 1996, effectively blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC from carrying out the necessary research to better understand how to prevent gun violence. “I commend Jay Dickey for taking this stand. As gun owners, we want to protect the Second Amendment. But at the same time, we recognize the fact that we can safeguard those rights while also allowing our expert scientists to conduct research on how to best prevent gun violence,” said Thompson. “There is not one good reason to keep this ban in place. Gun violence takes the lives of 30-plus Americans every single day. There are experts who are ready and able to look into what can be done to stop it. The problem right now is that they’re hamstrung. Doctors agree, medical professionals agree, even the author of the amendment agrees: it’s time to let our experts do what they do best – conduct research that will save some lives.” In his letter Dickey writes, “Research could have been continued on gun violence without infringing on the rights of gun owners, in the same fashion that the highway industry continued its research without eliminating the automobile… it is my position that somehow or someway we should slowly but methodically fund such research until a solution is reached. Doing nothing is no longer an acceptable solution.” Thompson’s task force, created in the aftermath of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, recommended that Congress should act to restore funding for research aimed at reducing gun violence. Today on Capitol Hill, physicians with Doctors for America joined the National Physicians Alliance, Doctors Council, American Medical Women’s Association, American College of Preventive Medicine, The Committee of Interns and Residents, Physicians for the Prevention of Gun Violence, American Medical Student Association, and American Academy of Pediatrics released a petition signed by more than 2,000 doctors in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia urging Congress to remove these barriers to common sense research that have existed for nearly 20 years and include annual funding to identify causes and ways to prevent gun violence. The full text of Dickey’s letter is below.

11.23.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today sent a letter signed by 114 of his colleagues calling on the White House to take action to reduce gun violence. The letter urges the president to close the background check loophole through executive action. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) lead a letter signed by 24 senators also asking the President to take executive action to close the background check loophole. “The Republican leadership in Congress continues to sit on their hands as gun violence becomes America’s new normal. Thirty-plus people a day are being killed by someone using a gun, yet the majority refuses to take the simple and commonsense step of passing legislation that would help keep guns out of dangerous hands. Since Congress won’t step up, the President should. Through executive action he can help keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. Something needs to be done and since Republicans in Congress can’t even bring themselves to hold a vote, this is the best option to make our country safer and save lives.” Specifically, the Members of Congress are asking the president to eliminate the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Clarifying the term to state that anyone selling guns in a high-volume, even if it be at a gun show or over the internet, is “engaged in the business” would require these sellers to obtain a license and conduct criminal background checks. Currently, background checks are not required by federal law for sales made at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. The full text of the letter is below . President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500-0004 Mr. President: Gun violence continues to go unchecked in our country. Communities are ravaged and lives are senselessly cut short. Every day, close to 30 Americans are killed by someone using a gun. Following yet another horrific mass shooting in Roseburg, Oregon, it is unthinkable that our country can continue to turn a blind eye to these tragedies. However, despite tragedy after tragedy, the Republican Congress has not been willing to pass any meaningful legislation to strengthen laws to help keep guns out of the hands of individuals who pose an increased risk to public safety. In the face of Congressional inaction, your administration could take an immediate step that would have an important impact on limiting gun violence. Specifically, we urge that you address an aspect of the private sale loophole that allows guns to be sold without a background check, by eliminating the ambiguity surrounding the term: “engaged in the business” as it pertains to federally licensed firearms dealers. Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform background checks for all gun sales, and only those individuals deemed to be "engaged in the business" of dealing in guns are required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). However, the regulatory definition of "engaged in the business," is exceptionally vague. As a result, individuals are able to sell guns at a high volume at gun shows, over the internet, or elsewhere without ever having becoming licensed and, in turn, without being compelled to conduct a simple background check before completing a sale. Updating the definition of “engaged in the business” to provide more explicit guidance as to which gun sellers are required to obtain a federal firearms license will help ensure that individuals are not able to continue to exploit this ambiguity in the current regulation and sell guns at a high volume without any oversight by ATF and without conducting background checks. This type of action is not without precedent, as many states have provided this type of explicit guidance regarding which vendors engaged in retail sales in the state are required to collect states’ sales tax. This change would be a positive step forward in closing the private sale loophole, a policy change that roughly 90 percent of Americans support. It would help ensure that those clearly holding themselves out as gun dealers are held to the same standard as the thousands of responsible gun dealers already licensed with ATF across the country. Thank you for your continued efforts to reduce gun violence and for your consideration of executive action that could save lives. We look forward to continuing to work together on ways to prevent gun violence. Sincerely,
11.20.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $100,000 United States Department of Agricultural (USDA) grant for the County of Sonoma Department of Health Services. With the funds, the Department of Health Services will work with key partners to expand farm to preschool programs at fifteen school-based pre-kindergarten sites serving low income families throughout Sonoma County. “This federal investment into Sonoma County will both help kids eat better and support our local farms,” said Thompson. “I’m proud to support this grant and commend Sonoma County for their leadership in putting healthy, locally grown foods on our schools’ menus.” Activities supported by this grant will include: Harvest of the Month educational tasting kits of farm fresh produce; Procurement of locally grown foods into prekindergarten meal programs; Increased hands-on learning in on-site gardens with support; and The development of comprehensive wellness policies that include farm to preschool language Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.18.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $145,101 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing (VASH) Project Based Voucher grant for the Housing Authority of the City of Napa. The grant will provide 17 Section 8 VASH vouchers for the Valley View Senior Homes. “No veteran who served our nation in uniform should live without a roof over their head and the benefits they’ve earned when they take the uniform off,” said Thompson. “We have a responsibility to those who served, and making sure they have adequate housing and access to VA services is at the top of the list. These grants will provide veterans with homes and better the lives of them and their families. It’s a proud day for our county.” Valley View Senior Homes is a 69-unit senior housing project being developed in American Canyon. With this award of VASH vouchers, the Housing Authority will be able to provide rental assistance to 17 chronically homeless veterans. Through the VASH program, these veterans will also receive supportive services on-site through the VA. This is the first VASH award ever received in Napa County. “How appropriate that, just as we are honoring our veterans on Veterans Day, we learned that we will be able to provide a home for 17 chronically homeless veterans right here in American Canyon. We are particularly pleased that the grant provides not only housing, but also a range of support services for these veterans in order to ensure their successful transition to a stable home environment. Thanks to the City of Napa Housing Authority and Satellite Affordable Housing Associates for partnering with us on this project, the first of its kind in Napa County,” said American Canyon Mayor Leon Garcia. “This is an example of what we can do when we share resources and staff to bring funding to Napa County,” said Napa Mayor Jill Techel.

10.28.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted in favor of H.R. 1314, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. The agreement raises the debt limit until March 15, 2017, and sets increased spending levels for two years by partially rolling back sequestration cuts by $80 billion, which will be split equally between defense and nondefense spending. The agreement also mitigates increases in Medicare Part B premiums that were forecast to impact certain beneficiaries in 2016, limits Part B deductible increases for all Medicare beneficiaries, and it keeps the Social Security disability insurance trust fund solvent until 2022. “While the bipartisan budget agreement isn’t perfect, it is better than continuing to govern crisis-to-crisis and cliff-to-cliff,” said Thompson. “It doesn’t include everything I want, nor does it include everything Republicans want. However, it helps keep our government open, makes sure we pay our bills on time, and eases job-killing, across-the-board sequestration cuts. With some stability now in place, both parties should use this modest compromise as a framework to come together to work on a long-term budget solution that puts people to work, lowers our debt and invests in our future.” The bill passed by a bipartisan vote of 266-167. It now goes to the Senate for consideration. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.19.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Department of Treasury decided, at his urging, to allow Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) sites to more easily qualify for economic development funds though the New Markets Tax Credits (NMTC) Program. In a letter sent in March, Thompson requested that Treasury expand the universe of NMTC qualifying criteria to include BRAC sites. Treasury recently responded favorably to Thompson’s request. This provides private entities with an incentive to invest in BRAC areas. “These tax credits are job and revenue creators that can help resurrect communities that have been devastated by military base realignments and closures. They have already proven successful, and because of our work with Treasury, even more BRAC communities will be able to qualify,” said Thompson. “By expanding these high-value tax credits to BRAC areas like Mare Island, we can put people back to work, create new jobs, and help communities grow their economy.” The NMTC program targets low-income communities suffering from chronic unemployment and high poverty rates by providing investors with a 39 percent federal tax credit to help reduce unemployment and support economic growth. In the 5th Congressional District, Mare Island Naval Shipyard, which was closed in 1996, could be eligible for the tax credits made available due to Thompson’s work with Treasury. To qualify as an area of “higher distress,” a site must meet at least two qualifying criteria. Under Treasury’s new rules, being a BRAC site will count towards being considered “higher distressed.” If an area is considered to be “higher distressed,” investors can qualify for increased economic development tax credits to help boost the area’s economy. A full list of qualifying factors can be found here. Under the NMTC program, private entities are provided with tax credits to incentivize investments in so-called distressed areas. When an entity applies for tax credits through the NMTC program, their application is scored more favorably if at least 75 percent of their investment is being made in a “highly distressed” area. For example, if an entity wants to invest in Mare Island, its NMTC application would now be scored more favorably due to BRAC sites being a qualifying factor. Over the past several decades, hundreds of military installations around the country have been realigned or closed altogether through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, as well as through other base closure laws, leaving communities scrambling to make up for the lost jobs and revenue. Currently, when a military base is closed, the Department of Defense (DOD) is required to complete any necessary environmental cleanup at the former base and then transition the property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA). Together, DOD’s Office of Economic Adjustment and the LRA create a redevelopment plan for the property. The goal of this process is to lead to a timely, beneficial, revenue generating reuse of these former military bases. However, numerous military installation cleanups take much longer and cost much more than expected, significantly delaying their reuse and causing many of these communities to become or remain economically distressed. Treasury’s decision helps address this by allowing BRAC areas to more easily qualify for tax credits through the NMTC program. The NMTC program has proven effective at growing local economies and creating jobs. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, every $1 invested through the NMTC program generates $12 of private investment. Using the NMTC program, Brunswick, Maine has successfully redeveloped a former Naval Air Station into a $15 million, 80,000 square foot medical manufacturing facility. A second NMTC was also used in Brunswick, Maine to make $20 million in renovations to facilities now operated by a private aircraft manufacturer. However, this project could have been three times as large had additional NMTC funds been available. Combined, these two projects will bring more than 200 high-tech, high-wage jobs and other significant economic benefits to this former military community. Last Congress, Thompson introduced bipartisan legislation to expand the NMTC program by authorizing up to $100 million per year for distressed communities that have had military installations closed or realigned. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
10.09.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Public Assistance (PA) funds will be available to eligible applicants such as state and local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations in Lake County. This is funding for local communities to use to repair critical public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure and sewage collection facilities. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and locals governments split the remaining 25 percent. “The federal response to the Valley Fire has been nothing short of spectacular,” said Thompson. “Working with FEMA and other federal agencies we have been able to rapidly secure funds to help suppress the fire, repair our towns, reopen businesses and rebuild people’s homes. We face a long and hard road back, but this assistance will help make sure we fully recover.” Thompson also announced that Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Individual Assistance (IA) funds will be available to help individuals rebuild, repair and replace housing and other personal property not covered by insurance. Thompson wrote to the White House, urging the President to approve IA. Thompson also had conversations with the White House and Regional Administrator for FEMA Region IX Robert J.

FEMA previously approved the State of California’s request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant declaration for the Valley Fire. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP) allows for the “mitigation, management, and control” of fires burning on publicly or privately owned forest or grasslands which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. The FEMA grant will cover 75 percent of the costs for various fire suppression, safety and recovery needs. Eligible costs include: Costs for equipment and supplies Costs for emergency work such as evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); Costs for State emergency operations center Costs for the pre-positioning of Federal, out-of-State, and international resources for up to 21 days Cost of personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety Costs for field camps and meals Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs Costs for the temporary repair of damage cause by firefighting activities Costs for the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on co-mingled Federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another Federal agency. The Valley Fire, which started on September 12, 2015 has burned nearly 80,000 acres. The fire destroyed more than 1,900 structures, including more than 1,200 homes. Thousands of people have been displaced.

10.09.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1.5 million Defense Department grant for Riptide Bioscience, Inc. Riptide Bioscience is based in Vallejo on Mare Island. The grant, part of the US Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA), will go towards a research project titled the “Evaluation of Novel Antimicrobial Peptides as Topical Anti-Infectives with Broad Spectrum Activity Against Combat-Related Bacterial and Fungal Wound Infections.” "For several years, Riptide has been doing cutting-edge medical research right here in Vallejo," said Thompson. "Their research into wound-healing applications will provide great benefits to those in our military as well as the general population. Some 75 percent of recent war injuries are the result of ballistic wounds, and our Riptide is finding new and better methods to fight infections that result from those wounds. Their work will benefit our local economy, and I'm proud to support this kind of leading medical science emerging from our district." Henry Lopez, Executive Vice President of Riptide, said, "The research funded by this grant has huge potential to improve outcomes for war-wounded servicemen and women, and also civilian patients suffering from everyday wounds and trauma." Lopez continued, "This grant was one of only five funded in a tremendously competitive process involving some 280 applications from top research institutions across the nation. So we see it as powerful affirmation for the peptide-based therapeutics Riptide is developing." L. Edward Clemens, Principal Investigator on the Defense Department project, added, "As exciting as it is to improve the medical science behind wound healing, the work done here may have even wider application. One of the biggest challenges in our health system is the growing resistance of bacteria to conventional antibiotics. As those drugs are more widely used, bacteria mutate around the metabolic pathways the drugs use to kill germs. This is a crisis in the making. Some estimates suggest that in just a few years, antimicrobial resistance will lead to more deaths than cancer and diabetes combined." "But Riptide's agents don't work through the usual pathways," Clemens continued. They kill bacteria in ways much harder to mutate around. We expect these drugs to be a big part of the medical armament against the germs of the future." Riptide Bioscience’s research involves the development of Designed Host Defense Peptides (dHDPs). HDPs are small molecular weight proteins that fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.

10.08.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today introduced a resolution to establish a Select Committee of the House to study gun violence. The committee would be comprised of six Republicans and six Democrats. It would issue a final report and recommendations, including legislative proposals within 60 days of its establishment. The resolution is co-sponsored by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and the 11 vice-chairs of Thompson’s Task Force. “This House Majority has created committees to bully Planned Parenthood and harass a presidential candidate, all the while allowing mass gun violence to go unchecked and unexamined on their watch,” said Thompson. “There have been nearly 280 mass shootings since Newtown and Congress has done nothing. No votes have been cast. No bills have been debated. No proposals have even been considered. This Select Committee can change that. We’re offering Republicans a seat at the table. We want to hear their thoughts and ideas. We want to work with them. No proposal is going to stop every shooting, but we can come up with solutions that stop some tragedies. Failing to come to the table is equal to sitting by and allowing mass gun violence to become America’s new normal. Congress has a responsibility to do better than that. We need to step up, pull together and address this problem. It is within our power to do something to help save lives. Let’s not waste it.” The Select Committee on Gun Violence would study and make recommendations to address the following: The causes of mass shootings Methods to improve the Federal firearms purchaser background check system Connections between access to firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals Federal penalties for trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms Loopholes that allow some domestic abusers continued access to firearms Linkages between firearms and suicide Gun violence’s effect on public health The correlation between State gun violence prevention laws and the incidence of gun violence The importance of having reliable and accurate information on gun violence and its toll on our Nation The implementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance with the Second Amendment to the Constitution Rates of gun violence in large metropolitan areas Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.07.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has listed the Historic Franklin Station Post Office in downtown Napa for sale. The property has been placed on multiple real estate listing databases. In August, the USPS agreed at Thompson’s urging to stop pursuing the demolition of the Historic Franklin Station Post Office in downtown Napa and instead pursue the sale of the earthquake-damaged building and property with the stipulation that the buyer would repair the building in accordance with all applicable laws and protective covenants intended to preserve the architectural integrity of the building. The Franklin Station Post Office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. “Selling the post office is the best way to preserve this historic structure, and I am very pleased that USPS and Postmaster General Brennan are working with me and our community to save the property,” said Thompson. “The Franklin Station Post Office is one of our community’s crown jewels. It’s a beautiful part or our history and no one wanted to see it destroyed. By selling the post office, we can make sure this wonderful structure is around for many generations to enjoy.” There will be an advertising email campaign to the Bay Area commercial real estate community and a “For Sale” sign is placed on the building. There is no price listed because the sale will be done through a bidding process. Prospective Buyers must contact the CBRE Brokerage team in order to schedule a tour. Tours will be conducted October 26, November 9, and November 16. Prospective Buyers may also bring consultants, appraisers and other relevant personnel on these tours. Prospective buyers can contact Don LeBuhn at (415)772-0248/don.lebuhn@cbre.com if they have questions about the listing or to schedule a tour. Withn 30 days after the marketing and touring period concludes, CBRE will announce a “Call for Offer” date and bidding instructions will be communicated to all interested parties. All bids must be submitted by the deadline and will subsequently be evaluated by USPS. In August, the USPS submitted a letter to California’s State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) requesting a permit to demolish the post office. However, Thompson led an effort to find an alternative solution. Thompson discussed the potential sale of the historic post office with Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan and hosted a meeting with USPS officials in his Washington, D.C. office. He led the effort to involve the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which will now act as a consulting party in the consultation process the USPS initiated with SHPO under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Franklin Station Post Office was commissioned in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency tasked with carrying out public works projects which employed millions of out-of-work Americans. The ornate post office was built in the art deco architectural style. The USPS originally proposed to demolish the building due to the cost of repairing damage caused by the August 2014 earthquake.

10.05.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $2.625 million Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Department of Education (ED) grant for Napa Valley College (NVC). The grant will be paid over a five-year period. The Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program provides grants to assist HSIs to expand educational opportunities for all students and with a special focus on improving the educational attainment of Hispanic college students. The HSI Program grants also enable HSIs to expand and enhance their academic offerings, program quality, and institutional stability. “These federal dollars will strengthen our community by helping make sure someone’s first language isn’t a barrier to fully achieving his or her educational goals,” said Thompson. “I know first-hand the impact Napa Valley College can have on a student’s life. I’m Napa Valley College alum. I came to the school as a high school dropout with an Army-earned GED. Napa Valley College got my life on track. It’s an outstanding institution dedicated to bettering the lives of its students, and these funds will allow them to build on their great work.” Commenting on the award, NVC Vice President of Student Services Oscar DeHaro stated, “Napa Valley College is extremely honored to be recognized as a deserving federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution worthy of the investment of these public dollars. The award of this grant reinforces the resources available to all in our community and recognizes the urgent economic need of increasing college education access and completion for Hispanic students in California.” NVC will use the funds to develop a Statistics Pathway course and dual language courses in the sciences. The Statistics Pathway course will provide students with an intensive 6-unit course with content from pre-algebra, elementary and intermediate algebra contextualized in data analysis. The dual languages courses will help bridge the gap in academic language fluency. They will incorporate Spanish language materials into course materials, allowing Spanish speaking students in these to achieve better academic success, higher levels of recall to test better, and attain better grades on oral and written exams. Additional pieces funded in the grant are personnel for instruction and academic advising along with other interventions to help ensure student success.

10.02.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today called on Congressional Republicans to act on commonsense gun violence prevention laws in the aftermath of another mass shooting, this time at Umpqua Community College (UCC) in Roseberg, Oregon. “Every single time a mass shooting happens we go through the same routine. Thoughts and prayers are sent. Statements are made. Stories are written. And nothing changes. Yesterday it was nine people at a community college. A month ago it was a news reporter and cameraman in Virginia. Two months before that it was a prayer group in Charleston. Mass gun violence has become as commonplace as it is tragic. “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. Congressional Republicans have done nothing over and over again and, predictably, the results have been the same: more innocent lives lost, more families forever changed, and more mass gun violence. “Hours before the UCC shooting 147 bipartisan Members of Congress sent Speaker Boehner a letter urging him to act on gun violence prevention. The five brave co-authors of our background check bill notwithstanding, Republicans have done nothing. Republicans have a majority in Congress, and a White House and Democratic Caucus willing to work with them. All they need to do is get off their hands and act. “Let’s have this time be different. This time, let’s actually pull together and do something to make our country safer.” Thompson has introduced legislation to expand criminal background checks to all commercial guns sales and to expand existing federal prohibitors as it relates to mental health, substance abuse, history of violence, and other risk factors. The full text of the letter to Speaker Boehner is below. October 1, 2015 The Honorable John Boehner Speaker U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 2015 Dear Speaker Boehner, Gun violence affects every District and every community in America. We were all shocked and saddened by the senseless deaths of the victims of the Sandy Hook tragedy and have vowed that we would not let this happen again. Sadly, since then, America has been witness to at least 53 mass shootings[1]. Every day in this country, more than thirty people die as a result of gun violence.[2] This does not even address the individual victims of domestic violence or other vicious crimes that destroy families and communities. Our children should be safe in schools. People should be allowed to worship without threat of violence. Walking the neighborhoods of our cities should not be a high-risk activity. It is long past time that Congress addresses this national epidemic. We must ensure that guns do not make it into the hands of criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. We can do this without infringing on Constitutionally guaranteed rights. We call on you to bring to the Floor legislation that can protect innocent lives while safeguarding the rights of law abiding gun owners. No legislation will stop every tragedy, but passing commonsense gun laws will at least stop some. It is the least we can do to honor the memory of those we’ve lost to gun violence and prevent that list from growing. Sincerely,
09.30.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $279,467 Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Fair Housing Initiative Program (FHIP) grant for Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center (GNVFHC). This grant will fund the agency's fair housing enforcement, education and outreach work. This includes the implementation of fair housing investigations, trainings and presentations, and related activities that promote GNVFHC's mission to eliminate housing discrimination and ensure equal housing opportunity for all people. “A person’s race or ethnicity has absolutely no place in determining whether or not they can rent or buy at home,” said Thompson. “If people are discriminated against when trying to find a place to live, quality assistance like that offered by GNVFHC should be available. I am proud to support this grant and the work of GNVFHC.” “Greater Napa Valley Fair Housing Center is honored to be awarded this funding,” said Pablo Zatarain, Program Manager at GNVFHC. “These funds will allow GNVFHC to more effectively serve the residents of the region, and will supplement the resources the agency has at its disposal to meet our clients' needs.” Fair housing organizations and other non-profits that receive funding through the Fair Housing Initiatives Program (FHIP) assist people who believe they have been victims of housing discrimination. FHIP organizations partner with HUD to help people identify government agencies that handle complaints of housing discrimination. They also conduct preliminary investigation of claims, including sending "testers" to properties suspected of practicing housing discrimination. Testers are minorities and whites with the same financial qualifications who evaluate whether housing providers treat equally-qualified people differently. In addition to funding organizations that provide direct assistance to individuals who feel they have been discriminated against while attempting to purchase or rent housing, FHIP also has initiatives that promote fair housing laws and equal housing opportunity awareness. The grant for GNVFHC is a Private Enforcement Initiative (PEI). PEIs are multi-year grants that are reoccurring for up to three years as long as the grantee maintains satisfactory performance.

09.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $2 million Emergency Relief (ER) grant for the repair or reconstruction of federal-aid highways and roads on federal lands that have suffered serious damage as a result of the Valley Fire. The funds come from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHA). “The Valley Fire is the third worst fire in California’s history and has caused untold amounts of damage to critical infrastructure,” said Thompson. “There is a lot of rebuilding and recovery ahead of us, and repairing our roads is a big part of that process. I commend the FHA for their swift approval of these funds. They will help greatly as our community works to gets back on its feet.” ER funds are awarded to a State after the President or the Governor issues a formal emergency declaration and the State files a request for ER for the cost of damages to its eligible highways. Eligible repair work includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential traffic, minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining facilities as well as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition. The Valley Fire, which started on September 12, 2015 has burned nearly 76,000 acres and is currently 69 percent contained. 1,238 homes have been destroyed. 68 commercial properties and 642 outbuildings have been destroyed. Thousands of people have been displaced. The Valley Fire has caused significant damage to area highways. The highway damage involves pavements, signs, guardrails and safety features, destabilized slopes and embankments, and debris from trees and burned structures. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $200,000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for Sonoma County’s Social Advocates for Youth (SAY). “SAY provides kids in Sonoma County with homes, stability and hope for a good future,” said Thompson. “Their work reduces youth homelessness and makes our entire community a stronger, better place. I am proud to support these grants to help SAY continue and expand their work throughout out county.” "Homelessness among youth has risen 145 percent over the past five years in Sonoma County. One in four homeless people in Sonoma County is under the age of 25. The need is clear, and we've seen the City of Santa Rosa, and the County of Sonoma respond with funding for SAY's housing and outreach programs,” said Matt Martin, CEO of SAY. “We're honored to announce this supporting grant from the Federal government that will leverage those funds. Last year only 16 agencies received funding and we are humbled, in this competitive market, to be chosen." The grant will allow SAY to operate their 24/7 Dr. Coffee House Teen Shelter, where 91 percent of youth were successfully reunited with family or moved to stable housing in the last year. SAY will also expand outreach services to four new regions of Sonoma County, providing a daily presence on site where homeless youth need support. Founded in 1971, SAY provides support, opportunities and hope to children, youth and families by focusing on three core areas: housing, counseling and job skills training.

09.21.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today sent a letter to the White House urging it to approve Individual Assistance (IA) for victims of the Valley Fire. Earlier today, the State of California submitted its request to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for IA. The FEMA disaster funds for IA can be used to help individuals rebuild, repair and replace housing and other personal property. “The Valley Fire is one of the worst in our state’s history. It has forced thousands of people to evacuate their communities, destroyed more than a thousand homes, and left many families with nothing,” said Thompson. “I urge the White House to quickly act so that we can begin working to help folks get back on their feet. I stand ready to help expedite and support any requests. The faster these funds are approved, the faster families can begin the recovery process.” The state and local governments have conducted damage assessments and determined that the extent of the damage is beyond its capacity to repair without federal assistance. Because of this determination the state has formally requested IA. The request for IA must be approved by the President. The Valley Fire, which started on September 12, 2015 has burned nearly 76,000 acres and is currently 69 percent contained. 1,238 homes have been destroyed. 68 commercial properties have been destroyed. Thousands of people have been displaced. FEMA previously approved the State of California’s request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant declaration for the Valley Fire. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP) allows for the “mitigation, management, and control” of fires burning on publicly or privately owned forest or grasslands which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. The FEMA grant will cover 75 percent of the costs for various fire suppression, safety and recovery needs. Eligible costs include: Costs for equipment and supplies Costs for emergency work such as evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); Costs for State emergency operations center Costs for the pre-positioning of Federal, out-of-State, and international resources for up to 21 days Cost of personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety Costs for field camps and meals Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs Costs for the temporary repair of damage cause by firefighting activities Costs for the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on co-mingled Federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another Federal agency. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.17.2015	(Washington, DC) – Congressman Charles W. Boustany, Jr., MD, (R-LA) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) of the House Ways & Means Committee joined their colleagues Congressman Erik Paulsen (R-MN), Congressman John Shimkus (R-IL), and Congressman Gene Green (D-TX) today in introducing the Reinvigorating Antibiotic and Diagnostic Innovation (READI) Act to address the rising public health challenge of antibiotic resistance. Boustany said: “We have seen too many cases where families receive the devastating news that their loved one has a bacterial infection that is resistant to antibiotics. We have heard from physicians warning us about the critical shortage of antibiotics and the further need to improve diagnostic tests so they can better diagnose and treat these infections. This is why we are coming together today with legislation to reignite research and development for new antibiotics and diagnostic tests.” Thompson said: “By incentivizing the development of life-saving drugs and diagnostics, we can save money and keep people healthy and safe. In the last quarter-century we’ve seen antibiotic and antifungal resistance grow while research and development has lagged. This poses a serious threat to public health that must be addressed. Our bipartisan bill tackles this very issue by encouraging the development of new antibiotics and rapid diagnostic tests. The bill will help save lives and money. Congress should quickly pass it.” Antibiotic resistance is increasing and a growing number of patients are suffering from and succumbing to resistant infections that cannot be effectively treated with existing drugs. The pipeline for new antibiotics and antifungals remains disturbingly low leaving patients and physicians few and sometimes no safe and effective treatment options. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least 23,000 Americans will die this year due to antibiotic resistant infections. The economic cost of antibiotic resistance is high as well, costing the U.S. health care system an estimated $20 billion annually (including 8 million additional days that people spend in the hospital). Joe Dalovisio, MD, FIDSA, former Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) President and Associate Medical Director, Ochsner Health System, New Orleans said: “My colleagues and I continue to see increasing numbers of patients who we cannot successfully treat with our existing, dwindling arsenal of antibiotics. New infectious diseases threats emerge and grow constantly. For example, in Louisiana, we are beginning to see many more infections caused by the deadly bacteria Acinetobacter baumanni. We had only 11 reported cases in 2001, but 742 in 2010. While the vast majority of the 2001 cases were susceptible to available antibiotics, a whopping two-thirds of the 2010 cases were resistant to Cephalosporins—one of our most powerful classes of antibiotics. These frightening bacteria are becoming a more common cause of health care associated infections, including ventilator associated pneumonia, line sepsis, and burn wound sepsis. We are grateful to have a champion in Congressman Boustany—a fellow physician—who understands the public health crisis of antibiotic resistance and is leading this important congressional effort to help address it.” In an effort to counter the toll antibiotic resistance is taking on public health, the READI Act would amend the Internal Revenue Code by taking a “push” (during development) tax incentive approach for qualifying manufacturers to increase clinical testing of 1) antibiotic and antifugal drugs and 2) rapid infectious disease diagnostic tests. Antibiotic R&D poses unique scientific, regulatory and economic challenges which often make it riskier than R&D for other types of drugs. For example, the drugs become less effective as soon as they are used because bacteria evolve defenses to resist them and then transfer these defenses to other bacteria. Antibiotics also are typically inexpensive and used for short-durations and therefore, can rarely compete for R&D dollars against more profitable drugs like those that treat chronic diseases. In 1990, there were almost 20 pharmaceutical companies with large antibiotic R&D programs. Today, there are roughly three large companies with robust, active programs and a small number of companies with limited programs. Henry Chambers, MD, FIDSA, Chief of Infectious Diseases, San Francisco General Hospital said: “In California this year, we experienced the antibiotic resistance crisis firsthand, when a deadly outbreak of Carbapenem Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) occurred in two major California hospitals, underscoring the urgent need to combat antibiotic resistance and develop new treatments for patients who contract these infections. This bill will be an important complement to the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now (GAIN) Act, which was enacted in 2012 and provides a “pull” incentive for new antibiotics. We need a strong “push” incentive—like the tax credit provided in this bill—to help make antibiotics a feasible investment for companies. Unlike drugs for most other conditions, antibiotics are typically taken for a short period of time, inexpensive, and held in reserve to protect their utility—all contributing to a failure of the market in stimulating development of these important and life-saving drugs.” ### The following is a list of some of the organizations and companies supporting the READI Act: AdvaMedDx Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists American Gastroenterological Association American Society for Microbiology American Society of Health-System Pharmacists American Thoracic Society American Urological Association Antibiotics Working Group (Cempra, Durata Therapeutics, Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Melinta, The Medicines Company and Theravance) bioMérieux Cempra, Inc.

09.14.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved the State of California’s request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant declaration for the Valley Fire burning in Lake, Napa and Sonoma Counties. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP) allows for the “mitigation, management, and control” of fires burning on publicly or privately owned forest or grasslands which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. “The Valley Fire is spreading rapidly and has proven to be especially dangerous. It has already devastated nearly 100 square miles and is just five percent contained. Assistance from every level of government is needed as we respond to this major disaster,” said Thompson. “Many thanks to FEMA for quickly approving federal funds to help our first responders contain and eliminate the fire, and to help our district recover from the damage it has caused. The brave men and women of CAL FIRE, and all emergency responders, are in my thoughts and prayers as they selflessly work to protect our communities.” The Valley Fire is burning in Lake, Napa and Sonoma Counties. More than 61,000 acres have been burned. The fire is 5 percent contained. More than 400 structures have been destroyed and thousands of people have been forced to evacuate. 1,400 firefighters have been deployed. Evacuation Centers are located at Kelseyville Presbyterian Church, the Napa County Fairgrounds in Calistoga and the Highland Senior Center in Clearlake. More than 13,000 people have been evacuated. The FEMA grant will cover 75 percent of the costs for various fire suppression, safety and recovery needs. Eligible costs include: Costs for equipment and supplies Costs for emergency work such as evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); Costs for State emergency operations center Costs for the pre-positioning of Federal, out-of-State, and international resources for up to 21 days Cost of personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety Costs for field camps and meals Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs Costs for the temporary repair of damage cause by firefighting activities Costs for the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on co-mingled Federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another Federal agency.

09.11.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted in support of the Iran Nuclear Deal. Thompson spoke in support of the deal today on the House floor. Text of his remarks and video are below. “Mr. Speaker, a nuclear-armed Iran is certainly unacceptable. “And there are two ways to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon – diplomacy and military force. “As someone who has served in combat, I believe our nation’s first choice should always be diplomacy. “I say “first choice” because nothing in the deal takes military action off the table. “But before we go down that road, we need to give diplomacy a shot. And this deal is the best way forward. “I’m not new to the issue. I just finished serving eight years on the Intelligence Committee. I have reviewed the intelligence, I’ve read the classified documents and I’ve had numerous briefings with experts on every side of the issue. “There is no other deal to be had. It’s this or the status quo. And make no mistake; the status quo leaves Iran just a short time away from a bomb. “All of the intelligence clearly points towards the fact that this agreement is far better than doing nothing – better than the status quo. “Iran is already a nuclear threshold state. “If we reject this deal, Iran will keep getting closer and closer towards the development of their nuclear weapon. “If we accept the deal, we will be able to halt Iran’s activates, the IAEA will have enormous access to conduct inspections, and Iran must forever honor the conditions of the non-proliferation treaty or face the consequences. “This deal isn’t about trust. I don’t trust Iran. And I don’t like their leadership. “But as it’s been pointed out, you don't negotiate peace agreements with those you know, like and trust. “This deal is about verification. It’s about making Iran prove it is not developing a nuclear weapon. It’s about keeping America and our allies safe. “It is our best and only peaceful path forward. “I urge the House to approve the Iran Nuclear Deal.” ###

08.28.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced $176,340 in Affordable Care Act funding for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers (SRCHC) in recognition of their achievements in providing high quality, comprehensive care. The funds, provided though the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), will be used to expand current quality improvement systems and infrastructure, and improve primary care service delivery in the communities served by the health center. “The Affordable Care Act is working and you don’t have to look any further than Santa Rosa Community Health Centers to see that is true,” said Thompson. “The law is providing our health centers with the money they need to keep people healthy and provide them with quality, comprehensive care. The services provided by SRCHC are second to none. I am proud of the job they do and to have supported this funding which they have earned.” “The real winners in this story are our patients. They are receiving the highest quality preventive medicine, clinical care, and disease management. We are so proud of our contribution to the health of this community,” said Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer at SRCHC. Santa Rosa Community Health Center was one of only 10 health centers in California, and one of only 61 nationwide, to qualify as a National Quality Leader. National quality leaders received funding if they met or exceeded national clinical quality benchmarks, including Healthy People 2020 objectives, for chronic disease management, preventive care, and perinatal/prenatal care. The funding is broken down as follows: National quality leaders: received $52,447 for meeting and exceeding national clinical quality benchmarks, including Healthy People 2020 objectives, for chronic disease management, preventive care, and perinatal/prenatal care, demonstrating health centers’ critical role in improving quality health care nationwide. EHR Reporters: received $15,000 in funding for using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to report clinical quality measure data for all patients, a foundation for quality improvement strategies.

08.25.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced a $2,438,681 Economic Development Administration (EDA) investment which will support roadway and infrastructure improvements to the Green Island Industrial District (GRID) in American Canyon. The funds will be used to help reconstruct Green Island Road, a goods movement corridor for the GRID. In August, 2014 Thompson urged Northern California’s EDA representative to support the City of American Canyon’s application for federal funding. “The best thing we can do to grow our economy is to invest in rebuilding our roads, overpasses and bridges – and these funds show it,” said Thompson. “Not only will this project put people to work in construction, it will support hundreds of other jobs and businesses in the Green Island Industrial District that may have otherwise left if infrastructure improvements were not made.” Mayor Leon Garcia added, “This project is a great example of the City and business community working together to solve a problem. The American Canyon Chamber of Commerce brought together the business owners in the Green Island area to work with the City on this project. We all have the same goal: to help the Green Island businesses be successful. I appreciate the Chamber and local businesses partnering with the City to improve Green Island Road.” “The Green Island area has been the center of American Canyon’s industrial core for many years. Unfortunately, as the city has grown and prospered, the infrastructure hasn’t been able to keep up,” said City Manager Dana Shigley. “The City has been working with the business owners in the Green Island industrial area to find solutions, and this grant is exactly what we needed to make it happen. This grant, along with local tax dollars and funding from the property owners, will allow us to upgrade the utility and streets so the area can continue to prosper and businesses can grow” "Working together, the award of this Economic Development grant is the missing piece to make vital improvements to the industrial center of Napa County,” said City Council Member Belia Ramos. “This grant award would not have been possible without the collaboration of business operators, property owners, city staff and elected officials." According to the EDA, the project will allow businesses better access to the industrial district and its amenities, ensuring the ongoing viability and vitality of the industrial zone. EDA grants are awarded through a competitive process based upon the application’s merit, the applicant’s eligibility, and the availability of funds.

08.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and John Garamendi (CA-3) today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved the State of California’s request for a Fire Management Assistance Grant declaration for the Rocky Fire burning in Lake, Yolo and Colusa Counties. The Fire Management Assistance Grant Program (FMAGP) allows for the “mitigation, management, and control” of fires burning on publicly or privately owned forest or grasslands which threaten such destruction as would constitute a major disaster. “The Rocky Fire is a major disaster and all levels of government must respond,” said Thompson. “These federal funds will help our first responders contain and eliminate the fire, and they will help our communities recover from the damage it has caused. I commend FEMA for their assistance, CAL FIRE for their brave and extraordinary work, and our local communities for their support and partnership. Together we will recover from this disaster.” “Due to California’s unprecedented drought conditions, the Rocky Fire has been especially unpredictable and dangerous. I thank FEMA for their intervention with needed resources to help communities respond to the lasting damage caused by this fire,” Garamendi said. “California faces an extremely dangerous fire season, and we will continue to need active federal support to prevent bad situations from becoming unspeakable tragedies. We will also be vulnerable this winter when El Nino likely brings flooding and mudslides. I’m so grateful to the emergency responders who are selflessly doing all they can to save homes, lives, and habitats.” The Rocky Fire is burning in Lake, Yolo & Colusa Counties. 68,300 acres have been burned. The fire is 20 percent contained. Nearly 7,000 structures are threatened by the fire. Evacuation Centers are located at Middletown High School and Kelseyville High School. More than 13,000 people have been evacuated. The grant will cover 75 percent of the costs for various fire suppression, safety and recovery needs. Eligible costs include: Costs for equipment and supplies Costs for emergency work such as evacuations and sheltering, police barricading and traffic control, arson investigation); Costs for State emergency operations center Costs for the pre-positioning of Federal, out-of-State, and international resources for up to 21 days Cost of personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety Costs for field camps and meals Costs for mobilization and demobilization costs Costs for the temporary repair of damage cause by firefighting activities Costs for the mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on co-mingled Federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another Federal agency.

08.05.2015	NAPA, CA – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the United States Postal Service (USPS) has agreed at this time to stop pursuing the demolition of the Historic Franklin Station Post Office in downtown Napa and will instead pursue the sale of the building and property. The USPS originally proposed demolishing the earthquake-damaged structure. However, at the urging of Thompson and local community members the USPS has decided to move forward with selling the building and property, with the stipulation that the buyer would repair the building in accordance with all applicable laws and protective covenants intended to preserve the architectural integrity of the building. The Franklin Station Post Office is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. “This is the right decision for the USPS and for Napa, and I am very pleased that Postmaster General Brennan committed to working with me and our community to sell the building and property,” said Thompson. “The Franklin Station Post Office is one of our community’s crown jewels. It’s a beautiful part or our heritage and no one wanted to see it destroyed. By selling the post office, we can make sure this wonderful structure is around for many generations to enjoy.” The USPS will initiate the process to sell the post office in mid-August. It first must notify employees, union members and Mayor Jill Techel of the intent to sell and permanently relocate. The USPS will then hold a public meeting where community members can provide feedback on the location of the new Napa post office. The USPS will also notify federal agencies of the intent to sell before obtaining an appraisal of the building and property to determine its fair market value. The post office would then be open to competitive bidding for all interested parties before a buyer is selected. After the USPS submitted a letter to California’s State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) requesting a permit to demolish the post office, Thompson led an effort to find an alternative solution. Thompson discussed the potential sale of the historic post office with Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan and hosted a meeting with USPS officials in his Washington, D.C. office. He led the effort to involve the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which will now act as a consulting party in the consultation process the USPS initiated with SHPO under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act. The Franklin Station Post Office was commissioned in 1933 by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration (WPA), a federal agency tasked with carrying out public works projects which employed millions of out-of-work Americans. The ornate post office was built in the art deco architectural style. The USPS originally proposed to demolish the building due to the cost of repairing damage caused by the August 2014 earthquake.

08.05.2015	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a former senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Vietnam combat veteran, today issued the following statement in support of the Iran Nuclear Agreement: “A nuclear-armed Iran is unacceptable. There are only two ways to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon: diplomacy or military force. My first choice is diplomacy. “As a combat veteran and former member of the Intelligence Committee, I have been following this issue closely for many years. I have reviewed the intelligence, read the classified documents and had numerous meetings with experts both inside and outside of the Obama Administration, including Nicholas Burns, who served as undersecretary of state under President George W. Bush. “After a careful and detailed evaluation, I believe the deal struck by the Obama Administration is the best way forward. The intelligence clearly points towards the fact that this deal is better than the status quo. Iran is already a nuclear threshold state. If we continue down the current path, Iran will likely make progress in developing a nuclear weapon. Under this deal, we will be able to halt the Iranian’s activates for 10 to 15 years, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have enormous access for inspections and Iran will be obligated to forever honor their inspections, and the United States and our allies will be able to fully engage the regime to do everything possible to make sure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. “While I do not trust Iran nor like their leadership, the President has correctly pointed out that you don't negotiate peace agreements with those you know, like and trust. This deal is in the best interest of the United States and our allies, Israel included. I will support the deal when it comes before Congress for a vote.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.31.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that Santa Rosa Community Health Centers has been awarded $242,750 Ryan White grant through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for treatment of patients living with or at risk of exposure to HIV. “The primary care services offered by Santa Rosa Community Health Centers to those living with or at risk of exposure to HIV are indispensable,” said Thompson. “SRCHC is a welcoming and open health home where people are treated with respect and can get the care they need. I am honored to represent them and proud of the work they’re able to do through funding provided by the Ryan White grant.” The Ryan White grant funding supports Santa Rosa Community Health Centers’ work providing HIV primary health care and health education for women, children, infants and youth. It funds important quality initiatives such as case management and coordination of care that improves the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS. “We are grateful for this generous grant, which allows us to continue to provide comprehensive services, in collaboration with our excellent community partners, to people living with or at risk of exposure to HIV. Our HIV programs and services are an outstanding example of the SRCHC model of care that treats the whole person with dignity and respect. We are proud to be able to serve our community with the support of this Ryan White grant funding,” said Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer at Santa Rosa Community Health Centers.

07.30.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation to help veterans and their families save for and afford health care passed the Senate today and will be signed into law by the President. The bill, titled the Help Veterans Save for Health Care Act, passed as part of H.R. 3236, the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015. Thompson’s bill will allow veterans who have supplemental health care coverage and also receive Veterans Administration (VA) care for a service-connected disability to enroll or participate in a Health Savings Account (HSA). Currently, under IRS regulations, veterans and their families are prohibited from making and/or receiving contributions to a HSA for three months after receiving health care services through the Veterans VA for a service-connected disability. The bill was co-authored by U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson “This is a commonsense, bipartisan bill that will help make sure veterans and their families aren’t left on the hook for health care expenses they’d otherwise be covered for just because they received care from the VA,” said Thompson. “Making sure veterans have the same rights as other taxpayers to pay for their health care costs is the right thing to do for those who served our country in uniform.” A HSA is a tool to help individuals and families to save and pay for health care expenses. However under the IRS regulations veterans and their families are being unfairly excluded from an important health care savings tool. For example, a veteran with a service-connected disability may be enrolled in an employer-sponsored health plan with an HSA that provides health insurance coverage for their family. Under current IRS regulations, the veteran would be barred from participating in his or her HSA for three months after receiving care at the VA for a service-connected disability – even if that HSA is used to cover out-of-pocket healthcare costs for non-VA care and for their spouse or children.

07.24.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force released the following statement in response to the mass shooting in a Lafayette, Louisiana movie theater. “The news of another mass shooting in our country is both heartbreaking and tragic. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of the victims and the people of Louisiana. This is a time to mourn those whose lives were lost and to do all we can to help the people of Lafayette heal. “After yet another mass shooting, we also need to recognize that there are things we can do to help curb this kind of unchecked and all-too-common violence. That starts by doing everything we can to keep guns out of dangerous hands. We’ve witnessed far too many tragedies to continue doing nothing.

07.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced bipartisan legislation with Tom Reed (R-NY) to improve hospice care for patients, families and providers. The Hospice Care Access Improvement Act of 2015 would help hospice patients receive the care they need by making sure they have access to the resources to make informed decisions about end-of-life-care, all while cracking down on bad actor hospice programs. “This bill will help make sure patients receive the highest quality hospice services, families have peace of mind they need during difficult times, and providers are able to offer consistent care,” said Thompson. “By cracking down on bad actors, expanding access to information and resources, and making sure payments are made on a timely basis, we can improve the hospice system for patients, families and providers.” “We are making sure patients and families have access to the best possible, quality care during what can be a very challenging time in their lives,” said Reed. “Our hospice providers do an excellent job providing that care and peace of mind to families in need. It’s important that we help these providers continue their critical care missions.” Reed went on to say “We can’t let a few hospice providers who are cheating the system ruin the great work that most of these providers are doing every day,” said Reed. The bill also launches a pilot program to begin testing major payment reforms for the way The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimburses Hospice providers for care given to patients. The bill also improves access to Hospice care by increasing the number of health professionals which are able to perform pre-hospice evaluations and counseling services. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – A new webpage, https://mikethompson.house.gov/backgroundchecks, provides the public with easy and open access to get the facts, read the bill and provide feedback on U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation to expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. “I want make sure the public has easy access the facts about my background check bill and for people to have the opportunity to provide thoughtful and constructive feedback,” said Thompson. “I am a gun owner and supporter of the Second Amendment. People deserve the opportunity to learn for themselves that this bill isn’t about restricting the rights of law-abiding Americans – it’s about keeping guns from criminals, domestic abusers, drug addicts and the dangerously mentally ill.” The public can provide feedback on the legislation by emailing backgroundchecks.thompson@mail.house.gov. In March, U.S. House members introduced H.R. 1217, the bipartisan King-Thompson background check legislation. The bill, authored by Thompson and Pete King (R-NY), expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. The King-Thompson bill was co-authored by Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Bob Dold, (R-IL), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Kathleen Rice (D-NY). The legislation also supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It bans the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for firearms transfers between family members, friends and hunting buddies. It allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state in which they are stationed. It permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. And, under the bill, background checks would continue to be conducted in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years.

07.16.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against the House Majority’s California water bill, H.R. 2898. The legislation would jeopardize jobs in and north of the delta, undermine existing state law, and override long-standing environmental protections. This bill was introduced on June 25th – three weeks ago – and is being rushed to the House Floor without any public hearings or opportunities for lawmakers to receive input from stakeholders. It passed out of committee along a nearly party line vote (23-12) and is opposed by the White House. Thompson spoke in opposition to H.R. 2898 today on the House floor. Text of his remarks and video are below. “Mister Speaker, he’s absolutely correct. If that fresh water doesn’t run through and run out to the ocean, the salt water runs back in. I have two major cities in my district that rely on that for a source of water. If this bill were to pass, their water supply is in jeopardy. You can’t drink salt water. It just doesn’t work. “California is in the middle of a very extreme drought. “It’s not due to a lack of pumping. It’s not because of our state’s water regulations. And it’s not because we’re putting fish ahead of farms and people. “It’s because there is no rain and there’s no snow. “No bill can make it rain. But this bill makes a bad situation even worse. “It’s wrong for California. It won’t stop the drought. It won’t make it rain. But it will kill jobs. And it will ruin drinking water for millions of Californians. “The State of California won’t support this bill because ignores 20 years of established science and undermines our extensive efforts to implement equal measures to address long-standing water shortages. “We’ve been down this road before in California. We ignored science and we diverted water out of the Klamath River and nearly 80,000 spawning salmon died. Communities were devastated. And livelihoods were lost. “This bill also sets a dangerous precedent for every other state in our country. “California has long-standing water management rules. This bill overrides the very system of water regulations that Californians themselves devised to govern our state’s water supply. “It tells local resource managers and water districts how to administer their water supply. “If we pass this bill, we’re telling every state in America that we’re okay with the federal government undermining local experts and state laws from coast to coast. “If that weren’t enough, this bill also undercuts longstanding environmental laws. “The legislation we’re debating today redefines the standard by which the Endangered Species Act is applied. This will weaken the law, increase the risk of species extinction and lead to countless lawsuits and costly litigation. It’s as if the majority is holding wildlife responsible for our lack of rain. “You will hear the other side talk about a little fish, the Delta Smelt – and how we’re protecting fish at the expense of people. The truth I, as the gentleman from California mentioned, that protection of the smelt hasn’t prevented one drop of water from being pumped south since 2013. “We haven’t pumped more water south because there simply isn’t enough water. We’re in a drought. “And I am not insensitive to the supply and demand reality of California’s water. I understand the concerns of the Central Valley farmers. I’m a farmer myself. But if my well runs dry, the solution isn’t to steal the water from my neighbors. “We need real solutions that are based on science and that work for everyone. “This bill is not the solution. It’s bad for California, bad for other states, and bad for our environment.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.15.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (D-CA) bipartisan legislation to improve health care service and access to Medicare beneficiaries, and save tax dollars today passed the House and will go to the President to be signed into law. The legislation, titled the Medicare Independence at Home Medical Practice Demonstration Improvement Act of 2015 (H.R. 2196/S. 971) extends the Independence at Home Medical Practice Demonstration Program (IAH) for two years. IAH is a voluntary, home-based primary care service offered to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. Through this program, doctors provide primary care services to high-need Medicare patients in their own home. Thompson introduced the bill with Reps. Michael C. Burgess (R-TX) and Peter J. Roskam (R-IL). “The IAH demonstration improves access, quality of care, and quality of life for our most ill Medicare patients while saving taxpayer dollars,” said Thompson. “It’s an important program that works and this bipartisan bill will make sure seniors are able to keep taking advantage of it.” IAH requires that those who use the program demonstrate annual savings, improved outcomes, and patient and family caregiver satisfaction. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is charged with assessing whether delivery of the in-home care at home improves services for Medicare beneficiaries and increases patient satisfaction. "IAH allows me as an osteopathic physician as well as other health care providers to assess patients in their homes in order to gain a better understanding of the patient’s overall condition and well-being, avoiding unnecessary hospitalizations, ER visits, or nursing home use," said Dr. Norm Vinn, D.O., Founder and Chief Medical Officer of Housecall Doctors Medical Group in Laguna Hills. Vinn is a nationally recognized leader on integrated care coordination and past president of the American Osteopathic Association. "Most importantly, IAH allows these most frail Medicare beneficiaries to remain safely at home where they are most comfortable," Vinn said. Since its implementation three years ago, IAH has proven to help patients avoid unnecessary hospitalizations, ER visits, and nursing home use. Last month, CMS announced that the program saved more than $25 million- an average of $3,070 per beneficiary- in its first performance year. Thompson’s bipartisan legislation is endorsed by the American Osteopathic Association, the National Coalition of Health Care and the Independence at Home Coalition, which includes national medical societies and patient advocacy organizations such as AARP, the American Nurses Association, and The American Academy of Home Care Physicians. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
07.10.2015	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today attended a White House celebration where President Obama used the executive authority granted to him under the Antiquities Act to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Monument. Under this designation, the region will be permanently protected, ensuring continued recreational opportunities and providing an regional economic boost, while also safeguarding the region's beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters – which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Additionally, all currently owned federal lands within the boundary will be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed more efficiently and according to the site-specific needs. Earlier this year, Thompson introduced legislation in the House (H.R. 761) that would have also designated the region as national monument. “After years of tireless work by countless numbers of people, the Berryessa snow mountain region is finally getting the permanent protection it deserves,” said Thompson. “This national monument designation will provide a boost to our local economy, enhance recreational opportunities for tens of thousands of people, and protect important wildlife. Many thanks to Secretary Jewell, Secretary Vilsack and Senator Boxer – this wouldn't have happened without their partnership. And a special thanks to President Obama for taking action to protect one of America's national treasures." “I commend President Obama and thank my colleague Rep. Mike Thompson for his leadership in seeing the Berryessa Snow Mountain region designated as a National Monument,” Congressman Jared Huffman (CA-2) said. “As the crown jewel of the Northern California’s wild inner Coast Range, this designation while ensure the enjoyment of these beautiful lands for future generations, all while boosting the local tourism economy and creating good jobs here at home.” “Today’s designation by President Obama permanently protecting Berryessa Snow Mountain is a victory for local communities, local economies, and the environment. It will improve management of native wildlife, protect water quality in vital watersheds, and enhance the experience for the area’s numerous visitors. I commend the efforts of Congressman Thompson, Secretary Jewell, Secretary Vilsack, Senator Boxer, and all the local activists who invested so much time to make this happen,” said Congressman John Garamendi (CA-3). The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches nearly one hundred miles from Northwest Solano County to the flanks of Snow Mountain. It encompasses nearly 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The area provides habitat to so many kinds of plants and animals that it has been named a biodiversity hotspot. Establishment of a National Monument will improve coordination between federal agencies and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. Studies have shown that a national monument designation could be beneficial to the surrounding economies. A study by the Winters Chamber of Commerce found protected public lands are major contributors to our country’s $646 billion outdoor recreation economy. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. The study also found that local economies surrounding national monuments expanded following the creation of a new national monument. Employment, personal income, and per capita income either continued or improved in each of the regions surrounding the national monuments studied. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region also includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. Many nationally recognized recreation and sportsmen groups support a national monument designation. The National Monument designation only applies to land managed by the federal government. Lake Berryessa is not included in the National Monument designation. In addition, the designation protects private property rights and does not impact motorized recreation on Lake Berryessa. All existing grazing will also continue unchanged under the designation. Motorized and mechanized travel will continue be allowed on designated roads and trails. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the National Monument and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The National Monument designation does not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of a National Monument. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. # # #
07.09.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), vice-chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force today introduced the Safer Communities Act of 2015 (H.R. 2994), legislation aimed at reducing and preventing gun violence by keeping guns away from people who should not have them. The legislation closes the gaps in current federal gun policy by clarifying and expanding existing federal prohibitors as it relates to mental health, substance abuse, history of violence, and other risk factors; provides states with the tools needed to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws; provides resources for mental health crisis intervention services; and improves records reporting into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). “This bill puts policies in place that will help keep guns away from those we all agree shouldn’t have them,” said Thompson. “While those suffering from mental illness are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violent crimes, we must recognize that improving our mental health system, and keeping firearms from those with other risk factors such as a history of substance abuse disorders and violence, goes hand-in-hand with reducing and preventing gun violence. By improving intervention services, boosting evidence-based research, and giving our law enforcement officers more tools to get guns out of dangerous hands, we can make our country safer and get people the help they need, while also respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.” “This bill includes an array of measures to address the unfortunate and too often lethal link between mental illness and firearms deaths” said Blumenthal. “By simultaneously improving mental health care and keeping guns out of the hands of those who would use them to harm themselves or others, this legislation takes an holistic approach to this serious issue. By expanding existing federal prohibitors on risk factors including mental health, substance abuse and history of violence, this bill gives states the tools they need to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws and make our communities safer.” “The Safer Communities Act is a common sense proposal reducing the likelihood of individuals suffering from mental illness the ability to access firearms,” said Perlmutter. “My focus is to do what we can to prevent future tragedies in our communities and schools. It’s important to keep guns away from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others and instead provide them with the mental health tools and services they need. This is one of many steps we can take to keep our communities safe and make gun violence less easy, less frequent and less deadly.” The Safer Communities Act of 2015 clarifies and expands existing federal prohibitors to help keep guns away from those who are determined to pose a danger to themselves or others. Specifically, the legislation prohibits the purchase or possession of a firearm by individuals subject to involuntary outpatient commitment if a court finds they pose a significant and dangerous threat to themselves or others. Current federal law has been interpreted to apply only to inpatient commitments. Recognizing that states play an important role in preventing gun violence and ensuring safe communities, the legislation provides states with the tools needed to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws. Specifically, it further supports federal and state partnerships by providing grants to states to strengthen gun violence prevention laws that prohibit individuals with certain risk factors such as a history of dangerous mental illness, substance abuse, and violence from possessing firearms. For example, states could: Create laws that enable law enforcement to petition for a warrant to temporarily remove firearms when there is probable cause to believe that an individual poses an imminent risk of harm to self or others. The process by which a warrant is obtained and a gun is removed must be consistent with due process; and Create laws that temporarily prohibit the purchase and possession of a gun after an involuntary hospitalization on an emergency basis due to serious mental illness; The legislation also requires the FBI to expand its current alert system so that state and local law enforcement can pursue cases where prohibited persons try to purchase guns – particularly those prohibited due to serious mental illness. Thompson, Blumenthal and Perlmutter’s bill also provides resources for mental health crisis intervention services, boosts mental health research, enhances information sharing and research on gun violence, and improves the submission of mental health records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm. The bill changes the outdated and stigmatizing “mental defective” terminology currently used in federal firearms statute and replaces it with “ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.” Finally, Safer Communities Act of 2015 establishes a minimum restoration standard, ensuring a fair restoration process of firearm ownership rights that balances public safety with individuals’ rights. One year after an individual’s involuntary commitment ends, they may petition the court to have their rights restored. The application must be accompanied by a clinical opinion of a psychiatrist, psychologist, or licensed mental health professional. After considering a variety of factors, the judge would determine if restoring gun ownership rights is compatible with the public interest. Thompson’s task force included making improvements to our mental health system in their policy principles release in February 2013. # # #
07.07.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) Gregg Harper (R-MS), Diane Black (R-TN) and Peter Welch (D-VT) today introduced H.R. 2948, the Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2015. The bipartisan legislation will expand coverage of telehealth services under Medicare by putting them on the path toward parity with in-person health care visits. The use of technology in health care has created new ways for practitioners and patients to deliver and access care. However, our current statutory and regulatory framework prevents many patients and providers from taking advantage of telemedicine’s advancements. This legislation recognizes and embraces these technological advancements and the impact it can have on improving patient care and outcomes, and lowering health care costs. “Both patients and providers want telehealth for two simple reasons – it saves money and saves lives,” said Thompson. “Telehealth allows physicians to provide more patients with better healthcare, but while we’ve witnessed much advancement in the field of telemedicine, our policies still lag behind. By passing this commonsense, bipartisan bill we can expand telehealth services and make sure the best care and the best treatments are available to all Americans, no matter where they live.” “My interest in telehealth began with a single conversation about physician shortages and concerns about patients’ access to quality and affordable health care,” said Harper. “In the years following that first conversation, it has become even more important that we are able to tighten the access gap, and the best alternative is to use technology to connect health professionals with underserved populations – rural and urban – through telehealth networks. I am honored to continue to work with Reps. Mike Thompson, Diane Black, and Peter Welch on the introduction of this quality telehealth legislation.” “As a nurse for more than 40 years, I strongly believe that we must unshackle the burdensome government restrictions on Medicare that limit use of telemedicine. We all know that advances in technology can help deliver more convenient, cost-effective, and efficient care. But today, Medicare rules prevent most seniors from accessing these needed, revolutionary services. Washington should never stand between seniors and the care that they need to stay well. That is why I am proud to join Congressmen Thompson, Harper, and Welch in introducing the Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2015, which will expand access to this critical tool under Medicare,” said Black. “All Americans deserve access to quality, affordable health care, no matter where they live, and the advancement in telemedicine technology is making that a reality,” Welch said. “To ensure greater adoption of this technology, with patient health and safety at the forefront, Congress must keep pace and update the outdated policies governing this new health care delivery system. This bipartisan bill is crucial for the continued expansion of telemedicine, which will significantly improve both access to care and cost-effective delivery of services, resulting in reduced health care costs and improved patient outcomes. ” Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2015 would phase in the expansion of telehealth services by: Removing the geographic barriers under current law and allowing the provision of telehealth services in rural, underserved, and metropolitan areas Expanding the list of providers and related covered service that are eligible to provide telehealth services to include respiratory therapist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, speech language pathologist, and audiologist Expanding access to telestroke services, regardless of where the patient is located; Allowing remote patient monitoring (RPM) for patients with chronic conditions such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and diabetes; and Allowing the beneficiary’s home to serve as a site of care for home dialysis, hospice care, eligible outpatient mental health services, and home health services. "Rep. Thompson’s bill will help Medicare better serve millions of beneficiaries by providing more access to telemedicine technology that delivers quality treatment in a cost-effective way," said Jonathan Linkous, chief executive officer of the American Telemedicine Association. “The bill’s sponsors understand, from years of experience with Medicaid plans in their states, that access to telemedicine improves healthcare delivery and outcomes.” “This legislation is a common sense approach to significant advancement of telehealth,” said Mike Geldart, President, Remote Cardiac Services Provider Group (RCSPG) and COO of BioTelemetry, Inc. “It takes the regulatory handcuffs off of CMS so that health care professionals and suppliers can do what we do best, serve those patients often in the greatest need.” This legislation will also “remove some of the reimbursement roadblocks that have limited access to innovative remote monitoring solutions,” said Geldart. RCSPG is a coalition of providers furnishing over half of the remote cardiac diagnostic monitoring services in this country including to hundreds of thousands of Medicare cardiac patients. The Medicare Telehealth Parity Act is supported by the American Telemedicine Association, Telecommunications Industry Association, American Speech-Language Hearing Association, American Association for Respiratory Care, Remote Cardiac Services Providers Group, American Society of Nephrology, National Association for the Support of Long Term Care, National Rural Health Association, Biocom, Nursing Community Coalition (44 Nursing Groups), American Heart Association, American Stroke Association, Visiting Nurse Associations of America, and the American Occupational Therapy Association. The legislation has been referred to the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means. # # #
07.07.2015	(Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) and Congressmen Charles W. Boustany, Jr., MD, (R-LA) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced bipartisan companion language in the House (H.R. 2911) and Senate (S. 1697) known as the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act to roll back existing Treasury Department guidance issued under the authority of the Affordable Care Act prohibiting the use of Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs). Boustany and Thompson introduced the legislation last Congress. On September 13, 2013, Treasury issued guidance disallowing employers from using stand-alone HRAs to reimburse employees for healthcare-related expenses, stating these arrangements did not satisfy the Affordable Care Act’s minimum benefit and annual dollar cap requirements for health insurance plans offered by employers. As a result, employers that continue to offer HRAs would be subject to a $100 per day per employee penalty, totaling up to $36,500 over the course of the year. After Boustany questioned Secretary Jack Lew on this issue in a Ways & Means hearing on February 3, 2015, Treasury announced on February 18 that it would delay enforcement of this guidance and resulting penalties until July 1, 2015. Grassley, Heitkamp, Boustany, and Thompson’s legislation restores flexibility and choice into the marketplace by: Ensuring that small businesses and local municipalities with fewer than 50 employees are allowed to continue using pre-tax dollars to give employees a defined contribution for healthcare expenses Allowing employees to use HRA funds to purchase health coverage on the individual market, as well as for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses if the employee has qualified health coverage Protecting employers from being financially penalized for providing this cost-sharing option to employees Grassley said: “I’ve heard from farmers, small business owners and accountants who are worried about getting hit with a penalty for something they’ve done for a long time without any controversy. It doesn’t make sense to tell small employers they can’t help their employees get health insurance. Why disrupt something that worked? Our bill puts this provision back to what it was so farmers and small businesses can use this option as they see fit.” Heitkamp said: “Our bipartisan bill would make a needed fix to restore the ability for small businesses, which sometimes can’t afford to provide health benefits‎ for employees, to help their workers purchase coverage using HRAs. That just makes sense. I have long said some parts of the health care reform law work, but we need to improve the pieces that should work better for families and small businesses - and this bill continues those efforts.” Boustany said: “Restoring choice and affordability in the healthcare marketplace is the key to driving down costs and improving accessibility for consumers. Using Healthcare Reimbursement Arrangements is a creative approach that allows employees to select healthcare plans that are best tailored to fit their needs. Our common-sense bipartisan legislation frees employers to provide their employees with options that will put the individual in charge.” Thompson said: “This common-sense, bipartisan bill is about choice and affordability. It will allow small businesses to offer Healthcare Reimbursement Arrangements to their workers so they can choose a quality, affordable health insurance plan that fits their individual budget and healthcare needs.” Bruce Josten, Executive Vice President for Government Affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said: “The U.S. Chamber has long supported flexibility in benefit offerings, including the ability to offer stand-alone HRAs to help employees pay for health care coverage and services. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation marks an important first step in returning flexibility and choice to all businesses and their employees, and if enacted, would restore appropriate common-sense options to small business and their employees.” Tom Woods, Chairman of the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) and a home builder from Blue Springs, MO, said: “This common-sense legislation is particularly important for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. Even though these employers cannot offer a health insurance plan due to prohibitive costs, they would still be able to help make healthcare more affordable for their workers. We urge Congress to swiftly pass this bipartisan legislation so that more employers can help their workers meet the high cost of medical premiums or out-of-pocket expenses.” Kevin Kuhlman, Director of Legislative Affairs for the National Federation of Independence Business (NFIB), said: “If there’s an opportunity for a bipartisan improvement toward affordable healthcare, this has to be it. There’s no real justification for penalizing small businesses that do what the law’s strongest supporters claim to want, which is to help employees obtain coverage or pay medical bills. This is a rigid and thoughtless bureaucratic rule that undermines the purpose of the law, and it ought to be repealed immediately.” Bob Stallman, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), said: “Farmers regularly take on the roles of CEO, CFO, and HR director, in addition to caring for their land and animals. This legislation would give farm and ranch businesses, which are largely family-run, the flexibility they need to offer health care benefits in a way that makes the most sense for their employees and their businesses.” Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, Vice President of Government Relations & Public Affairs for the National Association for the Self-Employed (NASE) said: “We applaud the introduction of the Small Business Healthcare Relief Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation championed by Reps. Charles Boustany (R-La.) and Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Sens. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), as a common-sense solution to ensuring America's smallest businesses with fewer than 50 employees have access to Health Reimbursement Arrangements (HRAs).” Joel White, President of the Council for Affordable Health Coverage (CAHC), a multi-stakeholder advocacy alliance, said: “The IRS has issued a rule that penalizes small employers for doing the right thing - providing help to employees. Employers are struggling with how to maintain employee health benefits in the current costly, burdensome, and uncertain environment. This legislation takes a good first step in addressing the negative consequences of the rule. Employers shouldn't be penalized for helping employees better afford their coverage. Congress needs to pass this bill as quickly as possible.” Chris Byrd, Executive Vice President of healthcare software and payment solutions company Evolution1, a WEX company, said: “We are delighted bipartisan legislation has been introduced to permit small businesses to assist their employees with health insurance and out-of-pocket costs without being subject to egregious penalties of $36,500 per employee.” Supporters of the legislation include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association for Towns and Townships, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), the National Federation of Business (NFIB), the Small Business Majority, the National Association for the Self Employed (NASE), the Coalition for Affordable Health Coverage (CAHC), the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), and the National Retail Federation (NRF). ###
07.06.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $10,856,088 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant for Child Start, Inc. The funds will be used to provide Head Start and Early Head Start services to children and families throughout Napa and Solano Counties. The award is the first of a 5-year grant which Child Start, Inc. won through a competitive process established by HHS. Child Start, Inc. will receive a grant of the same amount for the next four years. “Everyone, no matter who they are or where they’re from, deserves an equal opportunity to work hard, get ahead and succeed,” said Thompson. “The Head Start and Early Head Start services provided though Child Start, Inc. make sure our kids have a foundation for success that’s rooted in education and strong, healthy development. I am proud to support Child Start, Inc. and this grant which will allow them to continue doing great work in our community.” “Ensuring we have the highest quality services for kids and families has always been at the heart of our mission,” said Debbie Peralez, Executive Director of Child Start, Inc. “We know that families rely on Head Start for early care and preschool services because they want what any parent wants; to ensure that their children are prepared for school and have the skills they need to succeed. We look forward to continuing our work on their behalf.” Child Start, Inc. provides Head Start services to nearly 900 preschool children and Early Head Start services to more than 170 infants, toddlers and pregnant women. Head Start is a federal program that promotes school readiness for children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants’ increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
06.29.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Barbara Lee (CA-13) lead a letter to Sutter Health expressing their concerns over the impact of the potential closure of the Thunder Road Adolescent Treatment Center in Oakland, California. The letter was cosigned by 18 Members of Congress from Northern California Thunder Road, which is owned and operated by Sutter Health, provides assistance to youth and families who are recovering from alcohol, drug and nicotine addictions. “The closure of Thunder Road would be a devastating blow to youth and families from across Northern California that depend on its services,” said Thompson. “For nearly thirty years, it has helped young people break from the grips of addiction and get on a path towards recovery. Many of our most vulnerable youth and their families would have nowhere to turn if Thunder Road closed its doors. We need to work together and find a way to keep this treatment center open.” “For nearly three decades, young people and families across Northern California have depended on Thunder Road to provide treatment and support for those battling alcohol, drug and nicotine addictions. With the announcement of Thunder Roads closure, I am deeply concerned that many in need of treatment and support could go without it,” said Lee. “I look forward to working with the community and others to ensure adequate treatment resources for our community.” Earlier this year, Sutter Health announced that operations at Thunder Road Adolescent Treatment Centers, Inc. were no longer sustainable, and the company would be working with Alameda county to find an alternative management solution. For nearly thirty years, Thunder Road has provided the highest level of care to over 10,000 teens in Alameda and Contra Costa counties that have struggled with mental health and substance abuse. Sutter Health is in the process of transitioning ownership of the Thunder Road program in order to ensure its long-term viability. The full text of the letter is below. June 24, 2015 Patrick Fry President and CEO Sutter Health 2200 River Plaza Drive Sacramento, CA 95833 Dear Mr. Fry: On behalf of our constituencies, we write to express our concern over the recent reduction in services offered by the Thunder Road program. As representatives of the communities who depend on this facility, we fear that such diminished services could jeopardize the great strides that the Thunder Road program has made possible. Our deep concern arises from the fact that Thunder Road is an essential resource for low-income and indigent youth dealing with addiction and co-occurring behavioral disorders. Over the 28 years since the program opened, it has served thousands of youth and families from the greater Bay Area and Northern California. With its unique licensure as both a chemical dependency recovery hospital and a group home, along with accreditation by the Commission on the Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, Thunder Road offers the highest available level of care, and serves as the last chance for its patients. This is especially true for drug-addicted youth in our child welfare and juvenile justice systems -- and, as important, for youth who are at imminent risk of falling into those systems. If Thunder Road closes, hundreds of vulnerable adolescents and their families across Northern California will lose access to its vital services. This closure would be a devastating loss to the many communities served by Thunder Road. We understand that Sutter Health is in the process of transitioning ownership of the Thunder Road program in order to ensure its long-term viability. We respectfully request an update on the current level of operations at the Thunder Road program, as well as the current outlook for the program’s future. Thank you for your consideration of this request. Sincerely, Barbara Lee Member of Congress Mike Thompson Member of Congress Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.29.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), co-chair of the Invasive Species Caucus, and Scott De Leon, Director of the Lake County Water Resources Department were honored last week in Washington, D.C. at the second annual Reduce Risks from Invasive Species Coalition (RRISC) Congressional Reception and Awards Program. Thompson, along with co-chair Dan Benishek (R-MI), received the “Outstanding Leadership by an Election Official in Protecting America’s Environment and Economy” award. De Leon received the “Outstanding Achievement by a Local Government Agency” award. “It’s a high honor to be recognized for the work our caucus has done in both raising awareness of invasive species and passing laws to help mitigate the costly damage they can cause,” said Thompson. “The work we do would not be possible without great people like Scott De Leon and the Lake County Water Resources Department. They are on the front lines, protecting our communities from the major financial risks that invasive species pose. Scott’s recognition is well-earned.” Aquatic invasive species pose a costly challenge to water infrastructure, fisheries, and the environment in local communities across the United States. However, this problem often only receives attention after an invasive species has become established in a new area and has begun clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, and outcompeting native species. These impacts can damage fisheries, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. For example, aquatic mussels such as quagga and zebra mussels have cost U.S. communities more than $5 billion since their introduction in the 1980's. In the 5th Congressional district, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk level for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes has been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and negatively impact the water supply for residents in Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. At the event, RRISC demonstrated a website developed by the Center for Invasive Species & Ecosystem Health at the University of Georgia that allows Members of Congress to learn which invasive species affect their individual Congressional Districts. Attendees learned how the economy, environment, and public health in every Congressional District are harmed by invasive species and how the award winners are making a difference in this fight. The event was sponsored by Syngenta, the Wine Institute, Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, Dawson and Associates, and WakeWorX LLC. About Reduce Risks from Invasive Species Coalition The Reduce Risks from Invasive Species Coalition (RRISC) seeks to reduce the risks posed by invasive species to the economy, environment, and public health by educating Americans about those risks and promoting cost-effective non-regulatory risk-based strategies for reducing them.

06.26.2015	Washington—Northern California Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-05), Jerry McNerney (CA-09), Jared Huffman (CA-02), Doris Matsui (CA-06), and Mark DeSaulnier (CA-11) released the following statement in response to the House GOP water bill: “When it comes to addressing California’s water challenges, we need bold, forward-thinking action and real, workable solutions – none of which exists in the water bill offered by our Republican colleagues.” “What’s worse is that this divisive, reckless approach is déjà vu. We are deeply disappointed by the lack of progress represented in this bill, and fearful that its passage could have lasting, devastating effects to all communities across California. This bill clearly neglects to include the voices from the very stakeholders – Delta and Northern California communities, fishing industry, farms, tribes, and water districts– that this bill stands to harm.” “We are deeply disappointed by the lack of progress represented here, and believe that its passage would be disastrous for millions of Californians. Specifically, the legislation would radically change how the federal government releases water through the Central Valley Project by instructing federal officials to pump maximum amounts of water and overriding the flexibility they need to operate a complex water system. “This bill makes it more difficult for federal and state agencies to make important decisions at a time when California faces its worst drought in a generation. It also undermines crucial environmental protection laws, harms vulnerable species populations, and continues to put different parts of the state at odds with each other when it comes to finding a path forward.” “As a delegation, we are committed to working with all stakeholders and will keep our focus on comprehensive, technologically-innovative, state-wide solutions that not only will help families, farmers, small businesses, and fish and wildlife endure this drought but will better prepare our communities for the next one.” ###
06.25.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following decision following the U.S. Supreme Court’s King v. Burwell decision: “Today, the Supreme Court has once again ruled that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional, upholding that all Americas, no matter where they live, can access premium tax credits for quality, affordable health care. “Since the ACA was passed, we have spent far too much time fighting over the law, both in Congress and in the courts. This ruling should settle once-and-for-all that the Affordable Care Act is the law of the land. “With today’s decision now behind us, and the ACA standing on firm constitutional ground, we need to begin working across the aisle to build on the law’s important reforms so that all Americans can have access to quality, affordable health insurance.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
06.24.2015	Washington, D.c. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today spoke on the Floor of the House to call on Republican Leadership to bring the King-Thompson background check bill up for a vote. The bipartisan King-Thompson background check legislation, officially known as the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015 expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. The King-Thompson bill, which was introduced in early March, is co-authored by Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Bob Dold, (R-IL), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Kathleen Rice (D-NY). “Mr. Speaker, last week we witnessed an act of pure hatred and evil in Charleston, S.C. “This is a time to mourn the victims, to pray for their families, for a community to heal, and for Congress to take action against unchecked and widespread gun violence. “30-plus people are killed every day by someone using a gun. Mass shootings are becoming almost commonplace. And yet we continue to do nothing. “No legislation will stop every tragedy. But passing commonsense gun laws will at least stop some. “We need to pass background checks. It’s our first line of defense against criminals & the dangerously mentally ill getting guns. “We don’t know what laws could have prevented the shooting in Charleston. “But we do know that background checks stop help keep guns from dangerous people – and that saves lives. “If the Republican leadership has a better idea to cut down on gun violence, let’s see it. “If not, let’s bring commonsense, bipartisan reforms like my bill to expanded criminal background checks up for a vote.”
06.24.2015	WASHINGTON – U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) and Ted Poe (R-TX-02), and Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) today re-introduced bipartisan legislation to level the energy playing field by giving investors in renewable energy projects access to a decades-old corporate structure whose tax advantage is currently available only to investors in fossil fuel-based energy projects. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act is a straightforward, powerful modification of the federal tax code that could unleash significant private capital by helping additional energy-generation and renewable fuel companies form master limited partnerships, which combine the funding advantages of corporations and the tax advantages of partnerships. “We need to take an all-of-the-above approach to America’s energy future,” said Representative Thompson. “This bipartisan bill will make it easier and more attractive for private capital to be invested in renewable energy. By leveling the playing field and treating renewable energy the same way we do oil and gas, we can create jobs, strengthen our national security, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and move closer to energy independence.” “Renewable energy technologies have made tremendous progress in the last several decades, and they deserve the same shot at success in the market as traditional energy projects,” Senator Coons said. “By updating the tax code, the bipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act levels the playing field for all domestic energy sources – renewable and non-renewable – to support the all-of-the-above energy strategy we need to power our country for generations to come. This practical, market-driven solution will unleash private capital and create jobs, and that’s why it has earned broad support from Republicans and Democrats in Congress as well as academics, outside experts, business leaders, and investors.” “In order to grow our economy and increase our energy security, sound economic tools like master limited partnerships should be expanded to include additional domestic energy sources,” Senator Moran said. “MLPs have a proven record of success through real growth in our country’s energy infrastructure. This legislation builds on a successful model, and I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues on policies that will drive innovation, create American jobs, and grow our economy.” “It is time for the United States to make Middle Eastern turmoil irrelevant to our energy security,” said Representative Poe. “In order to do this we must pursue a comprehensive energy strategy that empowers all sources of domestically produced energy. This common-sense bill will help do just that. It is time for Washington to get out of the way and make it easier not harder to produce energy in this country.” A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business structure that is taxed as a partnership, but whose ownership interests are traded like corporate stock on a market. By statute, MLPs have only been available to investors in energy portfolios for oil, natural gas, coal extraction and pipeline projects. These projects get access to capital at a lower cost and are more liquid than traditional financing approaches to energy projects, making them highly effective at attracting private investment. Investors in renewable energy projects, however, have been explicitly prevented from forming MLPs, starving a fast growing portion of America’s domestic energy sector of the capital it needs to build and grow. Newly eligible power generation from renewables, renewable fuels, and related energy activities: Solar (PV and CSP), Wind, Hydropower, Marine/Hydrokinetic, Fuel Cells, Electricity Storage, Combined Heat and Power, Biomass, Waste Heat to Power, Renewable Fuels, Biodiesel, Biorefineries, Energy Efficient Buildings, Carbon Capture and Storage. In the Senate, The MLP Parity Act was also cosponsored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Susan Collins (R-ME), Angus King (I-ME) and Cory Gardner (R-CO). In the House, the MLP Parity Act was also cosponsored by Paul Gosar (R-AZ-04), Mark Amodei (R-NV-02), Peter Welch (D-VT-AL), Jerry McNerney (D-CA-09), Mike Coffman (R-CO-06) and Earl Blumenauer (D-OR-03). The MLP Parity Act has been endorsed by the following organizations: States: National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO); Businesses: Bloom Energy, Duke Energy, DuPont, First Solar, Gamesa, NRG Energy, Sempra Energy, Vestas, Virent, Williams; Trade Associations: Advanced Biofuels Association, Advanced Ethanol Coalition, Alliance to Save Energy, American Council on Renewable Energy, American Wind Energy Association, Biomass Power Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Combined Heat & Power Association, Energy Storage Association, Geothermal Energy Association, Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association, Growth Energy, Heat is Power Association, International District Energy Association, National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative, Real Estate Roundtable, Solar Energy Industries Association; Environmental Advocates: Clean Air Task Force, Union of Concerned Scientists; Think Tanks and Research Institutes: Clean Energy Trust, Third Way; Finance & Investment: CalCEF, CERES; Labor: Laborers’ International Union of North America A summary of the bill can be downloaded here: https://coons.senate.gov/download/mlp-parity-act-summary- A section-by-section summary of the bill can be downloaded here: https://coons.senate.gov/download/mlp-parity-act-section-by-section The legislation itself can be downloaded as a PDF here: https://coons.senate.gov/download/mlp-parity-act-114 Below are statements of support for the MLP Parity Act: Dan W. Reicher, Executive Director, Stanford University Steyer-Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance & Interim President and CEO, American Council on Renewable Energy (ACORE): “The MLP Parity Act is one of those rare birds on Capitol Hill: a bill with broad bipartisan support, a deep policy rationale, and serious potential for both economic and environmental benefits.” Richard Kauffman, Chair of Energy and Finance, New York Governor Andrew M. Cuomo: “The MLP Parity Act helps clean energy compete on a level playing field with other industries that use stock and bond markets. Let’s evolve our financing to match our innovative energy economy.” Phyllis Cuttino, Director, Clean Energy, The Pew Charitable Trusts: “The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act would expand a tax incentive that is currently available only to oil and gas projects to include clean energy sources as well. By opening up low-cost financing to a broader range of technologies, this legislation would help grow our domestic energy industry and increase the United States’ competitiveness. Thank you to Senators Coons and Moran and Representatives Poe and Thompson for their leadership on this legislation.” David Terry, Executive Director, National Association of State Energy Officials: "We thank Senator Coons for strongly supporting key options for financing renewable energy projects, including master limited partnerships. This continues the trend of the Senator providing thoughtful leadership in the energy arena." Rhone Resch, President and CEO, SEIA: “Today, solar is the fastest-growing source of renewable energy in America, employing 174,000 workers at 8,000 U.S. companies. Senator Coons' MLP proposal would help to build on this tremendous success by leveling the playing field between clean, renewable energy and long-entrenched energy sources in America. SEIA applauds Sen. Coons for putting forward an idea that has the potential to attract private sector investment for critically-important solar projects.” Barry Granger, Vice President for Government Affairs, DuPont: “We appreciate Senator Coons thoughtful and supportive legislation to encourage investment in cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuels by extending the tax-efficient Master Limited Partnership structure to investments in these forms of energy. These tax policies have proven effective in encouraging investment in oil and gas infrastructure and can similarly provide a much needed incentive for further developing the domestic renewable fuels industry.” James C. Greenwood, President and CEO, BIO: “The MLP Parity Act will help level the playing field between renewable fuels and fossil fuels in tax policy that shapes private investment decisions. We are especially pleased that this legislation also covers renewable chemicals, for the first time establishing tax parity for this growing biotech sector. This will clear a path for increased industrial biotechnology innovation and commercialization activities that drives employment and economic growth and reduces dependence on foreign oil.” Brooke Coleman, Executive Director, Advanced Ethanol Council: “The advanced and cellulosic ethanol industry strongly supports the efforts of Senators Coons and the other co-sponsors of Master Limited Partnership Parity Act to level the playing field for advanced technologies when it comes to MLPs. The MLP Parity Act would take a meaningful inequity out of the federal tax code, allow advanced technologies to compete for financing on a more level playing field, and put the country in a better position to create jobs and compete in the emerging $2 trillion global clean energy marketplace. Oil and gas producers are essentially using MLPs to access the retail investment market more quickly and efficiently, which in turn makes it easier to finance new oil and gas projects. It makes no sense for the federal government to continue to offer this financing vehicle to fossil fuels only. We commend this bipartisan group for tackling this issue.” John Prunkl, President and CEO, Primary Energy Recycling Corporation and Chair, Heat is Power Association: “We own and operate one of the largest waste heat to power projects in the U.S. for the benefit of a large steel producer in the Midwest. The economic and environmental benefits of this project are undeniable and have helped position our customer as a low cost producer of steel in the region while helping them produce their product with a smaller environmental impact. The MLP Parity Act would lower the cost of capital for waste heat to power projects like ours, making these projects easier to finance and more attractive to a broader range of customers, while supporting jobs and the local economy. We applaud the sponsors' efforts to level the playing field for energy generation resources like ours that improve the competitiveness of our nation’s industrial sector and generate power with no additional fuel, combustion or emissions.” Kateri Callahan, President, Alliance to Save Energy: “We applaud Alliance Honorary First Vice-Chair Senator Chris Coons and Senator Jerry Moran, sponsors of the Master Limited Partnerships (MLP) Parity Act, for this common sense bill encouraging private investment in energy efficiency projects. Bringing parity between investors in clean energy and investors in oil, natural gas, coal extraction, and pipeline projects makes sense. The MLP Parity Act will help to bolster energy productivity, create jobs, and save consumers and businesses money.” Kurt Waltzer, Managing Director, Clean Air Task Force: "The Clean Air Task Force strongly supports the MLP Parity Act. In order to address climate, we need to have several affordable low and zero carbon technology options. This bill is particularly important for Carbon Capture and Storage - a critical path technology for addressing climate change that is in the early stage of its deployment. Having MLP financing available for CCS would help reduce the financing costs of early-mover projects. Reducing financial barriers for early projects is a necessary step for getting more steel in the ground, and thereby driving down costs through learning and innovation.” Brad Crabtree and Patrick Falwell, Co-Directors, National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative: “On behalf of participating energy, industrial, and technology companies, labor unions, environmental organizations, and state officials, the National Enhanced Oil Recovery Initiative applauds the MLP Act’s sponsors for expanding MLP eligibility to increase private investment in carbon capture and storage projects. Capturing carbon dioxide from power plants and many other industrial facilities for use in enhanced oil recovery produces more American oil, creates good-paying jobs, generates net new revenue for the federal treasury, and reduces CO2 emissions.” Mike McAdams, President, Advanced Biofuels Association: "We are grateful for Senator Coons' leadership at a critical point for America's domestic biofuels industry as we are moving from the beaker to the barrel, in record time. The legislation provides an innovative financial mechanism that could significantly reduce the cost of financing as companies are reaching a game-changing milestone. Substantial investments by private companies in research and development have been the catalyst for today's success in bringing advanced biofuels to commercial markets, but stable and consistent public policies are crucial to encourage and allow additional investment dollars that will help get us across the finish line. By creating a new and more appealing option for investors, the bill helps level the playing field and ultimately promotes a more cost competitive advanced biofuel alternative to conventional fuel." Matt Carr, Executive Director, Algae Biomass Organization: “The members of the Algae Biomass Organization applaud Senator Coons for his work to create a more level playing field for investment in renewable energy projects through the MLP Parity Act. Algae-derived fuel producers are confident that when the tax code and other federal programs are applied blindly to renewable and traditional energy projects, renewable energy will see a significant increase in private investment, making renewable energy more cost competitive. The increased competition will help drive down energy bills for all ratepayers. Senator Coons' MLP Bill is essential to creating fair competition in the energy market.” Robert P. Thornton, President & CEO, International District Energy Association: “When Super Storm Sandy hit in 2012 and knocked out power to 8.1 million people in 21 states, the need for more robust and resilient energy infrastructure became alarmingly obvious and urgent for cities, communities, campuses, industry and healthcare. Today, mayors and CEO’s alike are seeking public/private partnerships to accelerate capital investment in district energy and combined heat & power microgrids to deliver more efficient and sustainable local energy solutions. The Master Limited Partnership Parity Act offers significant potential to catalyze growth of these community-scale clean energy resources. By providing a new source of liquid private capital, the Act can play a vital role in strengthening the infrastructure of our nation’s cities, communities, institutions and military bases.” Steve Clemmer, Director, Energy Research and Analysis, Union of Concerned Scientists: “Giving renewable energy projects access to low-cost financing available from publicly-traded MLPs would help level the playing field with fossil fuels and give all Americans the opportunity to invest in the transition to a cleaner, low-carbon economy. This innovative financing tool would expand the investor base and lower the cost of financing renewables projects by roughly 40 percent, addressing an existing market barrier currently inhibiting development. Such a change means more clean energy projects being built and continued economic benefits in this growing sector.” Joe Keefe, President & CEO, Pax World Mutual Funds: “We’re looking for exposure to clean energy opportunities throughout our $3.8 billion portfolio. The ability to invest in clean energy infrastructure is particularly interesting. However, like many investors, we invest through the capital markets and are thus not in a position to finance individual renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Smart changes, like those proposed for Real Estate Investment Trusts and Master Limited Partnerships, could provide opportunities for investment by firms like Pax as well as individual investors.” George Gay, CEO, First Affirmative Financial Network: “Investments like those possible through clean energy MLPs are exactly the type of investments our clients want to make. Like many Americans, they want to support projects that provide clean energy and create jobs domestically. Our typical client already has a large portion of their investment portfolio dedicated to energy projects through Master Limited Partnerships. They are investments we know and trust and their use for clean energy could be a great way to fund clean energy projects, spark job creation, catalyze economic growth, and provide investment opportunities for responsible investors.” Lowell Miller, Founder, President/CIO, Miller/Howard Investments Inc.: “There is no apparent logic to the current exclusion of renewable energy companies from the ability to form publicly traded partnerships. A large part of the intent in permitting energy companies to become MLPs was to encourage the development of domestic energy resources and infrastructure. Entity-level taxation was eliminated, and enabled a greater pass-through of revenues to shareholders, thus creating a “yield” vehicle and an additionally attractive feature of the entity’s equity. To fail to include renewable energy is, in effect, to say that the government and its tax system wants to implicitly encourage carbon-based energy development and to discourage—or not encourage—renewable energy development. It’s doubtful that a poll of citizens would agree with this standpoint.” ###
06.19.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $730,000 water conservation grant for Los Carneros Water District. The grant will go towards funding the water district’s Irrigation Efficiency Partnership Project. The funds are part of a $6.5 million Department of Interior grant package for more efficient management of California’s water. “California is going though one of the longest and most severe droughts in our state’s history, and we need to be doing all we can to conserve water and make sure we’re using our scarce resources wisely,” said Thompson. “These funds will help users avoid waste and improve efficiently, and I’m proud to support them.” “As an all-volunteer organization, the Water District is pleased to receive this grant from the Bureau of Reclamation. The grant includes both assistance from the Bureau to fund the installation of water use efficiency technology and bi-lingual training modules and assistance from the Natural Resources Conservation Service to assist the end users with on-site irrigation efficiency improvements,” said Board President John Stewart. The Irrigation Efficiency Partnership Project will install technologically advanced metering, monitoring and reporting systems to accompany the construction of the district’s recycled water pipeline. The project will build resilience to drought and support the efficient use of water by providing water users with near “real time” information on water consumption volume and rate. Users will be able to detect inefficiencies and problems with the field irrigation systems and take immediate corrective actions. This project is expected to save 138 acre-feet of water over its 20-year lifespan. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.18.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that his bipartisan legislation to improve the Medicare Advantage (MA) program for seniors passed the House by voice vote. The Increasing Regulatory Fairness Act (H.R. 2507), co-authored by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) would expand an annual comment period for proposed payment rates and regulatory changes for MA plans. “This legislation will double the time that stakeholders have to provide constructive feedback on Medicare Advantage rates and policy changes,” said Thompson. “As more Medicare beneficiaries sign up for Medicare Advantage, it is important that stakeholders have time to provide thoughtful input so that access to Medicare Advantage plans can keep pace with the growing number of enrollees.” Each year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) publishes its Medicare Advantage call letter and rate notice, which outlines payment rates and changes for the nearly 2,000 plans that serve our MA population. Nearly 10 years ago, the call letter and rate notice were less than 20 pages long. However, since then, enrollment in Medicare Advantage has nearly tripled from 5.4 million to 16 million, Medicare Advantage policy has become more complex, and the call letter and rate notice has grown to more than 150 pages. At the same time, the time between the publishing of the draft notice and the final notice, which is currently 45 days, has remained unchanged. During this 45-day period, in which there are only 15 days to comment on the proposed changes in the program, stakeholders are expected to review 150 pages of regulatory changes, and understand the impacts of the proposed policy changes on a program that provides medical care to over a third of Medicare beneficiaries. The small timeframe also deprives CMS of thoughtful, constructive feedback that is necessary to improve a program on which seniors rely. H.R. 2507 will expand the current cycle from 45 to 60 days, allowing for 30 full days – or double the current time allowed – to analyze and provide feedback on the draft call letter and rate notice. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep.

06.17.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Mike Thompson Griffith (D-CA) was joined today by Reps. Morgan Griffith (R-VA), Joyce Beatty (D-OH), James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), and Gregg Harper (R-MS in introducing the Furthering Access to Stroke Telemedicine (FAST) Act (H.R. 2799). This bipartisan bill expands access to stroke telemedicine (also called “telestroke”) treatment in Medicare, and has earned the support of the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association and the American Academy of Neurology. Similar legislation (S.1465) has been introduced in the Senate. “When having a stroke, time is of the essence,” said Congressman Thompson. “Every tool in the toolbox should be available. This bill will save lives by allowing stroke patients to be treated quickly via telemedicine no matter where they are located.” Congressman Griffith said, “At a 2001 event, my then-colleague Virginia Delegate Bob Bloxom suddenly began having a significant stroke. Two doctor-delegates, John O’Bannon and George Broman, promptly rushed to his aid. Dr. O’Bannon, a neurologist, phoned for an ambulance, and informed the paramedics of Bob’s condition. Doctors were soon able to administer to Bob the clot-busting Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), after which he recovered rapidly. To everyone’s astonishment Bob returned several days later to the Virginia House of Delegates, making remarks on the floor with no discernable impact to his speech or motor functions. tPA and telestroke ought to be readily available to help improve the chances of recovering from a stroke. I thank my colleagues for joining me in this effort.” Congresswoman Beatty said, “As a stroke survivor, I know the magnitude of this disease and its often life changing effects. Each year nearly 800,000 Americans have a stroke and we should do more to provide the tools needed to better assist and decrease recovery times of stroke survivors. Advances in stroke treatment like telestroke have proven highly effective in improving the quality of stroke care that patients receive. I thank Congressman Griffith for putting forward this important legislation and thank all the stakeholders for educating and leading the charge in stroke prevention and treatment.” Congressman Sensenbrenner said, “As the leading cause of serious long-term disability, improving treatment for stroke patients is critical. This important legislation expands patient access to telemedicine through modern technology, while saving taxpayer money. Far too many lives are lost to stroke each year. Passing the FAST Act will increase the odds of recovery and reduce the harmful effects of stroke on American families.” “To increase access to timely stroke diagnosis and high quality care; innovative strategies like telehealth are paving the way forward and focusing on what matters most: connecting patients with quality and well-timed care,” said Congressman Harper. “It is prudent that Congress supports legislation that will help increase the percentage of ischemic stroke patients being diagnosed within 3-4 hours, so that patients are able to receive therapies to avert or reduce disability. Telestroke technology is broadening patients’ access to care regardless of distance and is ultimately reshaping how healthcare is delivered.” “All Americans deserve access to high quality stroke care regardless of where they live,” said American Heart Association/American Stroke Association President Elliott Antman, M.D. “That’s why this bill is so essential – it removes a barrier for Medicare beneficiaries so they can receive the improved quality treatment telestroke provides. The association urges Congress to pass this important legislation that will help prevent long-term disability and improve the lives of all of our nation’s stroke survivors.” “Telemedicine has the potential to improve the lives of millions of individuals suffering from chronic conditions. Stroke is a condition that needs to be treated immediately in order to minimize damage to the brain. This legislation focuses on expanding access to a proven method for treating strokes quickly,” said Terrence L. Cascino MD, FAAN, President of the American Academy of Neurology. “Stroke patients with access to a neurologist have significantly better outcomes than those that do not. Reimbursing for telestroke consultations under Medicare will dramatically increase the number of beneficiaries who have timely access to neurologist, ultimately producing steep reductions in disability while saving the federal government money. It’s a win-win.” BACKGROUND: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death for Americans and contributes greatly to long-term disability and dementia some survivors. Through telestroke, a patient having a stroke can gain access to specialists through the use of interactive videoconferencing, even if the hospital at which the patient is receiving treatment does not have a stroke neurologist available around the clock. Telestroke can expand the diagnoses of ischemic strokes and allow patients to more quickly be treated with Tissue Plasminogen Activator (tPA), a drug that helps dissolve blood clots and reverse disability if administered within the first three to four and a half hours after a stroke. Currently, Medicare only covers telestroke in the most rural, underserved areas. This legislation, the FAST Act, would expand coverage nationwide. Additionally, the American Heart Association estimated it would save approximately $119 million in Medicare spending annually by reducing the need for rehabilitation and nursing home stays.

06.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05) and Diane Black (R-TN-06) today introduced H.R. 2712, the Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015. The legislation will provide workable options for employers to administer and offer health coverage to their employees by creating a voluntary prospective reporting system and streamlining the reporting process for businesses under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “While the health care law isn’t perfect, it was an important first step toward making quality, affordable health care a reality for all Americans. Now it’s time to work across the aisle to make commonsense improvements to the law, and that is exactly what this legislation will do,” said Thompson. “I’ve heard from employers of all sizes, who want to offer health care to their employees, about the challenges they face complying with the ACA’s administrative requirements. This bill would allow employers to maintain employer-sponsored health coverage, while reducing reporting burdens on businesses so they can focus on what they do best – creating jobs and growing our local economies. Our bill would also increase consumer protections by requiring that eligibility for subsidies be based on the most recent tax data. This will increase accuracy and ensure that individuals and families aren’t hit with a large and unexpected tax bill at the end of the year. “RILA applauds Representatives Black and Thompson for their leadership in introducing the Commonsense Reporting Act of 2015, which will to bring clarity to the health Exchange subsidy process and provide employers with relief under the ACA reporting requirements,” said Christine Pollack, vice president of government affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Under the current reporting requirements established by the ACA, businesses are required to collect and annually report information about the coverage they offer to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and their employees. The information reporting is intended to verify compliance with the individual and employer mandates established by the ACA, and administer subsidies through the insurance exchanges. Additionally, employers and insurers are required to collect Social Security numbers of all covered individuals, including dependents, information that many do not currently collect. However, these reporting requirements have proven to be a challenging and inefficient way to gather the necessary information and administer subsidies. Thompson and Black’s legislation is designed to refine the information reporting process under the ACA, improve accuracy and minimize the risks of employees having to repay part or all of premium tax credits or cost sharing subsidies in cases where exchanges made an incorrect eligibility determination. It also enhances privacy protections for individuals and families. Specifically, the Commonsense Reporting and Verification Act of 2015 will: Create a voluntary prospective reporting system: Permits employers to voluntarily report to the IRS general information about their health plan for the current year, helping increase the accuracy of eligibility determinations for exchange tax credits; state and federally-facilitated Exchanges will access information securely through the Data Services Hub Streamline the reporting process: Eases reporting burdens for employers who use the voluntary prospective reporting system by requiring reporting statements only for those employees for whom the employer has received notification that the employee or their dependents enrolled in coverage on the Exchanges or received a subsidy rather than issuing reporting statements for the entire workforce Protect privacy: Eliminates the requirement that employers and insurers collect dependents’ Social Security numbers Modernize transmission of information to individuals: Allows for electronic transmission of employee and enrollee statements rather than requiring this information be provided only by paper statement sent through the mail Establish oversight of reporting and tax credit verification: Requires a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study to provide insight into how availability of employer-sponsored insurance is being verified by state and federal Exchanges, and suggest improvements to the appeals and prospective reporting systems Creates eligibility process for subsidies: Requires the exchanges to review the most recent tax filing for individuals who are automatically reenrolled in exchange coverage and adjust them accordingly.

06.05.2015	Washington, D.C. –U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Dave Reichert (R-WA) introduced the bipartisan Medicare Secondary Payer and Workers’ Compensation Settlement Agreement Act, H.R. 2649, along with the Senate version introduced by Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Bill Nelson (D-FL). The legislation is intended to protect injured workers whose compensation claims overlap with Medicare coverage. Unfortunately, these claims are frequently subjected to lengthy and roundabout reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine appropriate set-aside amounts to pay for future medical costs in which Medicare may have an interest. These delays unfairly affect the injured worker making the claim. “Bureaucratic red-tape shouldn’t keep hardworking Americans from getting the money they need to cover their costs following a work-related injury,” said Thompson. “Injured Workers deserve peace of mind and the system needs to work quickly and seamlessly. I look forward to working with Congressman Reichert to pass our legislation and help make this happen.” “Hard-working Americans should not be jeopardized by inefficient, unnecessary bureaucratic procedures,” said Reichert. “Instead, injured workers should have confidence that the system is working to protect them and that their claims will be reviewed and processed fairly and quickly. I thank Congressman Thompson for joining me in introducing this bill that would ensure the system serves the American worker and their family rather than the other way around.” “Too often, workers who are injured are forced to deal with bureaucratic red tape,” Portman stated. “This commonsense bill will help those suffering from a work-related injury get the care they need and get back on their feet sooner.” Background The Medicare Secondary Payer and Workers’ Compensation Settlement Agreements Act establishes clear and consistent standards for an administrative process that provides reasonable protections for injured workers and Medicare. It would benefit injured workers, employers and insurers by creating a system of certainty, and allows the settlement process to move forward while eliminating millions of dollars in administrative costs that harm workers, employers and insurers. The legislation has widespread support from groups such as the American Insurance Association, the American Bar Association, the National Council of Self-Insurers, Property Casualty, Insurers Association of America, UWC-Strategic Services and the Workers Injury Law and Advocacy Group (WILG). Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Trent Franks (R-AZ), Joe Heck (R-NV), Jared Polis (D-CO) and Raul Ruiz (D-CA) introduced H.R. 2663 the bipartisan the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act of 2015, which aims to streamline the permitting process for wind, solar and geothermal development on public lands and establishes a revenue sharing mechanism that ensures a fair return for relevant stakeholders: “This bill will streamline renewable energy projects on public lands which will help put Californians back to work and further support an all-the-above energy approach,” said Congressman Thompson. “By removing unnecessary red tape and putting a straightforward permitting process in place, we can spur job growth, grow our energy sector and support conservation.” The Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act establishes a revenue sharing mechanism that ensures a fair return for relevant stakeholders. distributes certain revenues derived through this Act by returning 25% to the state where development takes place, 25% to the counties of origin, 15% is directed for the purposes of more efficiently processing permit applications and reducing the backlog of renewable energy permits, and 35% is deposited into a fund for sportsmen and conservation purposes, including increasing access and outdoor recreation like hunting and fishing. Due to the fact that federal lands are not taxable, state and local governments receive a share of the revenues from the sales of energy production on lands within their borders. These resources help local governments deliver critical services and develop much-needed capital improvement projects, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement. “Renewable energy is an integral part of the United States’ all-of-the-above energy strategy and our nation’s public lands should play a critical role in facilitating development. Unfortunately, federal bureaucracy and outdated permitting processes continue to plague potential economic growth on public lands,” said Congressman Gosar. “This bill is a win-win for everyone and will establish a permitting process for federal lands that encourages production and is tailored to the unique characteristics of renewable energy projects.” “Simplifying and streamlining the permitting process for renewable energy development on public lands is an easy step toward a more efficient government,” said Congressman Franks. “There is vast energy potential on these lands and we must do everything we can to harness it. This bill is a job-creator and I'm happy to support it with my colleagues.” “Nevada is poised to be a world leader in renewable energy development,” said Congressman Heck. “And with more than 80% of our land owned by the federal government, Nevada has ample opportunities to develop renewable energy projects, especially projects utilizing solar and geothermal technology. That is why this bill is so important; it streamlines the permitting process for renewable energy projects and ensures that revenue generated for the federal government by these projects stays in Nevada. Public lands should benefit the public and this bill helps move us in that direction.” “I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing a forward-thinking bipartisan bill that would streamline antiquated regulatory processes that are impeding the development of renewable energies on public lands,” said Congressman Polis “Incentivizing private investment in clean energy projects on public lands will save taxpayer dollars, create skilled jobs, secure our nation’s energy future and promote environmental health.” “This bipartisan bill will make a real difference here in our desert by streamlining renewable energy development on public lands and putting in place revenue sharing that could fund Salton Sea restoration and development,” said Dr. Ruiz. “We need pragmatic solutions to advance our energy independence and help preserve our national treasures for generations to come.” Senators Dean Heller (R-NV), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Jim Risch (R-ID), and Jon Tester (D-MT) introduced the Senate companion of this bill on May 21, 2015. Similar legislation introduced last Congress by Thompson was supported by more than 60 organizations including the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, NACo, the Western Governors’ Association, as well as numerous counties, sportsmen and local conservation groups. In addition, the Geothermal Energy Association and Ormat Technologies have already signed on in support of the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act of 2015.

05.28.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and John Garamendi (CA-3) today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has awarded the Solano County Water Agency, in collaboration with the Westside Sacramento Integrated Water Management Group, a $467,378 federal grant to assess contamination from abandoned mines in Lake, Napa, Solano, and Yolo counties. “Congratulations to the Solano County Water Agency and their partners on being awarded a brownfields grant that will help clean up abandoned land so that it’s safe and can be enjoyed by the public,” said Thompson. “By revitalizing these deserted commercial properties, we can create open spaces, spur economic development, restore habitat and improve water quality.” “This grant gives our communities the tools needed to clean abandoned mines, improve local water quality, protect public health, and support local businesses. It will also help us enjoy the great outdoors and strengthen Northern California’s tourism industry,” said Garamendi. “Thank you to the Solano County Water Agency and the Westside Sacramento Integrated Water Management Group for taking on this important work.” “EPA is committed to helping communities strengthen their local economy by cleaning up abandoned industrial and commercial properties – places where environmental cleanups and new jobs are needed most,” said Jared Blumenfeld, EPA’s Regional Administrator for the Pacific Southwest. “Solano County Water Agency and their coalition partners will use these funds to address abandoned mine properties that may be reused for open space, trails, and habitat restoration.” Specifically, the grant was awarded to Solano County to support work on the Westside Integrated Regional Water Management Plan (IRWMP). The plan was put together by the Westside-Sacramento Regional Water Management Group, a coalition of public agencies spanning Yolo, Colusa, Lake, Solano, and Napa County who have partnered to identify and address regional water resources opportunities and challenges for the areas within the Cache Creek and Putah Creek watersheds, including mercury contamination cleanup. The grant will fund the inventory of mine-scarred brownfields in these watersheds, conduct Environmental Site Assessments, and prepare site cleanup plans. The coalition will assess and prioritize mine-scarred brownfields on private lands that may be revitalized for public benefit, including open space, trails, economic development, habitat restoration, and water quality improvement. Approximately 100 abandoned mines are located in the upper Cache Creek and Putah Creek Watersheds of the inter-coastal mountain range west of the Sacramento River in Lake, Napa, Solano, and Yolo counties. Since the inception of EPA’s brownfields program in 1995, cumulative program investments have leveraged more than $22 billion from a variety of public and private sources for cleanup and redevelopment activities. This equates to an average of $17.79 leveraged per EPA brownfield dollar expended. These investments have resulted in approximately 105,942 jobs nationwide. EPA’s brownfields program empowers states, communities, and other stakeholders to work together to assess, safely clean up, and sustainably reuse brownfields sites.

05.22.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day which will be observed on Monday, May 25th: “Memorial Day is a time for us to remember that no matter what we might think about war, we must always, always honor and salute our warriors. “It is a day of remembrance. A day for families to remember the loved ones they lost, for servicemembers to remember their friends who fell next to them in battle, for our nation to remember the high cost of freedom – that those we honor were someone’s child, someone’s partner, someone’s parent. “Generations of brave men and women have laid down their lives to protect the country we love, and preserve the ideals for which it stands. They could give no greater sacrifice. And we could owe no greater debt. “So on this Memorial Day, let us honor our warriors the best way we know how: by taking care of the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, and fellow soldiers they left behind. And let us pray for peace – for the day when war is not a reality, but a far-distant memory.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.21.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) submitted a statement into the official record of the United States House of Representatives commemorating Geothermal Awareness Month. The statement was submitted today, May 21st, to mark California’s Geothermal Awareness Day. Thompson has repeatedly and successfully fought to protect geothermal royalties from harmful federal budget cuts. Geothermal revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, the counties should share in the revenue. Counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners in the continued development of geothermal energy – a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. In Fiscal Year 2014, Lake County received more than $959,000 in geothermal royalties and Sonoma County received more than $1,315,000 in geothermal royalties. The text of the statement is below. May 21, 2015 Remarks of Representative Mike Thompson Honoring California’s Geothermal Industry “Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor California’s Geothermal Industry as we celebrate Geothermal Awareness Month. It is important to recognize the success of existing geothermal facilities in California and the great value in promoting the development of new geothermal power, one of California’s greatest natural resources. “Geothermal energy is an excellent source of clean, renewable energy that supports thousands of jobs across our district and state. Not only does the production of geothermal energy boost our economy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, it provides counties with important royalty payments which they use to pay for important priorities like public safety, road maintenance and law enforcement. Furthermore, geothermal energy is critical to California’s renewable and low carbon energy goals. “Geothermal energy is locally produced and boosts rural economies through jobs, royalties, tax payments and more. While in development, a geothermal power project will employ hundreds of individuals during construction and post-construction, more than most other renewable technologies. I am proud to represent The Geysers, which lies beneath the surface of Lake and Sonoma Counties, employs 300 full-time employees at Calpine, fifty full-time employees at the Northern California Power Agency’s two Geysers power plants and more than 150 contractors. The Geysers is also the largest taxpayer in both Sonoma and Lake Counties. “Geothermal power benefits communities across the state, while providing important environmental benefits. In the south, The Salton Sea Restoration and Renewable Energy Initiative, a plan to save an important source of water and minerals in the state, can add up to 1,700 megawatts of low-impact, cost-competitive geothermal energy to the State’s power grid. In the north, the Geysers maximizes the economic and environmental benefits of the resource, and helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the equivalent of removing almost half a million cars from the road, meaning cleaner air for local towns and cities. “Mr. Speaker, it is appropriate at this time that we recognize May 21, 2015 as Geothermal Awareness Day and honor California’s Geothermal Industry for ensuring that new and existing geothermal power is part of a diverse and sustainable energy mix now and in the future.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.19.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior Member of the House Ways and Means Committee, today introduced, H.R. 2412, the New Energy for America Act which extends investment tax credits (ITC) for energy efficient residential and commercial property through 2021. “The ITC is one of the most important tools we have that supports the deployment of solar energy in the United States,” said Thompson. “Since 2006, when the residential and commercial ITCs first took effect, employment in the U.S. solar industry has grown to 175,000 jobs at more than 8,000 solar companies. It has a proven track record of success and it’s important that we extend it.” “The solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC) is paying huge dividends for America. Today, the solar industry is pumping $18 billion a year into our economy and creating tens of thousands of new jobs,” said Rhone Resch, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). “By 2016, we will be generating enough clean solar energy nationwide to power 8 million homes, offsetting 45 million metric tons of damaging carbon emissions – the equivalent of removing 10 million cars off our roads and highways. We applaud Congressman Thompson for his continued leadership on issues vital to our economy and environment – and thank all of the original co-sponsors for joining him in this important effort to build a clean energy future for America.” In 2008, the ITC was extended for eight years. Over the past eight years, the ITC has leveraged billions in investment in American solar facilities, resulting in installed capacity equal to 97 percent of total solar in America. The installed cost of solar power has also fallen by 73 percent since 2006, and prices continue to drop while efficiencies of solar panels have increased. However, the U.S. solar energy is facing a steep cliff with the looming expiration of the residential and commercial ITCs at the end of 2016. If the credits are allowed to expire, these gains in the solar industry will be placed at risk before the cost of solar energy reaches parity with traditional energy resources. Thompson’s bill addresses this by extending residential and commercial ITCs for an additional five years, the point at which many energy analysts believe that the cost of solar will reach grid parity in most U.S. electricity markets. The New Energy for America Act would also extend the ITC credits for other promising clean energy technologies, such as fuel cells, stationary microturbines, combined heat and power property, small wind and geothermal heating and cooling property. H.R. 2412 has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.15.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, won “Top Gun” honors at this week’s Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation annual shoot-out. Thompson outshot the other 35 Members of Congress that participated. “This annual shoot-out is a great event that brings together folks from both political parties for an afternoon of fun and comradery,” said Thompson, a two-time Chairman of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus and Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. “It was an honor to win the ‘Top Gun’ award, and I look forward to working with my fellow members of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus to advance conservation, recreation and safety issues that are important to us all.” Members of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus (CSC) joined the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation (CSF) and representatives from the sportsmen's community at Prince George's County Trap and Skeet Center in Glenn Dale, Maryland, for a friendly competition of shooting rounds of trap, skeet and sporting clays.

05.15.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Congressman Rob Wittman (R-VA-1) have introduced two bills that are critical for wetlands conservation efforts. The first of the bills would reauthorize funding for the popular North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) for five years, while the second would extend a particular provision of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act that is essential to NAWCA’s efforts. “The North American Wetlands Conservation Act works and Congress should make sure it gets the funds it needs to remain successful,” said Thompson. “It allows us to preserve important wetlands, protect wildlife and habitat, and conserve natural treasures for our kids and grandkids to enjoy. I look forward to working with Congressman Wittman to pass these bipartisan bills so the NAWCA can remain strong for years to come.” “One of the best things Washington can do in these challenging economic times is to reauthorize federal programs that have proven successful,” said Wittman. “NAWCA is certainly one of these programs, having leveraged more than $3 billion in matching funds from conservation partners since its enactment in 1989. Protecting, restoring, and managing wetland habitat is a productive endeavor, and it is critical that we invest efficiently to conserve our natural areas for the use and enjoyment of future generations.” Since NAWCA’s enactment in 1989, conservation partners, from small landowners to large corporations, have leveraged the federal share of NAWCA with over $3.44 billion in partner funds. Over 4,400 corporate, small business, non-profit, state and local entities have tripled NAWCA dollars with matching funds with an average partner match of 3:1. From 1990 to 2010, the program has assisted in funding 2,038 wetland conservation projects in all 50 states, Canada, and Mexico, affecting over 26 million acres of essential wildlife habitat. Today’s bill would reauthorize funding for NAWCA for five years. The second piece of legislation would extend a provision of the Pittman-Robertson Act that directs the interest earned on obligations held in the wildlife restoration fund into NAWCA for use annually through a competitive grant making process. This provision, which currently is set to expire in September, has amounted to nearly $17 million to NAWCA in some years, based upon the prevailing interest rates. # # #
05.13.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today voted to pass H.R. 2048, the bipartisan USA Freedom Act. The USA Freedom Act ends the bulk collection of call detail records (telephone metadata) and includes enhanced transparency measures. H.R. 2048 passed by a bipartisan vote of 338-88. “Our government has a responsibility to respect people’s civil liberties and protect our national security,” said Thompson. “This legislation does both. It ends the government’s bulk collection of metadata, it strengthens oversight and improves accountability, and it allows our intelligence community to continue their brave work to keep Americans safe.” H.R. 2048 prohibits bulk collection of phone records previously authorized under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act. Further, H.R. 2048 prohibits large-scale, indiscriminate collection, such as records from an entire state, city, or zip code. Additionally, it creates a panel of experts to advise the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA Court on matters of privacy and civil liberties, communications technology, and other technical or legal matters. Under H.R. 2048, in order to access the data the government must get approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). In order to obtain approval from the FISC to access the data, the government must show there is a reasonable articulable suspicion that the records sought are “relevant to an authorized investigation,” and “protect against international terrorism.” This pre-judicial FISC review is required for each individually-targeted call detail record. In emergency situations, the legislation permits the Attorney General to authorize the emergency production of call detail records. In these cases an application must be presented to the FISC within seven days. If the FISC denies the application, the government cannot use the results of the production in any proceeding before a court, agency, legislative committee or any other government entity except in instances of threats of death or seriously bodily harm. Also included in the legislation is Thompson’s bipartisan Intelligence Oversight and Accountability Act of 2013. Thompson’s provision requires that any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) decision, order or opinion that includes a denial of an Intelligence Community (IC) request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of the FISA be shared with Congress. Currently, when the FISC or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review issues a decision, order, or opinion, the Attorney General (AG) must determine if the issue considered by the FISC includes a “significant construction or interpretation of the law.” If the AG determines that the decision is significant, that information must be shared with Congress. However, if the AG determines that the decision is not “significant,” the AG is not required to share the information with Congress. Removing discretionary elements regarding what Congress should and should not receive from the FISC, will increase the Congressional oversight of IC tools and programs to ensure their proper use. Additionally, the bill requires declassification of all significant opinions of the FISA court, and requires the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to provide the public with detailed information about how they use these national security authorities. The USA Freedom Act preserves essential authorities for the intelligence and law enforcement communities to protect the nation. It also allows for continued monitoring of foreign nationals for a set period of time after they enter the United States, which ensures that potentially dangerous actors won’t be able to “go dark” once they enter the U.S. It also enhances investigations of international proliferations of mass destruction, and increases the maximum prison sentence for providing support to foreign terrorists. H.R. 2048 now goes to the Senate for their consideration. The Obama Administration supports the legislation. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
05.13.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) today applauded the California State Senate for passing SCR 48, which recogizes the importance of geothermal energy to California by marking May 2015 as Geothermal Awareness Month and May 21, 2015 as Geothermal Awareness Day. The resolution is authored by Senators Mike McGuire (D – Healdsburg) and Ben Hueso (D – San Diego). “Geothermal energy embodies several unique traits, including low integration costs, a small land footprint, and most important, a predictable, consistent and adaptable source of energy production that can accommodate the needs of power grids,” said Thompson. “It is not dependent on the weather, season or time of day, and provides a dependable source of base load power. It supports thousands of jobs across our district and state, and provides counties with important royalty payments which they depend to provide public services. I applaud Senators McGuire and Hueso for passing their resolution recognizing the importance of geothermal energy.” In 2013 alone, the California Energy Commission found that geothermal energy production in California supplied nearly 24 percent of the state’s renewable energy. And, the United States Department of Energy projects geothermal electricity generation could quadruple through 2040, helping California and other states meet their renewable energy goals. Thompson has repeatedly and successfully fought to protect geothermal royalties from harmful federal budget cuts. Geothermal revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, the counties should share in the revenue. Counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners in the continued development of geothermal energy – a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. In Fiscal Year 2014, Lake County received more than $959,000 in geothermal royalties and Sonoma County received more than $1,315,000 in geothermal royalties. “The geothermal industry is a major employer in the local communities where projects are located, providing a diverse range of full-time employment opportunities as well as contractor jobs throughout all phases of development and operation,” states Senators McGuire and Hueso’s resolution, SCR 48. California is home to the largest geothermal power facility in the world called The Geysers. Located north of San Francisco in Lake and Sonoma Counties, The Geysers is one of two places in the entire world where high temperatures and dry steam can be directly converted to generate power. The Geysers alone accounts for 36 percent of the geothermal energy produced in North America, again illustrating the importance of renewable energy for both California and the nation. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep.

05.06.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Don Young (R-AK-AL) today announced the bipartisan Veterans Congressional Fellowship Caucus is now accepting applications for 2015 fellows. The mission of the Caucus is to increase the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill. To do this, veterans Thompson (U.S. Army 1967-1973) and Young (U.S. Army 1955-1957) last year launched the caucus fellowship program. “Every office on Capitol Hill would be lucky have a fellow from this program,” said Thompson. “Our veterans are some the most skilled workers our country has to offer. As a veteran, I understand we have a responsibility to help those who’ve served our nation find a job when they return home. This fellowship program helps us to fulfill that responsibility by increasing the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill and providing our heroes with new skills to help them excel in the civilian workforce.” As a veteran myself, I am always looking for opportunities to support our veterans,” said Young. “The Veteran Fellowship Caucus is a powerful resource for both Members of Congress and our veterans. Congress significantly benefits from the knowledge and expertise of these battle tested individuals, while our veterans learn the skills necessary to excel on Capitol Hill. I have personally benefitted from hiring veterans and would encourage all my colleagues to do the same. My goal is to change the attitudes of Congress, which has in recent years forgotten about the commitment our nation made to our veterans.” According to a 2014 survey by HillVets, an organization for veterans in politics and government, the latest confirmed count of veterans working on Capitol Hill is 98 veterans out of approximately 6,060 Capitol Hill employees. 55 percent of Congressional offices responded to HillVets’ recent survey. By extrapolating a similar proportion of veteran hires to the non-responsive offices HillVets projects that no more than 178 veterans are working in personal offices on Capitol Hill. To increase the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill, the bipartisan Veterans Congressional Fellowship Caucus has created a fellowship program that will provide them with the resources and skills necessary to bridge the gap between military service and legislative work. Veterans who are interested in applying for the fellowship program can apply here: https://mikethompson.house.gov/constituent-services/veterans-fellowship-program. Veteran fellows will be placed in participating offices. They will take part in an educational curriculum where they will learn the legislative process and how to assist constituents dealing with federal agencies. The fellows will be provided a certificate at the end of their fellowship highlighting their completion of the program. ###
05.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced Viviana Garcia from Vintage High School in Napa County as the winner of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. Garcia’s work, titled “Self Portrait” will represent California's 5th Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where it will be displayed starting this June for one year. Garcia and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony on June 24th, 2015. Garcia is taught by Christine Golik. “Congratulations to Viviana on being named our district’s 2015 Congressional Art Competition winner” said Thompson. “Her work, along with the work of all of our other student artists, was outstanding. I am impressed every year with our district’s artistic talent, and I am especially proud to feature Viviana’s ‘Self-Portrait’ in the U.S. Capitol.” The portrait was done as a study on the style of Gustave Courbet. It is an oil pastel expressing agony as Gustave Courbet is known for depicting extreme expressions. Speaking about her piece, Garcia said, “Courbet expressed agonizing feelings. I was inspired to do the same.” “Quiet, pensive and self-directed, Viviana, takes each project beyond the limit,” said Golik. “Her self-portrait, after Gustave Courbet, in soft pastels exemplifies her talent. The students, faculty and I are so proud to have her work going to Washington D.C.” The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for Members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition. Photos of Garcia and her work are below. Her work was selected as the winning entry by judges who chose between her piece and the artwork of other county winners throughout the Fifth Congressional District. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.01.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement after the Department of Transportation’s (DOT) new regulations issued today for trains carrying highly-flammable crude oil. “These rules do not go far enough in addressing the safety concerns posed by trains transporting highly volatile crude oil through the heart of our communities,” said Thompson. “We need to put robust, comprehensive safety measures in place that will help make sure communities are safe, railcars meet the strongest possible standards, and first responders are prepared in the event of an emergency. DOT’s rules do not sufficiently address these issues and so Congress should act to put safety measures in place.” On April 15th, Thompson co-authored and introduced the Crude-by-Rail Safety Act which establishes comprehensive new safety and security standards for the transport of crude oil by rail. The legislation is designed to help protect communities along the nation’s railway networks. The legislation comes amid growing concerns that current standards do not address the threat posed by transporting crude oil by rail. Under Thompson’s legislation the use of all DOT-111 tank cars would be eliminated immediately. DOT’s rule sets forth a ten-year retrofit schedule that allows the continued use of the most dangerous DOT-111 tank cars for at least 3 more years. Electronic pneumatic brakes would be required under Thompson’s bill 90 days after enactment. DOT requires advanced braking systems, including electronic pneumatic brakes (ECP), but gives railroads 6-8 years to implement them. DOT’s rule puts the onus of communicating rail routing information on state and local entities and first responders, and only requires railroads to provide states with contact information from which they can request information. Thompson’s legislation would require railroads to provide this information on a weekly basis to state and local officials as well as providing emergency information and contacts in case of an accident. DOT’s rule does not include regulations that require rail inspections or address infrastructure. Thompson’s bill requires additional rail inspections to help identify rail flaws before they become an issue that can cause an accident. Additionally, Thompson’s bill establishes a maximum volatility standard for crude oil transported by rail. By reducing volatility, you reduce the likelihood of explosions on impact. The bill also establishes the strongest tank car standards to-date. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
04.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – The Eisenhower Memorial Commission today elected Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) to serve as Vice Chairman of the Commission. In addition, Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) was elected to serve as Chairman. “It’s a high honor to be named Vice Chair of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission,” said Thompson. “President Eisenhower was a giant on the international stage and his story, as told by the memorial, is a truly important project - for our nation and for the world. I look forward to working with other members of the commission as we finish our work and break ground.” “It has always been my goal to ensure there is a lasting and fitting tribute on the National Mall to Kansas’ favorite son, Dwight D. Eisenhower,” Senator Roberts commented following his election to the Chairmanship of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission. “I am humbled and honored to serve as the chair of the Commission.” The bi-partisan EMC was created by Congress in 1999. The 12-member Commission includes four Members of the United States Senate and four members of the U.S. House of Representatives. World renowned architect Frank Gehry was selected to design the memorial through a federal competition process managed by the General Services Administration’s Design Excellence Program in 2009 and the Commission chose a preferred design concept for the memorial in 2010. The design received preliminary approval from both the National Capital Planning Commission and U.S. Commission of Fine Arts in October, 2014.

04.28.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $3,746,906 Department of Health and Human Services Grant for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers (SRCHC). The funds will help SRCHC provide effective, responsive, culturally-appropriate solutions to community health needs for the patients it serves. “The work done by Santa Rosa Community Health Centers is second to none,” said Thompson. “They help make sure that no one in our community goes without the health care they need just because they don’t have the means to pay. I am proud to support these grants which allow them to continue their important service.” Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer, says, "We are grateful for the federal funding that ensures our doors are open to everyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay. SRCHC is a critical resource for over 45,000 people struggling with barriers to health posed by poverty, lack of insurance, transportation, culture, education, and homelessness. Without this ongoing support from the federal government, we simply could not continue to address the prevalent health disparities in our community." Funding from the grant specifically helps cover operational costs, such as: Staff who provide essential primary health services Medical care, programs, and services for uninsured patients Outreach and enrollment efforts Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee, today voted against H.R. 1890, the so-called “fast track” legislation that would allow for Congress to consider future trade deals without the ability to offer amendments. The legislation, considered today by the House Ways and Means Committee, would allow negotiated trade treaties to be submitted to Congress for an up or down vote. Members of Congress would not be able to offer amendments to improve trade deals. “If trade deals are done right, they can be a huge win for our economy. I witnessed this firsthand on a recent congressional trip to South East Asia. It’s an enormous market, and if we can gain access to this market, while protecting American jobs, then we could see a big boost in our exports. If we boost our exports, businesses grow, wages rise, and new jobs are created. “Improvements can be made to this bill to strengthen important benchmarks such as the creation and protection of good American jobs, improved market access for U.S. goods, strong labor and environmental standards, and meaningful congressional oversight. A good trade bill has the potential to address these concerns, but unfortunately both sides couldn’t come together to make the necessary improvements. “We should do all we can to grow exports because it means more jobs, but it cannot be done at the expense of American workers, health and safety, and the environment. There is room for improvement in this bill and it is my hope that we can work across the aisle to make those improvements as the bill moves forward.” Thompson offered two amendments during the Ways and Means Committee hearing. The first amendment would require that any trade deal negotiated by the Administration recognize the serious and growing issue of global climate change and promote international collaboration and cooperation to mitigate and address its impacts. The second amendment offered by Thompson would require that all trade deals negotiated by the Administration safeguard United States labor, environment, and public health laws and practices. Under this amendment, all negotiated trade deals would have to include provisions prohibiting foreign governments and companies from suing the United Sates on the grounds that that United Sates labor, environment or public health laws constitute unfair trade barriers. For example, under this amendment a foreign government or company could not sue the United States by claiming California’s clean air and water standards constitute an unfair trade barrier. Both of Thompson’s amendments were voted down. The bill passed out of committee by a vote of 25-13. 23 Republicans and two Democrats voted in favor of the legislation. It now goes to the floor for consideration by the full House of Representatives. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.21.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) joined Congressman John B. Larson (CT-1), in coauthoring the ‘Social Security 2100 Act’, HR 1391. The measure stands to cut taxes for Social Security recipients, provides a benefit increase for current and future beneficiaries, and keeps the system strong for generations to come. “Social Security is one of our nation’s most successful government programs, and this bill will help ensure its longevity” said Thompson. “With the measures laid out in this legation, we can both improve benefits while providing a tax break for seniors now and make sure Social Security remains strong four our kids and grandkids.” “Social Security remains the nation’s bedrock retirement program and provides vital protection for the disabled and those who have lost a loved one. Many Americans, however, do not believe it will be there for them when they retire. I am proud to announce a common sense path forward today that, not only strengthens benefits now, but ensures Social Security will be here through the next century,” said Larson. “Representative Mike Thompson knows that a growing share of Social Security beneficiaries in California’s Fifth Congressional District and all over the country depend on Social Security for all or most of their income in retirement. He knows that eroding retirement benefits will put seniors on a highway to hardship until modest Social Security benefits are strengthened rather than cut. That’s why the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare applauds Congressman Thompson for cosponsoring the “Social Security 2100 Act” which would ensure that today’s and tomorrow’s seniors have a livable retirement. This bill provides greater economic security by achieving long term solvency while making needed improvements in Social Security benefits. I thank Congressman Mike Thompson for joining a major effort to preserve and strengthen the Social Security system for the grandparents, parents and children of Northern California and of this nation,” said Max Richtman, President and CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The Social Security 2100 Act, H.R. 1391 provides the following: Tax cut for over 11 million Social Security recipients by raising the threshold on taxation of benefits Benefit bump beginning in 2016 for current and new beneficiaries Protection for low income workers by raising the minimum benefit from below the poverty line to 25 percent above Long term protection against inflation for cost of living adjustments (COLA) by adopting the CPI-E formula Social Security remains the single most reliable program for middle class Americans and is expected to pay full benefits over the next two decades. With common sense steps like those in the Social Security 2100 Act, Congress can boost this program now and ensure Social Security remains strong well into the future.

04.20.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the County of Sonoma Fleet Operations located in Santa Rosa has been selected by the Environmental Protection Agency as a Clean Air Excellence Award winner. The Clean Air Excellence Awards Program periodically recognizes and honors outstanding innovative efforts to help make progress in achieving cleaner air. Award-winning entries must directly or indirectly reduce pollutant emissions, demonstrate innovation, offer sustainable outcomes, and provide a model for others to follow. “Sonoma County has always been at the forefront when it comes to making our environment cleaner and healthier for the folks in our community,” said Thompson. “Its fleet is a model for other counties around America to follow. Not only is it reducing pollution, it’s saving money and time by increasing fuel economy and reducing travel times.” “Our County is proud to be a pioneer in the field of electric vehicle fleets,” said Supervisor Susan Gorin. “Through the development of our Electric Vehicle Charging Station Infrastructure Program, we have been able to reduce air pollution and improve air quality. We are excited to receive national recognition for our efforts.” The Sonoma County fleet is made up of nearly 300 hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, neighborhood electric vehicles, and battery electric vehicles. The hybrid fleet has reduced gasoline and diesel fuel usage by over 166,500 gallons while traveling over 10 million miles since 2002. In July 2011, Sonoma County took the lead role in creating one of the first comprehensive sets of guidelines for the installation of electric vehicle charging stations in the nation. Its model has been used as a reference by other government agencies across the United States to expedite the installation of the infrastructure necessary to support electric vehicles. To date, the County has facilitated or installed more than 50 electric vehicle charging stations with more than 100 charge ports. An additional 22 charging stations with 44 ports will be installed by the end 2015. At the end of 2013, Sonoma County had more electric vehicle charging stations operational than the entire State of California and had reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 7.9 metric tons. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.16.2015	Washington, DC – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), vice-chair of the task force today led more than 100 of their bipartisan colleagues in calling on House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to not include legislative language, or “riders” that would block efforts to reduce and prevent gun violence in Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 appropriations bills. “These riders benefit criminals and handcuff law enforcement’s ability to reduce gun violence,” said Thompson and Esty. “There is no justification for preventing scientific research into the causes of gun violence, or for restricting our ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. These riders are nothing more than backdoor legislative tactics designed to protect bad laws that shouldn’t be on the books in the first place.” In previous appropriations bills, gun-related riders have been added without open debate and have acted as roadblocks to reducing and preventing gun violence. These riders have prevented law enforcement from requiring federally licensed firearm dealers from keeping an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of criminal gun transfers, and stifled scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. Thompson’s task force recommended that Congress should act to repeal these riders and restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The task force urged Congress to fund law enforcement’s efforts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into the causes of gun violence. In policy principle number nine found here the task force recommended that Congress remove the Dickey, Rehberg and Tiahrt restrictions. The full text of the letter is below. April 16, 2015 The Honorable John A. Boehner The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House Democratic Leader U.S. House of Representatives U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20151 Washington, DC 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: As the House Committee on Appropriations develops each of the twelve Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations bills, we urge that you ensure the Committee’s legislation not include harmful legislative language, or “riders,” that impact the enforcement of gun laws, the operations of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL), or research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. Gun violence reduction and prevention is an important and sensitive issue. Given the renewed national focus on gun violence prevention, now is not the time to include controversial appropriations riders that negatively impact gun laws. Instead, such changes to gun policy must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through the regular order. This must be done in an open and transparent process where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and debated by the proper committees of authorizing jurisdiction and the entire House of the Representatives. Over the past several years, various appropriations riders related to gun policy have had unintended consequences that could have been prevented had these issues been properly and more thoroughly debated in Congress. For example, the Tiahrt and Rehberg amendments, among others, have prevented law enforcement from requiring FFLs to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of crime gun transfers, and chilled unbiased scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. As the Fiscal Year 2016 appropriations process begins through the respective subcommittees, we urge you to support the development of legislation that is free of harmful gun-related riders. Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Sincerely, ###
04.15.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today co-authored and introduced the Crude-by-Rail Safety Act which establishes comprehensive new safety and security standards for the transport of crude oil by rail. The legislation is designed to help protect communities along the nation’s railway networks. The legislation comes amid growing concerns that current standards do not address the threat posed by transporting crude oil by rail. Representatives Jim McDermott (WA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-6) and Ron Kind (WI-3), and Nita Lowey (NY-17) introduced the legislation with Thompson. “Public safety is priority number one when it comes to transporting highly volatile crude oil,” said Thompson. “Railcars transporting crude run through the heart of our communities, and as recent accidents have demonstrated, robust, comprehensive action is needed. The bill introduced today puts safety measures in place that will help make sure communities are secure, railcars are as strong as possible, and first responders are prepared in the event of an emergency.” In recent months, the large growth in crude-by-rail transport has led to increased rail traffic and a rise in rail accidents. Four derailments in the US and Canada in under a month earlier this year underscored the urgency of action to curb the risks of transporting volatile crude oil. The legislation introduced today will increase safety standards and accountability. The Crude-by-Rail Safety Act would establish new, commonsense federal safety standards for railcars transporting oil across the country. This legislation: Establishes a maximum volatility standard for crude oil (propane, butane, methane, and ethane) transported by rail Prohibits use of unsafe DOT-111 tank cars, including the removal of 37,700 unsafe cars off the rail network Establishes the strongest tank car standards to-date Requires comprehensive oil spill response planning and studies Increases fines for violating volatility standards and hazmat transport standards Requires disclosure of train movements through communities and emergency response plans Requires railroads to implement a confidential close-call reporting systems Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.09.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and John Garamendi (CA- 3) today announced a $939,062 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant for Lake Family Resource Center. The funding will be used for the center’s Early Head Start program which provides expectant mothers and low-income families with children up to 3 years old with services and resources such as child development, prenatal education, family services and parent involvement activities. “Through Early Head Start, the Lake Family Resource Center provides a wide array of benefits to young children and parents, all of which help to make sure families have a foundation for success that’s rooted in education and strong, healthy development,” said Thompson. “This grant will allow our resource center to continue its important work and I am proud to support its funding efforts.” "Head Start programs are already transforming lives in Lake County and across the country, and this grant for the Lake Family Resource Center is going to much good for parents and children in our community," Garamendi said. "This grant will give our children a greater chance to excel at an early age and help make families stronger." “Lake FRC is thrilled to receive funding to continue provision of services that help children and families to thrive,” said Lake Family Resource Center Executive Director Gloria Flaherty. “The agency is committed to strengthening families and Early Head Start builds a wonderful foundation in establishing that parents are the first and best teachers of their children.” The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families. The goals of Early Head Start are: To provide safe and developmentally enriching caregiving which promotes the physical, cognitive, social and emotional development of infants and toddlers, and prepares them for future growth and development; To support parents, both mothers and fathers, in their role as primary caregivers and teachers of their children, and families in meeting personal goals and achieving self-sufficiency across a wide variety of domains; To mobilize communities to provide the resources and environment necessary to ensure a comprehensive, integrated array of services and support for families; To ensure the provision of high quality responsive services to family through the development of trained and caring staff. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.02.2015	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Napa Chamber of Commerce officially endorsed the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument proposal. Under National Monument designation, the region would be permanently protected. This would ensure continued recreational opportunities and provide the region with an economic boost, while also safeguarding the region's beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters – which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Under a national monument designation all currently owned federal lands within the boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed more efficiently and according to the site-specific needs. “Establishing the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is good for our economy, environment and recreational opportunities,” said Thompson. “It will allow the area to be managed more efficiently and effectively, while benefiting businesses in communities surrounding the monument. I am grateful for the Chamber’s support and thank them for encouraging President Obama to take action that will permanently protect this national treasure.” In a letter to President Obama, Napa Chamber of Commerce Chair Ken Frank writes, “The Berryessa Snow Mountain region contains vital conservation and science values including plate tectonic geology and biologic diversity; recreational opportunities for all, and can offer economic opportunities for gateway communities. Economically, the Napa Valley is a gateway to the region to the south and west. Permanent protect will support our local communities surrounding the park.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches nearly one hundred miles from Northwest Solano County to the flanks of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano, Glenn, Colusa and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The area provides habitat to so many kinds of plants and animals that it has been named a biodiversity hotspot. Establishment of a National Monument will improve coordination between federal agencies and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. Studies have shown that a national monument designation would be beneficial to the surrounding economies. A study by the Winters Chamber of Congress found protected public lands are major contributors to our country’s $646 billion outdoor recreation economy. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. The study also found that local economies surrounding national monuments expanded following the creation of a new national monument. Employment, personal income, and per capita income either continued or improved in each of the regions surrounding the national monuments studied. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region also includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. Many nationally recognized recreation and sportsmen groups support a national monument designation. The National Monument designation only applies to land managed by the federal government. Lake Berryessa is not included in the National Monument designation and current access to and uses of private land will not be impacted the legislation. Under a National Monument designation all existing grazing will continue unchanged. Grazing would be permitted in additional areas as long as it is accordance with all laws and regulations. And, the expanded use of grazing could be used as a management tool. No legally-open roads or motorized vehicle trails will be closed as a result of the National Monument designation. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the National Monument and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The National Monument designation would not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of a National Monument. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. In addition to the Napa Chamber of Commerce, Napa, Lake, Yolo, Solano and Mendocino Counties have all voted in support of permanent protection for the region. Additionally, the Calistoga Chamber of Commerce, Napa County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the cities of Calistoga, Clearlake, Davis, St. Helena, West Sacramento, and Winters support permanently protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. Also in support of the permanently protecting the region are: More than 65 elected officials including former Congressman Pete McCloskey, co-author of the Endangered Species Act. More than 200 businesses representing all five involved counties Nearly 30 landowners and farmers. More than 35 Recreation and conservation groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Ducks Unlimited, the Backcountry Horsemen of California, and the National Hispanic Environmental Council Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.25.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.Con.Res. 27, the House Republicans’ Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 budget resolution. The budget resolution passed by a vote of 228-199. No Democrats voted for the resolution and 17 Republicans voted against the resolution. The budget, if passed by the Senate would be vetoed by President Obama. “If this reckless spending plan was to ever be implemented it would be a devastating blow to hard working American families,” said Thompson. “It would kill jobs, raise taxes on working families, and make it harder to afford a home, send kids to college, and save for a secure and enjoyable retirement. It is the exact opposite of what our county needs. American families deserve for their government to put a spending plan in place that grows the economy and helps make sure everyone who works hard has an fair and equal opportunity to get ahead and succeed. According to the non-partisan Economic Policy institute, the House Republicans’ budget plan will destroy 2.9 million jobs in 2017, and decrease economic growth by 2.5 percent. The budget cuts the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent, and according to the non-partisan Tax Policy Center and Citizens for Tax Justice, taxpayers with income exceeding $1 million would receive an average tax cut of more than $200,000. These cuts and tax breaks are paid for by increasing taxes on working families by an average of $2,000. The budget plan would turn Medicare into a block grant program, ending the Medicare guarantee and raising health care costs for seniors. According to CBO projections of the House Republicans’ similar plan last year, the budget would raise premiums for traditional Medicare by 50 percent on average. Seniors would also be forced to pay more for prescription drugs since the budget repeals the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which closed the Medicare Part D prescription donut hole. In 2014, 417,500 California seniors and people with disabilities saved an average of $940 because the donut hole was closed. Repealing the ACA, as the budget calls for, would require seniors to pay for preventive health services such as cancer screenings. The cost of such services was eliminated under the ACA. H.Con.Res. 27 ends higher education tax credits which 11.5 million working families use each year to help pay the cost of college. Pell Grants would be frozen at their Fiscal Year 2015 levels for 10 years, and eliminates 89 billion in Pell Grant increases that Congress already enacted and paid for. 1,027,000 California students rely on Pell grants to afford college. The budget plan would also raise the cost of student loans by $34.8 billion over ten years by charging interest on loans while students are still in college. Additionally, it eliminates $16.3 billion in student loan repayment benefits that cap borrowers’ monthly student-loan bills as a percentage of their income. Overall, the budget cuts support for student loans and college aid by more than $220 billion over 10 years. Additionally, 4,510 fewer children in California would have access to Head Start services. H.Con.Res. 27 cuts $187 billion – nearly 20 percent – from transportation funding in the coming decade despite the fact every $1 billion in infrastructure spending creates nearly 35,000 jobs. The budget cuts funding for veterans’ programs by $1.9 billion in FY 2016 and by $19 billion over the next ten years below the President’s proposed budget. It slashes investments in clean energy, jeopardizes nutrition assistance, reduces housing vouchers, and cuts job training and employment services.

03.25.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA) today led 125 of their colleagues in calling on appropriators to provide funds to strengthen the National Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The letter, signed by 119 Democrats and 8 Republicans, urged the House Appropriations Committee to, at minimum, maintain Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 funding levels in House version of the FY 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. Last year, Thompson and Fitzpatrick passed a bipartisan amendment which led to NICS funding being increased to record levels in the FY 2015 omnibus appropriations bill. The funds are used to help states improve data submissions to NICS. “To stop criminals from getting guns we need to make sure their names are in the background check system,” said Thompson and Fitzpatrick in a joint statement. “Our national criminal background check system is only as good as the data you put in it. These funds will help states get all their information into the system so that we know if a person trying to buy a gun is a criminal, a domestic abuser or is dangerously mentally ill.” NICS, the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm, is missing information. Because of this, people who otherwise would not pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. A USA Today report found that in just five states, records for at least 2.5 million fugitives weren’t entered into the NICS system. According to a report by Everytown, 12 states have still submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the NICS system. According to the Department of Justice, six states have fewer than 30 total records each in the NICS system in all prohibited categories combined. Maintaining, at minimum, the funding from the FY 2015 omnibus appropriations bill will provide states with additional resources to ensure the background check system has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not possess guns. The full text is below. The Honorable John Culberson Chairman House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies H-309, The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Chaka Fattah Ranking Member House Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies 1016 Longworth House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairman Culberson and Ranking Member Fattah: As the Committee begins writing the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill, we respectfully request funding for implementation of the National Instant Background Check Systems (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-180) at least at the FY15 level of $73 million. The Act provides for grants to states to upgrade their electronic databases, incentives for states to transmit electronic records to NICS, penalties for states that do not comply, and requirements for keeping NICS up-to-date, including the removal of obsolete or erroneous records. The Act also provides financial incentives for states to develop “relief from disabilities” procedures for persons who have lost the right to possess a firearm due to a mental health adjudication or commitment but are later determined not to pose a danger to public safety. As you are aware, the Gun Control Act of 1968 (Pub. L. No. 90-618) precludes certain persons, including felons, those adjudicated mentally ill, illegal aliens, drug abusers, and those under a restraining order, from purchasing or possessing firearms. The only way to enforce these requirements effectively is to ensure that NICS has up-to-date records from state and federal sources. At present, millions of records are currently missing from the various databases that make up NICS. Many states do not have the resources necessary to implement the technology to automate criminal history and mental health records, which has allowed persons otherwise prohibited from purchasing or owning firearms to do so in violation of federal law. This remains a serious problem because many states still do not submit adequate numbers of mental health and criminal records to make NICS work as intended. The intent of NICS Improvement Amendments Act is to ensure there are sufficient resources to provide accurate and timely data about persons prohibited from possessing firearms. This cannot be achieved absent adequate funding for NICS. In fact, demand for this funding is increasing every year and we must provide adequate funding to meet this growing need. While the Act authorized a combined total of $1.125 billion from FY 2009 through FY 2013, a total of only $63.567 million was appropriated during that time. We fully understand the current constraints on the federal budget and appropriations process. Keeping citizens safe, however, must be Congress’s top priority. The NICS Improvement Amendments Act has been severely underfunded in years past, and the recent tragedies in Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona, unfortunately show that gun violence is still a very serious issue that plagues our country. Ensuring NICS has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of persons who cannot safely and legally possess them while at the same time protecting Americans’ Second Amendment rights will save lives. Consequently, we respectfully urge the Committee to fund the NICS Improvement Amendments Act at a level that at minimum matches $73 million. Thank you for your consideration of our request. For additional information, please contact us or Jennifer Goedke (Rep. Thompson). Sincerely, ###
03.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today secured the final $1.8 million needed to complete the Napa Flood Project. The $1.8 million will be used for landscaping, turf reinforcement, irrigation and erosion control. “The Napa Flood Project is one of the fundamental pillars of job creation and economic development in our community,” said Thompson. “I am proud to say that after decades of dedication and hard work that we have the money we need to finish the job. It’s a truly great day for our county as this project will improve water quality, provide flood protection to homes and businesses, and help create and support thousands of jobs. Many thanks to the Army Corps and all of our local leaders for their efforts to get this project over the finish line.” “It’s a great day for the city and the community and we need to thank Mike Thompson for his work with the Chief of Engineers, the Assistant Secretary of the Army and the Office of Management and Budget for securing the funding to move our project towards completion,” said Mayor Jill Techel. “Mike Thompson continues to be the leader that every community would love to have; persuasive, optimistic and tenacious." In June 2013, Thompson secured $16.62 million in funds in the Army Corps of Engineers' Fiscal Year 2013 work plan to complete the Napa Flood Project's Downtown Bypass Channel. This project will provide 100-year flood protection to the City of Napa and support business development and job creation throughout the community. The Napa Flood Project will improve water quality, create urban wetlands, and enhance wildlife habitats, while also providing flood protection to 2,700 homes, 350 businesses, and more than 50 public properties. Thompson previously worked to secure more than $226 million on this project. To date, over $900 million in public and private investment has been made in Napa because of the promise that the project's completion will reduce instances of flooding in the City and County. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement after U.S. District Court Judge ruled against the Mishewal Wappo tribe in their suit against the federal government seeking status restoration. Had the tribe been successful in its suit, land in Napa County would have been placed into federal trust, exempting it from all local and state regulations. “More than 50 years after the Wappo tribe was congressionally derecognized, an attempt to circumvent Congress and the U.S. Department of Interior by going through the courts rightfully failed,” said Thompson. “The motivation behind this lawsuit was clear. By the group’s own admission, if the lawsuit was successful, they would have attempted to build a casino in Napa or Sonoma Counties. This ruling respects separation of powers, complies with established statute of limitations law, and protects our region’s important agricultural lands from Las Vegas-style gambling.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of Women’s History Month, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) recognized Cynthia Guzman as Napa County’s Woman of the Year. Guzman was one of five women recognized. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored. “I regularly have the privilege to work with extraordinary women across our district. It’s important that they are recognized – and what better time to do it than Women’s History Month,” said Thompson. “Cynthia is a strong advocate for Alzheimer’s awareness and she works tirelessly to reduce the stigma attached to the disease. She’s come to my office in Washington, D.C. and I’m proud to have participated multiple times in her Walk to End Alzheimer’s. She is an extraordinary person and it’s my honor to recognize her as Napa County’s Woman of the Year.” In 2011, Ms. Guzman was diagnosed on her 63rd birthday with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease. Not one to accept her challenges without a fight, Ms. Guzman moved to Napa to be closer to her family, and began raising awareness and advocating for increased research funding for this terrible disease. She has been an active member of the Alzheimer’s Association and has been spreading her personal story throughout the region. Ms. Guzman’s story has been published in multiple books, magazine, and newspapers. She has come to Washington, D.C. as a part of the Alzheimer’s Association Advocacy Forum and has organized multiple Walk to End Alzheimer’s in our community. The origins of Women’s History Month begin in Thompson’s district. Until the late 1970’s, women’s history was rarely included in K-12 curriculum and was virtually absent in public awareness. To counter this, the Education Taskforce of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978 centered on International Women’s History Day. With the help of the National Women’s History Project, founded in Sonoma County, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of Women’s History Week. In 1981, Congress responded to the growing popularity of Women’s History Week by making it a national observance and eventually expanding the week to a month in 1987. Earlier this month, Thompson introduced H. RES. 525, a bipartisan resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives honoring March as Women’s History Month. The women recognized were: · Cynthia Guzman – Napa County Woman of the Year · Pamela Phillips – Lake County Woman of the Year · Gaye LeBaron – Sonoma County Woman of the Year · Karen Taylor – Solano County Woman of the Year · Maureen Toms – Contra Costa County Woman of the Year Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of Women’s History Month, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) recognized Karen Taylor as Solano County’s Woman of the Year. Taylor was one of five women recognized. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored. “I regularly have the privilege to work with extraordinary women across our district. It’s important that they are recognized – and what better time to do it than Women’s History Month,” said Thompson. “Karen is a fixture in her neighborhood and our Vallejo community. She’s always strived to help young people in Vallejo have the best experiences possible and to see the best in themselves. She is an extraordinary individual who volunteers her time to help others. It’s my honor to recognize her as Solano County’s Woman of the Year.” Taylor is a considerate woman with a loving and giving heart, and is always seeking to help the less fortunate in our community, especially youth, homeless, and elders. From block parties that she put on as a teenager to field trips to take kids to Lake Tahoe to see snow for the first time, she has been a fixture in her neighborhood and the Vallejo community. She has helped young people in Vallejo by forming activity groups, such as Karen’s Tiny Tots and Karen’s Girls Clubs for kids and teenagers. Taylor has strived to improve our community for more than thirty years. She has worked with kids to perform plays, has hosted meetings on pregnancy prevention for teenage girls, and has devoted countless hours of work to the Solano AIDS Coalition.

03.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of Women’s History Month, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) recognized Maureen Toms as Contra Costa County’s Woman of the Year. Toms was one of five women recognized. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored. “I regularly have the privilege to work with extraordinary women across our district. It’s important that they are recognized – and what better time to do it than Women’s History Month,” said Thompson. “Maureen is a tireless volunteer for our community. She helped develop the new city hall in Pinole, worked to improve to the Pinole Swim Center, obtained grants to plant trees in town, and helped with the reconstruction of the Pinole Middle School. She’s active with the Special Olympics and a strong advocate for children with disabilities. It’s my honor to recognize her as Contra Costa County’s Woman of the Year.” Toms has been a strong supporter of the Special Olympics; as a parent of a child with Down Syndrome, she has been a tireless advocate for children with disabilities. She has also donated hundreds of hours as a volunteer on numerous planning committees that have led to improving the quality of life for the families and residents in the City of Pinole and West Contra Costa County. Toms grew up in a family that believed in serving their community, and that philosophy became a lifelong passion. From helping children with intellectual disabilities overcome barriers through sports and shatter stereotypes with the Special Olympics to helping beautify her local neighborhood by obtaining grants to plant trees in a local park, she has been a tireless advocate for the people and places that make our community special.

03.22.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of Women’s History Month, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) recognized Gaye LeBaron as Sonoma County’s Woman of the Year. LeBaron was one of five women recognized. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored. “I regularly have the privilege to work with extraordinary women across our district. It’s important that they are recognized – and what better time to do it than Women’s History Month,” said Thompson. “Gaye is a leading historian and a pillar of the community. I’ve had the privilege to know and work with her since I first ran for public office. She is an extraordinary individual and it’s my honor to recognize her as Sonoma County’s Woman of the Year.” LeBaron is a renowned columnist for the Press Democrat newspaper, the best known historian of Sonoma County, and has been prolifically telling the story of our county, with over eight thousand articles published. Her influence and acclaim have grown over the years because of this focus and the level of trust she has built with the general public through her constancy. She’s worked for the Press Democrat for 45 years. The origins of Women’s History Month begin in Thompson’s district. Until the late 1970’s, women’s history was rarely included in K-12 curriculum and was virtually absent in public awareness. To counter this, the Education Taskforce of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978 centered on International Women’s History Day.

03.21.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of Women’s History Month, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) recognized Pamela Phillips as Lake County’s Woman of the Year. Phillips was one of five women recognized. One woman from each of the five counties that make up the Fifth Congressional District was honored. “I regularly have the privilege to work with extraordinary women across our district. It’s important that they are recognized – and what better time to do it than Women’s History Month,” said Thompson. “Pam served five amazing decades as an employee of the Social Security Administration, retiring last June as Manager of the Lakeport Social Security Office where she worked for more than 30 years. I’ve worked with Pam for the past 16 years and her work ethic and dedication to our mutual constituents was outstanding. She is an extraordinary public servant and it’s my honor to recognize her as Lake County’s Woman of the Year.” Over her exemplary five decade career as a public servant, Phillips worked her way up from receptionist to Field Manager of the Lakeport Social Security Office. Throughout her career, Phillips always did her upmost to alleviate the immediate personal need in every dire situation and to see that every question was answered and every beneficiary was well-served.

03.17.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced more than $4.3 million in U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grants to restore river habitat and improve water quality in Napa and Sonoma Counties. The grants are part of the $8.7 million in federal funds awarded to local and state organizations for projects to restore tidal marshes, river habitat, and improve water quality in and around San Francisco Bay. “These grants will benefit our communities, wildlife and the long-term health of the greater San Francisco Bay estuary,” said Thompson. “By improving water quality and restoring habitat, we can help make sure these important natural resources, and the jobs and businesses that depend on them, are protected and kept strong.” The grants will support the following projects: Sears Point Tidal Marsh Restoration $1.5 million to Sonoma Land Trust with partners U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), San Pablo Bay National Wildlife Refuge (NWR), California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Ducks Unlimited and San Francisco Bay Joint Venture. Restoring 960 acres of tidal wetlands by breaching a levee to connect tidal marsh habitat from the Sonoma Baylands to San Pablo Bay, providing habitat for protected species and creating levee slopes designed to ensure marsh habitat growth as sea level rises. Napa River Restoration $894,324 to Napa County with partners Napa County Resource Conservation District (RCD), California Land Stewardship Institute and private landowners. Restoring habitat within the Napa River’s Oakville to Oak Knoll reach by widening the channel, enhancing the floodplain, and reducing bank erosion to improve water quality and salmon habitat. Upper York Creek Dam Removal and Restoration $987,876 to City of St. Helena with partners California Department of Water Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, Napa County and Napa County RCD. Removing an earthen dam and fish passage barrier to open access to 1.5 miles of steelhead habitat and restoring a channel cross-section on Upper York Creek to reconnect the creek with the Napa River. Clean Streams in Southern Sonoma County $991,156 to Sonoma County with partners City of Sonoma, Sonoma Ecology Center, Sonoma County Parks, Sonoma County Water Agency and private landowners. Reducing sediment and pathogen pollution in Sonoma Creek and Petaluma River watersheds and tracking project progress on improving water quality in Sonoma Creek. San Francisco Bay, a designated “estuary of national significance” under the Clean Water Act, is recognized around the world for its natural beauty and ecological significance. The Bay and its tributaries provide vital fish and wild­life habitat within the Bay-Delta estuary which drains nearly half of California’s watersheds via the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Since 2008, EPA’s San Francisco Bay Water Quality Improvement Fund has provided over $40 million in competitive grants for nearly 60 projects that are restoring water quality and wetlands, reducing polluted runoff, and greening development in San Francisco Bay and its watershed. These grantees and their partners represent a network of over 70 government agencies, resource conservation districts, land trusts, watershed groups, and non-profit organizations across the Bay Area’s nine counties. EPA’s 54-page progress report on these investments and environmental results over the last six years has just been released to the public: https://www2.epa.gov/sfbay-delta/san-francisco-bay-water-quality-improvement-fund-progress-report-2008-2014 Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.16.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $4,965,527 Head Start Grant for Community Action Partnership (CAP) of Sonoma County. The funding will be used to provide Head Start and Early Head Start services to 552 children and their families at 12 center based sites throughout Sonoma County. “Head Start and Early Head Start are about making sure our kids have a foundation for success that’s rooted in education and strong, healthy development,” said Thompson. “No one does better work when it comes to running these programs than CAP. This grant will help them continue their great work, and I am proud to continually support their efforts.” “We are pleased to partner with the Office of Head Start to provide this resource to assure that children are ready to enter school.” said Tim Reese, executive director of Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County. “Head Start is a key partner in assuring that we meet our collective Health Action vision of Sonoma County being the heathiest place to live by 2020.” Federal Head Start and Early Head Start programs promote the school readiness of children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants’ increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18) and Mike Thompson (CA-5) reintroduced today the Fair Access to Health Care Act, legislation to expand the eligibility for premium tax credits for people living in high-cost areas who purchase health insurance through the federal and state exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “The Affordable Care Act is helping low to middle-income Americans buy private health insurance with subsidies adjusted to their income level,” Eshoo said. “While this is tremendously helpful to millions of individuals and families, there are others in high-cost areas, like those in my home district of Silicon Valley, who cannot benefit because the threshold to qualify for subsidies does not account for the cost of living.” Eshoo continued, “The Fair Access to Health Act ties health insurance subsidies to the cost of living of a geographic area instead of to the national federal poverty level. In doing so, we can expand access to health insurance and improve our nation’s health.” “In many communities in our district the cost of living is far higher than the national average,” said Thompson. “A middle class income means different things in different parts of the country and that’s why the income thresholds set by the ACA need to take cost of living into account. With qualifying income levels set across-the-board, many hard working families in high-cost areas like ours don’t qualify for subsides and therefore can’t get affordable insurance. This bill will help make health insurance affordable, no matter where someone lives.” Currently the ACA allows those making between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to qualify for premium tax credits to help them purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. At this level, an individual making up to $45,960 and a family of four making up to $94,200 qualify for premium tax credits. However, the income threshold used to determine eligibility for these tax credits doesn’t take into account the cost of living for different geographic areas. A family living in New York City or San Francisco is treated the same as a family living in a small town in South Carolina or Texas. The Fair Access to Health Care Act would allow the premium tax credits offered through the ACA to be increased proportionally based on an area’s cost of living. Under the bill, the federal poverty level threshold will increase proportionally based on an area’s cost of living above the national average cost-of-living. The cost-of-living is determined using the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). Based on available SPM data, using this calculation: In the San Francisco-Oakland-Freemont, California Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a family of four earning up to $125,757 and individuals earning up to $61,356 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Vallejo-Fairfield, CA MSA, a family of four earning up to $109,743 and an individual earning up to $53,543 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Napa, CA MSA a family of four earning up to $116,808 and individuals earning up to$56,990 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Santa Rosa-Petaluma, CA MSA a family of four earning up to $113,746 and individuals earning up to $55,496 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. Precedent already exists in the ACA for such cost-of-living adjustments. The ACA accounts for the cost-of-living differences in Alaska and Hawaii by using a higher income threshold to determine subsidy eligibility. The Fair Access to Health Care Act would provide similar adjustments to the other 48 states. Individuals and families from low-cost geographical areas will not be impacted by this legislation. Those earning up to 400 percent of the FPL would still be eligible for subsides and no region would see a reduction from their current subsidy level. # # #
03.06.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – This week, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins (R-KS) introduced the Medicare Patient Access to Hospice Act. This legislation fixes outdated Medicare regulations so that Physician Assistants can provide primary care to hospice patients, which is currently not covered under the current rules. "Access to hospice care should not depend on where you live, or your proximity to certain medical providers," said Congressman Thompson. "In many communities, physician assistants are the only primary health care providers. This bill will make sure that people in those areas are able to access hospice care by allowing physician assistants to look after hospice patients." “Increasing patient access is essential to ensuring hospice patients receive the necessary care,” said Congresswoman Jenkins. “Yet, the antiquated regulations of Medicare prevent Physician Assistants, who are often the only primary health care providers in more rural areas, from helping terminally ill patients, even when there are no alternative options. The Medicare Patient Access to Hospice Act enables physician assistants to be recognized as physicians in certain cases so they can provide care to those people in their time of greatest need. This is a proposition that is just plain commonsense. For years, the number of primary care physicians has been declining in more remote areas and this bill would help combat the problem so that some of the most vulnerable Kansans and Americans get the healthcare they deserve.” # # #
03.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today announced a $1,411,750 Department of Health and Human Services Grant to Napa County’s Child Start. The goal of the Early Head Start-Child Care Partnership grant is to expand high quality early learning opportunities for Napa and Solano Counties’ most vulnerable infants and toddlers. The grant will be used to form collaborative partnerships between Child Start and local child care programs like Napa Valley Adult Education's Teen Parent Program and Solano Community College Children’s Programs. “These funds will help parents and their children get the care and education they need to be successful and pursue their career goals,” said Thompson. “Everyone, no matter who they are or where they are from deserves an equal opportunity to succeed and this grant will help our great community organizations make that happen.” “This grant will empower Child Start to build on long-standing community relationships and work with local child care providers to address the desperate need for high quality care for infants and toddlers in Napa and Solano Counties,” said Debbie Peralez, Executive Director for Child Start. “We look forward to strengthening these partnerships and continuing to lay a foundation for success for our community’s at-risk children.” “We look forward to new opportunities to collaborate with Child Start to enhance the quality of our infant/toddler center and provide services needed to support young parents in completing their education and career development, and realizing their dreams," said Rhonda Slota, Principal at Napa Valley Adult Education. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) was appointed by Speaker John Boehner to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. Thompson will fill the spot vacated by Former Rep. John Dingell (D-MI). The Migratory Bird Conservation Commission was established on February 18, 1929, by the passage of the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. It was created and authorized to consider and approve any areas of land and/or water recommended by the Secretary of the Interior for purchase or rental by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and to fix the price or prices at which such areas may be purchased or rented. In addition to approving purchase and rental prices, the Commission considers the establishment of new waterfowl refuges. “It is a tremendous honor to be appointed to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission, and to the first member in the commission’s history from the Pacific Flyway,” said Thompson. “As a longtime waterfowler and conservationist I am proud to be part of this commission, and to have the opportunity to work on protecting and preserving our great wetlands and diverse wildlife.” "Congressman Thompson's knowledge of conservation, wetlands and waterfowl habitat makes him a perfect fit for the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission," said Ducks Unlimited President George Dunklin. "His appointment to the Commission is a step forward for conservationists nationwide." “Congressman Mike Thompson is a dedicated sportsman with a long history of water fowling. His knowledge of key North American wetlands, especially in the pacific flyway, makes him a great choice for the commission,” said Ducks Unlimited Director of Conservation Programs Fritz Reid. As an elected official Thompson has led efforts to preserve waterfowl and conserve wetlands. In the early 1990s, homeless people started camping along the South Spit of Humboldt Bay, located in Humboldt County, California. The Spit is one of the most important hunting areas in the state, annually hosts large numbers of Black Brant and other waterbirds. The situation on the Spit quickly worsened as garbage piled up, pit bulls hunted in packs, and abandoned cars, buses and trailers leaked fluids into wetlands. At the time, the land was privately owned and despite the huge numbers of felons on-site, enforcement of trespassing was lax. After visiting the Spit, Thompson forged new partnerships with local leaders. When agencies developed management plans that limited public use, Thompson rejected them. He wanted the Spit’s historical uses preserved, most notably waterfowl hunting and fishing. Through Thompson’s work, the Spit was acquired by the California Department of Fish and Game which gave the land the Wildlife Area status it enjoys today. Thompson ensured that the homeless were offered services and a huge clean-up took place to remove the toxins. Today, wildlife thrives and public access is secure. Thompson also helped forge a deal in California’s Del Norte County to save the Aleutian Goose. At the time the goose population was growing and they needed more grazing areas to forage. The geese competed with local ranchers, cattle and dairy operations. This created hardships for both the geese and the local farmers and ranchers. Thompson struck a deal with California State Parks that allowed the land to be restored to short grass, the preferred forage for Aleutians. This was a true win for the geese and the landowners. Continuing his work on preservation, Thompson secured more than $20 million to restore the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh. This 20 year restoration project represents a remarkable recovery of one of the San Francisco Bay’s great wetlands. The area was once diked and drained for agricultural purposes. After it was drained, it was used for commercial salt production. Because of Thompson’s efforts, 10,000 acres of wetlands have been restored and hunting opportunities have been increased. Additionally, as a co-author of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, Thompson’s fingerprints are on conservation efforts spanning far beyond California. This law co-written by Thompson is responsible for the conservation of more than 23 million acres of wetlands. Since the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission's establishment, more than 5.5 million acres have been acquired by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by fee purchase, easement, or lease with monies from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The Fund provides the Department of the Interior with financing for the acquisition of migratory bird habitat. There are four major sources of money for the Fund. The most well-known source is the revenue received from the sale of Migratory Bird Hunting and Conservation Stamps, commonly known as Duck Stamps. The other three major sources include appropriations authorized by the Wetlands Loan Act of October 4, 1961, import duties collected on arms and ammunition, and receipts from the sale of refuge admission permits as provided for by the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986. The Fund is further supplemented by receipts from the sale of products from rights-of-way across national wildlife refuges, disposals of refuge land, and reverted Federal Aid funds. In 1989, the Commission acquired the additional responsibility to approve project funding under the North American Wetlands Conservation Act. This Act provides for Federal funding to encourage partnerships to protect, enhance, restore, and manage wetlands and other habitats for migratory birds and other fish and wildlife to carry out the North American Waterfowl Management Plan. The North American Wetlands Conservation Council, which was created by this legislation, submits project recommendations to the Commission for funding approval. The Council has submitted more than 1,900 high priority projects for consideration by the Commission since its establishment. All have been approved for funding, representing a total of $1 billion for the protection of wetland habitat. Thompson was recently inducted into the California Waterfowl Hall of Fame, where he was recognized for his passion for the traditions of waterfowling, one sign of which is that he is renowned as one of the foremost authorities on vintage California waterfowl decoys. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.04.2015	Washington, DC – A coalition of U.S. House members today introduced H.R. 1217, the bipartisan King-Thompson background check legislation, officially known as the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015. The bill, authored by U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Pete King (R-NY), expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. The King-Thompson bill was co-authored by Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Bob Dold, (R-IL), Bennie Thompson (D-MS), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) and Kathleen Rice (D-NY). “This anti-criminal, pro-Second Amendment bill will help keep spouses, kids and communities safe by preventing dangerous people from getting guns,” said Mike Thompson. “Background checks are the first line of defense in our efforts to keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill, and Congress should fortify that first line of defense by passing our bipartisan bill to close the system’s loopholes.” “There is no single law that can put an end to mass shootings or gun violence, but there are certainly proactive steps we can take to keep guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, and the dangerously mentally ill. To that end, I have introduced bipartisan background check legislation called the King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. My legislation extends the current background check system to all commercial sales. It also improves state and federal recordkeeping to strengthen the background check database (NICS), and authorizes a commission to examine incidents of mass violence in the U.S.,” said King. “When background checks are used, they keep guns out of the hands of people we all agree shouldn’t have guns. It is estimated that four out of 10 gun buyers do not go through a background check when purchasing a firearm – meaning those with criminal records can easily bypass the system. As government officials it is our responsibility to protect our citizens, and when it comes to gun violence we must do more. I will continue to push for action on background check legislation in Congress, and support efforts to reduce gun violence. The overwhelming majority of Americans want to see action, and we owe it to the victims and their families to prevent such tragedies from occurring again.” “This is a common-sense, bipartisan proposal that creates a comprehensive system for background checks while not infringing on constitutional rights. This measure – as well as efforts to end straw purchases and ensure that the dangerously mentally ill cannot lawfully get access to a gun – have my full support,” said Fitzpatrick. “A stronger background check system on commercial sales will make our communities safer and help keep guns out of the hands of people who shouldn’t have them,” said Meehan. “This legislation will help save lives while protecting the rights of law-abiding Americans.” "As a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and responsible gun ownership, I am proud to co-author this commonsense legislation that will help keep firearms out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. This bipartisan bill takes critical steps towards stemming gun violence in our communities and schools by closing loopholes in the system that all too often allow firearms to end up in the wrong hands. This is a critically important cause that transcends party lines, and I hope Congress and the President will move quickly to put this law on the books," said Dold. “This bill is a real commonsense approach to keeping our communities safe. As an avid hunter and gamer, I am pleased to co-sponsor legislation that keeps our communities safe without disruption to responsible gun owning citizens. I urge Congress to move quickly on the passage of this legislation and look forward to the benefits of this law,” said Bennie G. Thompson. “The current loopholes that allow criminals and the dangerously mentally ill to buy guns over the internet or at a gun show without a background check put our families at risk,” said Esty. “It’s time for Congress to listen to the voices of over 90 percent of Americans, including the majority of gun owners, and expand background checks to cover every commercial gun sale.” “This bill is about taking common-sense steps to enforce current law,” said Rice. “Violent criminals, domestic abusers and people with dangerous mental disorders are already legally prohibited from buying guns, but we can’t enforce that when anyone can avoid a background check by going to a gun show or ordering online. As a former district attorney and lifelong prosecutor, I’ve held the hands of too many grieving mothers and fathers not to do anything I can to prevent gun violence, and this bill is an opportunity to do just that. It’s bipartisan, it’s common sense, and I urge all my colleagues to give it the support it deserves.” Under the legislation, the current background check system would be expanded to require comprehensive and enforceable background checks on all commercial gun sales, such as those made at gun shows, over the internet or through classified ads. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, no system is in place to prevent these same prohibited purchasers from buying identical guns at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad with no questions asked because background checks are not required for these kinds of sales. The King-Thompson bill closes these loopholes. The legislation also supports the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It bans the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for firearms transfers between family members, friends and hunting buddies. It allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state in which they are stationed. It permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. And, under the bill, background checks would continue to be conducted in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. The bill also help strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. The King-Thompson legislation is identical to H.R. 1565, the background check legislation authored by the representatives in the 113th Congress. And it is identical to the bipartisan background checks bill authored by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) in the 113th Congress. The Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2015 has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. ###
03.03.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today introduced H. RES. 137, a bipartisan resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives honoring March as Women’s History Month. The origins of Women’s History Month begin in Thompson’s district. “The roots of Women’s History Month are in our district, and I’m proud to recognize the many contributions that women have made to our nation with this resolution,” said Thompson. “However, honoring women should not be limited to one month out of the year. We need to work every day to make sure women have the same opportunities as men to move up and succeed – because when women succeed, America succeeds.” Until the late 1970’s, women’s history was rarely included in K-12 curriculum and was virtually absent in public awareness. To counter this, the Education Taskforce of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978 centered on International Women’s History Day. With the help of the National Women’s History Project, founded in Sonoma County, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of Women’s History Week. In 1981, Congress responded to the growing popularity of Women’s History Week by making it a national observance and eventually expanding the week to a month in 1987. The National Women’s History Project (NWHP) is based in Santa Rosa and chooses the theme of National Women’s History Month each year. This year, National Women’s History Month celebrates “Weaving the Story of Women’s Lives.” Thompson has previously co-authored numerous pieces of legislation to ensure women are treated equally in the workplace. Those bills include the Paycheck Fairness Act which provides more effective remedies to women who face blatant wage discrimination, and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which requires employers to maintain pregnant workers' salaries and benefits so that women don’t have to choose between their workplace security and having a child. Thompson also helped pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act which ensures women can fight for equal pay in court. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

03.02.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced that the U.S. Department of Defense has today issued a rule to implement Thompson’s legislative provision requiring every American flag purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent of grown, produced or manufactured in the United States. Thompson’s provision passed last Congress as part of H.R. 3547, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 omnibus appropriations bill, and was signed into law by the president in January, 2014. “This Pentagon rule implements my legislation to make sure every American flag DOD buys is made in America, by American workers with American products,” said Thompson. “As a veteran myself, I am proud that because of this legislation, our brave men and women in uniform will never again have to serve under a non-American made U.S. flag. Thompson’s provision, which the DOD rule codifies, applied the Berry Amendment to the American Flag. The Berry Amendment, originally passed in 1941, prohibits DOD funds from being used to acquire food, clothing, military uniforms, fabrics, stainless steel, and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the United States, except in rare exceptions. Thompson’s provision applied the same rules for the DOD’s acquisition of American Flags, which previously were not listed as a covered item. Precedent already exists for such a provision. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase U.S.-made American Flags for serivcemembers’ funerals. Thompson’s provision passed as part of H.R. 3547, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 omnibus appropriations bill. The DOD has now codified Thompson’s provision in its new rule issued today. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
02.24.2015	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of National Invasive Species Week, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Dr. Dan Benishek (MI-01) today announced the formation of the Congressional Invasive Species Caucus for the 114th Congress. This bipartisan caucus works to raise awareness of the impact of invasive species around the country, supports local communities who are bearing the brunt of this problem, and promotes efforts to prevent and control the spread of invasive species. The caucus provides members of Congress with educational opportunities about the economic and environmental damage of invasive species, while developing policy solutions to the environmental challenges that result from their spread. Additionally, the Caucus will provide opportunities for Members of Congress to meet with other policy makers, organizations and industry leaders that are working to prevent the spread of invasive species. This caucus was first founded by Thompson and Benishek in the 113th Congress. “Invasive species pose a costly challenge to infrastructure, agriculture and the environment,” said Thompson. “In our district, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk for quagga invasion. Our caucus will bring together experts and industry leaders, so we can come up with plans to protect our communities from invasive species before they become a major problem.” “I’ve fished the lakes of Northern Michigan my whole life, and I’ve seen the damage done by invasive species, especially invasive phragmites and zebra mussels. Now we are working to try and prevent the spread of Asian Carp. The importance of protecting both the Great Lakes and inland lakes from these species cannot be overstated. These invasive species do real damage to both the environment and the economy. I’m working with my colleagues in the Caucus to come up with an aggressive strategy to combat these environmental challenges,” said Benishek. Invasive species threaten communities by devastating native habitat, damaging crops, clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, or outcompeting native species. These impacts can lower crop yields, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. Last Congress, Thompson had legislation signed into law requiring the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the impacts of aquatic invasive species on federal assets and current federal spending on aquatic invasive species prevention. Aquatic invasive species pose a costly challenge to water infrastructure, fisheries, and the environment in local communities across the United States. However, this problem often only receives attention after an invasive species has become established in a new area and has begun clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, and outcompeting native species. These impacts can damage fisheries, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. For example, aquatic mussels such as quagga and zebra mussels have cost U.S. communities more than $5 billion since their introduction in the 1980's. In the 5th Congressional District, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk level for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes have been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and negatively impact the water supply for residents of Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. The Congressional Invasive Species Caucus will work to develop plans to combat the spread of invasive species like the quaggas. The Caucus plans to begin holding meetings and developing their legislative agenda in the coming months. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
02.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) today led a bipartisan coalition of legislators in calling on President Obama to protect local clean energy royalties from harmful budget cuts. In a letter to the president, Thompson and the lawmakers expressed their disappointment that geothermal royalty payments to counties were eliminated in the President’s recently released Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 budget. Because of the high burdens that geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, counties currently share in the revenue of the federal receipts. “If a county invests in developing geothermal energy, it deserves its fair share of returns on that investment,” said Thompson. “Robbing counties of this revenue is fiscally irresponsible and will do nothing to reduce our deficit. While the federal government will see no significant gain, our counties will be forced to go into deeper debt in order to pay for road repairs, law enforcement, and public safety. I will work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure any budget passed by Congress doesn’t include these short-sighted geothermal cuts.” Geothermal revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, the counties should share in the revenue. Counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners in the continued development of geothermal energy – a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. Ending this sharing would negatively impact counties while having no meaningful deficit reduction impact. Over a ten year period, revenue sharing accounts for less than one tenth of one percent of the federal debt. In Fiscal Year 2014, Lake County received more than $959,000 in geothermal royalties In Fiscal Year 2014, Sonoma County received more than $1,315,000 in geothermal royalties. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
02.13.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced $4.8 million in Emergency Relief (ER) funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to help the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and local agencies cover repair costs for infrastructure damaged by the August 24th, 2014 earthquake. “Our community is still recovering from the earthquake that struck nearly six months ago,” said Thompson. “Our infrastructure is still in need of repair and these funds will go a long way towards helping our recovery efforts. Going forward, I will continue working with all federal agencies to make sure our district gets the resources we need to address the damage that the earthquake caused.” ER becomes available after the President or the Governor issues a formal emergency declaration and the State files a request for ER for the cost of damages to its eligible highways. Eligible repair work includes emergency repairs needed to restore essential traffic, minimize the extent of damage, or protect the remaining facilities as well as permanent repairs necessary to restore the highway to its pre-disaster condition. In October, 2014, the Obama Administration approved Individual Assistance (IA) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for areas in Napa and Solano Counties impacted by the earthquake. The Obama Administration also approved U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for homeowners, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. In September, 2014, the Obama Administration approved FEMA disaster funds for Public Assistance (PA). This is funding for local communities to use to repair public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure, power generation facilities, sewage collection facilities, and drainage channels. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and local governments split the remaining 25 percent. Hazard Mitigation funding was also approved in September, 2014. This is funding for local communities to repair facilities in a way that will help make sure they are better able to withstand future earthquakes. The approved funding is in response to the August 24th, magnitude-6.0 earthquake that struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. Estimates show that the earthquake caused $362 million in damage and damaged more than 1,500 homes. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
02.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today voted against his own legislation, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act of 2015, after House Republicans rejected Thompson’s amendment to pay for the bill. Thompson offered an amendment that would not have raised taxes on any individuals, and was previously proposed by former Republican Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp. Thompson’s amendment would have simply given the IRS more time to investigate if someone overstated an asset’s value which could lead to a larger deduction than they are entitled. Passing the legislation without paying for it adds $1.2 billion to the deficit. “This is a conservation policy that I’ve championed since coming to Congress, but House Republicans are acting so fiscally reckless that I cannot even support my own legislation,” said Thompson. “This conservation tool has preserved millions of acres across our country and we should make it permanent – but we can’t do it by forcing our kids and grandkids to foot the bill. Congress should pay for the bills we pass.” Thompson’s conservation easement legislation was passed as part of a larger tax bill, H.R. 644, none of which was paid for and would add a total of $93 billion to the deficit. The bipartisan Conservation Easement Incentive Act of 2015 provides a permanent enhanced tax incentive to family farmers, ranchers, and other landowners who choose not to develop their land and instead preserve their property for conservation. By providing tax benefits to landowners who choose conservation, the bill helps preserve our nation’s farm lands and open spaces for posterity. Under the Conservation Incentive Easement Act of 2015, landowners who donate their property’s development rights would maintain ownership and management of the land, but forgo their rights to develop the land in the future. The legislation would make permanent an enhanced tax incentive for donating development rights that expired at the end of 2014. In the past, the enhanced tax incentive has been extended on a short-term basis. Consequently, this has created uncertainty among landowners and has discouraged donations because it takes an average of three years to set up a conservation easement. With a short-term extension, landowners who want to donate their development rights for conservation may not know if the enhanced tax benefits will be available to them by the time their conservation easement is established. Making the enhanced incentive permanent will give more farmers, ranchers, and other landowners the assurances they need to choose land conservation over development. In addition, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act would also help moderate-income landowners choose conservation by: Raising the maximum deduction a donor can take for donating a conservation easement from 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year to 50 percent; Allowing qualified farmers and ranchers to deduct up to 100 percent of their AGI; and Increasing the number of years over which a donor can take this deduction from 5 to 15 years. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
02.11.2015	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today joined United States Trade Ambassador Michael Froman and a bipartisan coalition of House members to announce that the United States has launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to crack down on a questionable Chinese export subsidy program. Specifically, the U.S. is pursing dispute settlement consultations with the Government of China concerning their “Demonstration Bases-Common Service Platform” program that seems to provide prohibited export subsidies such as cash grants and free services to manufacturers and producers located throughout China. This unfair Chinese program is harmful to American workers and American businesses of all sizes. “China’s actions are damaging our international marketplace, undercutting American businesses, and hurting workers in communities across our country,” said U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5). “This case is about making sure the playing field is level and that China operates under the same fair and basic set of rules that American businesses and workers must abide by.” “President Obama has made vigorous enforcement a touchstone of his trade agenda,” said Ambassador Froman. “Under the President’s leadership, USTR will continue working tirelessly to ensure that China and all WTO Members play by the rules so we can grow solid, middle-class jobs here in America. American workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses rank among the most productive and innovative in the world, and where there is a level playing field they can compete and win. This Administration is dedicated to ensuring that they get all the economic opportunities we’ve negotiated under our trade agreements.” Through the questionable export subsidy program, China provides free and discounted services as well as cash grants and other incentives to enterprises that meet certain export performance criteria. The program subsidizes enterprises from one of seven specific economic sectors: (1) textiles, apparel and footwear; (2) advanced materials and metals (including specialty steel, titanium and aluminum products); (3) light industry; (4) specialty chemicals; (5) medical products; (6) hardware and building materials; and (7) agriculture. Today’s action represents a vigorous effort hold China to their WTO obligations. Export subsidies provide an unfair advantage to a vast array of Chinese exporters and are expressly prohibited under WTO rules. Consultations are the first step in the WTO dispute settlement process. If the United States and China are not able to reach a mutually agreed solution through consultations, the United States may request the establishment of a WTO dispute settlement panel. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.05.2015	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) today introduced legislation in the House (H.R. 761) and Senate (S. 393) to designate the 360,100 acre Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Monument. Under this designation, the region would be permanently protected, ensuring continued recreational opportunities and providing an regional economic boost, while also safeguarding the region's beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters – which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Under a national monument designation all currently owned federal lands within the boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed more efficiently and according to the site-specific needs. “Protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region will help boost tourism, grow the local economy, improve recreation opportunities and protect important species,” said Thompson. “By designating the region as a national monument, we can unite all federal lands under one management plan and preserve this national treasure for generations to come.” “The Berryessa Snow Mountain region is one of California’s greatest natural treasures,” Boxer said. “This bill will expand opportunities for outdoor recreation and help preserve this region’s magnificent vistas and diverse wildlife for current and future generations.” “Creating the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument will preserve the environment and support local communities,” said Feinstein. “By providing permanent protections and coordinated federal management, this legislation will help ensure one of California’s most beautiful and biologically diverse regions continues to thrive.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches nearly one hundred miles from Northwest Solano County to the flanks of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The area provides habitat to so many kinds of plants and animals that it has been named a biodiversity hotspot. Establishment of a National Monument will improve coordination between federal agencies and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. Thompson, Boxer and Feinstein are also working with the Obama Administration to designate the region as a national monument though Executive Action if Congress refuses to act on the legislation. “The national monument will protect the region’s natural splendor, while providing continued recreational opportunities and boosting visitation,” said Assemblymember Bill Dodd. “This is a great example of how we can protect our environment and support our local economies.” “I applaud Congressman Thompson and Senator Boxer for their work on this important legislation, said Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon. “A Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument will preserve environmental treasures, protect water sources, and provide an economic boon for all of the surrounding communities.” Studies have shown that a national monument designation would be beneficial to the surrounding economies. A study by the Winters Chamber of Congress found protected public lands are major contributors to our country’s $646 billion outdoor recreation economy. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. The study also found that local economies surrounding national monuments expanded following the creation of a new national monument. Employment, personal income, and per capita income either continued or improved in each of the regions surrounding the national monuments studied. “The Berryessa Snow Mountain region is a truly spectacular area. The landscape is not only picturesque; filled with iconic California plants, wildlife, and outdoor adventure, it’s also bursting with economic opportunity,” said Sara Husby, Executive Director of Tuleyome. “Over two hundred local businesses support a National Monument designation for the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. Many of these businesses are mom and pop stores, and these folks recognize that a National Monument designation will draw more visitors to the area. It’s also exciting to hear their stories about going out and enjoying the area, as many locals consider these lands to be their ‘wild backyard.’ The local communities surrounding these lands have really embraced our efforts, and they are excited to see such a great amount of support to ensure that these lands will be protected forever.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain region also includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. Many nationally recognized recreation and sportsmen groups support a national monument designation. “Congressman Thompson has brought all stakeholders to the table, forged partnerships and listened to everyone’s input. He then took those ideas back to Washington, D.C. and made sure they were included in this legislation,” said Don Amador, the western representative for the national off-road organization Blue Ribbon Coalition. “I am proud to support this bill because it will forever safeguard the trails and recreational opportunities that so many people, including myself, enjoy.” The National Monument designation only applies to land managed by the federal government. Lake Berryessa is not included in the National Monument designation and current access to and uses of private land will not be impacted the legislation. In addition, the bill protects private property rights by stating that nothing in the legislation requires a private property owner to allow public access to their property, and the bill includes legislative language ensuring that the National Monument designation will not impact motorized recreation on Lake Berryessa. The legislation ensures that all existing grazing will continue unchanged. The bill does not prohibit other grazing in additional areas as long as it is accordance with all laws and regulations. And, the bill allows for the expanded use of grazing as a management tool. “We own and operate a 3,000 acre cattle ranch adjacent to lands that are proposed to be included in this national monument. Recently, we gifted our ranch to three daughters. We are strongly supportive of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument” said John and Judy Ahmann, ranchers and adjacent private landowners. “Congressman Thompson has worked closely with local stakeholders to personally hear their thoughts and input, and to incorporate many of their ideas and suggestions into this legislation. Because of this, we want the bill to pass so that this area and its way of life will be preserved." No legally-open roads or motorized vehicle trails will be closed as a result of the National Monument designation. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the National Monument and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The National Monument designation would not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of a National Monument. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. Napa, Lake, Yolo, Solano and Mendocino Counties have all voted in support of permanent protection for the region. Additionally, the Calistoga Chamber of Commerce, Napa County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, and the cities of Calistoga, Clearlake, Davis, St. Helena, West Sacramento, and Winters support permanently protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. Also in support of the permanently protecting the region are: More than 65 elected officials including former Congressman Pete McCloskey, co-author of the Endangered Species Act. More than 200 businesses representing all five involved counties Nearly 30 landowners and farmers. More than 35 Recreation and conservation groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Ducks Unlimited, the Backcountry Horsemen of California, and the National Hispanic Environmental Council The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources and the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #

02.02.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – A bipartisan coalition today introduced the Conservation Easement Incentive Act of 2015 in the House (H.R. 641) and Senate (S. 330). The legislation, authored by Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Mike Kelly (R-PA), and Senators Dean Heller (R-NV) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) provides a permanent enhanced tax incentive to family farmers, ranchers, and other landowners who choose not to develop their land and instead preserve their property for conservation. By providing tax benefits to landowners who choose conservation, the bill helps preserve our nation’s farm lands and open spaces for posterity. “Conservation easements have encouraged landowners across our county to conserve millions of acres of farm lands and scenic open spaces – so we know they work, but there’s also more we can do” said Thompson. “By passing this bill and making this conservation tool permanent, landowners will have the certainty they need to preserve and protect even more property and natural resources for future generations.” “This bipartisan bill provides private land owners an important tool to conserve our state’s precious natural resources, increase outdoor recreation opportunities, and preserve our proud tradition of ranching,” said Heller. “In a state like Nevada, where over 85 percent of our lands are federally controlled, it is important to preserve our western way of life while keeping land in private hands and on local tax rolls.” “Our farmers and ranchers are the best stewards of the land,” said Stabenow. “If this deduction becomes permanent, more landowners will take part in preserving our land, water and wildlife habitats. It’s a win for taxpayers, a win for farmers, and it’s a win for our environment.” “This commonsense, bipartisan legislation is about supporting farmers who want to preserve our nation’s most cherished natural resources for future generations,” said Kelly. “Since 2006, conservation easement has secured hundreds of thousands of acres of America’s farmland and open space for hunting, fishing, hiking, and locally-source food production. Western Pennsylvania is fortunate to be home to many vibrant and impressive land trusts, including one of the largest in the nation. This legislation will help them conserve even more farm and natural lands by making this important conservation tool a permanent part of our tax code.” Under the Conservation Incentive Easement Act of 2015, landowners who donate their property’s development rights would maintain ownership and management of the land, but forgo their rights to develop the land in the future. The legislation would make permanent an enhanced tax incentive for donating development rights that expired at the end of 2014. In the past, the enhanced tax incentive has been extended on a short-term basis. Consequently, this has created uncertainty among landowners and has discouraged donations because it takes an average of three years to set up a conservation easement. With a short-term extension, landowners who want to donate their development rights for conservation may not know if the enhanced tax benefits will be available to them by the time their conservation easement is established. Making the enhanced incentive permanent will give more farmers, ranchers, forest, and other landowners the assurances they need to choose land conservation over development. In addition, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act would also help moderate-income landowners choose conservation by: Raising the maximum deduction a donor can take for donating a conservation easement from 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year to 50 percent; Allowing qualified farmers and ranchers to deduct up to 100 percent of their AGI; and Increasing the number of years over which a donor can take this deduction from 5 to 15 years. The Conservation Easement Incentive Act has been endorsed by the Land Trust Alliance, Ducks Unlimited, the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the Nature Conservancy, the National Sports Shooting Foundation, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Mule Deer Foundation, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the American Forest Foundation, the National Audubon Society, the Wildlife Society, the California Association of Wine Growers, and National Wild Turkey Federation. H.R. 641 has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, on which Congressmen Thompson and Kelly both serve. S. 330 has been referred to Senate Finance Committee on which Stabenow and Heller serve. # # #
01.28.2015	Washington, D.C – In an effort to combat chronic hunger across the nation, a bipartisan coalition in the House of Representatives has introduced H.R. 461, the Wild Game Donation Act of 2015, to provide hunters with charitable deductions for the costs associated with donating processed deer, moose, and other wild game meats to food-based charities. In addition, the legislation would allow game processors who participate in the program to pass savings on to local food-based charities through tax-deductions of their own. H.R. 461, introduced by Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA), Don Young (R-AK), Ann Kuster (D-NH), Mike Kelly (R-PA), has received widespread support by hunter advocates and wildlife conservation groups alike, including Feeding America, Safari Club International, the National Rifle Association, and the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation. The Wild Game Donation Act would assist food banks across the nation that struggle to keep up with the increasing demand for food by encouraging hunters to do their part and donate their wild game meat to help feed the hungry. According to the most recent U.S. Department of Agriculture numbers, 49 million people live in food insecure households. Last year alone, one in seven Americans (roughly 46 million) required assistance from food banks; a figure that includes at least twelve million children and seven million seniors. Following introduction, the four sponsors of the Wild Game Donation Act of 2015 shared these thoughts: “Hunger is a very real and persistent problem that impacts families, children and seniors in all corners of our country. This important, bipartisan legislation will help increase the amount of meat donated by hunters to charities, putting food on the plates of millions of Americans. As a longtime sportsman, I am proud to support this bill with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle.” - Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) "With the abundance of natural resources in my home state of Alaska, it’s truly disappointing to know people – especially children – still go hungry. From the pan-handle to the North Slope, more than 100,000 Alaskans don’t know where their next meal will come from. As a former teacher, I understand the impact hunger has on families and growing children. This legislation, which has received bipartisan support from organizations and groups across the country, is a small but critical step in the right direction to solve the greater issue of hunger. I look forward to passing this commonsense bill to provide an added incentive for hunters to donate their game and provide some of the tastiest protein in the world to our food-based charities.” – Representative Don Young (R-AK) “This common sense bill is a win-win: it provides a tax cut for hunters who donate to food charities, and it helps families in need access fresh, nutritious meat they couldn’t otherwise afford. In New Hampshire, many of our local hunters are already setting an example by taking part in a similar program, so I was proud to partner with Rep. Don Young to introduce this bill, in the hopes that it will encourage more hunters from across the country to consider donating game to help feed hungry families in their local communities.” – Representative Ann Kuster (D-NH) “This commonsense legislation is anti-hunger, pro-hunter, and pro-helping Americans. Right now there are more than 46 million Americans relying on food banks each year, including 1.8 million Pennsylvanians, along with an ever-increasing demand for food by food-based charities. In Western Pennsylvania and across America, countless hunters are ready to donate their game to those in need. After all, hunting for food is as old an American tradition as helping our fellow citizens. It just makes sense to encourage those who hunt to help those who hunger and to make it as safe and easy as possible.” – Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) H.R. 461 requires all animals be killed in accordance with state and local laws and by the individual making the charitable contribution. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
01.20.2015	Washington, D.C. – In their continued fight against genetically engineered (GE) fish, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), Don Young (R-AK), Walter B. Jones (R-NC), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), and Jared Huffman (D-CA) introduced two pieces of legislation intended to prevent GE fish from making its way onto the nation’s dinner plates and spreading into the nation’s oceans. The first bill, H.R. 394, the Prevention of Escapement of Genetically Altered Salmon in the United States (PEGASUS) Act, would effectively ban all GE fish in the United States by prohibiting the shipment, sale, transportation, purchase, procession, or release into the wild of GE salmon or other GE finfish unless the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service completes a full environmental impact statement and concludes that it will result in no such impact to the environment. The second bill, H.R. 393, would improve efforts to inform the American consumer by requiring the labeling of all GE fish sold for consumption. With the growing concerns for approval of GE fish for human consumption, H.R. 393 would force the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require the labeling of these controversial products. Following the introduction of H.R. 394 and H.R. 393, the bill’s bipartisan sponsors shared the following statements: Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA): “No genetically engineered salmon should be in our waters or on our dinner plates, unless a full environmental study, using the best available science is conducted to make sure these fish won’t harm natural salmon, our fisherman, and the health of American families,” said Thompson. “The FDA’s evaluation of these fish is inadequate. Until rigorous scientific studies are completed, these fish shouldn’t be in our waters or stores.” Congressman Don Young (R-AK): “The FDA is reviewing GE salmon as if it were a new animal drug, but this type of review process is obviously dead wrong for a product destined for our dinner plates. Furthermore, it fails to consider the possible threat GE fish pose to natural salmon fisheries in this nation, “said Congressman Don Young. “The PEGASUS Act’s message is unmistakable, it tells federal regulators to rethink their approach before a monumental mistake is made that cannot be undone. As lawmakers, we must do everything in our power to protect the public and one of the finest products in the world.” Congressman Walter B. Jones (R- NC): “I would like to thank Don Young for his leadership and continued focus on this important issue. American consumers have a right to know if they’re a eating a wild caught fish or somebody’s science project,” said Congressman Jones. Congressman Peter DaFazio (D-OR): “Healthy, wild salmon runs are critically important to the environment, to our fishermen and to consumers across the globe,” DeFazio said. “That’s why it would be incredibly short-sighted and dangerous for the FDA to allow some biotechnology company to tamper with the natural order by creating genetically engineered salmon. It would only be a matter of time before these Frankenfish mix in with the wild salmon population, destroy the species and wreak havoc on our fishing industry.” Congressman Jared Huffman (D-CA): “We need to keep genetically engineered salmon out of our oceans, rivers and streams—and off of our dinner plates. GE salmon pose a danger to our wild salmon population, the ecosystems they live in and our commercial fisheries, and the PEGASUS Act is an important step towards protection of our families and coastal communities.” Background: Since 1996, AquaBounty Technologies has been developing GE salmon with the hopes of receiving FDA approval to sell it for human consumption. The specific process splices genetic material from the Chinook (King) salmon with that of a pout fish and Atlantic salmon. The resulting organism, the company claims, would grow to the size of an Alaskan King salmon in a shorter period of time than found in nature. In 2012, the FDA published a draft Environmental Assessment for GE salmon holding that the product is unlikely to cause significant effects on the environment and is safe to eat. However, although the public comment period ended on this controversial assessment two years ago, the FDA has not announced their final decision. For bill text of H.R. 394, please click here.

01.09.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Mike Thompson, chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force (CA-5) today announced 11 vice chairs to serve on the task force in the 114th Congress. The vice chairs and Thompson will make up the task force’s leadership team. “I am proud to announce our leadership team for the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,” said Thompson. “Our vice chairs have a wide range of expertise, come from different backgrounds, and will bring unique ideas to the table as we work to reduce and prevent gun violence while also protecting the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens. In 113th Congress our task force was successful in increasing funding for background check system to record levels. Now we need to take the next, and most important, step towards reducing gun violence by expanding background system so it can’t be bypassed with the click of a mouse or by driving to a gun show.” After the December 14, 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Thompson was named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam. In February 2013, the task force announced a comprehensive set of policy principles designed to reduce gun violence while respecting the 2nd Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. The 11 Vice Chairs for the 114th Congress are: Rep. Elizabeth Esty (CT-5), who represents the community of Newtown – “I’m honored to continue to serve as Vice Chair of the U.S. House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. The scourge of gun violence is devastating our communities. Congress has shamefully failed to act on commonsense reforms, like expanded background checks and stricter punishments for illegal gun trafficking and straw purchasing. These reforms protect the 2nd amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners, enjoy overwhelming support from the American people, and will save lives. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress—particularly new members—to keep our children and our communities safe from gun violence.” Rep. Chaka Fattah (PA-2) – “It is a privilege to continue serving as one of the Vice-Chairs of this task force, charged with reducing gun violence and making our communities safer places to live and work. I am proud to have contributed to our progress last Congress, leading the effort that secured $73 million to assist states in improving background check records maintenance. There is no community in this country immune from the tragedies of gun violence, and as we sustain our efforts, I hope we can find consensus and enact smart legislation to strengthen our country’s gun laws.” Robin Kelly (IL-2), author of the 2014 Kelly Report on Gun Violence in America – “I’d like to thank Chairman Thompson for the opportunity to serve. I’m excited to work with him and the task force to strengthen the coalition against gun violence and to pursue common sense solutions to gun violence that balance our Second Amendment rights with the right of all Americans to live free from the threat of gun violence.” Rep. Grace Napolitano (CA-32) – “Suicide is the leading cause of gun deaths in the U.S. today, yet mental health services are rarely discussed as a means to prevent gun violence. Unfortunately the mischaracterization of individuals suffering from mental illness halts the progress we have made toward our goal: eliminating stigma to ensure those suffering know it is always okay to seek help. By detecting and treating mental illness early on we can help reduce self-harm or harm to others, preventing tragedies from occurring. I look forward to continue addressing the mental health component of gun violence prevention and working with my colleagues on this critical public health concern.” Rep. Rick Nolan (MN-8) – “I know that responsible gun-ownership is an integral part of our heritage in my home state of Minnesota – I am a lifelong sportsman and gun owner, and have hunted in northern and central Minnesota my entire life. The majority of my fellow sportsmen understand there is a need for a comprehensive approach to reduce and prevent gun violence while continuing to protect our Second Amendment rights. In that spirit, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force to implement policies that protect our children and communities confronting the reality of daily gun violence and threat of senseless mass shootings.” Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO-7) – "Colorado is home to some of the worst tragic mass shootings in our nation. Part of my work on this important task force is to avoid other families having to struggle with the violence and pain caused by mental health disorders and gun violence." Rep. David Price (NC-4) – “The time has come for Congress to pass common-sense legislation to reduce gun violence and prevent future tragedies like Sandy Hook. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force to develop and propose sensible reforms that would make our schools and communities safer while allowing law-abiding gun owners to use their weapons for recreation or self-defense.” Rep. Kathleen Rice (NY-4) – “I’m proud to join this task force. As a career prosecutor, I come to this issue from a law enforcement perspective. I’m not out to restrict any law-abiding citizen’s right to own a gun – I want to keep guns away from people who aren’t legally allowed to have them by closing the loopholes that allow violent criminals, domestic abusers and people with dangerous mental illnesses to avoid background checks. I’m eager to work with my fellow task force members to get it done.” Rep. Bobby Scott (VA-3), serving his 12th term representing Virginia's 3rd Congressional District and is the Ranking Member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce. He has sponsored the Youth PROMISE Act, which would provide resources to state and local governments for comprehensive, evidenced-based strategies and programs to prevent juvenile crime – "I am honored to serve another term as a vice chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Since the tragedy at Newtown, Connecticut, this task force has been working tirelessly to find legislative solutions to reduce gun violence and sadly our work is still very much needed. Obviously one single approach to ending gun violence will not be effective. But what can be most effective is a comprehensive, evidence-based approach that includes gun safety, mental health, juvenile justice, and crime prevention initiatives. I look forward to working with Chairman Thompson, our returning vice chairs and our newly appointed vice chairs to advance these issues in the 114th Congress." Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-12), Legislative Counsel to Congressman Leo Ryan in 1978 when she accompanied him to investigate the People's Temple cult in Jonestown, Guyana. Congressman Ryan was assassinated, and Speier was shot five times at close range. She still carries two of the bullets in her body - “We need to face the truth: America has a gun problem. With each new headline, we are reminded of the deadly cost of inaction. Congress cannot continue its silence while gun violence in this country continues. On average each day 32 Americans are murdered with a gun, 51 people kill themselves with a gun, and 45 people are accidentally shot with a gun. I look forward to working with The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force to enact commonsense reforms, including universal background checks, ending the gun show loophole, and looking at ammunition currently available.” Rep. Bennie Thompson (MS-2), an avid hunter, was selected to chair the bipartisan Congressional Sportsman’s Caucus during the 113th Congress. Congressman Thompson has served as the lead Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security since 2007. Prior to his election to Congress, Congressman Thompson served as alderman and mayor of Bolton, Mississippi and as a supervisor in Hinds, County Mississippi – “I am pleased to serve as Vice Chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task force during in the 114th. I look forward to working with my colleagues on reducing the number of Americans affected by gun violence while protecting law abiding citizens 2nd Amendment Rights.” Incoming Vice-Chairs Kelly, Nolan and Rice are replacing outgoing Vice-Chairs John D. Dingell, Carolyn McCarthy and Ron Barber. ###

12.23.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court’s 2011 ruling that said irrigation restrictions in California’s Central Valley lacked sufficient scientific justification. In overturning the lower court’s ruling, the circuit court upheld irrigation restrictions in the Central Valley that were created in 2009 after the National Marine Fisheries Service released a “biological opinion” which found that Central Valley irrigation projects endangered steelhead and chinook salmon. “The 9th Circuit’s ruling in this case affirms that while Delta water is important for farmers in the Central Valley, it’s also important for fish, wildlife and those who depend on the Delta for their drinking water and livelihoods. The Delta supports thousands of jobs in farming, fishing and tourism, and has an economic output of more than $4 billion a year. Neither the court, nor anyone else, should be in the business of picking winners and losers when it comes to our limited water supply. Instead, all decisions should be guided by the best available science – and the 9th Circuit let the best available science guide its decision making. I commend the ruling and look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress, state leaders, and all stakeholders to find fair, science-based solutions to our water challenges.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
12.22.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Kevin Brady’s (R-TX) bipartisan Small Business Efficiency Act (H.R. 3581) was signed into law on Friday by President Barack Obama. The legislation helps reduce burdens faced by small businesses and ensures better compliance with complex federal employment tax responsibilities. Specifically, the Small Business Efficiency Act provides clear rules for Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) that are voluntarily certified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect and pay federal employment taxes for their small business clients. The legislation will provide certainty for small businesses that use certified PEO services and allow employers to focus on their business operations, not government paperwork. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and they shouldn’t be held back because of Washington regulations and piles of government paperwork,” said Thompson. “This law will remove bureaucratic burdens so that small businesses can focus on what they do best – growing their business, producing quality products and creating good-paying jobs.” PEOs provide human resources services to small business clients. One of the most important tasks that PEOs perform for small businesses is the collection and payment of employment taxes, reducing the amount of burdensome paperwork for small businesses. Before the bill was enacted, there was ambiguity about a certified PEO’s (CPEO) ability to assume employment tax responsibility. The Small Business Efficiency Act eliminates this ambiguity by implementing safeguards for the CPEO’s small business clients. To become a certified PEO (CPEO) Thompson and Brady’s legislation requires a PEO to meet certain basic financial conditions, satisfy reporting obligations, and maintain ongoing certification with the IRS. After meeting certification requirements, the CPEO would assume full and sole responsibility and liability for employment taxes due as long as they are certified. The Small Business Efficiency Act creates a voluntary IRS certification process to help PEOs become certified so they can take on small business clients and accept liability for filing payroll taxes for their clients’ employees. Not only will small businesses benefit from the legislation, the federal government directly benefits as well. The IRS has stated that CPEOs would improve compliance with employment tax requirements, reduce the number of returns the IRS has to process, and reduce errors in calculating and paying employment taxes. Presidents Bush and Obama have included very similar proposals in their budget submissions. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
12.19.2014	NAPA, CA – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), joined by Congressman John Garamendi (CA-3), today hosted Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment Robert Bonnie on a visit to the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region. After a hiking tour of the region, Thompson held a public meeting to hear from constituents about Thompson’s conservation proposals for the Berryessa Snow Mountain region and what it means to the local communities. At the public meeting, a panel consisting of ranching, recreation, conservation, academic and elected leaders spoke in support of protecting the region. “Protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region will help boost tourism, grow the local economy, improve recreation opportunities and protect important species found nowhere else on earth,” said Thompson. “That is why I’ve proposed legislation that would permanently safeguard this important region. However, Congress has refused to consider this bill. If Congress won’t act, then I look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Jewell, Undersecretary Bonnie and the Obama Administration on plans to permanently protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a national monument.” As part of their visit, Thompson took Jewell, USDA officials and other state and local community members to portions of the proposed national conservation area within BLM’s Cache Creek Wilderness. The 27,245-acre wilderness contains spectacular scenery, including steep canyons, scenic rivers, rolling oak woodlands and elaborate springtime wildflower displays. "This is a beautiful area with cultural history and great opportunities for outdoor recreation and wildlife viewing so it's no surprise that the community wants to make sure that it is protected and passed on to the next generation," said Jewell. "Today's opportunity to get out and see the public lands and to hear directly from the local and tribal communities about their vision for conservation and land management is important. I want to underscore our support of Congressman Thompson's efforts to recognize this region as a National Conservation Area, which could also lead to additional economic benefits to the region." “We are supportive of Congressman Thompson’s effort to solicit public comment on his proposal,” said Bonnie. “The Forest Service also met with tribal leaders to discuss the proposal earlier this month. There appears to be significant public support for this proposal and we look forward to working with all interested parties as this process continues.” “The Berryessa Snow Mountain Region is a natural treasure at the heart of the 3rd District. This region’s rugged beauty helps sustain outdoor recreation businesses, serves as a valuable source of water, and provides critical habitats for our wildlife,” Garamendi said. “It was vitally important to hear from our friends and neighbors in the community on how we can best preserve Berryessa Snow Mountain now and into the future. I look forward to translating these ideas into sound public policy.” Jewell, Bonnie and U.S. Forest Service Chief (USFS) Tom Tidewell visited California at the invitation of Thompson who, since 2012, has introduced legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives that would designate the 350,000 acre Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under an NCA designation, the region would be permanently protected, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's wildlife, rare plants, and waters – which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. U.S. Senator Boxer (D-CA) has introduced a companion bill in the Senate. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches nearly one hundred miles from the shores of Lake Berryessa to the peak of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The area provides habitat to so many kinds of plants and animals that it has been named a biodiversity hotspot. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region also includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. Safeguarding the Berryessa Snow Mountain region would also provide the surrounding communities with economic benefits. Recent studies have shown that local economies surrounding national monuments expanded following the creation of a new national monument. Employment, personal income, and per capita income either continued or improved in each of the regions surrounding the national monuments studied. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. More than 100 businesses in areas surrounding the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region support a national monument designation, as do many nationally recognized recreation and sportsmen groups such as the International Mountain Bicycling Association, Back Country Horsemen, the Equine Land Conservation Resource and the Blue Ribbon Coalition. Additionally, all five counties within the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region have endorsed permanent protection for the area.

12.16.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) has introduced H.R. 5860, the bipartisan Small Business Healthcare Relief Act with Congressman Charles W. Boustany, Jr., M.D., (R-South Louisiana). This legislation fixes an existing Treasury Department guidance under the Affordable Care Act that limits the use of health reimbursement arrangements (HRA’s) for small businesses, limiting choice and affordability for healthcare consumers. “Since the landmark health care reform legislation was passed, we’ve focused too much time trying to undermine the law, and far too little time working to build on its important reforms so that all Americans can afford health insurance,” said Thompson. “This bipartisan legislation moves past party politics, fixes an important part of the health care law, and improves choice and affordability. By building on the reforms made in the Affordable Care Act, like this legislation does, we can make sure every American can afford to go to the doctor – and that’s what matters.” On September 13, 2013, Treasury issued guidance disallowing businesses from using HRA’s as a tax-free means to reimburse employees, stating these arrangements were disqualified under Affordable Care Act’s annual dollar cap. The Small Business Healthcare Relief Act restores flexibility and choice into the marketplace by: Ensuring that small businesses are allowed to use pre-tax dollars to give employees a defined contribution. Allowing employees to use these funds as an HRA to purchase health coverage on the individual market, as well as for qualified out-of-pocket medical expenses. Protecting small business employers from being unnecessarily financially penalized for providing this option to employees. The legislation is supported by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), the National Association of Homebuilders (NAHB), the National Association for the Self-Employed, and the Coalition for Affordable Healthcare (CAHC). Support letters from these organizations are attached. The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, on which Thompson and Boustany serve. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

12.11.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 83) that includes numerous provisions that would put our economy at risk, hurt the middle class, provide funding for Syrian rebels to fight ISIL, and undermine the president’s attempts to address problems with our broken immigration system. “Once again, House Republicans are threatening to shutdown the government by including provisions in a last-minute funding bill that’s needed to keep the government open past midnight. Buried deep in this bill is a provision that would put American taxpayers back on the hook for bailing out Wall Street when their riskiest bets go wrong. These kinds of risky bets brought our financial system to the brink of collapse in 2008, and cost our nation millions of jobs. While this provision is a windfall for Wall Street and will allow them to once again gamble with taxpayer’s money, it’s a blow to the middle class. “If that wasn’t enough, the funding bill would dramatically increase the amount of money wealthy donors can funnel into our elections, preventing the voices of American middle class families and small businesses from being heard. “This funding bill also provides $500 million to train and arm Syrian rebel groups to fight ISIL. While ISIL is a dangerous terrorist organization that must be stopped, we do not have enough information on the people we are arming and training, nor can we ensure that these weapons will not fall into the hands of ISIL, or be used against innocent civilians. “Finally, the legislation attempts to undercut the President’s executive actions to address problems with our broken immigration system by only providing short-term funding to the government agency tasked with carrying out these fixes. “We need a clean, straight-forward spending bill that doesn’t hurt our middle class, undermine our democratic process, arm foreign rebels we know little about, or undercut efforts to fix our immigration system.” H.R. 83 repeals a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation that required banks to separate and independently fund their derivative trades, which were one of the central causes of the financial crisis in 2008. Repealing this provision of Dodd-Frank will allow banks, backed by taxpayer-insured funds, to trade derivatives and get bailed out if the trades lead to another near financial collapse. A second provision in H.R. 83 would increase the sums a single contributor could give to a party committee by nearly tenfold per year. Under the current limits, a donor can give $129,600 to the Democratic or Republican National Committee and another $64,800 to the parties' House and Senate committees in each two-year election cycle. The new rules proposed in the omnibus bill would increase those limits to $648,000 for the parties’ national committees and $453,600 for their House and Senate committees. Additionally, the omnibus bill provides $500 million to extend a Pentagon program to arm and train up to 5,000 Syrian rebels to fight ISIL. In September, Thompson voted against arming these rebels. H.R. 83 funds all government agencies though the end of September, except for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS, the agency responsible for carrying out the President’s recently announced executive orders on immigration, is only funded until February 27th. Such short-term funding could undermine the Obama Administration’s ability to carry out the President’s executive orders. H.R. 83 passed the House by a vote of 219-206 and now goes to the Senate for a vote.

12.10.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Legislation authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) to enhance rail and refinery security passed the U.S. House of Representatives as part of H.R. 4681, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. Thompson’s legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A) to conduct an intelligence assessment of the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail infrastructure. After the assessment is conducted, DHS I&A must submit the results of its assessment to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, along with any recommendations to improve the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail infrastructure. The recommendations will help officials better protect the communities surrounding refineries and railways from potential harm. “Public safety is my number one priority and through enhanced reporting we can better know if threats exist and how we can fix them,” said Thompson. “This law will help make sure we’re transporting and holding crude oil and other cargo through and in our communities in a safe manner.” The improved reporting required by Thompson’s legislation will help officials better assess the types of threats our nation's oil refineries and railways face so that such threats can be mitigated. This could include improvements to security at refineries, or upgrades to rail infrastructure that could decrease the likelihood of derailments. Many trains transporting crude oil from the Bakken Shale formation of North Dakota run through Thompson’s congressional district. The crude oil from this region is regarded as highly flammable and this legislation will help make sure it is transported safely. H.R. 4681 passed the House by a vote of 325-100. It now goes to the President to be signed into law. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.10.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Legislation authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) to improve the security at American embassies passed the U.S. House of Representatives today as part of H.R. 4681, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 and will now be signed into law. Since the Benghazi attack in 2012, studies have identified the need for security personnel at U.S. diplomatic posts to receive threat information from the Intelligence Community in a timelier manner so they can request and receive security enhancements as needed. Thompson’s legislation will address this need by enhancing information sharing. “Since the Benghazi attack in 2012, we’ve spent far too much time debating fabricated scandals, and far too little time discussing what needs to be done to help make sure Americans serving in our foreign embassies are safe,” said Thompson. “Studies since the Benghazi attack have shown that we need to improve communication between our Intelligence Community and our diplomatic outposts, and this will make sure that happens.” Ensuring security personnel at U.S. diplomatic posts receive threat information from the Intelligence Community in a timely manner requires excellent information sharing and communication between the Intelligence and Diplomatic Security communities. Thompson’s legislation directs the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide an assessment of the status of threat information sharing between the Intelligence Community and diplomatic security personnel, and to propose remedial action to help make sure security personnel at U.S. embassies can request and receive security enhancements in a timely manner. The classified report from the DNI will be submitted to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. H.R. 4681 passed the House by a vote of 325-100. It now goes to the President to be signed into law. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.09.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-05), George Miller (D-11), Doris Matsui (D-06), Jerry McNerney (D-09), and John Garamendi (D-03) today voted against H.R. 5781, so-called “California Emergency Drought Relief Act.” The legislation, introduced on December 2nd, was sent to the House Floor without any committee review or input from any state or federal water agencies, fishing interests, or tribes. H.R. 5781 would mandate the pumping of Delta water to South of the Delta. “This deeply flawed legislation is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to use the drought as an excuse to steal water from the Bay Delta – and to do so with zero regard for the folks who depend on that water for their livelihoods. It was rushed to the House Floor with no consideration given to the jobs it would destroy, the water supply to urban and rural areas it would jeopardize, environmental protections it would gut, the drinking water it would damage, or the fact that it would do nothing to alleviate the drought. “The entire state of California is in a drought. It's not due to a lack of pumping. It's due to a lack of snow and rain. If the Majority was interested in actually addressing the drought, there are things we could do to help. Congress can invest in more water conservation, more water recycling, and more water storage. With investments like these, we can collect millions of gallons of new water, ensure urban and rural areas have a reliable water supply, help farmers better plan, and create good jobs. This bill does none of that. Our people deserve better than this politically driven bill. They deserve science-based solutions.” The legislation passed the House by a vote of 229-182. The Obama Administration has issued a veto threat on the bill.
12.09.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released a statement today on the $73 million included in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 83) to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). In May, Thompson passed a bipartisan amendment to increase NICS funding to the FY 2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. The additional funds will be used to help states improve data submissions to NICS. The funding in the FY 2015 funding bill represents a $14.5 million increase in funding from FY 2014 levels. “Our national criminal background check system is only as good as the data you put in it, and these funds will help make sure all the information gets into the system,” said Thompson. “I applaud our appropriators for providing states with the money they need to get the most current and comprehensive data into the background check system. Having up-to-date information will help make sure criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can’t get their hands on guns. “Now we need to finish the job by expanding background checks to all commercial gun sales so these same prohibited purchasers can’t bypass the NICS system altogether by going to a gun show or buying a gun online.” Currently, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm, is missing information. Because of this, people who otherwise would not pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. · A USA Today report found that in just five states, records for at least 2.5 million fugitives weren’t entered into the NICS system. · According to a report by Everytown, 12 states have still submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the NICS system. · According to the Department of Justice, six states have fewer than 30 total records each in the NICS system in all prohibited categories combined. This increased funding included in the omnibus will provide states with additional resources to ensure the background check system has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not possess guns. In February 2013, Thompson’s task force specifically recommended taking immediate action to ensure the NICS database was up-to-date. A full copy of the task force’s report, including principle six, which deals with NICS, can be seen here. Additionally, Thompson and U.S. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) are co-authors of H.R. 1565, bipartisan legislation to expand the current background check system to all commercial gun sales. Joining them are original co-authors Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by A-rated NRA Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.04.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.R. 5759, the House Republican’s legislative attempt to block President Obama’s recently announced executive actions on immigration. “This House Majority has had more than 500 days to pass a bipartisan compressive immigration reform bill but has refused to vote. Now, instead of taking real governing action, they decided to waste more time passing a partisan bill that would undermine the president’s legal reforms and does nothing to fix our broken immigration system. It’s past time Republicans in the House put the needs of our country ahead of partisan politics and vote to pass comprehensive immigration reform.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.04.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation to designate the United States Postal facility located at 100 Admiral Callaghan Lane in Vallejo as the “Philmore Graham Post Office Building” passed the Senate last night and will now go to the President to be signed into law. The legislation, H.R. 5106, was cosponsored by every member of the California Congressional Delegation in the House. “Philmore Graham earned this recognition though his life’s work in which he strived to help others succeed,” said Thompson. “He served our nation in uniform, mentored youth in Vallejo, and was a leader in our community. It’s fitting that we honor his memory by forever naming our post office after Philmore Graham.” Graham was born in North Carolina and graduated from Tennessee State University. He served in the Air Force and worked at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He was the first, and to this day remains the only, African American to hold the position of supervisor at Mare Island’s Department of Nuclear Energy. In 1966, Graham founded the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club in Vallejo. What began as six young boys meeting in Graham’s garage has become a thriving organization that today enriches the lives of approximately 300 boys and girls each year. The club has worked with thousands of young people since its inception. Graham mentored scores of young people, offering them support and encouragement and instilling in them the values and principles they needed to succeed. He provided academic support, encouraged involvement in sports, and taught young people the importance of perseverance, hard-work, and self-respect. Graham was named the NAACP’s Outstanding Citizen of the Year. He was awarded the Good Neighbor Award, the Salute to America Lifetime Merit Award, the Profile of Excellence Award, the Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award, and the “Who’s Who” Among Black Americans Award. Additionally, he was named the Omega Man of the Year and Citizen of the Year multiple times.

12.03.2014	WASHINGTON­—Today, Northern California Representatives Mike Thompson (D-05), Jared Huffman (D-02), George Miller (D-11), Doris Matsui (D-06), Jerry McNerney (D-09), John Garamendi (D-03), and Ami Bera (D-07) released the following statement regarding the House Republican water bill introduced last night: “With just a few days left in the legislative session, the House plans to pass yet another divisive, dishonest, and potentially devastating California water bill without any public input or legislative oversight. This is unconscionable, and just the latest chapter in their reckless approach to micromanaging the state’s water during one of the worst droughts in our history. “The idea that this bill is a ‘compromise’ is laughable. It is clear that this bill was thrown together without any input from anyone other than those who stand to benefit from its passage. This bill was not reviewed by the Natural Resources Committee, nor has it received input from federal agencies, the state, affected local water agencies, the fishing industry, tribes, or communities. Legislation this sweeping should be the subject of public hearings and input from all affected stakeholders. “The bill makes it more difficult for state and federal agencies to make real-time water decisions, undermines state water rights priorities, misstates current law, and explicitly overrides the Endangered Species Act. These sweeping changes would place the west coast’s environment, tribes, communities, and the fishing industry in harm’s way in the next drought year. “The drought does not stop at the edge of congressional districts, yet this bill insulates some parts of the state from the tough water decisions that will be made in the next year. We’re all in this together, and Congress should not tie water managers’ hands nor should we address drought conditions in some parts of the state at the expense of others.” ###
12.02.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that all five counties within the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region have endorsed permanent protection for the area. Today, Mendocino unanimously voted to endorse permanent protection for the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region. Napa, Lake, Yolo and Solano Counties have all previously voted in support of permanent protection for the region. “There is overwhelming public support for protection of this national treasure,” said Thompson. “If Congress won’t pass my legislation to permanently protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region then President Obama should step up where Congress hasn’t and permanently protect the region as a national monument.” In May 2013, Thompson introduced H.R. 1025, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced S.483 the companion bill in the Senate. The legislation would designate the 350,000 acre Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under this designation the region would be permanently protected, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's natural beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters - which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Additionally, President Obama can use his executive authority to designate the region as a national monument. Such action would achieve the goals of Thompson’s legislation. Napa, Lake, Yolo, Solano and Mendocino Counties all support a national monument. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches more than 100 miles from the lowlands of Putah Creek below Lake Berryessa, across remote stretches of Cache Creek, and up to the peak of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region also includes numerous trails, open spaces, lakes and rivers. These resources provide recreation opportunities for hikers, bikers, hunters, campers, off-highway vehicle users, and both motorized and non-motorized boaters. A national monument designation would also provide a boost to our local economies. Protected public lands are major contributors to our country’s $646 billion outdoor recreation economy. In California alone, more than half of all residents participate in outdoor recreation each year, supporting more than 700,000 jobs and generating more than $6 billion for our state’s economy. In addition to the five counties that support a national monument designation, more than 100 businesses in areas surrounding the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region also support a national monument designation. Thompson’s legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. Despite hearings in both the House and Senate, it has not received a vote. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.21.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement on the executive actions announced tonight by President Obama on immigration. “Our immigration system is broken and tonight the president took steps to help fix it. However, executive actions alone cannot fix our broken immigration system, nor are they a substitute for passing comprehensive immigration reform. Truly fixing our broken immigration system will require congressional action. “The Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation more than 500 days ago. It’s been more than a year since we introduced bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform legislation in the House. Not only is passing this tough, fair, comprehensive immigration reform legislation the right thing to do for our country and in line with our nation's most fundamental principles, it will boost our economy and lower our debt. Yet given more than 500 days to act, the House Majority still refuses to vote. It’s past time Republicans in the House put the needs of our country ahead of partisan politics and vote to pass comprehensive immigration reform.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.20.2014	WASHINGTON­—Today, Northern California Representatives Jared Huffman (D-02), George Miller (D-11) Mike Thompson (D-05), Doris Matsui (D-06), Jerry McNerney (D-09), John Garamendi (D-10), and Ami Bera (D-07) released the following statement after Senator Dianne Feinstein announced she will not be pursuing passage of her water bill this year: “We are pleased Senator Feinstein will not be pursuing passage of the water legislation secretly negotiated by her and House Republicans. This legislation would have eviscerated environmental laws protecting fisheries, California watersheds, local water supplies, and tribal and local economies in order to benefit a few powerful Delta water exporters. We applaud the Senator for stepping away from this deeply flawed legislation and realizing that a bill of this magnitude requires public hearings and regular committee process. “As Members of Congress who represent districts that would be directly affected by this legislation, we have been raising serious objections to both the secretive process and the harmful content of this legislation. We will continue to demand next year that any water legislation responding to California’s severe drought be balanced and take into consideration the array of stakeholders in California. “We have long supported inclusive, forward-looking responses to the drought and to our state's longer-term water needs, including decisions by federal and state agencies this year to maximize water supply while abiding by environmental laws. We remain eager and willing to work with Senators Feinstein and Boxer, state and federal agencies, and other Members of Congress to advance fair and responsible water legislation.”
11.19.2014	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep.

11.10.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that he is encouraging local schools and veterans to participate in the Veterans History Project. The Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress American Folklife Center was created by the U.S. Congress in 2000 to collect, preserve and make accessible the personal accounts of American war veterans so that future generations may hear directly from veterans and better understand the realities of war. “This project provides an excellent opportunity for young people to hear firsthand what serving our nation during times of war means,” said Thompson. “By recording the stories of our veterans for posterity, generations of family and community members will be able to hear directly from those who served our country so they could grow up free.” The program comprises individual audio- and video-recorded interviews, original photographs, letters and other historical documents from veterans of every war and conflict since World War I. In addition, U.S. citizen civilians who were actively involved in supporting war efforts (such as war industry workers, USO workers, flight instructors, medical volunteers, etc.) are also invited to share their valuable stories. To date, the Veterans History Project has collected more than 95,000 oral histories from veterans in every state and congressional district. Students can interview local veterans and their video recordings will be submitted to the Library of Congress, where they will be archived for posterity. There are no deadlines for participation. Veterans, veteran organizations, or schools who are interested in participating in this project should contact Thompson’s office at (707) 645-1888 or email vetshistory.thompson@mail.house.gov. Please visit https://www.loc.gov/vets/ to learn how you can get involved in this important project.

11.10.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a Vietnam Veteran who served in combat with the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant/platoon leader with the 173rd Airborne Brigade where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart, released the following letter of thanks in honor of tomorrow’s Veterans Day. “Dear Friends, “On Veterans Day, let’s start by saying thank you, because that’s what Veterans Day is about. Thank you to our communities for the support you provide for those who have bravely served. Thank you to the families of our veterans. Anyone who has ever served or had a loved one in the Armed Forces knows that military service is a family commitment. And most importantly, thank you to our veterans. Today, cities and towns across America are pausing and giving their greatest appreciation for your service. “The truth is that every day should be Veterans Day. Not a moment should go by where we’re not giving thanks for the sacrifices our veterans and their loved ones have made on our behalf. “They didn’t make those sacrifices with any expectation of praise or admiration. The brave Americans who risked their lives to defend our country and uphold our values did so selflessly. “They did it out of duty, out of fidelity to our freedoms, out of love for county, and out of loyalty to those they served beside and citizens they never met. “So, let’s make sure we honor our veterans first by saying, ‘Thank you.’ And as important – through action – by making sure our veterans and their families get the benefits they earned. “No one who has fought for our nation in uniform should have to fight for a paycheck, proper health care, or a roof over their head when they take the uniform off. “We must make sure our veterans have opportunities – the opportunity to get a quality education, the opportunity to get a job that pays well, and the opportunity for a dignified retirement. “And we must strengthen health care services for all our veterans – from the disabled to those suffering from PTS, depression and traumatic brain injuries. “I won’t stop working until this happens. And that’s in part because I am a veteran. “So, on Veterans Day, let’s not just say thank you – let’s show our thanks by making sure our veterans and their families get what they’ve earned. “And let us honor their sacrifice by praying for peace – for the day when war is not a reality, but a far-distant memory. As John F. Kennedy said, ‘Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end to mankind.’ “To all of our veterans and their families – thank you for your service, for your sacrifice, and for coming home and continuing your commitment to building a great country. Now, let us make sure we, as a grateful country, never forget to honor our commitment to you.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

10.28.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), and Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) today announced that the Obama Administration has approved Individual Assistance (IA) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for areas in Napa and Solano Counties impacted by the August 24th earthquake. The Obama Administration also approved U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans for homeowners, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The Obama Administration had previously only approved FEMA disaster funds for Public Assistance (PA). “The approval of this much needed assistance is an important step in our region’s recovery, and it will finally allow us to start helping folks get back on their feet,” said Thompson. “Individuals and families will be able to use these funds to begin the process of rebuilding and repairing homes and other personal property. And, local businesses will be able to apply for low-interest SBA loans to repair or replace disaster-damaged property, inventory and supplies. I stand ready to work with our state and local officials to make sure people know what assistance is available, who qualifies and how to apply. My office is also ready to assist with any hurdles people may encounter.” Boxer said, “I thank the Obama administration for determining that the people of Napa and Solano counties who were severely affected by the recent earthquake will be eligible for Individual Assistance grants and SBA loans. Residents suffering because of this devastating quake can now apply for grants of up to $32,400 to repair their homes, find temporary housing and cover expenses such as medical bills or moving costs. Business owners will be eligible for low-interest disaster loans of up to $2 million to repair and rebuild, homeowners can apply for loans of up to $200,000, and renters can qualify for loans of up to $40,000 to cover personal property losses.” “I applaud FEMA’s decision to approve sorely-needed individual assistance for families affected by the South Napa earthquake,” said Feinstein. “When I visited Napa after the earthquake, I saw the suffering in the community, the red- and yellow-tagged homes and businesses that were hurt. Families and business owners need help to make necessary repairs, and individual assistance will go a long way toward helping those affected by the earthquake move forward with their lives.” The FEMA disaster funds for IA that the Obama Administration approved today is funding for individuals and families to help rebuild and repair housing and other personal property. Individuals in Napa and Solano Counties can register with FEMA the following ways: Apply online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. Apply via smartphone at m.fema.gov. Constituents may call the registration phone number at 1-800-621-3362; those who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. The Small Business Administration (SBA) loans that the Obama Administration approved today would help businesses repair or replace disaster-damaged property, inventory, and supplies. Homeowners and renters may also be eligible for SBA loans to repair or replace disaster-related damages to homes or personal property. Businesses and homeowners that would like to apply for SBA loans can do so online at: https://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/loans-grants/small-business-loans/disaster-loans. The Obama Administration previously approved FEMA disaster funds for PA. This is funding for local communities to use to repair public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure, power generation facilities, sewage collection facilities, and drainage channels. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and local governments split the remaining 25 percent. Hazard Mitigation funding was also previously approved. This is funding for local communities to repair facilities in a way that will help make sure they are better able to withstand future earthquakes. The approved funding is in response to the August 24th, magnitude-6.0 earthquake that struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. Estimates show that the earthquake caused $362 million in damage and damaged more than 1,500 homes. Governor Brown has declared a State of Emergency and requested federal assistance. Thompson led a letter to the President urging him to approve the state’s request.

10.16.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $160,727 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) grant to assist homeless women veterans in Santa Rosa. The Grant and Per Diem Program (GPD) Special Need Grant is being awarded to Vietnam Veterans of California, Inc. so it can continue providing housing and necessary services to homeless women veterans, including women who have to care for children. “This grant isn’t just about reducing veteran homelessness; it’s about providing veteran mothers and their children with housing and stability as our vets make the transition back to civilian life,” said Thompson. “It’s unthinkable that a woman who served our country in uniform would have to struggle to find housing for herself and her kids. As a Vietnam Veteran, I am a proud supporter of this important VA initiative and will continue doing everything I can to make sure our heroes receive the very best – because that’s what they’ve earned.” About the GPD Program: The VA’s GDP Program, a key component of the VA’s plan to eliminate homelessness among veterans, funds community agencies that provide services to homeless veterans. The program promotes the development and provision of supportive housing and services with the goal of helping homeless veterans achieve residential stability, increase their skill levels and income, and obtain greater self-determination. Recognizing that a “one-size fits all” approach would not serve the needs of homeless Veterans who require more intensive interventions, the GPD Special Need Grant was established. GPD Special Need funding allows grantees to provide transitional housing to the most vulnerable homeless Veterans while working to transition them to permanent housing.

10.06.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, bipartisan legislation authored by U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Tom Reed (R-NY-23) to improve access to quality hospice care was signed into law by President Obama at a White House ceremony. Thompson and Reed’s Hospice Opportunities for Supporting Patients with Integrity and Care Evaluations (HOSPICE) Act was included in the Improving Medicare Post-Acute Care Transformation (IMPACT) Act of 2014. “This law will strengthen accountability and transparency at hospice facilities so that patients receive the highest quality care possible,” said Thompson. “By putting these accountability measures in place, we are improving hospice centers and providing patients and their families the peace of mind that they will be able to depend on the care they receive.” The HOSPICE Act requires a three-year recertification cycle for hospice facilities as opposed to the current six to eight-year timeframe. This enhanced time-frame is designed to improve accountability and make sure hospice centers are attentive to the changing needs of patient care. This will also improve quality of care by helping hospice providers see where improvements are needed. According to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) examined hospice survey frequency in 2007 and 2013 and found that the existing intervals and resources were inadequate. The mandatory survey frequency in HOSPICE Act is consistent with the OIG recommendations. The HOSPICE Act also allows the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to conduct a medical review of hospice programs that reach a threshold of patients under care for more than 180 days. The threshold would be established by CMS. This provision will help make sure patients at high-volume hospice centers are receiving quality care.

The funds will be used to hire additional staff for the health center’s new dental clinic and support staff for the primary care clinic. “Sonoma Valley Community Health Center does outstanding work to make sure everyone in our community has access to affordable, quality health care,” said Thompson. “I am proud to announce these important funds which will allow our health center to hire more providers and serve more patients.” “We are pleased to have been afforded the Expanded Services opportunity, which will allow the Sonoma Valley Community Health Center (SVCHC) to allocate resources toward the critical task of provider recruitment," said Cheryl Johnson, SVCHC CEO. "With this new funding, SVCHC will immediately launch grant-related activities and anticipates the addition of a full-time provider, resulting in an additional 450 patients served for our community. Also, with the addition of comprehensive dental services through our new Dental Clinic, the long-standing oral health disparities and lack of access to dental care in our service area will be remedied.” The new SVCHC Dental Clinic boasts 1,814 sq. ft. of space, which includes six dental chairs, and will open as part of the new expanded facility in October 2014. The new Dental Clinic is the first and only local dental clinic to address the needs of many of Sonoma Valley’s adults and children. According to a 2010 study conducted by the Sonoma County Task Force on Oral Health, there were only 15 dentists for 109,000 low-income dental patients countywide. The Task Force characterized this as a local health care crisis. As a result, 52 percent of area third-graders have a history of tooth decay - well above the California state average. The new SVCHC Dental Clinic will begin to bridge the gap in oral health care in our region.

That’s an enormous economic win.” “We are incredibly grateful for Congressman Thompson's support for this important project,” said Supervisor Mike Mcguire. “This grant funding is will make our area more attractive to industry, help create jobs, and make our airport safer and more accessible.” The runway project will allow the airport to support and attract major airlines that would be able to fly to larger airports further inland. Currently the airport offers flights to Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The project will help make Sonoma County more attractive to commerce because businesses will be able to more easily get back and forth from major inland city, and fly customers or cargo in and out with greater ease. Tourism could also see a boost as the project will make it easier for people around the country to get to Sonoma County. The project will also improve safety by separating two runways that currently end at the same location. Creating two separate endpoints for the runways will help eliminate pilot confusion. Earlier this year, Thompson announced a $1 million Department of Transportation (DOT) grant that will be used for environmental mitigations required to complete the airport’s runway realignment and extension project. Last year, Thompson announced nearly $40 million in DOT funds for the runway project at Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport.

09.23.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced that the Napa County Catalyst Coalition has received $125,000 in federal Drug-Free Communities Support Program grants to help our local community prevent use of illegal substances among youth. “These grants provide Napa County with the resources we need to help prevent youth substance abuse, and organize our community around the goal of having healthy kids and drug-free communities,” said Thompson. “The best way to reduce drug use is to stop it before it starts, and that’s what these federal grants are all about. I am proud to support them.” Over the past nine years, the Catalyst Coalition, a program of the Napa County Office of Education, has partnered with local schools, families, organizations and businesses in Napa County to identify and address the most pressing issues related to youth drug and alcohol use. According to the 2013 California Healthy Kids Survey for Napa County, first use of alcohol among 9th graders in Napa County has declined 18 percent since 2005, when Catalyst first started. In addition, first use of marijuana among 9th graders has declined 11 percent since the Catalyst youth marijuana prevention initiative began in 2011. With the collaboration of the cities, county and law enforcement, Napa County now has streamlined its social host ordinances so that they are easier to enforce, with more meaningful consequences. Other initiatives include a retail alcohol signage campaign, youth marijuana prevention, and new e-cigarette policies in the schools and community to protect children.

09.22.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Santa Rosa, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit serving six northern California counties, has been awarded a $249,229 grant by the Department of Homeland Security to double its free citizenship education classes in Sonoma and Napa counties over the next two years. The grant will provide for two additional 18-week citizenship preparation and literacy courses annually for a total of four classes in each county, each serving between 40 and 50 students. Currently there are only two of 21 adult schools in the entire six-county region that offer citizenship classes. “We are a nation of immigrants. I am a third generation Italian-American on my mother’s side. Every year millions of immigrants just like my family, come to our country in search of greater opportunities for themselves and for their families,” said Thompson. “I will continue supporting these important grants that help make sure the dream of American citizenship is not only for those who were born within our borders, but also for those legal, permanent residents who have arrived on our shores in search of a better life.” Catholic Charities has been providing two classes a year since 1998. The courses are for English language learners who range in ability from high beginner to high intermediate. Classes are taught in English with highly trained tutors available for one-on-one or group instruction. “Our program serves people from countries all over the world who face significant barriers to obtaining naturalization,” says program manager Dina Lopez. “They are legal permanent residents who have been providing for their families and communities for years, as business owners, employees, and volunteers, yet were prohibited from voting. Obtaining citizenship is a dream that takes many months of hard work. During the last three years our learners have scored an average of 89% on the test, and every one of the students who received our assistance with the naturalization process successfully gained US citizenship.” The Immigration and Refugee Resettlement Services program of Catholic Charities of Santa Rosa was established in 1975. Most of the staff are Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) accredited, which is the largest accredited staff in the US. In addition to citizenship classes, services include assistance in Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and refugee resettlement/family reunification services.

09.19.2014	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA), Dave Reichert (R-WA), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Greg Walden, (R-OR), Jared Polis (D-CO), and Erik Paulsen (R-MN) yesterday introduced the bipartisan U.S. Optimal Use of Trade to Develop Outerwear and Outdoor Recreation (OUTDOOR) Act (H.R. 5646) to reduce tariffs on recreational performance apparel. The legislation would make products like jackets and pants more affordable for American consumers, encourage participation in outdoor activities, and help designers and retailers of performance apparel better compete in the global economy. In a joint statement the Congressmen said, “The American Dream is built on the idea of exploration and economic success, and the OUTDOOR Act works to promote both of those concepts and make them a reality. From canoeing mountain climbing, Americans have found ways to enjoy the outdoors in every season of the year, and outfitting them with innovative apparel is the basis of a major job-creating industry. This legislation is a needed update to antiquated and unreasonably high tariffs set on recreational performance apparel, and more importantly it will help employers grow their businesses, remove a hidden tax on consumers, and continue to foster interest in America’s outdoor recreation.” “I commend the Representatives and Senators Cantwell and Ayotte for coming together in a bipartisan effort to support the outdoor recreation industry, a vital part of the economy at the state and national level,” said OIA President and CEO Frank Hugelmeyer. “The U.S. OUTDOOR Act will lower costs for outdoor businesses, fuel innovation, attract more consumers to get outdoors using high-quality, affordable apparel and will create more jobs in the United States. We look forward to the enactment of this important legislation.” BACKGROUND According to the Outdoor Industry Association, American consumers spend over $640 billion each year on outdoor recreation, in so doing supporting an industry that is directly and indirectly tied to 12 million American jobs. H.R. 5646 creates new Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) breakouts for both knit and woven recreational performance outerwear and changes tariff rates for these clothing items to duty-free, thereby eliminating the “hidden tax” on these goods.

09.18.2014	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-05) bipartisan legislation to transfer management of recreation at Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) today passed the House Committee on Natural Resources. “BLM is the agency best suited to manage recreational activities at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “Now that this bipartisan bill has passed committee the full House should take it up so that BLM, BOR and the county can begin working on a smooth management transfer, and on a successful redevelopment plan.” Thompson’s bill, H.R. 4166, has 226 co-authors, eight more than is needed to pass the House. BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically, the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from BOR to BLM while still allowing BOR to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the dam.

09.17.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) today voted against arming Syrian opposition groups to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The authorization to arm and train the Syrian opposition groups passed the House by a vote of 273-156. “ISIL is a dangerous terrorist organization that must be stopped. It has brutally murdered two American citizens, and it poses a threat to the United States, our allies, and to regional stability. “However, arming Syrian opposition groups alone is not an effective strategy to combat the ISIL terrorist group and diminish its capacity to operate. There has been inadequate vetting of these opposition groups. We do not have enough information on the people we are proposing to arm and train. We cannot ensure that these weapons will not fall into the hands of ISIL, or be used against other innocent civilians. And, we need a better strategy in place to engage a broad, international coalition of Muslim countries to fight alongside these Syrian opposition groups. “Simply arming the Syrian opposition groups comes with great risk. Instead, we need a comprehensive strategy that includes a debate and vote in Congress that specifically authorizes the use of force against ISIL, and the involvement of a broad, international coalition of Muslim and Western countries to diminish ISIL and degrade their organizational capabilities.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.12.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), today released the following statements on the White House’s partial approval of the federal disaster assistance requested by the State of California for areas impacted by the August 24th earthquake: “The approval of these federal disaster funds is an important step in our recovery. They will help our cities and towns repair the damage that was caused by the earthquake,” said Thompson. “However, these funds do not help individuals in our community who are still struggling to get back on their feet. This is the worst earthquake the Bay Area has seen in 25 years. Many families have significant damage to their homes and personal property. Our government cannot turn their backs on them in their time of need. I urge the White House to take the next important step and approve federal disaster assistance for individual families as requested by the State of California.” Senator Boxer said, “I thank the President for his swift response in approving a major disaster declaration for California, which will help our communities rebuild after this devastating earthquake. It is critical that the Administration move quickly to approve Individual Assistance to help families affected by the quake get back on their feet.” The Obama Administration today approved Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for Public Assistance (PA). This is funding for local communities to use to repair critical public infrastructure such as roads, bridges, buildings, water infrastructure, power generation facilities, sewage collection facilities, and drainage channels. The federal government covers 75 percent of the costs, and the state and locals governments split the remaining 25 percent. Hazard mitigation was also approved. This is funding for local communities to repair facilities in a way that will help make sure they are better able to withstand future earthquakes. The Obama Administration did not yet approve or deny Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster funds for Individual Assistance (IA). This is funding for individual families to help rebuild and repair housing. FEMA is still reviewing the state’s request for IA and a decision on IA funds will be made by the Obama Administration at a later date. Local assessments show the earthquake caused $55 million in public damage and $362 million in private damage. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans may be announced at a later date. These loans are available to help businesses repair or replace disaster-damaged property, inventory, and supplies. Homeowners and renters may also be eligible for SBA loans to repair or replace disaster-related damages to homes or personal property. On Sunday, August 24th, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma. The earthquake was the largest to hit the Bay Area in 25 years. Governor Brown has declared a State of Emergency and requested federal assistance. Thompson led a letter to the President urging him to approve the state’s request.

09.10.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) released the following statement on President Obama’s address on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL): “Tonight, President Obama laid out a comprehensive, multi-layered strategy to combat the ISIL terrorist group and diminish its capacity to operate. “The ISIL terrorist group brutally murdered two American citizens. It poses a threat to the United States, our allies, and to regional stability. We cannot wait until it grows stronger and more capable of resisting international efforts to stop it. “With the cooperation and involvement of Congress and a broad, international coalition of Muslim and Western countries, the U.S. should move to diminish ISIL, degrade their organizational capabilities, and bring those responsible for killing Americans and other innocent individuals to justice.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.09.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan legislation to designate the United States Postal facility located at 100 Admiral Callaghan Lane in Vallejo as the “Philmore Graham Post Office Building” pasted the House last night by unanimously. The legislation, H.R. 5106, was cosponsored by every member of the California Congressional Delegation. “There is no one more deserving of this recognition than Philmore Graham and I am proud that the House passed this bipartisan bill,” said Thompson. “Mr. Graham was a veteran, a patriot, a mentor and a leader. He dedicated his life to helping others succeed, and he made our community a better place to live and raise a family. It’s only fitting that we honor his memory by forever naming our post office after Philmore Graham.” Graham was born in North Carolina and graduated from Tennessee State University. He served in the Air Force and worked at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He was the first, and to this day remains the only, African American to hold the position of supervisor at Mare Island’s Department of Nuclear Energy. In 1966, Graham founded the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club in Vallejo. What began as six young boys meeting in Graham’s garage has become a thriving organization that today enriches the lives of approximately 300 boys and girls each year. The club has worked with thousands of young people since its inception. Graham mentored scores of young people, offering them support and encouragement and instilling in them the values and principles they needed to succeed. He provided academic support, encouraged involvement in sports, and taught young people the importance of perseverance, hard-work, and self-respect. Graham was named the NAACP’s Outstanding Citizen of the Year. He was awarded the Good Neighbor Award, the Salute to America Lifetime Merit Award, the Profile of Excellence Award, the Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award, and the “Who’s Who” Among Black Americans Award. Additionally, he was named the Omega Man of the Year and Citizen of the Year multiple times. H.R. 5106 now goes to the Senate for consideration.

09.03.2014	NAPA, C.A. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today called on President Obama to issue a major disaster declaration for the areas impacted by the August 24th earthquake. The letter to the president, led by Thompson was also signed by Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi (CA-12), and Congressmen Jared Huffman (CA-1) and John Garamendi (CA-3). A major disaster declaration, which was formally requested by the State of California, would provide federal assistance to the communities that were damaged by the earthquake. The president must approve the state’s request. “The earthquake hit our communities hard and federal assistance is needed for our area to fully recover from the damage that was caused,” said Thompson. “I stand ready to help expedite any support and resources because the sooner we get aid from the federal government, the sooner we can begin rebuilding and repairing our homes, businesses, and infrastructure.” If federal assistance is approved by the president, funds from Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA may be available for individuals to help rebuild and repair housing, and for local communities to repair public infrastructure. Small Business Administration (SBA) loans may be available to businesses to repair or replace disaster-damaged property, inventory, and supplies. Homeowners and renters may also be eligible for SBA loans to repair or replace disaster-related damages to homes or personal property. The state and our local governments have conducted damage assessments and have determined that the extent of the damages are beyond their capacity to repair without federal assistance. Because of this determination the state has formally requested that the president issue a major disaster declaration. The president must approve the state’s request for federal assistance to become available. FEMA does not provide for assistance if there is another option in place, like insurance. All individuals should contact their insurance companies first to see what benefits, if any, their plan provides. A full copy of the letter to President Obama is below. August 29, 2014 The President The White House Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write to you in strong support of the State of California’s request for a major disaster declaration to provide much-needed assistance to our State for damages resulting from the August 24, 2014, earthquake. On August 24th, at 3:20 a.m., an earthquake measuring 6.1 struck 3.7 miles northwest of American Canyon near the West Napa Fault. As you know, this was the strongest quake to strike the region since 1989. As a result, there has been significant damage to homes, businesses, public buildings, and infrastructure throughout our communities. Governor Edmund G. Brown promptly declared a State of Emergency, noting the impact in Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. It is clear to us and local authorities that a major disaster declaration is critical to helping our State recover and rebuild. Therefore, we strongly support the State of California’s request for a major disaster declaration. We appreciate your consideration of this request and we are ready to assist you in expediting support and resources to the impacted communities. Sincerely,
08.29.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement in recognition of Labor Day: “Labor Day is a time to thank our sisters and brothers of labor for everything they do, and to honor hard working, middle class American families. The best way to honor our country’s hard workers is by making sure they have the opportunity to get ahead and succeed. Right now, middle class families are getting squeezed at every turn as prices on everything from rent, to utilities, to college and groceries go up and middle class paychecks remain stagnant. “That’s not who we are as a country. America isn’t a country where the middle class can’t move up, hard working folks can’t get ahead, and someone who works full-time has to live below the poverty line. We’re a country where, if you work hard and play by the rules, you will get a job, buy a house, send your kids to college and save for retirement. “This Labor Day, let’s commit ourselves to jumpstarting the middle class by creating good jobs, raising the minimum wage, and making higher education affordable. Let’s commit ourselves to making sure everyone who works hard and plays be the rules has an equal and fair opportunity to achieve the American Dream.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.29.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) will consider waiving late filing, payment, or deposit penalties on a case-by-case basis for wineries and other businesses whose operations were affected by the recent earthquake. “This decision is big help to our local businesses who have been severely impacted the earthquake,” said Thompson. “It will give them one less thing to worry about as they get back on their feet. Anyone who has questions about applying for this assistance should consider my office a resource and contact us with any questions.” As a result of the earthquake, many of these taxpayers may not be able to timely file, or make timely payments or deposits of Federal excise taxes administered and enforced by TTB. In light of this, TTB will consider waiving late filing, payment, or deposit penalties on a case-by-case basis. The waiver of penalties may also apply to taxpayers such as relief workers, and taxpayers whose place of employment is located in the affected area. To qualify for such a waiver, a taxpayer must: Demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the appropriate TTB officer, that the earthquake directly affected your ability to timely file, pay, or deposit; and Contact the TTB National Revenue Center (NRC) at: 550 Main Street, Suite 8002 Cincinnati, OH 45202-5215 Toll-free: 877-882-3277 E-mail: TTBInternetQuestions@ttb.gov Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.27.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today warned constituents to be aware of scams and fraud in the wake of the recent earthquake. “Please be aware of scams and fraudulent phone calls, and watch out for suspicious activity and potential fraud,” said Thompson. “Make sure you ask to see a license, and if you suspect a scam call the authorities.” According to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the most common post-disaster fraud practices include phony housing inspectors, fraudulent building contractors, bogus pleas for disaster donations and fake offers of state or federal aid. Those who suspect fraud should call the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline toll free at 1-866-720-5721. Complaints may also be made to local law enforcement agencies. On Sunday, August 24th, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa, Solano and Sonoma County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma.

08.25.2014	NAPA, C.A. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced $2 million in Emergency Relief funds from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s (DOT) Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) to help the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and local agencies cover repair costs for infrastructure damaged by the August 24th earthquake. “This earthquake severely damaged a lot of our infrastructure and these funds will go a long way towards helping our community recover,” said Thompson. “I will continue working with the DOT and all federal agencies to make sure our district gets the emergency resources we need to rebuild and recover.” Caltrans has identified numerous locations with damage to bridges and roadways, with preliminary cost estimates already totaling at least $10 million at this time. The earthquake caused widespread surface cracking on roadways, such as S.R. 121 north of the Sonoma/Napa County line at Cuttings Wharf, and significant stress to joints on bridges, including the Napa River Bridge on S.R. 29. All bridges are safe and open to traffic. The state’s primary focus is determining whether bridge joints should be repaired or replaced. On Sunday, August 24th, a magnitude-6.0 earthquake struck the Napa and Solano County area at approximately 3:20 a.m. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was three miles from American Canyon, six miles from Napa, and eight miles from Sonoma.

08.22.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $2.65 million U.S. Department of Education (ED) grant for Santa Rosa Junior College. The grant was awarded under the Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) Program. “Everyone, no matter who you are or where you’re from should have the opportunity to receive a quality education,” said Thompson. “These important funds will support Santa Rosa Junior College’s ongoing efforts to increase the education opportunities available to our community’s Hispanic population. I am a proud supporter of this program, and I will continue working to make sure our district’s colleges and universities have the resources they need to prepare our students for successful careers.” “This is a transformational moment not only for SRJC but for the entire community,” said Dr. Frank Chong, President and Superintendent of Santa Rosa Junior College. “We eagerly welcome the grant and what we will be able to achieve with the additional resources to serve the unique needs of the Latino community in Sonoma County and the North Bay.” The purpose of the HSI program is to expand educational opportunities for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic students, and to expand and enhance the academic offerings, program quality, and institutional stability of colleges and universities that are educating the majority of Hispanic college students. In an effort to increase academic opportunity and attainment for Hispanic and low-income students Santa Rosa Junior College is introducing the Multi-cultural Education Transfer Acceleration or Meta4 Program. This grant will support the Meta4 Program. Meta4 will meet four specific goals: Increase access, retention, and degree or certificate completion for Hispanic and low-income students; Increase the number of Hispanic English Learners students enrolling in, and successfully complete, transfer-level composition courses; Provide Hispanic and low-income students access to new technology advising and planning tools to increase their academic success, retention and graduation rates; and Improve the transition and continuing success of Hispanic and low-income students to the demands of college with an emphasis on improving student support and academic success.

07.31.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Gregg Harper (R-MS) today introduced bipartisan legislation to expand telehealth services under Medicare. The bill, titled the Medicare Telehealth Parity Act of 2014 puts telehealth services under Medicare on the path toward parity with in-person health care visits. “Telehealth saves money and helps save lives,” said Thompson. “By expanding telehealth services, we can make sure the best care and the best treatments are available to all Americans, no matter where they live. I am proud to be introducing this bill with my friend and colleague Gregg Harper, and I will continue working with him to improve access to telehealth services.” “Telehealth is one of the most promising aspects of the health care field,” said Harper. “Mississippians, Californians and people all over the country can benefit from an expansion of telehealth services. This is an issue that Congressman Mike Thompson and I have worked on together in the past, and it’s my privilege to help him introduce this bill.” The Medicare Telehealth Parity Act expands telehealth in a series of three phases. "We fully support this effort to improve healthcare access and affordability using telecommunications technology," said Jonathan Linkous, chief executive officer of the American Telemedicine Association. "These cost-saving provisions are critical to improve telehealth coverage and extend care to millions of Americans.” Phase one expands telehealth services under Medicare for video conferencing and technologies known as store-and-forward which allows clinical information such as videos, data, and x-rays to be stored and then sent to another site for evaluation. This phase expands these services to all federally qualified health centers, rural health clinics and in counties within metropolitan statistical areas with populations less than 50,000. The bill will expand telehealth coverage for certified diabetes educators, speech language therapists, audiologists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists and physical therapists. The use of remote-patient monitoring for diabetes, congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease will also be incorporated in this phase. Phase two expands telehealth services under Medicare coverage for video conferencing and store-and-forward technologies in counties located in metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 50,000-100,000. Video conferencing will also extend to a beneficiary’s home for home health services and agencies, durable medical equipment, home dialysis and hospice. Speech language pathology, audiology, respiratory, occupational and physical therapies will also be covered services under this phase.

07.28.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1 million Department of Transportation (DOT) grant for Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. The funds will be used for environmental mitigations required to complete the airport’s runway realignment and extension project. Once completed, this runway project will help the airport accommodate regional jets flying longer distances to and from an increased number of air travel destinations. “The runway project at Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport will be a cornerstone of economic development in our region for years to come,” said Thompson. “It’s important that we protect our local environment as this project continues – and these funds will help us do just that.” “We are incredibly grateful for Congressman Thompson's continued support,” said Supervisor Mike Mcguire. “This grant funding is critical to the success of the Airport Safety and Improvement project and it will immediately be put to work improving the Airport's runways and facilities.” Specifically, these funds will address environmental requirements to protect and mitigate the impact to local endangered plant and animal species. Thompson worked with the Federal Aviation Administration, other federal resource agencies, and local officials to address these environmental mitigation concerns. The addressing of these environmental concerns was required for the airport to receive funding for the runway realignment and extension project. The runway project will allow the airport to support and attract major airlines that would be able to fly to larger airports further inland. Currently the airport offers flights to Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The project will also improve safety by separating two runways that currently end at the same location. Creating two separate endpoints for the runways will help eliminate pilot confusion. Last year, Thompson announced nearly $40 million of DOT funds for the runway project at Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.23.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today hosted a meeting with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Undersecretary for Benefits Allison Hickey and Julianna Boor, the new Director of the VA’s Oakland Regional Office. Thompson and his Northern California colleagues discussed the claims backlog at the Oakland Regional Office, and the recent controversies at other VA offices around the country. Since 2012, Thompson has hosted four separate oversight meetings with Hickey on Capitol Hill, and toured the Oakland Regional Office with her. “The claims backlog at the Oakland VA office, and the mess we’ve recently witnessed at several other VA offices across our country is unacceptable,” said Thompson. “I believe that Undersecretary Hickey and Director Boor are committed to solving this problem. As a veteran myself, I will not stop working with the VA and my colleagues in Congress until we make sure that all of our nation’s veterans are getting the care and benefits they’ve earned in a timely manner. These oversight meetings are a good way for us to keep a finger on the pulse of the VA’s improvements.” Currently, new claims by veterans can take almost 300 days to process, delaying access to care and benefits. California veterans in the 5th Congressional District are serviced by the Oakland Regional Office which, until last year, had one of the longest claims backlog in the country. In January, Thompson passed legislation that holds the VA accountable for ending the backlog of claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration. The legislation requires a monthly report from each regional office and the national VA office detailing the current backlog of claims. Additional reporting is required from offices with backlogs averaging more than 200 days. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.23.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today issued the following statement on the Department of Transportation’s new proposed crude by rail regulations: “These new regulations are a step in the right direction. They address concerns laid out in the letter I sent Secretary Foxx earlier this month, and will help make sure crude oil from North Dakota's Bakken region is shipped in a safer manner. However, there is more that should be done. Public safety is priority number one, and that’s why we need to make sure our first responders have all the information they need to quickly and effectively address emergency situations.” Many trains transporting crude oil from the Bakken Shale formation of North Dakota run through Thompson’s congressional district. The crude oil from this region is regarded as highly flammable. Earlier this month, Thompson and House colleagues from Northern California sent a letter to DOT Secretary Anthony Foxx expressing strong concern over the increased shipments of crude oil by rail in their districts, and calling for action to increase safety. The letter asked that the DOT phase out old rail cars for newer, safer retrofitted cars. The new DOT regulations seek to phase out older tank cars and implement tighter speed limits while enhancing safety standards for new and existing tank cars. Additionally, in June Thompson passed legislation through the House that enhances rail and refinery security by requiring the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A) to conduct an intelligence assessment of the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail infrastructure, and to make any recommendations it deems appropriate to protect surrounding communities or the infrastructure itself from potential harm.

07.22.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a member of the bipartisan TRIO Caucus, today announced a $325,000 U.S. Department of Education grant for Sonoma State University’s (SSU) TRIO program. Federal TRIO programs are outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The programs serve and assist low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and individuals with disabilities. “Everyone, regardless of who they are, where they’re from, or how much money their parents have, deserves the opportunity to go to college and earn a degree,” said Thompson. “The TRIO programs help make this possible and that’s why I am a proud member of the TRIO Caucus and supporter of these important grants. With these funds, SSU will be able to help make sure students across our community have equal opportunities to achieve their educational goals.” The funds will be used to train staff on strategies for recruiting and serving hard to reach populations such as students with limited English proficiency, students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education, students with disabilities, students who are homeless children and youths, students who are in foster care or are aging out of the foster care system, and other disconnected students. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.22.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $222,179 Small Business Innovation Research grant for Riptide Bioscience, INC. Riptide Bioscience, INC. is based in Vallejo on Mare Island. The grant, from the National Eye Institute (NEI), will go towards a research project titled the Designed Host Defense Peptides for the Treatment of Bacterial Keratitis. “Not only will this grant support Riptide Bioscience’s cutting-edge research, it will provide a boost to our local economy as this money is invested in new innovations and medical advances,” said Thompson. “The work being done by Riptide Bioscience is second to none, and I am proud they call our district and Mare Island home.” “Our firm, Riptide Bioscience, has been developing peptides that have remarkable antibacterial activity, and also fight the inflammation that accompanies many serious illnesses,” said Henry Lopez, Executive Vice President of Riptide. “Keratitis is one of the conditions where a real concern is the development of bacterial resistance to the most common drugs. But bacteria can’t easily develop resistance to these peptides, which are proteins derived from naturally occurring defense mechanisms. The promise here is to develop a whole class of therapeutics that trump bacterial resistance and can be used against a very wide range of diseases. With new resistant strains arising every day, the need is urgent.” Bacterial keratitis is an infection of the cornea, the clear, round dome covering the eye's iris and pupil, that causes pain, reduced vision, light sensitivity and tearing or discharge from your eye. Resulting from infection from contact lens use or from injury to the eye, bacterial keratitis usually develops very quickly, and if left untreated, can cause blindness. Bacterial keratitis afflicts 30,000 patients in the United States every year. Riptide Bioscience’s goal is to evaluate Designed Host Defense Peptides (dHDPs). DHPDs are small molecular weight proteins that fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungi and can be used for the topical treatment of keratitis.

07.16.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today issued the following statement on the violence in Israel and the Palestinian Territories: “I am saddened by the recent murders of Naftali Fraenkel, Gilad Shaer, Eyal Yifrach, and Mohamed Abu Khdeir. My heart goes out to their families. Those responsible for their murders should be brought to justice. The resumption of rocket fire into Israel from Gaza is very troubling, targeting major Israeli population centers, putting countless civilians at risk. At the same time, I urge the Israeli military to do everything in their power to avoid Palestinian civilian casualties. I have and will continue to support continued U.S. assistance to Israel, and the close relationship between our two governments and peoples, while at the same time supporting Israel’s right to defend itself.”
07.15.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced H.R. 5106, bipartisan legislation that would designate the United States Postal facility located at 100 Admiral Callaghan Lane in Vallejo as the “Philmore Graham Post Office Building.” Every member of the California Congressional Delegation has cosponsored Thompson’s bill. “There is no one more deserving of this recognition than Philmore Graham,” said Thompson. “Mr. Graham served our country in the Air Force, founded the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club, and was the only African American to have ever been named supervisor at Mare Island’s Department of Nuclear Energy. He devoted his life to the idea that all children should have the opportunity to achieve their dreams. It’s only fitting that we honor this lifetime of work by forever naming our post office after Philmore Graham.” “On behalf of the Graham family, we thank Congressman Thompson for honoring a man who dedicated his entire life so that others could succeed,” said Philmore Graham’s son, Montoya Graham. Graham was born in North Carolina and graduated from Tennessee State University. He served in the Air Force and worked at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard. He was the first, and to this day remains the only, African American to hold the position of supervisor at Mare Island’s Department of Nuclear Energy. In 1966, Graham founded the Continentals of Omega Boys and Girls Club in Vallejo. What began as six young boys meeting in Graham’s garage has become a thriving organization that today enriches the lives of approximately 300 boys and girls each year. The club has worked with thousands of young people since its inception. Graham mentored scores of young people, offering them support and encouragement and instilling in them the values and principles they needed to succeed. He provided academic support, encouraged involvement in sports, and taught young people the importance of perseverance, hard-work, and self-respect. Graham was named the NAACP’s Outstanding Citizen of the Year. He was awarded the Good Neighbor Award, the Salute to America Lifetime Merit Award, the Profile of Excellence Award, the Martin Luther King Jr. Humanitarian Award, and the “Who’s Who” Among Black Americans Award. Additionally, he was named the Omega Man of the Year and Citizen of the Year multiple times.

07.03.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on today’s Quinnipiac University Poll that found 92 percent of American voters, including 92 percent of gun owners, support requiring background checks on all gun purchases. The poll also showed 86 percent of Republicans support background checks. “As a hunter, gun owner and supporter of the Second Amendment, I am proud to count myself among the 92 percent of American gun owners who support background checks for gun sales,” said Thompson. “I’ve authored bipartisan legislation to expand background checks to all commercial gun sales, and the only thing standing in the way of it passing is the Republican Majority in the House. It’s time they listen to the 92 percent of American gun owners who support background checks and bring our bill up for a vote – because if the Republican Majority would allow a vote, my bill would pass. ” Thompson and U.S. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) are co-authors of H.R. 1565, legislation that would expand the current background check system to all commercial sales. The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA), and supported by a bipartisan majority in the Senate. 189 House members have cosponsored the King-Thompson bill.

07.01.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-05), Doris Matsui (CA-06), George Miller (CA-11) and John Garamendi (CA-03) sent a letter to Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx expressing strong concern over the increased shipments of crude oil by rail in their districts, and calling for action to increase safety. “We are especially concerned with the high risks involved with transporting lighter, more flammable crude in densely populated areas. Should spills or explosions occur, as we have seen over the last year, the consequences could be disastrous, costing lives, damaging property, and harming the environment,” the members wrote. “While we are pleased with the many actions that DOT has taken thus far and we believe that your agency is making steady progress, we must still emphasize the utmost importance of demonstrated compliance with federal regulations by the railroad and petroleum industries. We believe there must be accountability and comprehensive oversight, as well as adherence to the most stringent of standards.” Specifically, the letter calls on the Department of Transportation (DOT) to: Provide a report on the level of compliance by the railroad and petroleum industry to the May 7th Emergency Order that requires information be shared in a timely manner with local entities. Issue a rulemaking that requires stripping out the most volatile elements from Bakken crude before it is loaded onto rail cars. Expedite the issuance of a final rulemaking to require the full implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) technology for all railroads transporting lighter crude and provide a status report on the progress of PTC implementation to date. Expedite the issuance of a rulemaking that requires phasing out old rail cars for newer, retrofitted cars. The full text of the letter is below: July 1, 2014 The Honorable Anthony Foxx Secretary U.S. Department of Transportation 1200 New Jersey Avenue, S.E. Washington, D.C. 20590 Dear Secretary Foxx: As members of the California Congressional Delegation, we are writing to voice our strong concerns over the increased shipment of crude oil by rail in our districts and the safety risks associated with this upsurge. Northern California is already seeing a significant increase in the movement of oil through our local communities, and the number of shipments is only expected to rise in the coming years. We commend the Department of Transportation (DOT) for its focus thus far on more information sharing, slower speeds, and reinforced railcars. As you know, the solutions for this important safety issue must be multi-pronged and implemented as quickly as possible, which requires a strong and coordinated effort by the federal government to achieve an effective solution. We are especially concerned with the high risks involved with transporting lighter, more flammable crude in densely populated areas. Should spills or explosions occur, as we have seen over the last year, the consequences could be disastrous, costing lives, damaging property, and harming the environment. While we are pleased with the many actions that DOT has taken thus far and we believe that your agency is making steady progress, we must still emphasize the utmost importance of demonstrated compliance with federal regulations by the railroad and petroleum industries. We believe there must be accountability and comprehensive oversight, as well as adherence to the most stringent of standards. We appreciate your agency’s May 7th Emergency Order that requires carriers to provide State Emergency Response Commissions with advance notice because it is imperative that local emergency managers and first responders are given up-to-date information on what materials are being transported through their regions, when these transports are occurring, and where this crude oil will be stored. But, because improved coordination and communication between the oil companies, railroads, and emergency managers is so fundamental to the safe transport of highly flammable lighter crude, we request a full report on the level of compliance by the oil companies and railroads to date. Additionally, we urge your agency to prioritize implementing solutions in an expeditious manner that we believe will better protect our communities. One such solution would remove a significant amount of the volatile elements, flammable natural gas liquids (NGLs), from the crude before it is loaded onto rail cars and we understand that regulators are already considering this course of action. In order for industry to comply, they would need to build small processing towers known as stabilizers that shave off NGLs from crude before it is ultimately loaded for transport. Stabilizers are common in other parts of the country and we understand that this could also be feasible through equipment leasing. Because your agency has explicitly stated that all options are on table, we believe that requiring the petroleum industry to make lighter crude shipments by rail less volatile must be a part of the solution. And, although building infrastructure will require time and investment, industry experts have also publicly stated that stripping NGLs from lighter crude is a part of the equation for addressing railcar safety. Furthermore, we believe that positive train control (PTC) advanced technology should be fully implemented as it is designed to automatically stop or slow a train before accidents can occur. Derailments must be avoided at all costs and PTC should be prioritized due to its accurate prevention of train-to-train collisions and derailments caused by excessive speed and unauthorized movement of trains. We believe that an expedited final rulemaking requiring full implementation of PTC is needed for those railroads that will be transporting lighter crude by rail through our communities. Yet another solution that has been considered and in some cases the oil industry has initiated, is switching out older rail cars for new, retrofitted ones. We urge your agency to issue a rulemaking to require phasing out and retrofitting older tank cars that do not have the latest safety technologies installed in order to further minimize the impact of an explosion, if a derailment with lighter crude were to occur. As all of these federal emergency orders and standards are being considered and final regulations are set to come out next year, we request that your agency provide us ongoing information regarding industry compliance and develop ambitious standards that will both prevent derailments and ensure that industry workers and communities are protected in cases where derailments do occur. We cannot allow communities to be in danger when viable solutions are available. To sum up our requests, we would like your agency to: Provide a report on the level of compliance by the railroad and petroleum industry to the May 7th Emergency Order. Issue rulemaking that requires stripping out the most volatile elements from Bakken crude before it is loaded onto rail cars. Expedite the issuance of a final rulemaking to require the full implementation of PTC technology for all railroads transporting lighter crude and provide a status report on the progress of PTC implementation to date. Expedite the issuance of a rulemaking that requires phasing out old rail cars for newer, retrofitted cars. We believe that we must be vigilant and put in place strict safety regulations that can adapt and meet the rapidly changing transportation and energy needs of our country. Thank you for your continued elevation of these important safety issues, and we look forward to working with you on this matter.

06.30.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement on the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby. In a 5-4 decision, the court ruled that for-profit corporations are allowed to exclude birth control coverage in their employees’ insurance plans based on the owners’ religious beliefs. “Today’s Supreme Court decision took health care choices out of the hands of women and their doctors, and put them in the hands of corporate bosses and their religious beliefs. The health care reform law rightfully put women and families in control of their own health care by covering preventive care, like cancer screenings, vaccines, and contraception, without copays or deductibles. Allowing corporate CEOs to deny their workers this care on the basis of their religious beliefs is a major step backwards. I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress to make sure any woman affected by today’s decision is still able to get the same federally-mandated preventive health benefits that everyone else is offered through the Affordable Care Act.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.27.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1,227,878 Head Start/Early Head Start grant for Contra Costa County. The funding will be used to provide Head Start and Early Head Start services to more than 1,860 children and their families at 27 centers throughout Contra Costa County. The grant restores funding lost through the federal sequester in 2013. “Head Start and Early Head Start programs help make sure all children have a foundation for future success,” said Thompson. “I am proud to support these grants which help make sure all students, regardless of where they live or how much money their parents make, have the tools they need to succeed from an early age.” Representative George Miller, a long-time Head Start supporter, praised the recent grant. "Contra Costa's long-standing Head Start program plays a vital role in our community and I am pleased to see our program continue to receive substantial federal support," Miller said. "Head Start helps disadvantaged children and their families, and that's good for our overall community." “We are delighted to have our program restored to its pre-sequester levels as the need continues to grow for families in need of childcare services throughout Contra Costa County as we look to prepare as many children and families as possible for success in the school systems and throughout their lives,” said Christina Reich, Division Manager at the Contra Costa County Employment and Human Services Department. Specifically, the funds will be used to: Increase enrollment in Head Start; Extend the part-day, part-year program from 26 weeks to 30 weeks, and extend employment of part-day, part-year program staff accordingly; Increase enrollment in Early Head Start enrollment Cover increased operational costs Head Start is a federal program that promotes school readiness for children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants’ increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families.

06.26.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – In the wake of recent shootings in Portland, Las Vegas, and Santa Barbara, Representatives Carol Shea-Porter (NH-01), a member of the House’s Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and Task Force Chairman Mike Thompson (CA-05) led a letter to Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) signed by 163 Members of Congress demanding a vote on substantive legislation to address gun violence. “Our nation has suffered at least 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre,” Shea-Porter, Thompson, and 161 of their colleagues wrote. “The factors allowing these rampages are no mystery: loopholes in the background check laws, straw purchases, restrictions on law enforcement, and gaps in our mental health system. Dozens of legislative proposals that address these factors have been introduced and await consideration. But despite wake-up call after wake-up call, a shameful tradition of Congressional inaction continues.” “Moments of silence on the floor of the House are not enough. The last thing these victims and their families need is further silence from this Congress. They deserve a vote,” they continued. Recently on the floor of the House of Representatives, Shea-Porter called on Speaker Boehner to allow a vote on legislation to help prevent more deaths from senseless gun violence. The Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, which is chaired by Thompson, released a comprehensive set of policy principles that will reduce gun violence and respect the Second Amendment. Of those recommendations, one of the most important pieces is H.R. 1565, bipartisan legislation written by Reps. Thompson and Peter King (R-NY) and cosponsored by Rep. Shea-Porter, to strengthen and expand background checks. This legislation bolsters the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners and helps keep guns from criminals, terrorists, and the dangerously mentally ill. Right now, a criminal in many states can buy a firearm at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because those sales don’t require a background check. H.R. 1565 requires comprehensive and enforceable background checks on all commercial gun sales, including those at gun shows, over the Internet, or through classified ads, while providing reasonable exceptions for family and friends. Background checks would be conducted though a licensed dealer in the same manner as they have been for more than 40 years. The Thompson-King bill bans the creation of a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. “Congressional silence is not a sign of respect, but rather an institutional indictment. We must right this wrong. You must allow a vote on substantive legislation to address gun violence,” Shea-Porter, Thompson and others concluded in their letter. Full text of the letter to Speaker John Boehner is below. The full list of signatories can be found here. +++ June 26, 2014 Speaker John Boehner Office of the Speaker H-232, US Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Dear Mr. Speaker: We agree with you that we must honor the victims of the recent shootings in Portland, Las Vegas and Santa Barbara. But moments of silence on the floor of the House are not enough. The last thing these victims and their families need is further silence from this Congress. They deserve a vote. Our nation has suffered at least 74 school shootings since the Sandy Hook massacre. The factors allowing these rampages are no mystery: loopholes in the background check laws, straw purchases, restrictions on law enforcement, and gaps in our mental health system. Dozens of legislative proposals that address these factors have been introduced and await consideration. But despite wake-up call after wake-up call, a shameful tradition of Congressional inaction continues. Gun violence has affected constituents in every Congressional district, and as their representatives, Members of Congress deserve the opportunity to vote on bills that would address this epidemic. Congressional silence is not a sign of respect, but rather an institutional indictment. We must right this wrong. You must allow a vote on substantive legislation to address gun violence. Sincerely, ###
06.20.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement on the Obama Administration’s decision to extend more benefits to same-sex couples, regardless of if they live in states that recognize same-sex marriage or not. These actions follow last year's U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act¸ ending the ban on federal benefits for legally married same-sex couples: “The Supreme Court made clear that same-sex couples have equal rights to federal marriage benefits. Today’s actions move us closer to the day when all people – no matter whom they love and marry, or where they live – are treated equally in the eyes of the law. “However, too many benefits are still denied to too many same-sex couples. Full equality for all American families shouldn’t have to wait on the courts. It’s time for the House Majority to bring the Respect for Marriage Act to the floor for a vote, and ensure marriage equality for all couples.” Today, the Obama Administration announced that the Department of Labor was beginning the process to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act to same-sex couples. This would allow legally married same-sex couples to take unpaid leave from work to care for a sick spouse, regardless of if they live in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. The Department of Justice has also announced that it has completed its review of federal benefits and found that almost all federal benefits will be provided to same-sex couples, whether or not they live in a state that recognizes same-sex marriage. Social Security and veteran benefits cannot fully be extended to same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage without Congressional action. The Respect for Marriage Act, which Thompson co-authored, would address this issue and extend all marriage benefits to same-sex couples, regardless of where they live.

06.19.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Jared Huffman (CA-2) today announced a $2.5 million Department of Transportation Grant for Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit (SMART) train. The funds will be used for the engineering design in preparation for construction of the Larkspur Extension, which will connect the SMART rail system to the Larkspur Ferry in Marin County. “The SMART project is going to be an economic lynchpin for our entire region, and I am proud to have helped secure these important funds,” said Thompson. “With the construction of SMART, jobs will be created, communities will be connected, congestion will be reduced, commuters will have an easier time getting to work along the entire corridor, and our region will be more attractive to home buyers and businesses. This economic ripple effect will have a big impact on regional job growth for decades to come.” “SMART will take thousands of cars off our roads, reducing pollution and easing congestion on the increasingly gridlocked 101,” Huffman said. “SMART is a critical project for our environment, economy, and would be an important infrastructure investment for this region for decades to come. I’ll continue fighting in Washington to secure funding to complete it.” “We are grateful to have this federal support to move the project towards construction and we believe the regional funding support for the Larkspur Extension will encourage the federal government to help us complete construction of SMART's connection to the Larkspur Ferry,” said SMART General Manager Farhad Mansourian. The funds were originally secured for SMART in Fiscal Year (FY) 2010. In 2012, SMART received notice that the funding would lapse unless it could be utilized by the end of the fiscal year. For the funds to be utilized SMART had to be accepted into the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) New Starts/Small Starts program. To address this issue, Thompson led a letter with former Rep. Lynn Woolsey to the FTA urging them to preserve this funding until SMART was accepted into the FTA’s New Starts/Small Starts Program and could execute the grant. SMART was accepted into the New Starts/Small Starts program in September 2013 and has since completed the preliminary work that now enables them to utilize this funding. SMART is constructing a 43-mile, locally funded rail project between Downtown San Rafael and the Sonoma County Airport north of Santa Rosa, with revenue service anticipated to begin in late 2016.

06.17.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today issued the following statement after the Supreme Court upheld a federal law in Abramski v. U.S. that makes it a crime for one person to buy a gun with the purpose of transferring the gun to another person while lying to the dealer about the final owner of the firearm. “Today, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a commonsense law that helps keep guns away from those we all agree shouldn’t have them. Criminals, domestic abusers, and those with a history of serious mental illness should not be able to send a straw person into a gun store to pass a background check and buy a firearm on their behalf. This practice exploits a loophole in our criminal background check system and the court was right to keep it closed. “However, closing other major loopholes in our background check system requires action from Congress. Right now, those same prohibited purchasers who seek out a straw person to buy their guns can just as easily go online or drive to a gun show and get a gun with no questions asked. That’s why we need to pass legislation that requires background checks for all commercial gun sales.” In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that purchasing a gun with the intent to sell it to someone else is an illegal attempt to evade the Brady law, which requires that the actual buyer of a gun undergo a background check. Such actions, known as “straw purchases,” could allow prohibited purchasers to have another person pass a background check and buy a gun on their behalf. Thompson is a co-author of H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). Nearly 190 House members have cosponsored the bill. H.R. 1565 expands the existing background check system to require comprehensive and enforceable background checks for all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads.

06.16.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today issued the following statement after the White House announced that President Obama issued an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity: “Today, President Obama issued an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors on the basis of sexual orientation. The president’s action is an important step towards true equality for everyone, regardless of whom they love. Now it’s time for the House Majority to bring the bipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act to the floor for a vote, and end discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in all workplaces.” The Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) passed the U.S. Senate in November 2013 and currently has 205 bipartisan cosponsors, including Thompson, in the U.S. House of Representatives. The ENDA would establish basic protections in the workplace to prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. ENDA would provide a basic level of protection against workplace discrimination and would apply to private employers as well as local, state, and federal government employers. On March 18th, 2014 Thompson joined colleagues in the House and Senate in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to ban federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans. The executive order issued today does what the letter requested. The full text of the letter is below. March 18, 2014 The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to fulfill the promise in your State of the Union address to make this a “year of action” and build upon the momentum of 2013 by signing an executive order banning federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) Americans. As you have said before, “now is the time to end this kind of discrimination, not enable it.” As we continue to work towards final passage of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) with strong bipartisan support, we urge you to take action now to protect millions of workers across the country from the threat of discrimination simply because of who they are or who they love. We are committed to doing all that we can in Congress to get ENDA to your desk this year; however, there is no reason you cannot immediately act by taking this important step. This executive order would provide LGBT people with another avenue in the federal government they could turn to if they were the victim of employment discrimination by a federal contractor. When it combined with ENDA, these non-discrimination protections would be parallel to those that have been in place for decades on the basis of race, sex and religion. An executive order covering LGBT employees would be in line with a bipartisan, decades-long commitment to eradicating taxpayer-funded discrimination in the workplace. IN 1941, President Roosevelt prohibited discrimination in defense contracts on the bases of race, creed, color, or national origin. In subsequent executive orders, Presidents Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson expanded these protections to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not used to discriminate. In addition, most of the largest government contractors- companies like Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed Martin- have LGBT non-discrimination policies in place. They adopted them because business leaders recognize that discrimination is bad for the bottom line. Finally, time is of the essence. Even with an executive order in place, full implementation of these protections will require regulations to be developed and finalized, a process that will take many months, if not longer, to fully put in place. Issuing an executive order prohibiting discrimination against LGBT workers in federal contracts would build on the significant progress for LGBT rights made during your time as President and would further your legacy as a champion for LGBT equality. We urge you to act now to prevent irrational, taxpayer-funded workplace discrimination against LGBT Americans.

06.12.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $376,423 U.S. Education Department (ED) grant for Mendocino-Lake Community College. The grant comes from the ED’s College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP). “Everyone, regardless of who they are or where they’re from should have access to an affordable education,” said Thompson. “That’s why I am a proud supporter of these grants that help seasonal workers and their children get the education they need to start or further a successful career. Congratulations to Mendocino-Lake Community College on their success.” The College Assistance Migrant Program assists students who are migratory or seasonal farmworkers (or children of such workers) enrolled in their first year of undergraduate studies at an Institution of Higher Education (IHE). The funding supports completion of the first year of studies. The program serves approximately 2,000 CAMP participants annually. Specifically, the funding is used for outreach to persons who are eligible, counseling, tutoring, skills workshops, financial aid stipends, health services, and housing assistance. Additionally, follow-up services are provided to participants after their first year.

06.11.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Jared Huffman (CA-2) today passed an amendment in the U.S. House of Representatives that would provide the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) with $1 million in additional resources to protect our nation’s food supply and help the OIG conduct more efficient investigations into food recalls, like the recall at Rancho Feeding in Sonoma County. The amendment, which is fully paid for, was offered to H.R. 4800, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2015. “With the Rancho recall, I witnessed firsthand the need for USDA’s inspectors to have more resources so they can conduct better and more efficient investigations,” said Thompson. “From the beginning of the Rancho recall, public safety has been our number one concern. We can’t let food get out that puts the health and safety of the American public at risk. That is why it is important that the Office of Inspector General has sufficient resources so they can do their job and ensure our food is safe. This amendment provides them with that support.” “The Rancho recall clearly demands a serious investigation. Many of my ranching constituents are facing serious financial losses and they can’t get any information from USDA about what happened. We have more information from CNN than we have gotten from USDA—this is completely unacceptable,” said Huffman. “The public has a right to know what happened, how the process broke down, and who will be held responsible for it. Our amendment ensures the USDA Inspector General’s office has the resources needed to swiftly complete the investigation, close the case, and ensure we get answers so we can prevent this from happening again. In February, Rancho Feeding, a Sonoma County based slaughterhouse, recalled all 8.7 million pounds of beef it processed in 2013. The USDA was slow to share information about the nature of the recall and what would happen to the beef already processed by Rancho. The recall put jobs, businesses, and livelihoods at risk, and the length of the USDA investigation, coupled with the lack of information, increased uncertainty for business and consumers. Specifically, Thompson and Huffman’s amendment transfers $1 million from the USDA Departmental Administration account to the USDA OIG. These resources will help ensure that the OIG, the office tasked with ensuring the integrity of USDA operations, has the support it needs from Congress to do its job and ensure our food is safe.

06.11.2014	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today that his office is accepting applications from those ages 17-23 who are interested in attending the four service academies requiring nominations: United States Air Force Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, United States Military Academy at West Point, and the United States Naval Academy. The fifth service academy, the Coast Guard Academy, does not require a nomination. "One of the highest honors I have as a Representative in Congress is getting to annually nominate exceptional candidates from our community to the service academies,” said Thompson. “If offered appointments by the academies, these young men and women will receive both a world class education and the skills they will need to become tomorrow’s military leaders.” Eligible candidates must be at least 17 years old, but younger than 23, in the year of their admission to the academy, a United States citizen, unmarried, and a resident of California’s 5th Congressional District. Application documents must be requested from Thompson's office by September 15th, 2014 and returned by October 1st, 2014. Interested applicants should contact Thompson’s Santa Rosa District Office at CA05ServiceAcademy@mail.house.gov or 707-542-7182 for an application packet and further information.

06.10.2014	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon today testified in front of the House Committee on Natural Resources’ Subcommittee on Water and Power in support of Thompson’s bipartisan legislation to transfer management of recreation at Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). “BLM is the agency best suited to manage recreational activities at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “This management transfer has broad support both in Congress and in our local community. We need to pass this bill and begin working with BLM, BOR and the county on a smooth management transfer, and with BLM on a successful redevelopment plan.” “I strongly support this legislation because Lake Berryessa is an important regional recreation destination, which generates tourism critical to the local economy," said Dillon. “I have worked more than a decade trying to solve problems and improve the situation with the Bureau of Reclamation at Lake Berryessa. However, BOR’s strength lies in their management of water resources. BLM is much better suited to manage this vast recreational and resort area." At the hearing, Tom Iseman, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Water and Science at the Department of the Interior testified on behalf of the Obama Administration in support of the legislation to transfer the management of Lake Berryessa from BOR to BLM. Thompson’s bill, H.R. 4166, now has 225 co-authors, seven more than is needed to pass the House. BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would: Transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Bureau of Land Management; Direct the Department of the Interior to develop a comprehensive management plan ; and Allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the Dam Video of Thompson testimony can be seen here.

06.09.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Legislation authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) to improve the security at American embassies passed the U.S. House of Representatives as part of H.R. 4681, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015. Studies since the Benghazi attack in 2012 have identified the need for security personnel at U.S. diplomatic posts to receive threat information from the Intelligence Community in a timely manner so that they can request and receive security enhancements as needed. Thompson’s legislation will address this need by helping enhance information sharing. “We have a responsibility to protect all Americans serving our country overseas,” said Thompson. “Since the Benghazi attack in 2012, we’ve spent far too much time playing politics and creating scandals, and far too little time discussing what needs to be done to help make our embassies safer. Studies have shown we need to improve communication between our Intelligence Community and our diplomatic outposts, and this amendment will help us do just that.” Making sure security personnel at U.S. diplomatic posts receive threat information from the Intelligence Community in a timely manner requires excellent information sharing and communication between the Intelligence and Diplomatic Security communities. Thompson’s legislation directs the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide an assessment of the status of threat information sharing between the Intelligence Community and diplomatic security personnel, and to propose remedial action to help make sure security personnel at U.S. embassies can request and receive security enhancements in a timely manner. The classified report from the DNI will be submitted to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. H.R. 4681 passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 345-59. It now goes to the Senate for their consideration.

06.05.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Legislation authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) to enhance rail and refinery security passed the U.S. House of Representatives as part of H.R. 4681, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015. Thompson’s legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis (DHS I&A) to conduct an intelligence assessment of the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail infrastructure, and to make any recommendations it deems appropriate to protect surrounding communities or the infrastructure itself from potential harm. “Public safety is the number one priority when we’re transporting and holding crude oil and other cargo through and in our communities,” said Thompson. “This legislation will let us know if threats exist and how we can fix them.” Thompson’s legislation requires the DHS I&A to conduct an intelligence assessment of the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail transportation infrastructure. After the assessment is conducted, DHS I&A must submit the results of its assessment to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, along with any recommendations it has to improve the security of domestic oil refineries and related rail transportation infrastructure to protect the communities surrounding such refineries or such infrastructure from potential harm. Improved reporting will help officials better assess the types of threats our nation's oil refineries and rail yards face, so that such threats can be mitigated. Many trains transporting crude oil from the Bakken Shale formation of North Dakota run through Thompson’s congressional district. The crude oil from this region is regarded as highly flammable and this legislation will help make sure it is transported safely. H.R. 4681 passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 345-59. It now goes to the Senate for their consideration.

06.04.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1,009,000 Small Business Administration (SBA) business loan for VJB Vineyard & Cellars. The SBA loan was used as part of the project financing of the VJB Vineyard & Cellars’ facilities, including final improvements that were completed in time for the summer tourist season. “Low interest SBA loans help small businesses grow and create jobs,” said Thompson. “In the Sonoma Valley, small businesses and our wine community are the backbone of our economy. I am proud to support these SBA loans and congratulate VJB Vineyard & Cellars on their success.” “This SBA loan helped our family complete a wonderful project that has been in the works since 2005,” said Henry R. Belmonte, Proprietor and President of VJB Vineyards & Cellars. “We thank Congressman Thompson for supporting these loans and for his steadfast support of the Sonoma Valley wine community.” The loan comes though Bay Area Development Company, a privately funded company that is licensed by the SBA to assist local small and mid-sized businesses to expand. The type of SBA financing received by VJB Vineyard & Cellars is designed to target successful, locally owned companies that are seeking to make a substantial business expansion. Companies are provided with financing that has a fixed low interest rate and lower down payment than is available through conventional financing. As a result, the companies are able to grow faster and create more jobs. VJB Vineyard & Cellars, located on Highway 12 in the heart of the village of Kenwood, began in 1999 as a partnership between two brothers, Victor and Henry Belmonte. Initially making wine for their family-owned restaurant, the concept evolved to a small production project focused on Italian varietals from California.

06.04.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $3,087,565 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) grant for Santa Rosa Community Health Centers (SRCHC). The grant will help SRCHC provide effective, responsive, culturally-appropriate solutions to community health needs for the populations served by SRCHC. “A person’s access to quality, affordable health care should not be dependent on where they live, how much money they make, or whether or not they have health insurance,” said Thompson. “The committed, hard-working people at SRCHC make sure that if someone needs care, they get care. I am proud to support their work, and will continue doing everything I can to make sure they have the resources they need to serve our community.” Naomi Fuchs, Chief Executive Officer at SRCHC, says, “We are grateful for the Federal funding that ensures our doors are open to everyone in need, regardless of their ability to pay. SRCHC is a critical resource for over 42,000 people struggling with barriers to health posed by poverty, lack of insurance, transportation, culture, education, and homelessness. Without this ongoing support from the federal government, we simply could not continue to reduce the prevalent health disparities in our community.” Specifically, funding from the grant helps cover operational costs such as: Staff who provide essential primary health services Care, programs, and services for uninsured patients Outreach and enrollment efforts Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.02.2014	Washington, DC—U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and James Lankford (R-Ok) led a group of 111 bipartisan Members of the House of Representatives in sending House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp (R-Mich.) a letter asking the Chairman to reconsider proposed changes to the “last in, first out,” (LIFO) business accounting measures in the House’s final proposal to overhaul our nation’s federal tax code. “Repealing LIFO will have a devastating impact on businesses across our districts and country,” said Thompson. “The purpose of comprehensive tax reform should be to create jobs, make things simpler for people and businesses, and get our fiscal house in order. Ending LIFO will have the opposite effect. It will put people in the communities I represent out of work, punish businesses who have depended on this type of accounting for 70 years, increase their tax burden, and cause further economic uncertainty.” Currently, American companies with inventories that increase in value as it sits in storage can elect to use the accepted accounting method called “last in, first out” or LIFO. LIFO allows a company to use the cost of producing the newest unit in their inventory as opposed to the oldest when determining the profit of a single sale, which compensates for inflation. Companies electing to use LIFO are liable for changes in pricing; should the cost of producing the most recent unit decrease, they must continue to use LIFO and report the larger profit margin. The Camp proposal retroactively implements the “first in, first out” or FIFO method over four years. As a result, companies currently using LIFO will incur a tax liability on the historic difference between using the LIFO method or using the FIFO method. Because these businesses were using an IRS-approved accounting method, many likely did not factor into their business plans a tax bill arising from a retroactive change in the tax code. Shouldering such costs could jeopardize the existence of some of these businesses and the jobs they support. “I applaud Chairman Camp and his Committee’s work to overhaul our nation’s broken 72,000+-page tax code. However, as we make much needed tax reforms, we must also ensure we do not unfairly penalize companies that followed the previous tax rules," said Lankford. “Many American industries use the ‘last in, first out’ accounting method as a way to free up capital to hire new employees and keep their companies running on a predictable schedule. A provision in Chairman Camp’s tax reform proposal would retroactively punish companies that have legally utilized this method for years to handle their accounting,” “I do not believe it was Chairman Camp’s intent to saddle these companies with added tax burden, despite the fact that they have utilized the legal LIFO accounting method for years. I join this esteemed group of Members to ask Chairman Camp to remove this provision from our House tax reform proposal to ensure we do not unduly punish hard-working businesses with yet another problem in our tax code. Rep. Thompson and I are grateful to be joined by so many of our colleagues on this letter to Chairman Camp. We will continue to protect the hardworking employees and industries in our respective states who need real tax reform,” concluded Lankford. A full copy of the letter is below. Dear Chairman Camp: As we share your desire for comprehensive tax reform, we commend you for putting forth a proposal and for continuing to advance the discussions on tax reform. Like you, we believe that reforms are key to our long-term economic growth and global competiveness. After reviewing the proposal in more detail, we would like to take this opportunity to share our concerns with the proposed repeal of “last-in, first-out” (LIFO) accounting and the negative impacts it will have on the businesses in our districts and, consequently, the local, regional and U.S. economy. LIFO is a legitimate and longstanding accounting methodology. It is not a “loophole,” “subsidy,” or tax expenditure; rather, LIFO is a widely accepted and utilized inventory accounting method that has been part of the U.S. tax code for more than 70 years. A wide array of businesses, both small and large, use LIFO because they sell products produced from raw materials or feedstock that generally rise in price over time and because it best matches the replacement cost of goods with the revenue from inventory that is sold. This helps businesses such as manufacturers, retailers, wholesale distributors, and car and equipment dealers generate after-tax income that is reinvested in the purchase of replacement inventory, a cycle that is necessary for the company to remain in business. We also have deep concerns with the retroactive nature of your repeal proposal and the adverse economic impact this will have on LIFO users, even with the applied transition rules and the proposed lower corporate rate. As you know, companies that use LIFO have a “reserve” that reflects the difference between current values of inventories and their historic costs, which for many companies has been accumulated over several decades. Under the proposal, these reserves would be recaptured and taxes would be owed and paid over a four year period, which -- in substance and in form -- is an unprecedented retroactive tax increase. While the proposed transition rule and lower statutory rates attempt to lessen the economic and administrative burden of reserve recapture, they do not sufficiently mitigate the measureable harm that would be caused by repeal. LIFO reserves are not cash accounts or liquid assets. In fact, the savings generated from using LIFO are reinvested in replacement inventory. Therefore, repealing LIFO and retroactively taxing the reserves will divert operating cash flows away from productive operations and investments and result in negative economic consequences on jobs and economic growth, especially for small and mid-size businesses. No contemplated transition or reduction in rates would be sufficient to offset the overall economic and administrative cost of repeal. We applaud your efforts to improve our tax system to spur job creation and economic growth. However, as stated above, repealing LIFO runs counter to these central tax reform goals. We therefore urge you to remove LIFO repeal from the tax reform proposal. We thank you for considering our request and look forward to working with you and the Committee to advance a tax proposal that is fair, simple, and promotes economic growth and competiveness. Sincerely, Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

06.02.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced seven appointments from California’s Fifth Congressional District to the service academies. Congress has partnered with 4 of our 5 service academies (Air Force, Army, Navy and Merchant Marine) for more than 150 years to nominate candidates for admission. The fifth service academy, the Coast Guard Academy, does not require a nomination. “Appointing talented and bright young men and women to the service academies is one of the highest honors I have as an elected representative,” said Thompson. “Our appointees are patriots. They will receive the finest education our country has to offer, they will learn leadership and command skills, and they will be taught the skills needed to become tomorrow’s military leaders.” A panel selects the appointees to ensure they are selected on nothing other than merit. Less than 1/3 of the applicants who apply to our academies are admitted. It is very selective and those that are chosen are truly the elite. This year’s appointees include: Air Force Nolan King, Napa, CA. King is an AP scholar, Civil Air Patrol cadet, airman, USAF auxiliary, and Boys State nominee. Evan Richter, Santa Rosa, CA. Richter is currently on a religious mission. He had previously been appointed to the Air Force and took religious leave. Richter had to re-apply to return to the Air Force, and the Air Force offered him another appointment. Army Adam Van Prooyen, Santa Rosa, CA. Van Prooyen was offered two appointments U.S. Air force and WestPoint. He participates in the Model UN, is a Boy Scout, participated in the WestPoint Summer Experience, was on the Principal’s honor roll from 2010-2013, and is an AP scholar. His grandfather served in the Army in Vietnam and his father served in Bosnia and Iraq after 9/11. Both his father and grandfather graduated from West Point. David Weinmann, Hercules, CA. Weinmann is proficient in Spanish, he participate in summer camps at both West Point and the Naval Academy, and has received numerous athletic awards. Navy Madeline Farr, Martinez, CA. Farr is proficient in Spanish and Arabic, and plays water polo. Farr’s grandfather is a retired chief from the Navy and her father served in the Marine Corp. Emiliano Tabarsi, Vallejo, CA.

05.30.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today introduced the Promoting Healthy Minds for Safer Communities Act of 2014, major mental health and domestic violence legislation aimed at reducing and preventing gun violence. The legislation provides resources for mental health crisis intervention services; closes the gaps in current federal gun policy by clarifying and expanding existing federal prohibitors; provides states with the tools needed to strengthen and enforce gun violence prevention laws; and improves records reporting into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). “While those suffering from mental illness are far more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violent crimes, we must also recognize that improving our mental health system is an essential component of reducing and preventing gun violence,” said Thompson. “This bill strengthens and improves intervention efforts, gives law enforcement additional tools to enforce laws and keep guns away from those who shouldn’t have them, and it improves the submission of mental health records into the criminal background check system. While no one law or set of laws can end gun violence, by taking these steps – and requiring background checks on all commercial gun sales – we can make our communities safer and prevent more shootings while respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.” The Promoting Healthy Minds for Safer Communities Act of 2014 helps keep guns away from those who are determined to pose a danger to themselves or others. The legislation prohibits the purchase or possession of a firearm by individuals subject to involuntary outpatient commitment if a court finds they pose a significant and dangerous threat to themselves or others. Current federal law has been interpreted to apply only to inpatient commitments. Recognizing that states play an important role in preventing gun violence and ensuring safe communities, the legislation strengthens federal and state partnerships by providing grants to states to strengthen gun violence prevention laws that prohibit individuals with dangerous risk factors from possessing firearms. For example, states could: Create laws that enable law enforcement to petition for a warrant to temporarily remove firearms when there is probable cause to believe that an individual poses an imminent risk of harm to self or others. The process by which a warrant is obtained and a gun is removed must be consistent with due process; and Create laws that temporarily prohibit the purchase and possession of a gun after an involuntary hospitalization on an emergency basis due to serious mental illness. The Promoting Healthy Minds for Safer Communities Act of 2014 prohibits the purchase or possession of a firearm by individuals convicted of misdemeanor stalking. It also expands the definition of intimate partners and expands the scope of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence to include dating partners, children, grandparents, grandchildren, and siblings. This allows people in these categories to be protected under current domestic violence laws that prohibit domestic abusers from purchasing or possessing firearms. Current law only protects current and former spouses, people who have or are co-habiting, people who share a child; parents; and guardians from domestic abusers who own guns. Thompson’s bill also establishes a minimum restoration standard, ensuring a fair restoration process of firearm ownership rights that balances public safety with individuals’ rights. One year after an individual’s involuntary commitment ends, they may petition the court to have their rights restored. The application must be accompanied by a clinical opinion of a psychiatrist or psychologist. After considering a variety of factors, the judge would determine if restoring gun ownership rights is compatible with the public interest. Finally, Promoting Healthy Minds for Safer Communities Act of 2014 includes measures to strengthen and improve intervention efforts, boost mental health research, enhance information sharing and research on gun violence, and improve the submission of mental health records into the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm. Thompson’s task force included making improvements to our mental health system in their policy principles release in February 2013. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
05.29.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – A bipartisan amendment authored by U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Pete King (R-NY), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), Joe Heck (R-NV), Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Mike Quigley (D-IL) to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS) passed the U.S. House of Representatives today by a vote of 260-145-1. The amendment provides an additional $19.5 million to help states improve their submissions into the criminal background checks system, bringing NICS funding for Fiscal Year 2015 to $78 million. Thompson offered the amendment on the Floor last night. “Our national criminal background check system is only as good as the data you put in it, and right now all the information isn’t getting into the system,” said the six Representatives in a joint statement. “When this happens, we can’t enforce the law, and criminals, domestic abusers, or dangerously mentally ill individuals who otherwise wouldn't pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. Our bipartisan amendment addresses this dangerous shortfall of information by providing states with the resources they need to get their records into the criminal background checks system.” Every day the background checks system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm, is missing valuable information. Because of this, dangerous people who otherwise wouldn't pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. A recent USA Today report found that in just five states, records for at least 2.5 million fugitives weren’t entered into the NICS system. According to a recent report by Everytown, 12 states have still submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the NICS system. According to the Department of Justice, six states have fewer than 30 total records each in the NICS system in all prohibited categories combined. Last year, Congress increased funding to almost $59 million. However, $20 million in requests from states went unfunded. This bipartisan amendment, which is fully paid for, provides states with increased funding to ensure the background checks system has complete and timely information to keep firearms out of the hands of individuals who should not possess guns. The amendment was included as part of H.R. 4660, the FY 2015 Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. The amendment is supported by Everytown for Gun Safety, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, Sandy Hook Promise, Third Way, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, the National Education Association, Americans for Responsible Solutions, the National Parent Teacher Association, the Union for Reform Judaism, the Washington Office on Latin America, States United to Prevent Gun Violence, Moms Rising, and the American Federation of Teachers. # # #
05.28.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today offered a bipartisan amendment with U.S. Reps. Pete King (R-NY), Elizabeth Esty (D-CT), Joe Heck (R-NV), Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA) and Mike Quigley (D-IL) to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS). The amendment provides an additional $19.5 million to help states improve their submissions into the criminal background checks system, brining NICS funding for Fiscal Year 2015 to $78 million. The amendment will be voted on tomorrow. Every day, the background checks system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), the database used to determine whether or not a prospective buyer is eligible to buy a firearm, is missing valuable information. Because of this, dangerous people who otherwise wouldn't pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. The text of Thompson’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman. “And thank you Mr. Wolf for all your years of outstanding service to this fine institution. “I rise in support of the bipartisan Thompson-King-Esty-Heck-Fitzpatrick-Quigley amendment to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System. “Everyone agrees that we don’t want criminals, domestic abusers, or the dangerously mentally ill getting guns. And the first step in stopping this is through background checks. “But the background check system is only as good as the data you put in it. And right now, all the information isn’t getting in. When the information doesn’t get into the system, we can’t enforce the law, and dangerous people who otherwise wouldn't pass a background check can slip through the cracks and buy guns. “A recent USA Today report found that in just five states, records for at least 2.5 million fugitives weren’t entered into the NICS system. “6 states have fewer than 30 total records in the NICS system. “And12 states have submitted fewer than 100 mental health records to the NICS system. When states fail to submit these records, there is nothing to stop a dangerously mentally ill person from passing a background check and buying a gun. This is exactly what happened at Virginia Tech. “My bipartisan amendment will address this dangerous shortfall. It provides an additional $19.5 million to help states improve their submissions into the criminal background checks system. It will bring NICS grant funding to $78 million. “Many people on both sides of the aisle have already supported funding at levels much higher than this. After the Virginia Tech shooting, Congress unanimously enacted legislation that authorized DOJ to provide up to nearly $190 million per year to help states improve submissions into the NICS system. “The NRA supported it too. Wayne LaPierre said, ‘Our members don't want mental defectives and criminals buying handguns, we supported the background checks and support the money to make it work effectively.’ “But since the unanimous passage of this NICS improvement legislation, Congress hasn’t come close to appropriating these funds. “In FY2013, Congress appropriated just $18 million. “Last year, we started moving in the right direction. We increased funding to almost $59 million. While this was a good bump, it wasn’t enough – because also last year, almost $20 million in requests from states went unfunded. “Our states need more resources to get all their information into the NICS system. If we give them these resources, we can stop dangerous people from getting guns. And we can save lives. “Everyday our background checks system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. “But millions of dangerous purchasers could be passing background checks when they shouldn't be – all because states don’t have the money they need to get records into the criminal background check system. “Mr. Chairman, this is dangerous. We can only stop criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill from getting guns if their information is in the system. “So let’s pass this amendment. Let’s give our states the resources they need to keep people safe.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.23.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Northern California Lawmakers issued a strong warning today in response to emergency drought legislation passed by the U.S. Senate. From U.S. Reps. George Miller (CA-11), Mike Thompson (CA-5), Doris O. Matsui (CA-6), Jerry McNerney (CA-9), John Garamendi (CA-3), Jared Huffman (CA-2) and Ami Bera (CA-7): “Senator Feinstein’s effort to produce workable solutions to California’s vexing water shortages is admirable. However, we remain deeply opposed to a provision of the Senate-passed legislation that could devastate the Bay-Delta ecosystem and the communities that depend on it. Unfortunately, this bill can only get worse through conference with House Republicans. The House Majority has already demonstrated their willingness to override state water law and environmental protections in the Delta. For this reason, we strongly caution our Senate colleagues from accepting any aspects of the destructive Valadao-Nunes bill, which does not provide any solutions to end water shortages, will irreparably damage the Bay-Delta, degrade drinking water quality and cost our state thousands of jobs. California needs to move toward sustainable water operations for the entire state not just one part.” # # #
05.23.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) joined 127 of his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives this week in calling on the Social Security Administration to extend Social Security marriage benefits to all same-sex spouses joined in civil unions, registered domestic partnerships, or marriages in states that do not recognize marriage equality. The Social Security Administration is currently withholding benefits from same-sex couples in civil unions and registered domestic partnerships, as well as married same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages. “No matter where a same-sex couple lives or what their union may be called, they are entitled to the same benefits as any married couple,” said Thompson. “The Supreme Court was absolutely right to strike down the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. Now we must continue working to make sure the rights and benefits of marriage are guaranteed for all American spouses.” In 2013, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Windsor that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman, was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. However, the Windsor decision provided little guidance as to the status of legally married couples who live in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages. As a result, the Social Security Administration has put on hold survivor benefit applications from same-sex spouses who live in states that do not recognize gay marriage. The full text of the letter signed by Thompson is below. May 22, 2014 The Honorable Carolyn W. Colvin Acting Commissioner Social Security Administration 6401 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21235 Dear Ms. Colvin: We write to urge the Social Security Administration (SSA) to take all necessary steps to end the unconstitutional discrimination currently preventing many same-sex couples from obtaining the Social Security spousal benefits they have earned. In United States v. Windsor, the Supreme Court ruled Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act—defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman—unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Following the ruling, the SSA released a statement encouraging individuals in same-sex marriages and other legal same-sex relationships to apply for benefits. While we appreciate that SSA is approving claims for couples and surviving spouses residing in states, at the time of application, that recognize marriage for same-sex couples, this approach leaves out many who have worked to earn benefits for their spouses and families. Same-sex couples in civil unions and registered domestic partnerships, as well as married same-sex couples living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriages, have their applications held, effectively denying them the spouse-based Social Security benefits they have earned. This discrimination is simply unacceptable. Although Social Security benefits are modest—for example, the average survivor’s benefit is just $1,221 per month—nearly two-thirds of elderly beneficiaries rely on Social Security for the majority of their income. For more than one-third of elderly beneficiaries, Social Security provides at least 90 percent of their income. This income is especially important for same-sex couples. According to the Williams Institute at UCLA, lesbians who are 65 or older are twice as likely to be poor as heterosexual married couples. The same report indicates that gay male couples over 65 also have higher poverty rates than their heterosexual counterparts. Furthermore, it is also important to note that the harm from this discriminatory policy extends beyond the same-sex couples who are denied the benefits they have earned. For example, for married same-sex couples currently living in states that recognize marriage equality, their fundamental freedom to choose to live anywhere in the United States—to accept a promotion or to be near family—is unfairly restricted by the threat of denied benefits. Should they change their residence before applying for benefits, they risk losing the Social Security protections they have earned. SSA is required to base determinations for spouse-based benefits on how “the courts of the State” where the applicant resides would assess spousal status. However, SSA also recognizes spousal status if the applicant is “deemed” a spouse by SSA in circumstances where the applicant “would, under the laws applied by such courts in determining the devolution of intestate personal property, have the same status with respect to the taking of such property as a wife, husband, widow or widower of such insured individual.” As extensive case law has demonstrated, states have frequently recognized particular attributes of marital relationships, such as the right to inherit property, even when the union is explicitly prohibited by state law. Additionally, United States v. Windsor confirmed that equal protection principles compel the federal government to respect the valid marriages of same-sex couples. In light of this ruling, SSA has the responsibility to rely on its own assessment of how to properly uphold the constitutional rights of those married to someone of the same sex. Numerous federal district courts have ruled that a state’s refusal to respect validly certified out-of-state marriages of same-sex couples is in violation of the equal protection principles upheld in United States v. Windsor. Based upon our examination of Social Security statutes and court precedent, we believe it is clear that same-sex couples joined in marriage, civil unions and registered domestic partnerships should be deemed eligible for spouse-based benefits, regardless of where they live. While it is disappointing that it is only due to the failure of Congress to act upon the Respect for Marriage Act that these extraordinary efforts are necessary, we urge SSA to take all steps within its authority to end discrimination regarding the approval of spouse-based benefits. We appreciate the extensive and ongoing effort that you and your agency have undertaken to reduce discrimination against same-sex couples, and we thank you for your consideration and your attention to this important issue.

05.23.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day which will be observed on Monday, May 26th: “Memorial Day is a day of remembrance. It is a day for families to remember the loved ones they lost. It is a day for servicemembers to remember their friends who fell next to them in battle. It is a day for our nation to remember the high cost of freedom – that those we honor were someone’s child, someone’s partner, someone’s parent. “On this Memorial Day, let us remember those in the Army, Navy, Air Force, Coastguard, Marines, Merchant Mariners, and members of our intelligence community who have given their lives for us. "And let us honor them the best way we know how – by taking care of the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, and fellow soldiers they left behind. That care starts by cleaning up the mess that we’re seeing unfold at the VA. It’s unacceptable, it’s deplorable, and it must be fixed. “Finally, let us all pray for peace – for the day when war is not a reality, but a far-distant memory.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.22.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today voted to pass an amended version of bipartisan H.R. 3361, the USA Freedom Act. Like the bipartisan Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reform legislation co-authored by Thompson, the amended version of the USA Freedom Act ends the bulk collection of call detail records (telephone metadata). H.R. 3361 passed by a bipartisan vote of 303-121. “Our government has a responsibility to protect people’s civil liberties and our national security, and this legislation does both,” said Thompson. “It ends the government’s bulk collection of metadata, it strengthens oversight and improves accountability of our intelligence community, and it allows our intelligence community to continue their brave work to keep Americans safe.” Under H.R. 3361, in order to access the data, which is already held by the telecom companies, the government must get approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). In order to obtain approval from the FISC to access the data, the government must show there is a reasonable articulable suspicion that the call detail records sought are “relevant to an authorized investigation,” and “protect against international terrorism.” This pre-judicial FISC review is required for each individually-targeted call detail record. In emergency situations, the legislation permits the Attorney General to authorize the emergency production of call detail records. In these cases an application must be presented to the FISC within seven days. If the FISC denies the application, the government cannot use the results of the production in any proceeding before a court, agency, legislative committee or any other government entity except in instances of threats of death or seriously bodily harm. Also included in the legislation is H.R. 3103, Thompson’s bipartisan Intelligence Oversight and Accountability Act of 2013. Thompson’s provision requires that any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) decision, order or opinion that includes a denial of an IC request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) be shared with Congress. Currently, when the FISC or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review issues a decision, order, or opinion, the Attorney General (AG) must determine if the issue considered by the FISC includes a “significant construction or interpretation of the law.” If the AG determines that the decision is significant, that information must be shared with Congress. However, if the AG determines that the decision is not “significant,” the AG is not required to share the information with Congress. Removing discretionary elements regarding what Congress should and should not receive from the FISC, will increase the Congressional oversight of Intelligence Community tools and programs to ensure their proper use. H.R. 3361 now goes to the Senate for their consideration. The Obama Administration released a Statement of Administration Policy saying it “strongly supports” the legislation.

05.21.2014	Washington, DC - U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1.9 million National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contract for Mare Island Dry Docks, LLC. The contract is for the dry docking and ship repairs of the RONALD H. BROWN research vessel and will create 45 to 50 jobs on the island. “This is another economic win to Solano County, the City of Vallejo, and Mare Island" said Thompson. "The acquisition of the RONALD H. BROWN contract is another big step towards Mare Island reclaiming its status as a center of economic activity in the Bay Area." The ship is named in honor of Ron Brown, the late Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce, who died in a plane crash while on an official trade mission to Croatia. The ship was commissioned in 1997 to support NOAA’s oceanic and atmospheric research projects. “We are honored to have the opportunity to work on the Ronald H. Brown research vessel,” said Christina Snyder, Executive Vice President of Mare Island Dry Dock LLC. “More importantly, we feel privileged to be a part of the effort to renew Mare Island.” Thompson is committed to securing opportunities to increase shipping traffic in the Strait and maritime commerce in the region. The NOAA contract, on the heels of the USCG’s POLAR STAR contract, shows that the talent and the resources exist on Mare Island to achieve those goals. The RONALD H. BROWN, the largest vessel in NOAA’s fleet, is an AGOR 24 Class ship weighing 3250 tons, 274 feet in length and can travel a maximum speed of 15 knots. The ship is equipped with state-of-the-art instrumentation to study the atmosphere, including Doppler weather radar. It has 4,100 square feet of laboratories, to include a computer and electronics lab, a biochemical lab and a wet lab. One of the vessel’s most notable assignments was to respond to and assess the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. This past April, the vessel finished a mission in Chile to recover and redeploy the Stratus Ocean Reference Station, a buoy that provides ongoing climate-quality records of surface meteorology. Mare Island Dry Docks is the RONALD H. BROWN’s next port of call.

05.20.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – Three pieces of legislation authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today passed the House as part of the Conference Report on H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA). The WRRDA legislation originally passed the House on October 23rd, 2013, while the Senate passed separate WRRDA legislation, S.601, on May 15th, 2013. Leaders from both the House and Senate have been in negotiations since the legislation passed both chambers. The negotiations produced an agreement on legislation, or Conference Report, which passed the House today and is expected to pass the Senate as early as next week. The President is expected to sign the legislation into law. The legislation authored by Thompson that passed the House and will soon be signed into law includes: The requirement of a study on the impacts of invasive species A provision allowing the Contra Costa Flood Control and Water Conservation Districts to directly perform flood control and habitat restoration on the Walnut Creek Project Legislative language to speed up Russian River Habitat Restoration and prevent the construction of an unnecessary $300 million pipeline in Sonoma County “These important provisions will help counties in our district save money, restore habitats, decrease localized flooding, and prevent the spread of invasive species,” said Thompson. “I am proud to have worked to pass this legislation and look forward to seeing it passed by the Senate and signed into law soon.” Invasive Species Provision The first provision authored by Thompson and passed as part of the Conference Report requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the impacts of aquatic invasive species on federal assets and current federal spending on aquatic invasive species prevention. Aquatic invasive species pose a costly challenge to water infrastructure, fisheries, and the environment in local communities across the United States. However, this problem often only receives attention after an invasive species has become established in a new area and has begun clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, and outcompeting native species. These impacts can damage fisheries, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. For example, aquatic mussels such as quagga and zebra mussels have cost U.S. communities more than $5 billion since their introduction in the 1980's. In the 5th Congressional District, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk level for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes have been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and negatively impact the water supply for residents of Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. Walnut Creek Project Provision The second provision authored by Thompson and passed as part of the Conference Report de-authorizes a four-mile segment of the existing Walnut Creek Project, taking it out of Army Corps control. De-authorizing this four-mile segment eliminates unnecessary U.S. Army Corps bureaucracy and allows the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District to directly perform flood control and habitat restoration on the remaining 18 miles of the Walnut Creek Project. The Walnut Creek Project is a 22-mile flood control project that was previously authorized by Congress in 1960. During a recent evaluation of the project, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the entire 22-mile project does not meet their standards because four miles of the project, near the mouth of the creek, were of concern. To bring the entire 22-mile project up to standard, work would need to be done on the four miles identified by the Corps' evaluation. However, this work would likely be significantly delayed due to numerous Corps requirements to consult with various federal agencies. Because of these bureaucratic barriers in place due to Army Corps regulations, local partners cannot complete the necessary work to prevent localized flooding, restore habitats, and maintain channel depth. By removing the four-mile portion that is of concern to the Corps, Thompson's provision will allow local partners at the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District to complete their necessary work in a timely manner. Russian River Restoration Provision The third provision authored by Thompson and passed as part of the Conference Report allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue working with the Sonoma County Water Agency to enhance six miles of endangered coho salmon habitat along Dry Creek, located between Warm Springs Dam and the Russian River near Healdsburg. This restoration work is required under the Russian River Biological Opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2008 to protect coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead trout; all listed as endangered or threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. Without this provision, it is unclear if the Army Corps would carry out their responsibilities as required by the Russian River Biological Opinion, leaving the Sonoma County Water Agency solely responsible for fulfilling this work by 2016. However, the amount of work required under the biological opinion can only be achieved with the cooperation of the Army Corps. If the requirements made under the biological opinion are not met, Sonoma County would be required to build a $300 million pipeline to mitigate habit impacts. The Conference Report passed the House by a vote of 412-4.

05.15.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Jared Huffman (CA-5) today announced a $1.5 million WaterSMART grant to the North Bay Water Reuse Authority for its North Bay Water Reuse Program. This funding will help provide recycled water for agricultural, environmental, industrial, and landscape uses throughout Marin, Sonoma, and Napa counties. “There are no easy solutions to the multi-year drought facing California. Residents, business and agriculture are all responding by reducing their use of water,” said Thompson. “The North Bay Water Reuse Program represents a regional approach to find long-term solutions, including the appropriate use of recycled water. I applaud the Bureau of Reclamation and the many Cities and local districts that have partnered with the North Bay Water Reuse Authority to move this important project forward.” “Funding regional water recycling improvements like the North Bay’s program is one of the smartest ways to improve our local and regional water reliability,” said Huffman. “California is already a national leader in developing sustainable alternative water supplies, but this drought is showing us that we still have a lot of work to do. That’s why today’s funding announcement is so important.” With this funding, the North Bay Water Reuse Program, a joint authority made up of three counties and seven water and sanitation agencies, will provide recycled water for agricultural, environmental, industrial, and landscape uses throughout Marin, Sonoma, and Napa counties. Phase I of the Program includes upgrades of treatment processes and construction of storage, pipelines, and pump station facilities to distribute recycled water. Phase I also provides 3,757 acre-feet per year of tertiary treated recycled water for irrigation demands and up to 1,700 acre-feet per year of tertiary treated recycled water for Napa Salt Marsh habitat restoration. The Program reduces both reliance on local and imported surface water and groundwater supplies as well as the amount of treated effluent released to San Pablo Bay and its tributaries. “This project will provide a drought-proof source of water for farmers in southern Napa County to help alleviate severe groundwater problems,” said Napa County Supervisor Keith Caldwell. “The county’s partnership with Napa Sanitation District plus the funding from the Bureau of Reclamation will help irrigate vineyards that might otherwise go dry.” The North Bay Water Reuse Program is one of nine water and reclamation and reuse projects in California receiving a total of $20 million in funding from the Department of Interior’s WaterSMART program. “It’s gratifying to know that our hard work continues to pay off,” said Sonoma County Supervisor David Rabbitt, Chair of the North Bay Water Reuse Authority (NBWRA). “The continued support from the Bureau of Reclamation tells me that our regional approach to water reuse is working and they recognize that this really is about creating a safe, reliable and sustainable water supply for a water-scarce region.” WaterSMART is the U.S. Department of the Interior’s sustainable water initiative that uses the best available science to improve water conservation and help water resource managers identify strategies to narrow the gap between supply and demand. Since its establishment in 2010, WaterSMART has provided more than $180 million in competitively awarded funding to non-federal partners, including tribes, water districts, municipalities and universities through WaterSMART Grants and the Title XVI Program. Proposals were ranked through a published set of criteria in which points were awarded for projects that effectively stretch water supplies and contribute to water supply sustainability, address water quality concerns or benefit endangered species, incorporate the use of renewable energy or address energy efficiency, deliver water at a reasonable cost relative to other water supply options, and meet other program goals. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
05.12.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – A bipartisan majority in the U.S. House of Representatives has co-authored U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) legislation that would transfer the management of Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The bill, H.R. 4166, now has 224 co-authors, six more than is needed to pass the House. A House Committee on Natural Resources hearing has been scheduled for late May. “No matter what side of the aisle you’re on everyone agrees that our federal agencies need to be operating efficiently and effectively and that’s why a bipartisan majority in the House supports changing management at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “The management status quo at the lake isn’t working. A new course is needed and BLM is the agency best suited to manage recreation at Lake Berryessa.” BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would: Transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Bureau of Land Management; Direct the Department of the Interior to develop a comprehensive management plan ; and Allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the Dam The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. A hearing on the legislation will take place in late May. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.09.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced Carissa Nacol from ArtQuest/Santa Rosa High School in Sonoma County as the winner of the 2014 Congressional Art Competition. Nacol's artwork, titled "Frustration" will represent California's 5th Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where it will be displayed starting this June for one year. Nacol and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony on June 25th. "Our district's artists are incredibly talented and creative," said Thompson. "Every year I am highly impressed with all of the artwork that is submitted. Many thanks to everyone who participated in this year's competition, and to the parents, teachers and judges who make this annual event possible. Congratulations to Carissa. I am honored to feature her artwork in the U.S. Capitol." “We are grateful for the Congressional Art Competition which provides all students with an incredible opportunity to share their work with the public. We are delighted that Carissa's work has been selected as winner. Carissa Nacol’s work exemplifies the high level of excellence reached in the ArtQuest program here at Santa Rosa High School,” said Stefanie Nagorka, MFA, ArtQuest teacher. Nacol is in the in the ArtQuest magnet arts program at Santa Rosa High School. She was one of four regional winners chosen by local artist judges. The three other finalists were: Contra Costa: Daniel Loginov, "Carquinez Bridge", John Swett High School Napa County: Cristina Edwards, "Gaia", American Canyon High School Solano County: Ibea Castillio, "Fall Harvest", Vallejo High School The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition. Photos of each finalist's submission are below.

05.09.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence voted to pass an amended version of H.R. 3361, the USA Freedom Act, out of the Intel Committee. This amended version of the USA Freedom Act unanimously passed the House Judiciary Committee yesterday before unanimously passing the Intelligence Committee today. “Our government has a responsibility to protect people’s civil liberties and our national security, and this amended legislation does both,” said Thompson. “I look forward to working to pass this bill into law.” Like the bipartisan Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reform legislation co-authored by Thompson, the amended version of the USA Freedom Act, authored by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), ends the bulk collection of call detail records (telephone metadata). In order to access the data, which is already held by the telecom companies, the government must show there is a reasonable articulable suspicion that the call detail records sought are “relevant to an authorized investigation,” and “protect against international terrorism.” H.R. 3361 requires pre-judicial Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) review of each individually-targeted call detail record. An amendment offered by Sensenbrenner during the Judiciary Committee’s review of the legislation permits the Attorney General to authorize the emergency production of call detail records if an application is presented to the FISC within seven days. If the FISC denies the application, the Government cannot use the results of the production in any proceeding before a court, agency, legislative committee or any other Government entity except in instances of threats of death or seriously bodily harm. Also included in the legislation is H.R. 3103, Thompson’s bipartisan Intelligence Oversight and Accountability Act of 2013. H.R. 3361 now goes to the House Floor for consideration. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.07.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – A bipartisan amendment co-authored by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) that provides the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with additional resources to address the claims backlog unanimously passed the U.S. House of Representatives. Thompson’s amendment redirects an additional $10 million to pay for programs like the Veterans Claims Intake Program, the centralized mail initiative, and staff overtime. “No one who has served our country in uniform should have to wait, in some cases more than a year, for the benefits they’ve earned because the VA is backlogged,” said Thompson. “This amendment will help make sure the VA has the recourses they need to get our veterans their benefits in a timely manner.” Currently, new claims by veterans can take almost 300 days to process, delaying access to care and benefits. Many California veterans in the 5th Congressional District are serviced by the Oakland Regional Office which has average backlog of 385 days. The Oakland Regional Office’s claims backlog is one of the longest claims in the country. The funding provided in the amendment co-authored by Thompson provides additional resources to address the claims backlog. California Reps. Jim Costa (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), and Jeff Denham (R-CA) also co-authored the amendment. The amendment passed the House as part of H.R. 4486, the 2015 Military Construction/Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act. H.R. 4486 now goes to the Senate for approval. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.06.2014	Washington, DC - U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $5.1 million U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) contract for Mare Island Dry Docks, LLC. The contract is for the dry docking and ship repairs of the POLAR STAR ice breaker. The POLAR STAR is used to clear pathways for supply vessels and support research missions. "This is a great day for Mare Island, Vallejo and Solano County,” said Thompson. “The POLAR STAR contract will bring much needed jobs and revenue to our community, and it represents an important step forward in the economic revitalization of Mare Island.” Last year, Thompson hosted a summit on economic revitalization of Mare Island. The summit pulled together stakeholders from the private and public sectors and was focused on the clean-up, redevelopment, long-term economic opportunities available on the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The POLAR STAR contract is representative of the kind long-term economic opportunities on which the summit focused. “This is great news for Solano County. I want to thank Congressman Mike Thompson for his commitment to Mare Island and to everyone involved in helping secure this contract for Mare Island. I can’t wait to see the ‘Now Hiring’ signs,” said Coast Guard Subcommittee Ranking Member Congressman John Garamendi (D-Fairfield, CA). “As the polar ice cap in the Arctic continues to recede further opening the region to global shipping traffic and other economic development, the POLAR STAR will be a key Coast Guard asset protecting American interests and ensuring safe and reliable maritime commerce.” The POLAR STAR was commissioned in January 1976 and is a 399-foot polar class icebreaker with a 140-person crew. Its maximum speed is 18 knots and it is capable of continuously breaking 6 feet of ice at three knots and can break 21 feet of ice backing and ramming. The vessel recently finished a mission in Antarctica to break through 12 miles of ice up to 10 feet in thickness on a major shipping channel. The shipping channel is used by the tankers to deliver approximately three and a half million gallons of fuel to area residents and to deliver more than 500 containers of supplies to operate McMurdo and South Pole stations for the next 12 months. Its next stop is Mare Island Dry Docks. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

05.05.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement in recognition of California’s Geothermal Awareness Day. “Geothermal energy is an excellent source of clean, renewable energy that supports thousands of jobs across our district and state. Not only does the production of geothermal energy boost our economy and reduce our dependence on foreign oil, it provides counties with important royalty payments which they use to pay for things such as public safety, road maintenance and law enforcement. “When the President proposed repealing these payments, I fought against it. If a community invests in developing geothermal energy, they deserve to get their fair share in returns. Stripping counties of these returns is a short sighted, fiscally irresponsible plan that will hurt communities and have no meaningful impact on deficit reduction. On a day when we are raising awareness of the many benefits of geothermal energy, we should take special note of how important geothermal royalties are to counties across our state.” Thompson recently led a letter calling on President Obama to protect local clean energy royalties from harmful budget cuts. Geothermal revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, the counties should share in the revenue. Counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners in the continued development of geothermal energy – a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. In FY 2013, Lake County received more than $802,000 in geothermal royalties. In FY 2013, Sonoma County received more than $1.1 million in geothermal royalties.

05.05.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement on Public Service Recognition Week. “This week our country celebrates Public Service Recognition Week to honor the necessary and meaningful work of our public servants. Every day, millions of public servants work tirelessly to better our country, our state, our counties and our communities. On behalf of everyone in our district, many thanks to all our public servants for everything they do.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.29.2014	Washington, DC – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) joined colleagues in the House and Senate in sending a letter to Secretary Arne Duncan of the U.S. Department of Education (ED) urging the ED to protect students from unfair banking practices, including campus-sponsored debit cards with terms that are not always good for students, and preserve the integrity of federal student aid programs. “Federal financial aid is there to help students. When colleges partner with financial institutions and push students into putting their federal student aid refunds into high fee accounts, it puts our federal investment at risk,” the members wrote. “Students should be able to make unbiased choices about the financial products that work best for them.” The letter was signed by 23 members of the House and Senate, including: Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tom Harkin (D-Iowa.), Senators Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Edward Markey (D-Mass.), and Representatives George Miller (D-Calif.), Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Chellie Pingree (D-Maine), Alan Lowenthal (D-Calif.), Julia Brownley (D-Calif.), Frederica Wilson (D-Fla.), Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), Karen Bass (D-Calif.), Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.), Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), John F. Tierney (D-Mass.) and Jared Huffman (D-Calif.). Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office and ED’s Inspector General raised concerns that colleges are entering into agreements with financial institutions that charge high fees or hidden fees, resulting in gain for the companies, but financial strain for students. The members’ letter advocates that: “Colleges should be recommending the financial products that provide the best deal to students, not the biggest financial reward for the institution.” The members specifically urged Secretary Duncan to establish rules that would: Ensure students can easily deposit federal financial aid into their personal accounts without delay or penalty. Direct deposit into a student’s own account should always be an easy option. Prohibit colleges from entering into a preferred relationship with a bank or financial firm to offer debit cards or other financial products that charge fees associated with the disbursement and use of Title IV aid. Ensure that students receive neutral and unbiased information about how best to access their federal student aid. Ban revenue sharing deals so that colleges select financial products based on their merits alone, not revenue to the college or other considerations. Require that colleges post agreements with banks on their websites and annually report them to the government for review by relevant agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ensure these new rules are applicable to any college-sponsored account into which Title IV funds are transferred or deposited. The full text of the letter is below. April 22, 2014 The Honorable Arne Duncan Secretary U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202 Dear Secretary Duncan: We write to express our support for changes to the Department of Education’s Title IV cash management rules that would preserve the integrity of our federal student aid programs and protect students from unfair banking practices. The cost of college tuition is out of reach for many low and middle-income families, and the federal government is committed to providing the financial aid that can help these students achieve their dream of a college education. But recent investigative reports have shown that financial aid dollars are being diverted away from students through high fees and high-pressure marketing. In February, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) released the results of an investigation showing that about 40 percent of all college students are enrolled in institutions that have agreements with financial institutions to market debit cards to students. The GAO and the Department of Education’s Inspector General have both raised concerns that campus-sponsored debit cards may not always be good for students. The reports conclude that action is needed to address high fees charged by some financial institutions, students’ access to ATM’s, and the undue influence that colleges exert in pushing students to opt into a school-endorsed debit card or checking account. An ABC News investigative report suggested that financial institutions are paying multi-million dollar kickbacks to some colleges for exclusive access to market their financial products on campus. Federal financial aid is there to help students. When colleges partner with financial institutions and push students into putting their federal student aid refunds into high fee accounts, it puts our federal investment at risk. Students should be able to make unbiased choices about the financial products that work best for them. Colleges should be recommending the financial products that provide the best deal to students, not the biggest financial reward for the institution. The Department of Education has the authority to issue rules related to the disbursement of student aid refunds, and it should use that authority to mandate contract transparency, prohibit aggressive marketing, and ban high fees when colleges partner with banks to sponsor debit cards, prepaid cards, or other financial products that disburse student aid. The Secretary should work to establish rules that: Ensure students can easily deposit federal financial aid into their personal accounts without delay or penalty. Direct deposit into a student’s own account should always be an easy option. Prohibit colleges from entering into a preferred relationship with a bank or financial firm to offer debit cards or other financial products that charge fees associated with the disbursement and use of Title IV aid. Ensure that students receive neutral and unbiased information about how best to access their federal student aid. Ban revenue sharing deals so that colleges select financial products based on their merits alone, not revenue to the college or other considerations. Require that colleges post agreements with banks on their websites and annually report them to the government for review by relevant agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Ensure these new rules are applicable to any college-sponsored account into which Title IV funds are transferred or deposited. We commend your efforts to address this important issue and we look forward to the resolution of this rulemaking process.

04.28.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $3,425,343 Head Start Grant for Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County. The funding will be used to provide Head Start and Early Head Start services to 552 children and their families at 12 center based sites throughout Sonoma County. “Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County does outstanding work and I am proud to support them,” said Thompson. “Their Head Start and Early Head Start programs help make sure all children have a foundation for future success.” “These investments help to assure that local Upstream Investment initiative’s produce a more prosperous, healthy and safe community,” said Tim F. Reese, Executive Director of Community Action Partnership of Sonoma County. “These services make life long changes in the trajectory of a child’s life that provide significant return on investment in the local community.” Head Start is a federal program that promotes the school readiness of children ages birth to 5 from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Head Start programs provide comprehensive services to enrolled children and their families, which include health, nutrition, social services and other services determined to be necessary by family needs assessments, in addition to education and cognitive development services. For every dollar spent on Head Start, our country realizes almost nine dollars in benefits through participants’ increased earnings, decreased welfare dependence and other factors. Head Start was founded as part of Lyndon B. Johnson’s War on Poverty in 1965. Since then, Head Start has grown from an eight-week demonstration project to include full day/year services and numerous program options. Head Start has served over 31 million children and their families in urban and rural areas in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. territories. The reauthorization of the Head Start Act in 1994 made it possible to establish Early Head Start as a program to serve infants and toddlers under the age of 3 and pregnant women. Early Head Start provides early, continuous, intensive and comprehensive child development and family support services to low-income infants, toddlers, pregnant women and their families.

04.17.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement today on the one year anniversary of the Senate’s failure to pass commonsense, bipartisan legislation that would require criminal background checks for all commercial gun sales. “One year ago today, a minority of Senators voted to block bipartisan legislation that would help keep criminals, domestic abusers, terrorists and the dangerously mentally ill from getting guns by requiring a simple background check for all commercial firearm sales. Every day at licensed gun stores where background checks are required, more than 170 felons, nearly 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives are prevented from buying a gun. But because background checks aren’t required for all commercial sales, these same dangerous purchasers can turn right around and buy a gun at a gun show or over the internet with no questions asked. “My bipartisan bill, and the bipartisan bill blocked one year ago in the Senate will close this loophole, keep guns from dangerous people, strengthen the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens, and save lives. It took 6 years and 7 votes until we passed the original Brady law that established the requirement for background checks at licensed dealers. We didn’t give up then, we won’t give up now. We’re going to finish the job.” Thompson and U.S. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) are co-authors of H.R. 1565, legislation that would expand the current background check system to all commercial sales. The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA), and supported by a bipartisan majority in the Senate. 189 House members have cosponsored the King-Thompson bill. The legislation helps prevent guns from falling into criminal hands and reinforces the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. By closing these loopholes, the legislation greatly reduces the number of places that criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can buy guns. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a table or out of someone’s trunk at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because no background check is required for these kinds of sales. Last year, the background check system identified and denied more than 88,000 sales to criminals, domestic abusers, those with serious mental illnesses, and other prohibited purchasers. However, those same prohibited purchasers could buy those guns at a gun show or over the internet without any questions asked. More than 40 percent of gun transactions are conducted without a background check. The King-Thompson legislation helps close these loopholes. Under H.R. 1565, background checks will continue to be conducted through a licensed dealer and records will be kept in the same manner as they have been for more than 40 years. The legislation also strengthens the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners by banning the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers and allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state they are stationed. It lets gun owners use a state concealed carry permit issued within the last five years in lieu of a background check and permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. The bill also improves the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will also reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.15.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) led a bipartisan letter with Rep. Pete King (R-NY-2) to President Barack Obama requesting that he require all federal agencies to only buy American flags that are 100 percent made in America, by American workers, using American grown and manufactured materials. “American flags bought by the United States government should be made in America, and they should be made by American workers and from American products. We urge the Obama Administration to make this simple buy-American policy a requirement for all federal agencies so that American tax-dollars are spent in support of American products and workers,” said Thompson. Prior to last year, only the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was required to purchase American made U.S. flags. Then earlier this year, Thompson authored and passed legislation requiring the Department of Defense (DOD) to only purchase American flags that are 100 percent made in America. However, federal agencies other than the VA and DOD are only required to purchase flags made of just 50 percent domestic content. Thompson and King requested the Obama Administration expand the VA and DOD’s buy-American requirements to U.S. flags purchased by all federal agencies. The full text of the letter is below. April 10, 2014 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We respectfully request that your Administration require all federal agencies to buy American flags that are 100 percent made in America, by American workers, using American-grown and manufactured materials. Prior to last year, only the Department of Veteran Affairs was required to purchase American made American flags. Then earlier this year, legislation we introduced was included in the Department of Defense (DoD) Appropriations Act, 2014 (P.L. 113-76, Sec. 8123), that required American Flags to be covered by the Berry Amendment. As a result, DoD is now required to buy only Berry Amendment-compliant American flags. These policies are a good start. However, we believe that it is inappropriate for federal agencies to continue to purchase just Buy American Act-compliant American flags, mandating just 50 percent domestic content. Wherever an American flag is flown, it is a symbol of the freedoms men and women throughout our history have marched, fought and died to secure. There is no greater symbol of our country, our unity, our freedom, and our liberty than our flag. It fills us with pride every time we see it flown or presented by an honor guard. We look forward to working with you to ensure that all American flags purchased by the federal government are 100 percent made in America, by American workers, with American content. Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON PETER KING Member of Congress Member of Congress Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.14.2014	WASHINGTON­—Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael), Sam Farr (D-Carmel), and Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale), applauded the U.S. Sentencing Commission for taking action to increase public safety and stop the environmental destruction caused by trespass marijuana grows on our public and private lands. The U.S. Sentencing Commission announced last Thursday that it adopted increased penalties for high-level offenders cultivating marijuana on trespassed private or public lands, as Huffman, Thompson, Farr, and LaMalfa, along with California’s U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, requested in a November letter to the Commission. These amended Sentencing Commission guidelines will be submitted to Congress and reviewed for a six-month period. They will officially take effect November 1. “Illegal marijuana grow sites that threaten lives, destroy public lands and devastate wildlife have become far too common,” said Congressman Thompson. “These new sentencing guidelines will serve as a strong deterrent against these illegal grow sites, and they will help make sure criminals who wreck our public and private lands are held fully responsible for the harm they cause.” “From the use of highly-toxic and illegal pesticides and rodenticides, to the violence perpetuated by drug trafficking organizations, trespass marijuana cultivation makes our public and private lands unsafe for all of us. California is in the midst of a devastating drought, and many of these grow operations illegally divert streams and tap groundwater with untold impacts on downstream water users and wildlife,” said Congressman Huffman. “As we move toward more rational marijuana policies it’s critical that we address the immediate threat to our environment and public safety posed by trespass growing operations. Where it is lawful to grow marijuana, it must be done lawfully and responsibly, and I’m glad that the Sentencing Commission has taken strong action to help keep our communities and public lands safe.” As our nation moves forward with more sensible laws to address marijuana use, we have to develop better policies to deal with the bad actors,” said Congressman Farr. “I am glad that the Sentencing Commission is changing their guidelines to address trespass marijuana grows. With these new guidelines in place, we can make public and private lands safer while protecting the environment for everyone to enjoy.” “While illegal marijuana cultivation has made many of our public and private lands unsafe, it also does untold damage to our forests and waterways. When these operations illegally divert streams, contaminate water supplies and leave refuse behind, property owners and local governments are stuck with thousands of dollars in clean-up costs,” said Congressman LaMalfa. “The Sentencing Commission’s recognition of these impacts will go a long way toward ensuring that those who disregard our nation’s laws are held responsible.” Thompson, Huffman, Farr, and LaMalfa previously introduced the PLANT Act, a bipartisan bill which would direct the Sentencing Commission to establish new penalties for these environmentally destructive practices. Sen. Feinstein and Senator Boxer introduced a companion bill in the Senate. ###
04.14.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – In one week, a bipartisan group of more than 100 additional Members of Congress signed on as co-authors of U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) legislation that would transfer the management of Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The bill, H.R. 4166, now has 165 co-authors. “We are rapidly approaching a bipartisan majority of members in the House who are on record supporting a change of management at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “People on both sides of the aisle agree that our federal agencies need to be operating efficiently, and BLM is the best agency to manage recreation at Lake Berryessa.” BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing, and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would: Transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Bureau of Land Management; Direct the Department of the Interior to develop a comprehensive management plan ; and Allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the Dam The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

04.11.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that he has joined the bipartisan TRIO Caucus. The caucus advocates for the Federal TRIO Programs and higher education access for low-income, first-generation students, and students with disabilities. The goal of the caucus is to generate support for TRIO programs from congressional offices, the US Department of Education, and other entities. “Making sure everyone has higher educational opportunities, regardless of their background, is an essential element to our nation’s long-term economic success,” said Thompson. “I am honored to be part of this bipartisan caucus where I will work with colleagues to help make sure all students are able achieve their educational goals.” The TRIO Programs are outreach and student services programs designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds. The programs serve and assist low-income individuals, first-generation college students, and individuals with disabilities. TRIO programs serve students from middle school through post-graduate study and provide academic tutoring, personal counseling, mentoring, financial guidance, and other supports necessary for educational access and retention. Find more information on the history of the federal TRIO programs here.

04.10.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today joined a bipartisan group of representatives in voting against H.Con.Res. 96, the House Majority’s Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 budget authored by Rep. Paul Ryan (WI-1). The budget resolution passed by a vote of 219-205. No Democrats voted for the resolution and 12 Republicans voted against the resolution. The Senate will not pass H.Con.Res. 96, and if they did, the President would veto it. “This reckless spending plan will kill jobs, end the guarantee of Medicare for America’s seniors, raises taxes on middle-class families while rewarding the wealthy and corporations that ship jobs overseas, gut our education system and make college more expensive for hard working families,” said Thompson. “The American people deserve a better path forward – one that shrinks our deficit and strengthens our middle class by creating jobs, cutting spending and asking everyone to pay their fair share. I will continue working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass a responsible budget that grows our economy and gets our fiscal house in order.” According to the non-partisan Economic Policy Institute, the cuts made in the House Majority’s budget will cost our economy 3 million jobs and decrease economic growth by 2.5 percent in 2016. The budget makes cuts to job creating investments in infrastructure, clean energy, education, research, innovation, and manufacturing. The House Majority’s FY 2015 budget ends the Medicare guarantee by transforming Medicare into a privatized voucher program. Under this program, rather than having guaranteed coverage of benefits, seniors would receive a voucher and would need to use that voucher to purchase private insurance or traditional Medicare. The budget also increases the costs of prescription drugs and preventive care for seniors. The plan repeals the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which would re-open the Medicare Part D ‘donut hole’ and end free preventive services such as cancer screenings that seniors now receive under the health care reform law. Since the enactment of the ACA, 7.9 million people with Medicare, including more than 358,000 Californians, have saved over $9.9 billion on their prescription drugs. And, in 2013, an estimated 37.2 million people with Medicare took advantage of at least one free preventive service thanks to the ACA. The budget also jeopardizes nursing home care for tens of thousands of seniors in California by cutting federal Medicaid funding for California by more than $95 billion over the next 10 years. The budget cuts the top corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent at a cost of $1 trillion, and taxpayers with income exceeding $1 million in 2015 would receive an average net tax decrease of more $200,000 that year. These cuts and tax breaks are paid for by increasing taxes on middle class families with children by an average of $2,000 per family. H.Con.Res. 96 cuts college student aid and support by a total of $260 billion over the next 10 years. Pell Grants, which 10 million students depend on to pay for college, are cut by $145 billion over 10 years. Pell Grants currently help students cover one-third of the cost of attending a four-year public college. College students in California will receive more than $246 million less in Pell Grants, and 51,350 fewer California students will receive Pell Grants needed to help pay for college. The budget plan also increases the cost of college loans by charging interest on college loans while students are still in school. This will raise the cost of student loans by $41 billion over ten years. Additionally, 21,140 fewer children in California would receive Head Start services under the House Majority’s Budget. Under the House Majority’s budget passed today, 175,300 Californians would lose training and employment services, and 313,200 Californians would lose job search assistance. Nearly 7,000 California children could lose access to child care. And, 1,315 fewer victims of domestic violence in California would be served through the STOP Violence Against Women Program. H.Con.Res. 96 now goes to the Senate for their consideration. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

04.08.2014	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5), Don Young (R-AK-AL), Veterans Affairs Committee Ranking Member Mike Michaud (D-ME-2) and Bill Enyart (D-IL-12) today announced the formation of the bipartisan Veterans Congressional Fellowship Caucus. The mission of the Caucus is to increase the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill. To do this, veterans Thompson (U.S. Army 1967-1973) and Young (U.S. Army 1955-1957) will launch a new caucus fellowship program which will accept its first participants this summer. “Our veterans are some of the most skilled workers our country has to offer,” said Thompson. “They are leaders who have been tested under pressure, and they will be tremendous assets to Congressional offices. As a veteran, I understand we have a responsibility to help those who’ve served our nation find a job when they return home. That is why I am proud to join my colleagues in officially launching this bipartisan caucus that, through our new fellowship program, will work to increase the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill and provide our heroes with new skills to help them excel in the civilian workforce.” “When I first took the oath of office in 1973, nearly three-fourths of Congress – both House and Senate – was made up of veterans; now, it’s barely 20%,” said Congressman Don Young. “As a whole we can do nothing about who the American people elect to represent them in Congress, however, we do have a say in the type of people that serve on our staffs. I am proud to help found this new veteran fellowship program with my good friend Congressman Mike Thompson, and hope that it encourages our nation’s veterans to become more actively involved in our political system. Our veterans have dedicated so much to serve this great nation and I am confident this program will give them the skills and resources needed to continue their service on Capitol Hill.” “Our veterans make incredible sacrifices for our country, and we have a responsibility to do everything we can to help these honorable men and women transition into the civilian workforce,” said Michaud. “Through their service, veterans gain a wide array of skills that will make them integral parts of Congressional offices. This program benefits not only our veterans, but Hill offices who stand to gain talented and motivated fellows.” “As former Adjutant General of the Illinois National Guard, I’ve seen firsthand how difficult it can be for our veterans to join the civilian workforce. I am pleased to join the caucus, and more importantly, I’m honored to be promoting such an important issue. My office employs military service men and women, and with the new Veterans Congressional Fellowship program, we’ll continue to do so,” stated Enyart. “When it comes to giving veterans a chance to land a good job and achieve the American Dream, Congress should be leading the way. Nearly one third of House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs majority staffers wore the uniform prior to their time on the Hill, a fact of which I am extremely proud. Our committee will continue to make an extra effort to hire veterans, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same,” said Rep. Jeff Miller, Chairman, House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. According to a recent survey by HillVets, an organization for veterans in politics and government, the latest confirmed count of veterans working on Capitol Hill is 98 veterans out of approximately 6,060 Capitol Hill employees. 55 percent of Congressional offices responded to HillVets’ recent survey. By extrapolating a similar proportion of veteran hires to the non-responsive offices HillVets projects that no more than 178 veterans are working in personal offices on Capitol Hill. To increase the number of veterans working on Capitol Hill, the newly formed bipartisan Veterans Congressional Fellowship Caucus has created a fellowship program that will provide them with the resources and skills necessary to bridge the gap between military service and legislative work. Veterans who are interested in applying for the fellowship program can apply here: https://mikethompson.house.gov/constituent-services/veterans-fellowship-program. Veteran fellows will be placed in participating offices, participate in an educational curriculum where they will learn the legislative process and how to assist constituents dealing with federal agencies. The fellows will be provided a certificate at the end of their fellowship highlighting their completion of the program. ###
04.08.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today commended the Senate for passing bipartisan legislation to extend unemployment insurance for nearly 3 million Americans, including more than 514,000 Californians. The Senate passed the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act by a vote of 59 to 38, which retroactively extends emergency unemployment insurance through the end of May. “A bipartisan majority in the Senate has passed a long overdue extension of emergency unemployment insurance and now it’s time for the House to do the same,” said Thompson. “The House Majority’s failure to act is hurting our economy and it is hurting families. Their inaction has cost California’s economy $834 million, and it’s cut off important benefits that people looking for work depend on to buy food and pay bills as they make the transition from joblessness back to the workforce. The House Majority needs to immediately bring the Senate’s bipartisan bill to the floor for a vote.” The bipartisan Senate agreement would: Retroactively restore emergency unemployment insurance for five months, from the end of December, 2013, when these benefits expired, through May 2014; Exclude millionaires from receiving emergency unemployment insurance; Strengthen efforts to help get job seekers back into the workforce; and Be fully paid for by making slight changes to federal pension programs and extending fees on U.S. customs users through 2024. The House Majority has blocked multiple efforts by Democrats to bring up legislation to extend emergency unemployment insurance on the House floor for more than three months. To overcome this opposition, Thompson joined 192 other House Democrats in signing a petition to force action on unemployment insurance legislation to the floor once a majority of Members of Congress (218) have signed it. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
04.04.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that 60 bipartisan members of the U.S. House of Representatives have signed on as co-authors of H.R. 4166, Thompson’s legislation that would transfer the management of Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). “There is serious bipartisan momentum behind changing the management status quo at Lake Berryessa,” said Thompson. “My colleagues understand that our federal agencies need to be operating efficiently, and our community has waited too long for BOR to effectively execute its redevelopment plan at Lake Berryessa. I will continue working to gain additional support so that we can pass this bill, transfer management, and craft a successful redevelopment plan with BLM and Napa County.” Recreation along the 165 miles of shoreline and 2000 acres of wildlife areas have been managed by BOR since the lake was formed after Monticello Dam was built in 1957. However, BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing, and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would: Transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Bureau of Land Management; Direct the Department of the Interior to develop a comprehensive management plan ; and Allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the Dam The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act has been referred to House Committee on Natural Resources.

04.04.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and Elizabeth Esty (CT-5), Vice-Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, led the call against legislative language known as “riders,” in appropriations bills that would block efforts to reduce and prevent gun violence. 106 of their colleagues joined Thompson and Esty in sending a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi urging them to oppose the inclusion of gun-related riders in appropriations bills for Fiscal Year 2015. “The only people these riders benefit are criminals,” said Thompson. “They prevent the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health from conducting research on the causes of gun violence. They restrict law enforcement’s ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. And they harm efforts to reduce and prevent gun violence. The American people deserve an open debate on these backdoor legislative tactics that do nothing but make our communities less safe." “It’s unacceptable for members of Congress to slip into must-pass bills controversial provisions that block efforts to reduce gun violence," said Esty. "The fact that gun-riders have prohibited federally-funded public health research on the causes and impact of gun violence and have limited efforts to track illegal guns underscores how harmful these under-the-table provisions can be. The American people deserve an open, public debate on issues that so deeply affect the health and safety of our families." In previous years, members of Congress included gun-related riders without any public debate. The riders include provisions known as the Rehberg restrictions that prohibit research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on gun violence prevention, the Tiahrt Amendments that hinder the ability of law enforcement to track and combat the spread of illegal guns, and the Dickey restrictions that have led Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to effectively halt all research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. In their policy principles released in February, 2013, the U.S. House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force recommended that Congress repeal these riders and restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The task force also urged Congress to fund law enforcement's efforts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into the causes of gun violence. In policy principle number nine found here, the task force recommended that Congress remove the Dickey, Rehberg, and Tiahrt restrictions. A full copy of the letter is below. March 25, 2014 The Honorable John Boehner The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House Democratic Leader U.S. House of Representatives U.S. House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: As the House Committee on Appropriations develops each of the twelve fiscal year (FY) 2015 appropriations bills, we urge that you ensure the committee’s legislation not include harmful legislative language, or “riders,” that impact the enforcement of gun laws, the operations of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL), or research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. Gun violence reduction and prevention is an important and sensitive issue. Given the renewed national focus on gun violence prevention, now is not the time to include controversial appropriations riders that negatively impact gun laws. Instead, such changes to gun policy must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through the regular order. This must be done in an open and transparent process where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and debated by the proper committees of authorizing jurisdiction and the entire House of Representatives. Over the past several years, various appropriations riders related to gun policy have had unintended consequences that could have been prevented had these issues been properly and more thoroughly debated in Congress. For example, the Tiahrt and Rehberg amendments, among others, have prevented law enforcement from requiring FFLs to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of crime gun transfers, and chilled unbiased scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. As the FY 2015 appropriations process begins through the respective Appropriations subcommittees, we urge you to support the development of legislation that is free of harmful gun-related riders. Thank you for your consideration of this matter. Sincerely, ###

04.02.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that Stephen Gale has been hired to serve as District Representative in Thompson’s Santa Rosa Office, and Edith Gonzalez has been hired to serve as Constituent Services Representative in Thompson’s Napa Office. “I am thrilled to have Stephen and Edith join our team,” said Thompson. “They are smart, talented, hard working individuals who will provide excellent service to our district and our constituents.” Gale has lived in Sonoma County for 25 years, spending the last 18 as a resident of Santa Rosa. Prior to joining Thompson’s staff, he had served as a consultant for the last fourteen years, providing planning and financial analysis services to businesses located throughout California. Gale has been active in civic affairs, serving on the Board of Public Utilities for the City of Santa Rosa since 2009 and as the Chair since 2013. Gale and his wife live in the Oakmont community of Santa Rosa. “I am excited to be joining Mike Thompson’s team in the Sonoma County District Office,” said Gale. “I have admired the Congressman’s work on behalf of his constituents for some time and consider it an honor to be adding my energy to continue that effort.” Gonzalez’s interest in public service began in high school when she volunteered with the National Association of Latino Elected Officials in Southern California where she helped Latinos register to vote. Gonzalez relocated to Northern California to pursue her education at U.C. Davis. While pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science with a minor in English at U.C. Davis, Gonzalez was accepted into the University of California Center Sacramento as an intern. There she joined the committee staff with the California State Assembly Committee on Jobs, Economic Development, and the Economy. Recently, Gonzalez completed an internship with Representative Mike Thompson at his Vallejo District Office where she assisted with constituent casework on veteran’s affairs, social security, and community outreach. “I am extremely grateful for this wonderful opportunity, and I look forward to pursuing my interest in public service while serving the people of Napa County,” said Gonzalez. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.01.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – An effort to fix the out-dated formula used to determine Medicare reimbursement payments that U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) helped lead through the House passed the Senate today as part of H.R. 4302, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and will now go to the President’s desk to be signed into law. H.R. 4302 passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 64-35. “This fix will help make sure that medical professionals in Sonoma County who care for Medicare beneficiaries are reimbursed at the appropriate, up-to-date levels,” said Thompson. “I am proud to have worked to get this fix signed into law so that we can make sure Sonoma County’s medical professionals get reimbursed at levels similar to those in neighboring, urban-classified counties, and so that we can protect and improve access to care.” Currently, Medicare reimburses physicians according to the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI), an index based on cost of living, cost of providing care, cost of malpractice insurance and other provider costs. Counties in California are put into one of nine separate reimbursement localities based on the GPCI formula. Counties with similar GPCIs are supposed to be put in the same reimbursement locality. However, Sonoma County, which despite having a high cost of living, is classified as a rural county. Because of this out-dated rural classification, physicians are being reimbursed at a level that doesn’t accurately reflect the costs of providing care in that area. The legislative fix advocated for by Thompson corrects this by updating the outdated payment localities to the current Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), which is the same way Medicare currently pays hospitals. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

03.27.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced H. RES. 525, a bipartisan resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives honoring March as Women’s History Month. The origins of Women’s History Month begin in Thompson’s district. Until the late 1970’s, women’s history was rarely included in K-12 curriculum and was virtually absent in public awareness. To counter this, the Education Taskforce of the Sonoma County Commission on the Status of Women initiated a “Women’s History Week” celebration in 1978 centered around International Women’s History Day. With the help of the National Women’s History Project, founded in Sonoma County, thousands of schools and communities joined in the commemoration of Women’s History Week. In 1981, Congress responded to the growing popularity of Women’s History Week by making it a national observance and eventually expanding the week to a month in 1987. “The roots of Women’s History Month’s are in our district, and I’m proud to recognize the enormous contributions that women make to our communities and county with this resolution,” said Thompson. “However, honoring women cannot be a once-a-year occurrence. That’s why I’ll continue working every single day to make sure women are treated equally in the workplace and have the same opportunities as men to move up and succeed – because when women succeed, America succeeds.” The National Women’s History Project (NWHP) is based in Santa Rosa and chooses the theme of National Women’s History Month each year. This year, National Women’s History Month celebrates “Women of Character, Courage, and Commitment.” “The National Women’s History Project is extremely grateful to have a Representative who is so knowledgeable and supportive of women. It is important to have men as allies, and we greatly appreciate Congressman Thompson’s continued support and efforts towards making sure women have the same opportunities as men to succeed,” said Molly Murphy MacGregor, Executive Director and Co-Founder of the National Women’s History Project. Thompson has co-authored numerous pieces of legislation to ensure women are treated equally in the workplace. Those bills include the Paycheck Fairness Act which provides more effective remedies to women who face blatant wage discrimination, and the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act which requires employers to maintain pregnant workers' salaries and benefits so that women don’t have to choose between their workplace security and having a child. Thompson also helped pass the Lilly Ledbetter Act which ensures women can fight for equal pay in court. H.RES. 525 was co-sponsored by 22 Democrats and 5 Republicans. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.26.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5), Pete King (R-NY-2) and Sean Patrick Maloney (D-NY-18) introduced the bipartisan Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) Assessment Protection Act of 2014. The legislation, HR 4285, helps spur local job creation and increase energy efficiency by enabling State and local governments to develop and implement PACE programs through local government financing of residential and nonresidential energy efficiency improvements. PACE programs – currently available in 31 states and the District of Columbia – allow property owners to finance the purchase and installation of energy retrofits to their homes and businesses and then pay for them each year as part of their property tax. “Not only is PACE one of the most innovative and successful solutions to our nation’s energy crisis, it’s a proven job creator that saves property owners money by lowering their energy costs and maintaining, and in some instances increasing, the value of their homes and properties,” said Thompson. “With PACE, homeowners and businesses’ utility costs are lowered, people are put to work, and our nation gets the benefit of reduced energy use, increased energy independence and a cleaner environment – all at no cost to the taxpayers. Our bill will allow every community in America to take advantage of this great program.” “I am proud to support legislation that allows homeowners to continue to use the PACE program to finance clean energy upgrades, which creates jobs and lowers energy costs for consumers,” said King. “With my neighbors already facing astronomical energy costs, we need to get rid of needless bureaucracy and start helping our homeowners invest in the technology of the future,” said Maloney. “Communities like Bedford, Somers and Pound Ridge are leading the nation to reduce energy consumption through PACE financing, and we need to cut through the red tape to ensure they can continue create jobs and increase energy efficiency by expanding this innovative program.” Specifically, the PACE Assessment Protection Act would direct the FHFA to rescind its 2010 policy guidance that directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to discontinue guaranteeing mortgages with PACE assessments. FHFA issued this policy guidance because it was concerned that if properties with a PACE assessment went into foreclosure, the PACE assessment would be repaid before Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which insured the mortgage. This policy guidance treats PACE differently than any other assessment. Under many state and local laws, most assessments, like property taxes and home owner association liens, are repaid before the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and other mortgage holders. To address FHFA’s concerns, the bill establishes minimum underwriting standards to ensure that homeowners are able to afford the PACE assessments, thereby protecting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from financial risk. Because a majority of new mortgages are underwritten by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, homeowners have essentially been unable to participate in PACE. If they did choose to participate in PACE then attempt to sell their house, a potential buyer would not be able to get a mortgage for the home because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could not insure the mortgage. This has caused PACE programs to be effectively halted throughout the country. PACE is a voluntary program that allows state and local governments to work together to meet the economic and environmental needs of their communities at no cost to taxpayers. The program is not mandated by Washington, D.C. so communities, which know better than Washington what suits their local needs, can make PACE work for them. In Sonoma County, California, which has one of the most successful PACE programs in our country, PACE has been responsible for more than $53 million in local investment and has helped create and support more than 700 jobs. The legislation is supported by the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, California State Association of Counties (CSAC), and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). HR 4285 has been referred to the House Committee on Financial services. ###
03.24.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (D-CA-5) bipartisan Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously today. The legislation, H.R. 3771 provides expedited tax relief for Americans making charitable donations in support of Typhoon Haiyan recovery efforts in the Philippines. Under the legislation, individuals who donate to the relief efforts in the Philippines between the enactment of this legislation and April 15, 2014 would be able to take a charitable deduction for those donations when they file their 2013 tax returns. This bill now goes to the President to be signed into law. “I am proud that this bill has passed the House. Now we need to get it onto the President’s desk so that people are encouraged to donate to the relief efforts,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5). “A lot of people in our communities have family and friends who were impacted by the typhoon. Passing this bill will help make sure aid keeps coming during these early stages of a long-term rebuilding effort.” While there was an immediate outpouring of donations and other assistance following Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, the length of the rebuilding process means contributions are still needed now and in the months ahead. This bill is intended to spur donations to charitable organizations by allowing taxpayers who donate to the relief efforts before April 15th, 2014 to receive tax benefits nearly a year faster than usual. As written, the tax code provides a delayed incentive for making charitable contributions. Taxpayers can claim a tax deduction for contributions they make to charities, but they receive the tax incentive many months later after they file their tax returns the following year. The Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act eliminates this delay by allowing taxpayers who donate to the relief efforts in the Philippines between the enactment of this legislation and April 15, 2014 to take the charitable deduction when they file their 2013 tax returns. H.R. 3771 was co-authored by Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-CA-15), Darrell Issa (R-CA-49) and Joe Heck (R-NV-3). A Senate companion bill, S. 1821, was introduced by Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Dean Heller (R-NV), and passed by the Senate on March 6, 2014. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.19.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Two waterfowl decoys will have a new home at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History thanks to a donation from U.S. Congressman and lifelong waterfowler Mike Thompson of Northern California. The canvasback pair, donated at a reception on Capitol Hill in mid-March, were hand-carved and hand-painted by Thompson. Each is hallowed and carved out of redwood. They have redwood heads and glass eyes. Thompson carved the decoys in the early 1990s and has hunted over them in the Klamath Basin and on the North Coast of California. “On behalf of the National Museum of American History, I am pleased to accept these two waterfowl decoys hand-carved and painted by the Congressman and to add them to our national collections,” said John Gray, director of the museum. The pair of donated canvasbacks are part of a larger hunting rig hand-carved and painted by Thompson that consists of 12 canvasbacks, 10 mallards, six teal, five prig, two Canada geese, a sprig tip up and a great blue heron confidence decoy. “Waterfowl hunting in the marsh is a wonderful experience, but it’s even better when you’re hunting over your own hand-carved and painted decoys,” said Thompson, the only Member of Congress in history to serve two terms as chair of the Congressional Sportsmen’s Caucus. The pair of canvasbacks are not the first decoys donated by Thompson. During his years of carving he has donated two pairs of canvasbacks, two pacific coast brant, and a drake mallard for charitable purposes. Thompson started carving decoys at the urging of two long-time California decoy carvers, Bill Neal of Marin and Carl Brown of Napa. “When I started collecting antique duck decoys, a lot of the old carving guys like Bill and Carl were still around. They urged me to start carving. I took a carving class in the early 90s, and as they say, ‘the rest is history.’” When Thompson first started carving, he would bring his decoys to Neal’s house where they would fill up a tub to weight them. Thompson was always critical of his work, pointing out even the slightest imperfections. One time at Neal’s house when Thompson was criticizing a decoy he carved, he recalled Neal looking him straight in the eye and saying, “Mike, if any duck gets close enough to notice that and you miss it, it’s not the decoy’s fault.” Thompson was recently inducted into the California Waterfowl Hall of Fame, where he was recognized for his passion for the traditions of waterfowling, one sign of which is that he is renowned as one of the foremost authorities on vintage California waterfowl decoys. Thompson still spends time carving and painting decoys, although he admits he spends less time then he used to given his duties as a member of Congress and his weekly traveling to Washington, D.C. Despite his elected duties, Thompson is as passionate about waterfowl today as he was when he was a kid. “Before he was old enough to drive,” Thompson recalls, “I would ride my bike through town to the river to go duck hunting and my mom would pick me up at a local grocery store three or four miles downriver.” As an elected official Thompson has led efforts to preserve waterfowl and conserve wetlands. In the early 1990s, homeless people started camping along the South Spit of Humboldt Bay, located in Humboldt County, California. The Spit is one of the most important hunting areas in the state, annually hosts large numbers of Black Brant and other waterbirds. The situation on the Spit quickly worsened as garbage piled up, pit bulls hunted in packs, and abandoned cars, busses and trailers leaked fluids into wetlands. At the time, the land was privately owned and despite the huge numbers of felons on-site, enforcement of trespassing was lax. After visiting the Spit, Thompson forged new partnerships with local leaders. When agencies developed management plans that limited public use, Thompson rejected them. He wanted the Spit’s historical uses preserved, most notably waterfowl hunting and fishing. Through Thompson’s work, the Spit was acquired by the California Department of Fish and Game which gave the land the Wildlife Area status it enjoys today. Thompson ensured that the homeless were offered services and a huge clean-up took place to remove the toxins. Today, wildlife thrives and public access is secure. Thompson also helped forge a deal in California’s Del Norte County to save the Aleutian Goose. At the time the goose population was growing and they needed more grazing areas to forage. The geese competed with local ranchers, cattle and dairy operations. This created hardships for both the geese and the local farmers and ranchers. Thompson struck a deal with California State Parks that allowed the land to be restored to short grass, the preferred forage for Aleutians. This was a true win for the geese and the landowners. Continuing his work on preservation, Thompson secured more than $20 million to restore the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh. This 20 year restoration project represents a remarkable recovery of one of the San Francisco Bay’s great wetlands. The area was once diked and drained for agricultural purposes. After it was drained, it was used for commercial salt production. Because of Thompson’s efforts, 10,000 acres of wetlands have been restored and hunting opportunities have been increased. Additionally, as a co-author of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, Thompson’s fingerprints are on conservation efforts spanning far beyond California. This law co-written by Thompson is responsible for the conservation of more than 23 million acres of wetlands. “While I don’t have as much time to carve and hunt because of my job in Congress, it’s through that job that I can work to make sure my kids and grandkids, and the generations that come after them will have good hunting land. To me, that’s as satisfying as hunting over any hand carved decoy.” Because of Thompson’s donation to the National Museum of American History, visitors to our nation’s capital will be able to see two beautiful pieces of art. Because of Thompson’s work, generations will be able to enjoy millions of acres of beautiful wetlands. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
03.13.2014	WASHINGTON­, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today introduced comprehensive drought relief legislation he co-authored with Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-2) that will provide assistance to farmers and ranchers, businesses, and communities suffering from the record drought in California and other western states. The legislation provides emergency relief to affected agricultural producers and fishing communities, funds emergency drought relief projects, maintains environmental protections, and ensures that the United States will be better-prepared to respond to future droughts and natural disasters. “This bill provides comprehensive relief to our entire state without putting the needs of some California water users above others,” said Thompson. “The bill is transparent, based on sound science, builds on the efforts of Senators Feinstein and Boxer, and protects the interests of farmers, fishers, businesses and other water users in the northern, central and southern parts of our state.” Original co-authors of the legislation include Grace Napolitano (CA-32), Peter DeFazio (OR-4), George Miller (CA-11), John Garamendi (CA-3), Jerry McNerney (CA-9), Doris Matsui (CA-6), Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), Sam Farr (CA-20), Jackie Speier (CA-14), Ami Bera (CA-7), Juan Vargas (CA-51), Alan Lowenthal (CA-47), and Scott Peters (CA-52). This comprehensive legislation stands in stark contrast with H.R. 3964, the partisan drought legislation by the House Majority in early February. H.R. 3964 would allow water to be pumped south from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for as long as water is available. If enacted, the bill would devastate Bay-Delta communities, harm drinking water, and jeopardize thousands of jobs and billions of dollars of economic activity. In contrast, the comprehensive bill introduced today: Accelerates planning and execution of water supply projects while maintaining environmental protections like the National Environmental Policy Act compliance. Brings the Army Corps reservoir operations in line with modern science, saving water, and helping communities through extreme weather events. The Army Corps of Engineers operates many of its reservoirs on outdated and obsolete water control manuals, some of which are as much as 60 years old. The new bill includes an emergency provision for faster updates during times of drought. Allows the Secretary of Agriculture to help cover losses caused by the drought. Ensures that the damages from California’s drought are properly recognized under the Stafford Act, so that Californians receive accurate and adequate disaster relief. Cracks down on illegal water diversions for marijuana cultivation. Illegal water diversions not only reduce available water for legal uses, but create a significant environmental threat in Northern California and other rural parts of the state. Thompson and Huffman previously introduced a bill to crack down on such environmental damages. Authorizes water planning and management activities to reduce water use in the Klamath Basin in California and Oregon. Directs the President to update the National Response Plan and the National Disaster Recovery Framework to address plans for responding to catastrophic drought preparing for longer term, continued drought in California and the western United States. Requires the development of a California salmon drought plan to address impacts of drought on wild fisheries, those that support tribal fisheries and the commercial and recreational fishing industry. Urges the Secretary of Commerce to immediately declare a fisheries disaster and fast-tracks future processes to respond to disaster conditions, ensuring prompt assistance rather than years after a disaster. Requires that water agencies receiving assistance under the legislation are in full compliance with state laws regarding groundwater and agricultural water use. Includes sunset provisions ensuring that emergency provisions end once the drought declaration is revoked. The bill includes the following emergency funding to respond to the drought: $255 million in emergency appropriations, including: $50 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund for projects in drought-affected states that reduce fire risk or assist water quality and capacity. $5 million for the Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program within the Rural Utilities Service to assist with rural water supply projects. $30 million for grants under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. $15 billion for grants under the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. $3 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration to assist in suppression of illegal trespass marijuana grows that diminish available water supply. $152 million available to the Bureau of Reclamation for projects, including $52 million for water conservation and efficiency projects, and to develop alternative water supplies, through the WaterSMART and Title XVI programs. $200 million in emergency disaster assistance including: $100 million in emergency assistance for farmers to fund water conservation measures that protect lands and sensitive watersheds. $25 million for Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grants that fund community projects to reduce harmful effects of the drought. $25 million to the Emergency Community Water Assistance Grants program for water conservation projects and to protect and upgrade water systems. These grants of up to $1 million are to complete projects that boost the availability and quality of drinking water, including in California communities at risk of running out of safe drinking water; $25 million in grant funding for public and nonprofit institutions to provide emergency assistance to low-income migrant and seasonal farmworkers harmed by the drought. $25 million in grants fo r private forest landowners to carry out conservation measures in response to drought and wildlife risks. $3 million in funding for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to carry out its work to respond to extreme drought conditions, including relocation of the release location and timing of hatchery fish and barging of hatchery release fish. $15 million for integrated regional water management projects that focus on water recycling and integrated water management on a watershed or regional scale.

03.12.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that he led a bipartisan letter with Reps. Joe Heck (R-NV), Steve Pearce (R-NM), Jared Huffman (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA) and Juan Vargas (D-CA) calling on President Obama to protect local clean energy royalties from harmful budget cuts. The letter urged the President to not repeal the sharing of geothermal royalty payments with counties. Because of the high burdens that geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, counties currently share in the revenue of the federal receipts. Revenue sharing was targeted for cuts in the President’s recently released Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 budget. “When a community invests in developing geothermal energy, they deserve to get their fair share in returns on those investments,” said Thompson. “Stripping counties of these returns is a short sighted, fiscally irresponsible plan that will have no meaningful impact on deficit reduction. It will rob counties of the funds they depend on to pay for things such as public safety, road maintenance and law enforcement. I will work with my Republican and Democratic colleagues in both the House and Senate to make sure any budget passed by Congress doesn’t include the President’s proposed geothermal cuts.” Geothermal revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, the counties should share in the revenue. Counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners in the continued development of geothermal energy – a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. Ending this sharing would negatively impact counties while having no meaningful deficit reduction impact. Over a ten year period, revenue sharing accounts for less than one tenth of one percent of the federal debt. In FY 2013, Lake County received more than $802,000 in geothermal royalties. In FY 2013, Sonoma County received more than $1.1 million in geothermal royalties.

03.11.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) joined President Obama today at the White House for a ceremony where the President used his executive authority to expand the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands along the Mendocino County coastline. Thompson has twice introduced legislation in the 111th and 112th Congresses to expand the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands. U.S. Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-2) introduced legislation with Thompson as a co-author in the 113th Congress. “The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are a national treasure,” said Thompson. “I commend President Obama for continuing to make this a year of action by expanding the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands. There are no federal lands more pristine than these, and I thank and applaud the President for taking action to preserve and protect these lands forever, and to strengthen our tourism economy and the jobs that come with it.” “I am thrilled that President Obama has preserved these pristine and breathtaking coastal lands,” Huffman said. “It is fitting that President Obama is following in the footsteps of Teddy Roosevelt in using the Antiquities Act—the same law used to protect the Grand Canyon and the Statue of Liberty—to protect this jewel of the Mendocino Coast for future generations. Thousands of new visitors each year will flock to see this gateway to the Coastal National Monument. As they enjoy some of the best ocean views in Northern California, they will also provide a significant boost to the local tourism industry, already Mendocino County’s biggest employer. I thank President Obama for bringing this land into permanent protection as a National Monument.” In 2000, President Clinton established the California Coastal National Monument for the purpose of protecting the area’s scientifically valuable coastal resources, including the geologic formations that provide unique habitat for breeding seabirds, marine mammals, and other native species. The addition to the monument designated today is approximately 1,665 acres of Federal lands located on California’s Mendocino County coast, just north of the City of Point Arena and is currently known as the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands. The area is a significant economic engine for the local community, driving tourism and offering opportunities for outdoor recreation. A Bureau of Land Management report estimates that outdoor recreation on the public lands in California contributed nearly $900 million to the economy in 2012. According to Scott Schneider, President and CEO of Visit Mendocino County, Inc. travel and tourism are responsible for the largest job sector in Mendocino County with close to 5,000 jobs earning over $114 million a year. In addition, visitor spending in Mendocino County brings in $20 million in state and local taxes. The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are contiguous with Manchester Beach State Park, the Point Arena Lighthouse, and the California Coastal National Monument. The California Coastal National Monument is located off the 1,100 miles of California coastline, comprising more than 20,000 small islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles between Mexico and Oregon. Current agricultural activities such as grazing are not affected by the designation. On December 3, 2009 and April 27, 2012 Thompson introduced legislation to expand the California Coastal National Monument and permanently protect the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands. The President’s action will fulfill the intent of these bills which is to protect the land and ensure the tourism economy can continue to thrive. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

03.10.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered to Congress its Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 work plan for the Army Civil Works program which includes $300,000 for a new start feasibility study for Dry Creek (Warm Springs Dam) and Coyote Valley Dam restoration. This provides much needed funding to begin a feasibility study on work which was included in the Russian River Biological Opinion, but for which the Corps believes it currently lacks authority. The Corps only included eight new starts in its budget nationwide. In addition, the President’s Fiscal Year 2015 budget proposal for the Civil Works Program of the Corps includes a request for $200,000 each for continuing the new start studies. “These funds are a big win for Sonoma County that will help our efforts to protect and restore critical habitat for threatened or endangered species of steelhead trout, and coho and Chinook salmon,” said Thompson. “Many thanks to everyone who worked to make sure the Army Corps recognized this project as a top priority.” “The inclusion of our environmental enhancement work on Dry Creek into the Corps work plan is a major milestone for fully implementing the Russian River Biological Opinion,” said Water Agency Chairman David Rabbitt. “The Water Agency greatly appreciates the Corps for making the implementation of the Biological Opinion a top priority, and for the support of our Washington, D.C. delegation for helping make this new start project happen, including Representatives Thompson and Huffman, and U.S. Senators Feinstein and Boxer. Enhancing critical habitat for coho and steelhead in the Russian River and its tributaries, including Dry Creek, is an essential mission of the Water Agency.” The Russian River Biological Opinion is a federally mandated 15-year blueprint to restore and protect threatened steelhead trout and endangered coho salmon. Issued after more than 10 years of studies by the National Marine Fisheries Service, the Biological Opinion found that some aspects of flood control and water supply operations managed by the Corps and the Sonoma County Water Agency threatened steelhead and coho within the Russian River watershed. The Biological Opinion calls on the Corps and the Water Agency to change operations and restore critical fisheries habitat. In particular, the Biological Opinion found that summertime flows in Dry Creek are too high for juvenile coho salmon to thrive. The fourteen-mile Dry Creek acts as the conduit for water released from Lake Sonoma to get to the Russian River for flood control and drinking water supply purposes. The Corps manages flood control releases and the Water Agency water supply releases from Warm Springs dam. The Biological Opinion requires the Corps and the Water Agency to enhance six miles of Dry Creek by changing the configuration of the creek to create slow-moving pools and fish refuge. The six miles must be completed by 2017 with evaluations completed by 2020. For more information about the Biological Opinion, please visit www.sonomacountywater.org.

03.06.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today introduced the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act (H.R. 4166), legislation that would transfer the management of Lake Berryessa from the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). “The management status quo at Lake Berryessa needs to change,” said Thompson. “Lake Berryessa is an important part of our county and we’ve waited too long for BOR to effectively execute its redevelopment plan. New management is needed, and a redevelopment plan that works for the lake, families and businesses needs to be implemented. We need to pass this bill and begin working with both BLM and BOR on a smooth management transfer, and with BLM on a successful redevelopment plan.” “Transferring the management of Lake Berryessa from BOR to BLM is the right thing to do for the lake, the families who live there and the businesses that depend on it,” said Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon. “I thank Congressman Thompson for introducing this legislation and look forward to working with him to make sure the management transition is both quick and smooth.” Recreation along the 165 miles of shoreline and 2000 acres of wildlife areas have been managed by BOR since the lake was formed after Monticello Dam was built in 1957. However, BOR has failed to provide and manage adequate concessions at Lake Berryessa in recent years. Currently, only one of the seven concessions has a permanent operator and four are operated under interim contracts, providing only boat launching and camping without hook-ups, showers or running water. The two remaining concession locations are closed. The lack of concessions has caused tourism to drop and has hurt the local economy. BLM manages 264 million acres of public lands across the United States, and has extensive experience managing outdoor activities on public lands – including camping, hiking, hunting, fishing, boating, wildlife viewing, and more. BLM management of the Lake Berryessa Recreation area would help ensure better management and enhanced recreational opportunities for visitors to the lake. Specifically the Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act would: • Transfer administrative jurisdiction over the Lake Berryessa Recreation Area from the Bureau of Reclamation to the Bureau of Land Management; • Direct the Department of the Interior to develop a comprehensive management plan ; and • Allow the Bureau of Reclamation to continue to administer the Monticello Dam and other facilities related to the Dam The Lake Berryessa Recreation Enhancement Act has been referred to House Committee on Natural Resources.

02.28.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) reminds constituents today that there is still time to sign up for a new health insurance plan, or shop around for a different plan if your current one does not meet your health care needs. Open enrollment goes through March 31st 2014. “There is just over a month left to get signed up for health insurance,” said Thompson. “If you want coverage for the first time, or want to shop around for a better plan at a better price you have until the end of March to do so. Make sure to take advantage of this time to find a plan that’s right for you and your family.” If people are changing their plans, they need to make sure there is not a lapse in coverage. If you enroll in a new plan between today and March 15th, 2014, that plan will not take effect until April 1st, 2014. If you enroll between March 16th, 2014, and March 31st, 2014, that plan will not take effect until May 1st, 2014. Constituents should contact their current insurance provider and Covered California to ensure that there is not lapse in coverage. Under the new law, millions of young adults are able to stay on their parents’ health insurance plans; more than 100 million Americans have received free preventive services such as mammograms and colonoscopies; children can no longer be denied insurance because they have a pre-existing condition; seniors are saving money on prescription drugs; insurance companies can no longer drop a woman’s coverage because she becomes pregnant, or kick people off of their insurance plan if they become sick; and. women can no longer be charged substantially higher premiums than men for the same coverage. To shop around for new plans and to compare costs and coverage, visit Covered California’s website, https://www.coveredca.com/. So far, nearly 830,000 people in our state have signed up for health insurance through Covered California. Financial assistance may be available for those who qualify.

02.12.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $2,475,991 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) for the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District (RHFD). The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funds are part of an AFG program called Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER). Funds under the SAFER program are intended to support the hiring of firefighters and the recruitment and retention of volunteer firefighters.“These funds will help make sure the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District has the resources and personnel it needs to respond to emergencies,” said Thompson. “SAFER grants support jobs and help make our communities safer places to live, work and raise a family. I am a proud supporter of the SAFER program, and I thank our firefighters and first responders for their service” “Many thanks to Representative Thompson and his staff for their invaluable assistance,” said Chief Charles Hanley. “On behalf of the Rodeo Hercules Fire District we are very pleased to be awarded a SAFER grant. The funding will be used to restore vital services in the Town of Rodeo and the City of Hercules. The return of local tax dollars will create employment opportunities and keep the help us in our mission to keep the community safe.”The RHFD currently serves an area of 25 square miles, including the City of Hercules and the unincorporated area of Rodeo. This program asks for a relatively small amount of money to recruit, retain, and reward its dedicated volunteers for service to their communities and to reimburse them for classes they take to increase quality of service. The absence of such volunteers would be catastrophic, especially in the event of a large-scale disaster or wildfire.The goal of the SAFER grant is to enhance the ability of fire departments such as the Rodeo-Hercules Fire Protection District to attain and maintain 24-hour staffing and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. The objective of the program is to award grants directly to volunteer, combination, and career fire departments to help the departments increase the number of frontline firefighters, and to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy.In Fiscal Year 2013, the DHS will award approximately $320 million directly to fire departments and volunteer support groups to expand the number of firefighters available to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public with respect to fire and all other hazards.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.11.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Northern California and Bay Area Representatives George Miller (CA-11), Mike Thompson (CA-5), Doris Matsui (CA-6), John Garamendi (CA-3), Jerry McNerney (CA-9), and Anna Eshoo (CA-18) today issued the following statement after legislation aimed to help West Coast farmers and communities during drought conditions was introduced in the U.S. Senate: “While the plan put forward today is a huge improvement from the disingenuous and deeply flawed legislation pushed through the House of Representatives last week by Rep. Valadao, we can still do much better. Particularly troubling in the new Senate bill are aspects that threaten the Northern California environment, economy, and may override protections for critically endangered species like salmon. We appreciate the Senators’ efforts to address the many problems intensified by the drought in California and the West Coast, and we look forward to working with them to change their legislation in such a way to protect the interests of all California stakeholders.” ###
02.11.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following video statement on Black History Month. Video and a full transcript are below. “Hi, I’m Mike Thompson. “This February, I hope you’ll join our community in celebrating Black History Month by recognizing a defining moment in our nation’s history: the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. “This legislation outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin. “No longer could anyone be denied a seat at a lunch counter, a sip of water from a public fountain or the opportunity to go to a certain school because of the color of their skin. “The Civil Rights Act was a giant step towards equality in America. But even 50 years later, there is still a lot of work to be done. “As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. recognized, inequality in America wasn’t limited to racial segregation, it also included economic injustices, which continue today. "What good does it do to be able to eat at a lunch counter if you can't buy a hamburger?" he said. “Another great American, President Lyndon Baines Johnson, said in his State of the Union Address when launching the War on Poverty that, ‘Many Americans live on the outskirts of hope – some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both. Our task is to help replace their despair with opportunity.’ ”Closing our country’s economic and opportunity gap is one of today’s civil rights fights. “And we should start closing it by raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment insurance, improving access to quality education and housing and creating good jobs so hard working families can get ahead. “By working together we can make sure that America is a country where, if you work hard and play by the rules, you can get a job, buy a house, send your kids to college and save for retirement. “50 years ago our nation came together and passed the Civil Rights Act and took a big step towards equality. “As we honor the rich legacy and profound contributions that African Americans have made to our country, let’s honor this 50 year anniversary of the Civil Rights Act by coming together again and taking another giant step towards equality. “Let’s come together and say as one community and one country that in America, no one who works hard should live in poverty and everyone who works hard should have an equal opportunity to succeed. “Thank you.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.06.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today the launch of the first annual Congressional Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) academic competition, known as the House App Challenge, for the 5th Congressional District. Established by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this nationwide competition invites high school students from all participating congressional districts to compete by creating and exhibiting their software application, or “app,” for mobile, tablet, or computer devices. It is designed to promote innovation and engagement in the STEM education fields. “This is an excellent opportunity for students in our communities to further their interest and involvement in science, technology, engineering and math,” said Thompson. “Estimates show 8.5 million STEM jobs will be created in the next decade, but they also show the United States will face a shortage of one million STEM graduates. That’s why the House App Contest is so important. STEM is where the jobs of the future will be and we need to do everything possible to encourage our students to pursue an education in STEM fields.” The House App Contest is open to all high school students who live in or are eligible to attend public schools located in the 5th Congressional District. In order to participate in the competition, students must provide a YouTube or VIMEO video demo explaining their app and what they learned through the competition during the submission period which runs from February 1, 2014 to April 30, 2014. More details on submitting a contest entry, the rules of the competition, and helpful programming resources can be found at StudentAppChallenge.house.gov.

02.05.2014	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against the House Majority’s California water bill, H.R. 3964. The legislation would allow water to be pumped south from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for as long as water is available, and it would undo the San Joaquin River restoration, an agreement to reconnect the river with the Pacific Ocean and reintroduce salmon flows. Thompson spoke in opposition to H.R. 3964 today on the House floor. Text of his remarks and video are below. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 229-191. It is not expected to be considered by the Senate and President Obama’s advisors have said that they would recommend the President veto the bill if it reached his desk. “Thank you Madam Chair. “Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this bill – a bill that would destroy jobs, does nothing to address the real problem, the drought, and ignores more than twenty years of established science. “What’s the bill do? “Will this bill help alleviate the drought? No. Even if we pumped as much water as possible, Central Valley farmers still wouldn’t have enough. There isn’t enough water to go around. We’re in an extreme drought. The worst in the last century. You can look at these photographs and see the snowpack last year versus the snowpack this year. We’re in bad straights. And it’s a drought. It’s not a manmade problem. It’s a drought. “Will this bill kill jobs? Yes. The Delta supports thousands of jobs in farming, fishing and tourism, and has an economic output of more than $4 billion a year. This bill puts those jobs in jeopardy. “Will this bill harm drinking water that millions of people rely on? Yes. When clean water is pumped south, the level of salt water in the Delta increases. People can’t drink seawater. “The entire state of California is in a drought. You saw it in today’s USA Today. There are towns without water. There are more towns in line to lose all the water they have. And it’s not due to a lack of pumping because of a quote-unquote little fish. It’s due to the lack of snow and the lack of rain. “Now I know this is personal for many of my colleagues. It’s personal to me too. Many of the towns that I represent are running out of water. My home town is rationing water – 65 gallons per person, per day. It’s a real, real serious problem. “I understand the concerns of the Central Valley farmers. Ag is big in my district too and this drought is hurting my constituents as well. Because of these dry conditions, grapevines will experience an early bud this year. And without water to protect the early bud from the frost, we have no crops. Out of business. But it’s a drought that’s causing the problem. “Proponents of this bill say those who oppose it care more about fish than people. These comments cheapen the debate, they insult the intelligence of Californians, and are not based on facts. “As a UC Berkeley professor of agriculture and resource economics stated in the paper today, Michael Hanemann, he said you could kill every fish in the Delta and you still would have a real problem. “Simply put, this bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to use this drought as an excuse to pump water from other users – and to do so with zero regard for the people who depend on that water for their livelihoods. “It would be more productive for this body to join in a rain dance on the floor today than to pass this bill. “Our people, our constituents deserve better than this politically-driven bill. They deserve solutions. “I ask for a ‘No Vote’ on the bill.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.04.2014	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson’s (D-CA-5) legislation, The Crop Insurance Accountability Act of 2013 (H.R. 2260), passed the Senate today as part of the compromise long term reauthorization of the Farm Bill (H.R. 2642) and is expected to be signed into law. The bipartisan Crop Insurance Accountability Act, co-authored by Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE-1), enhances conservation by incentivizing responsible farming practices. Under this legislation, in order for farmers to qualify for taxpayer subsidies of crop insurance, they must meet basic conservation requirements that minimize the impact to some of our most sensitive areas such as highly erodible lands and wetlands. “This new law will achieve two important goals. American farmers will continue having a strong and reliable crop insurance safety net, and our most sensitive lands will be protected and conserved,” said Thompson. “This is an excellent example of what we can accomplish if we work across the aisle to achieve common goals. This law is a win for American farmers – they will be protected. And this law is a win for our wetlands and highly erodible areas – they will be conserved.” The bipartisan Crop Insurance Accountability Act: Applies to annually-tilled crops grown on highly erodible lands (HEL) or any crops in wetlands, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); Requires farmers in these areas to file a conservation plan with USDA that states how they will reduce and offset impacts in these areas; Requires farmers to be in compliance according to their USDA-approved conservation plan in order to receive federal subsidies for their crop insurance premiums; Delays the date for producers to come into compliance who are subject to conservation compliance for the first time for five years; Allows for all appeal processes to be exhausted before farmers are found to be out of compliance; and Provides exemptions for circumstances beyond the farmers control and actions taken in good faith. Currently, crop insurance for farmers is subsidized by an average of 62 percent. The Crop Insurance Accountability Act would require farmers to meet a certain conservation compliance standard to continue qualifying for subsidized crop insurance. If a farmer chooses not to participate in conservation compliance or is found to be out of compliance, they may still purchase crop insurance but would be responsible for 100 percent of the insurance premium. Since the 1985 Farm Bill, conservation compliance has been required for participation in many farm bill programs. The 1996 Farm Bill disconnected conservation compliance from crop insurance premium subsidies and instead tied it to the direct payments, or fixed payments, farmers receive every year based on their land’s production history. The Farm Bill that passed the House essentially eliminated direct payments, and in doing so also ended conservation compliance requirements for many of those crops and lands. The Crop Insurance Accountability Act re-links conservation compliance measures to crop insurance premium subsidies. Reps. Thompson and Fortenberry originally introduced the Crop Insurance Accountability Act on June 5th, 2013, and was supported by: the American Farm Bureau Federation, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Defenders of Wildlife, Ducks Unlimited, Environmental Defense Fund, Environmental Working Group, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Association of State Conservation Agencies, National Corn Growers Association, National Farmers Union, National Wildlife Federation, Pheasants Forever, The Nature Conservancy, World Wildlife Fund. H.R. 2642, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act of 2013 (the Farm Bill) passed the House on January 29th, 2014 by a bipartisan vote of 251-166. It passed the Senate by a bipartisan vote of 68-32 and is expected to be signed into law by President Obama in the coming days.

02.04.2014	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Anna Eshoo (CA-18) today introduced H.R. 3986, the Fair Access to Health Care Act. The legislation would expand the eligibility for premium tax credits for people living in high-cost areas who purchase health insurance through the federal and state exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). “A middle class income means different things in different parts of the country,” said Thompson. “In some California cities, the cost of living is far higher than the national average. Because of the across-the-board income thresholds set by the ACA, some hard working families in high-cost areas like ours don’t qualify for subsides and therefore can’t get affordable insurance. This bill will help make affordable health insurance a reality, no matter where someone lives.” “The Affordable Care Act is helping low to middle-income Americans buy private health insurance with subsidies adjusted to their income level,” said Eshoo. “While this is tremendously helpful to millions of individuals and families, there are others in high-cost areas, like those in my home district of Silicon Valley, who cannot benefit because the threshold to qualify for subsidies does not account for the cost of living. The Fair Access to Health Act ties health insurance subsidies to the cost of living of a geographic area instead of to the national federal poverty level. In doing so, we can expand access to health insurance and improve our nation’s health.” Currently the ACA allows those making between 138 and 400 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to qualify for premium tax credits to help them purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. At this level, an individual making up to $45,960 and a family of four making up to $94,200 qualify for premium tax credits. However, the income threshold used to determine eligibility for these tax credits doesn’t take into account the cost of living for different geographic areas. A family living in New York City or San Francisco is treated the same as a family living in a small town in South Carolina or Texas. The Fair Access to Health Care Act would allow the premium tax credits offered through the ACA to be increased proportionally based on an area’s cost of living. Under the bill, the federal poverty level threshold will increase proportionally based on an area’s cost of living above the national average cost-of-living. The cost-of-living is determined using the Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM). For example, using this calculation: In the San Francisco-Oakland-Freemont, California Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), a family of four earning up to $125,757 and individuals earning up to $61,356 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Vallejo-Fairfield, CA MSA, a family of four earning up to $109,743 and an individual earning up to $53,543 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Napa, CA MSA a family of four earning up to $116,808 and individuals earning up to$56,990 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. In the Santa Rosa-Petaluma, CA MSA a family of four earning up to $113,746 and individuals earning up to $55,496 could qualify for premium tax credits to purchase health insurance through the ACA’s exchanges. Precedent already exists in the ACA for such cost-of-living adjustments. The ACA accounts for the cost-of-living differences in Alaska and Hawaii by using a higher income threshold to determine subsidy eligibility. The Fair Access to Health Care Act would provide similar adjustments to the other 48 states. Individuals and families from low-cost geographical areas will not be impacted by this legislation. Those earning up to 400 percent of the FPL would still be eligible for subsides and no region would see a reduction from their current subsidy level. ###
01.30.2014	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, Alan Lowenthal (CA-47) and Elizabeth Esty (CT-5) today introduced a House Resolution that calls for renewed congressional action in dealing with the ever-growing impact of gun violence on American communities. The legislation is endorsed by the Newtown Action Alliance. The House Resolution expresses that gun violence is a public health issue and commits Congress to enacting by the end of the 113th Congress common sense steps to curb gun violence without hindering Americans’ Second Amendment rights. The House Resolution is as follows:“Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that gun violence is a public health issue and Congress should enact by the end of the 113th Congress comprehensive Federal legislation that protects the Second Amendment and keeps communities safe and healthy, including expanding enforceable background checks for all commercial gun sales, improving the mental health system in the United States, and making gun trafficking and straw purchasing a Federal crime.”“When more than 30 people a day are killed by someone using a gun, inaction isn’t an option,” Chairman Mike Thompson said. “Congress needs to act and we need to start by passing my bipartisan bill to expand comprehensive and enforceable background checks to all commercial firearm sales so that criminals, terrorists and domestic abusers can’t bypass the background system by going to a gun show or buying a gun online with no questions asked.” “There is no need to lay out another statistic about the prevalence of gun violence. It is, as we are seeing on the news on almost a weekly basis, a public health epidemic,” Congressman Alan Lowenthal said. “The only thing more heartbreaking than the damage gun violence has done to families across our nation is the fact that Congress has failed to do anything meaningful about it.” “It’s simply shameful that Congress has not acted to pass commonsense gun violence prevention reform despite the overwhelming support of the American people,” Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty said. “More than a year after the horrific murders at Sandy Hook Elementary School in my district, the price of political inaction is unacceptable and inexcusable.” Of the dozens of bills introduced in the 113th Congress that aimed to reduce the prevalence of gun violence, none of them have been brought to the House Floor for a vote. Reps. Thompson, Lowenthal and Esty are members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, chaired and established by Rep. Thompson in December 2012. Rep. Esty represents the town of Newtown, CT, which experienced the horrific massacre of 20 children and 6 adults at Sandy Hook Elementary on December 14, 2012. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.29.2014	WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $1 million Department of Transportation grant for the California Maritime Academy based in Vallejo, California. The funding will help ensure well-educated and highly skilled U.S. Merchant Marine officers are available to meet our nation’s national security and economic needs. “This important funding will help Cal Maritime prepare brave Merchant Marines for the challenges they will face,” said Thompson. “This is exactly the kind of investment our government should be making. We’re recycling obsolete ships and using the funding to prepare our next generation of maritime professionals.” The funding for this grant came from the sale of obsolete vessels from the Maritime Administration’s National Defense Reserve Fleet, which were purchased for recycling. As required by the National Maritime Heritage Act, 25 percent of the profit from sales is distributed to maritime academies for facility and training ship maintenance, repair, and modernization, and for the purchase of simulators and fuel; 25 percent is provided to the National Park Service, which provides grants for maritime heritage activities through the National Maritime Heritage Grants Program; and 50 percent funds the acquisition, maintenance, and repair of vessels in the National Defense Reserve Fleet. The nation’s maritime academies train young men and women for service in the American merchant marine, the U.S. Armed Forces, and the Nation’s intermodal transportation system. Since 2009, the Maritime Administration has provided more than $8.9 million in funding generated from vessel sales to the state academies and the United States Merchant Marine Academy. The Maritime Administration promotes a strong U.S. commercial maritime industry through effective training and education of the men and women who will join its ranks upon graduation. The Agency supports maritime academies through direct funding and also provides scholarships through a student incentive payment program to a select number of state maritime academy students who commit to a post-graduation service obligation. The Maritime Administration also provides training vessels to all six state maritime academies for use in at-sea training and as shore side maritime skills and proficiency laboratories. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.29.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s State of the Union Address to Congress:“Tonight the President laid out a clear agenda to expand economic opportunities, create jobs and strengthen the middle class. Many of the steps being taken by President will further this agenda, and as the President said, these actions must be met by a year of action from Congress. “Right now, people across our country feel like no matter how hard they work, they can’t get ahead. Though our economy continues to recover, the middle class has seen their wages stall and their bills soar. When these hard working families look to Washington for answers, all they see is partisan fighting. “This partisan gridlock must be set aside and Congress must take action. We need to work across the aisle to raise the minimum wage, pass immigration reform, expand affordable educational opportunities, and make job-creating investments in infrastructure, manufacturing and renewable energy. By taking these actions we can strengthen our middle class, lower our deficit and grow our economy. “We must also work together to make our country a safer place. It has been more than a year since the tragic shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. In that time, more than 12,000 people have been killed by someone using a gun. Too many lives are being cut short and Congress is doing nothing. While no one bill will end all gun violence, taking simple steps like passing my bipartisan background checks bill to keep guns out of dangerous hands and save lives while respecting the Second Amendment. “Making sure our communities are safe and our middle class is strong is what I’m fighting for in Congress. It’s what our families, children and grandchildren deserve, and it’s what makes our country great. America has always been place where, if you work hard and play by the rules, you get a job, buy a house, send your kids to college and save for retirement. That’s the American Dream, and our top goal must be to make sure everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve that dream, no matter on what side of the aisle we sit.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.22.2014	Northern California Members of Congress released the following statements today in response to the California water legislation proposed by Speaker John Boehner (OH-8) and Reps. Devin Nunes (CA-22), David Valadao (CA-21) and Kevin McCarthy (CA-23). The legislation would allow water to be pumped south from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for as long as water is available, or until summer 2015; it would undo portions of the San Joaquin River restoration, an agreement to reconnect the river with the Pacific Ocean and reintroduce salmon flows; and it would create a joint House-Senate Committee to find longer-term solutions to California’s water challenges.Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5): “The current three-year drought is having serious impacts on farmers, families and businesses across California. We need to find science-based solutions to our state’s long-term water challenges. However, this proposal is nothing more than a shallow attempt to use the state-wide drought as an excuse to steal water from the delta. It shows zero regard for the fishers, farmers, families and businesses who depend on the delta for their livelihoods, ignores a half-century of established science, guts environmental protections, harms drinking water and will cause enormous economic hardships across the delta region. The health of the Bay Delta is integral to California’s economy. It supports thousands of jobs in farming, fishing and tourism. Pumping more water south of the delta not only puts these jobs at risk, but will do nothing to alleviate drought conditions. This proposal should be thrown out and solutions to California’s water challenges should be transparent, based on sound science, and developed with all stakeholders at the table so that those who depend on the delta to make a living aren’t left high and dry.” Rep. George Miller (CA-11): “Clearly, we need to solve problems for the benefit of the entire state- and I look forward to working towards a solution with my colleagues in Congress to do just that. But this attempt to gut federal and state environmental and water protections without sound science or considering the economic toll on the Northern California economy does not help. Doing so is not only misguided- it’s dangerous. The fact is, the Endangered Species Act does not control pumping operations in the Delta, and is not expected to significantly reduce water supplies this year. Rather, the lack of rain, low storage in reservoirs, and low river flows – not environmental laws – are the major causes of low water allocations across the State. Environmental protections in the Delta and our state’s rivers not only protect delta smelt, salmon and other endangered fish species, but also tens of thousands of jobs in fishing, tourism, and farming in Northern California, while also ensuring drinking water quality for millions of Californians. Putting those interests at risk for the benefit of Central Valley agribusiness is not a sustainable compromise. Instead, by working together to conserve water and by making smart investments in conservation, recycling, and other innovative solutions, we can sustain our economy and environment even while facing an extreme drought.”Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-3): “California is enduring a severe drought, which has negatively affected the families, farmers, and small business owners in the Delta region and throughout the state. This bill would allow south of the Delta water contractors and their allies who want to steal water from the Delta to do so, further exacerbating the problem. It ignores environmental protections, water quality issues, and the health of the Delta. This bill is not a solution to California’s water challenges. To steal from one community to benefit is unacceptable.”Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-6): “There is no question that we need serious proposals to tackle California’s long-term water woes. Unfortunately, the legislation unveiled today by Speaker Boehner and three other House Republicans is not the answer. This proposal is a water grab, plain and simple. Modeled after legislation that failed last Congress, it guts the Endangered Species Act, and would allow more water to be pumped from the Delta, regardless of whether or not the Delta has the water to spare. Sucking the Delta dry is not the answer to California’s water issues. We need long-term solutions that will benefit the entire state, and should be working together to solve California’s water problems through a balanced approach. This proposal is anything but balanced and will only create further discord.”Rep. John Garamendi (CA-3): “I’d like to welcome Speaker Boehner to California. The severity of the drought our state is facing certainly warrants it. I hope the Speaker will be interested in meeting the family farmers, fishermen, and recreational business owners whose livelihoods depend on a healthy Delta, and I will be happy to introduce him. If he’d like to learn more about smart investments we can make in water recycling, conservation, storage, and levee construction that create more water for the entire state, I’d love to walk him through my comprehensive water plan for all California communities. I’d also like to caution the Speaker to not forget about the missteps of the Westlands Water District, particularly why it was a bad idea for farmers in that district, given their decades-long federal water contract, to plant permanent tree crops when dry years were inevitable.”Rep. Ami Bera (CA-7): “For the third year in a row, drought and dry conditions are hurting many families, small businesses, and farmers in Sacramento County and beyond. Folsom Lake is already at historically low levels, and pumping more water south, not only puts jobs and our local economy at risk, but also does nothing to address the underlying problem, and only further exacerbates our local water shortage. We need to find both real solutions to address this crisis in the short-term, and a comprehensive plan for securing water access and storage throughout the state. This proposal, however, is a misguided effort to use the state-wide drought as an excuse to take much-needed water from one area of our state and send it to another.” ###
01.21.2014	Northern California Congress Members Mike Thompson (CA-5), George Miller (CA-11), Doris Matsui (CA-6), Jerry McNerney and John Garamendi (CA-3) released the following statement today in response to the National Review's story on the California drought. The story on California's drought was also discussed on MSNBC's Morning Joe. "The California drought, now in its third and most severe year, cannot be oversimplified as farmers versus fish. It is a very real challenge that is having serious impacts on farmers, families and businesses across the entire state. However, taking more water from the Bay Delta is not the answer and would lead to even greater problems that go far beyond the survival of the endangered salmon and delta smelt. "This is not an issue of putting environmental protections above the well-being of people as the story alleges. The health of the Bay Delta is integral to the Northern California economy. It supports thousands of jobs in farming, fishing and tourism. Pumping more water south of the delta puts these jobs at risk and will cause additional economic hardships across our state."Moreover, the author's assertion that environmental regulations to protect delta smelt, salmon, and other endangered wildlife populations are limiting water supplies for agricultural use is based on a misunderstanding of federal law. In fact, state regulators agree that the rules have little effect on the level of water exports in extremely dry years such as this. Simply put, there isn't enough water to export in the first place. Drought, not the Endangered Species Act, is the cause of water supply shortages. “California is now on pace for the driest year in our history as a state. Despite the very real risk of extended dry conditions, agriculture interests in the valley planted permanent tree crops that require a steady supply of water that is just not available. Ultimately, the only solution that works for the entire state is a statewide plan to generate new water. "California's farmers help feed our country and making sure they have a reliable water supply is an important concern to everyone. That's why we need to invest in things like water recycling, conservation, and storage. By making these investments, we can create millions of gallons of new water, help farmers better plan, and create good jobs while not risking the health of the bay delta and the families, farmers and small businesses who depend on it for their livelihoods." ###
01.17.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) legislative language that holds the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accountable for ending the backlog of claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration was passed by the House and Senate and will be signed into law. The language was included with H.R. 3547, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 omnibus appropriations bill.“This law will help hold the VA accountable for making sure our veterans and their families receive the benefits they have earned,” said Thompson. “No one who has served our nation in the Armed Forces should be forced to wait nearly a year for care and benefits because their local VA is backlogged. With this law in place, we will be able to make sure the VA continues to do everything possible to get this problem fixed.” In a meeting last week with VA Undersecretary for Benefits Allison Hickey, Thompson spoke about this legislation and the need to substantially reduce the backlog at the Oakland Regional VA. Currently, new claims by veterans can take almost 300 days to process, delaying access to care and benefits. Many California veterans in the 5th Congressional District are serviced by the Oakland Regional Office which has one of the longest claims backlog in the country. Thompson has called on President Obama to personally intervene and address this issue. He has also visited the Oakland Regional Office with senior officials from the VA, held regular meetings on the status of efforts to reduce the claims backlog, and helped pass legislation to speed up the transfer of electronic service records from the Department of Defense to the VA to help speed up the claims processing process. The language included in H.R. 3547 will require a monthly report from each regional office and the national VA office detailing the current backlog of claims. Additional reporting will be required from offices with backlogs averaging more than 200 days. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.17.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) bipartisan provision requiring every American flag purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent of grown, produced or manufactured in the United States, was passed by the House of Representatives and Senate, and will be signed into law. “This provision will make sure every American flag DOD buys is made in America, by American workers with American products,” said Thompson. “I am proud to have worked to pass this law so that our men and women in uniform never have to fight under a U.S. flag made overseas, and so that our Defense Department never again spends American tax dollars on a U.S. flag made overseas.” Thompson’s provision applies the Berry Amendment to the American Flag. The Berry Amendment, originally passed in 1941, prohibits DOD funds from being used to acquire food, clothing, military uniforms, fabrics, stainless steel, and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the United States, except in rare exceptions. Thompson’s provision applies the same rules for the DOD’s acquisition of American Flags, which previously were not listed as a covered item. Precedent already exists for such a provision. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase U.S.-made American Flags for serivcemembers’ funerals. Thompson’s provision passed as part of H.R. 3547, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 omnibus appropriations bill.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.14.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released a statement today on the $58.5 million included in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2014 omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 3547) to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). The funding in the FY 2014 omnibus appropriations bill represents a $41.7 million increase in funding from FY 2013 levels. The additional funds will be used to help states improve data submissions to NICS. “Making sure our background checks system has up-to-date information is an important step towards making sure criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill can’t get their hands on guns. I applaud our appropriators for providing millions of dollars in new funding to help state’s get their most current and comprehensive data into the NICS system. “Now we need to finish the job by expanding comprehensive and enforceable background checks to all commercial firearm sales so these same prohibited purchasers can’t bypass the NICS system by going to a gun show or buying a gun online.” In February 2013, Thompson’s task force specifically recommended taking immediate action to ensure the NICS database was up-to-date. A full copy of the task force’s report, including principle six dealing with NICS, can be seenhere. Additionally, Thompson and U.S. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) are co-authors of H.R. 1565, bipartisan legislation to expand the current background check system to all commercial gun sales. Joining them are original co-authors Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by A-rated NRA Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA).

01.13.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement after Congressman George Miller announced he would retire after serving 40 years in Congress:“This is the biggest public service loss to California in my lifetime. George leaving Congress will have a greater impact on our state than any past retirement from public office. During his 40 years of service, he has championed issues important to our communities, state and nation including improvements to education, job creation, conservation, deficit reduction and labor rights, while playing a leading role in reforming our health care system and protecting the Bay Delta. And, he was always willing to work with anyone, on any side of the aisle, to better his district and our county. “Congress and California will miss George and his leadership – and I will miss one of my closest colleagues and friends. It has been a high honor to serve with George for so many years, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him for the remainder of his current term and beyond to better our communities and state.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.09.2014	– U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today reiterated his call on the House Majority to pass legislation extending emergency unemployment insurance as $64,858,382 was drained from California’s economy during the first week of expired federal benefits. On December 28th, nearly 214,000 people in California lost an average $303 weekly benefit when the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired. An additional 12,531 people in California will lose benefits each week during the first half of 2014. These figures are based on Department of Labor (DOL) data. “When folks get emergency unemployment insurance, they don’t save it. This money is spent on rent, groceries and utilities. It supports jobs and businesses in our community,” said Thompson. “Not only is emergency unemployment insurance an important economic lifeline that helps make sure millions of American families are able to heat their homes and put food on the table as they look for a job, it’s a strong economic stimulant. Failing to extend these benefits hurts economic growth, and the only way to solve long-term unemployment is by creating jobs and growing our economy. This self inflicted economic drain will only get worse as more than 12,000 people will lose their benefits each week until Congress acts. We need to extend these benefits now.”Based on DOL data, $400 million was drained from the U.S. economy during the first week of expired federal emergency unemployment insurance. An additional 72,000 Americans will lose emergency unemployment insurance each week during the first half of 2014. The federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program took effect in 2008 when it was signed into law by President George W. Bush, and has been reauthorized several times as our economy continues to recover from the worst downturn since the Great Depression. Despite the economic progress made since 2008, there are still more than 1 million fewer jobs than there were before the recession began, and more than 4 million Americans have been out of work for six months or longer. Failure to extend federal emergency unemployment insurance will cost our economy 240,000 jobs, including 46,000 jobs in California, over the next year – hurting economic growth and making it harder for the unemployed to find work. Thompson is a co-author of H.R. 3546, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2013. H.R. 3546 would extend emergency unemployment insurance for one year and has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

01.08.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on the three year anniversary of the shooting in Tucson, Arizona in which former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded: “Three years ago today, my good friend and former colleague, Gabby Giffords, was meeting her constituents at a public event when a gunman opened fire on the crowd. Gabby, Rep. Ron Barber, and 11 others were wounded. Six were killed. “In the three years since, we’ve witnessed more incidences of horrific gun violence in places like Aurora, Colorado, Newtown, Connecticut, and the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. Also in the three years since, the House of Representatives hasn’t done one thing to help reduce or prevent acts of gun violence. “When seemingly regular acts of mass gun violence afflict our communities, and more than 30 people are killed every day by someone using a gun, inaction is unacceptable. “With the help of Rep. Ron Barber, Gabby’s former district representative, and my Democratic colleagues in the House, my task force developed a comprehensive set of policy principles that respect the Second Amendment and will prevent and reduce gun violence. We should act on these principles, and we should start by passing bipartisan background check legislation that will help keep guns out of dangerous hands.”Thompson and U.S. Rep. Pete King (R-NY) are co-authors of H.R. 1565, bipartisan legislation to expand the current background check system to all commercial gun sales.

01.07.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, issued the following statement after the Senate voted to begin consideration of a bipartisan three-month extension of emergency unemployment insurance (S. 1845) on a vote of 60 to 37: “Today’s bipartisan vote in the Senate is a positive step towards reinstating an important economic lifeline that millions of Americans depend on as they make the transition from joblessness to employment,” said Thompson.“Even though our economy continues to improve, there is still just one job for every three unemployed workers. People want to work, but they’re out of a job through no fault of their own. The House Majority should follow the Senate’s lead and end their refusal to take up legislation that boosts our economy, and helps make sure millions of American families are able to heat their homes and put food on the table as they look for a job.” At the end of December, 1.3 million Americans lost emergency unemployment insurance, including 214,000 Californians, when the program expired. An additional 325,800 people in California will lose their coverage in the first six months of 2014 if no action is taken, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. In California, more than 12,500 people will lose their benefits each week going forward if no action is taken. The federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program took effect in 2008 when it was signed into law by President George W.

01.03.2014	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement today on the Obama Administration’s announcement of two new executive actions to strengthen the federal background check system. “These important executive actions will strengthen our criminal background check system and go a long way towards helping make sure guns don’t get into the wrong hands,” said Thompson. “The evidence shows background checks work when they are used. Last year, background checks identified and denied 88,000 sales to prohibited purchasers at licensed dealers. However, there is no way of knowing if those 88,000 prohibited purchasers, after being denied at a licensed dealer, then bought a gun at a gun show or over the Internet with no questions asked. This is a huge loophole that costs lives, and that’s why we need to pass my bipartisan background check bill expanding comprehensive and enforceable criminal background checks to cover commercial firearm sales such as those at gun shows and over the Internet.” The two announced executive actions will help make sure better and more reliable information makes its way into the background check system. The first executive action involves a proposed rule issued by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to clarify terminology used by federal law to prohibit people from purchasing a firearm for certain mental health reasons. Many states have noted current terminology is ambiguous. The second executive action involves a proposed regulation issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to address barriers preventing states from submitting limited information on individuals prohibited from purchasing a firearm for mental health reasons to the federal background check system. Some states have said that the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act’s (HIPAA) privacy provisions may be preventing them from making relevant information available to the federal background check system. The proposed rule will not change the fact that seeking help for mental health problems or getting treatment does not make someone legally prohibited from having a firearm. Furthermore, nothing in the proposed rule would require reporting on general mental health visits or other routine mental health care Thompson and U.S. Rep.

12.20.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that his bipartisan legislation to improve treatment options for active duty soldiers with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) has passed in both the Senate and House and is expected to be signed into law by the President. The legislation, which passed as a part of H.R. 3304, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014, allows service members to access innovative treatments offered outside military medical facilities. “The fact that this legislation is finally being signed into law is great news for our nation’s brave servicemembers,” said Thompson. “With so many of our troops returning from overseas with brain injuries, we need to make sure they have access to the very best care our country has to offer, no matter where it is provided. Because of this law, our heroes will be able to access cutting-edge care, even if it’s offered outside of our military medical facilities.” Thompson’s legislation, co-authored in the House by Rep. Pete Sessions (R-TX-32), creates a pilot program that allows military patients to receive treatment from health care facilities outside of the Department of Defense that are utilizing an array of leading-edge, successful therapies to treat TBI and PTS.Under Thompson’s and Sessions’ legislation, physicians and residential treatment centers like The Pathway Home in Yountville, CA may qualify for payment from the Department of Defense by participating in this investigational pilot program. Treatment safeguards in the legislation ensure servicemembers will have access to innovative private treatments while protecting their health and privacy.“The passage of HR 3304 is a welcome acknowledgment by Congress of the sacrifices made by our country's warriors by supporting opportunities for them to avail themselves to all realms of quality care that exists today,” said Fred Gusman, Executive Director of the Pathway Home in Yountville. “Nonprofits like The Pathway Home, Inc. - a Joint Commission accredited residential treatment center which has served for nearly six years as a viable referral resource for the VA system as well as military installations - might now possibly be reimbursed for the services it provides. Congressman Thompson and Rep. Session's leadership in introducing and championing this legislation will further the collaboration between all those entities that share in the singular share mission of caring for those who’ve given their all.” To reach the long-term objective of incorporating leading-edge medical practices into military hospitals, Thompson’s and Sessions’ TBI treatment initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the program, encouraging a constant flow of new and innovative treatments.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

12.16.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson’s (CA-5) helped lead an effort on Thursday to fix the out-dated formula used to determine Medicare reimbursement payments through the House Committee on Ways and Means. Currently, Medicare reimburses physicians according to the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI), an index based on cost of living, cost of providing care, cost of malpractice insurance and other provider costs. Counties in California are put into one of nine separate reimbursement localities based on the GPCI formula. Counties with similar GPCIs are supposed to be put in the same reimbursement locality. However, Sonoma County, which despite having a high cost of living, it is classified as a rural county. Because of this out-dated rural classification, physicians are being reimbursed at a level that doesn’t accurately reflect the costs of providing care in that area. A legislative fix, advocated for by Thompson, was passed unanimously by the House Committee on Ways and Means to correct this by updating the outdated payment localities to the current Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), which is the same way Medicare currently pays hospitals. “Medical professionals in Sonoma County who care for Medicare beneficiaries are not being reimbursed at the appropriate, up-to-date levels,” said Thompson. “This fix will make sure Sonoma County’s medical professionals get reimbursed at levels similar to those in neighboring, urban-classified counties. And, it will help protect and improve access to care.” “The California Medical Association sends a huge thanks to Congressman Mike Thompson for his strong leadership and advocacy on behalf of California physicians and their patients to enact Medicare reforms that will protect and improve access to care in Northern California,” said Dr. Richard Thorp, President of the California Medical Association. The fix advocated by Thompson was included in an amendment to H.R. 2810, the Medicare Patient Access and Quality Improvement Act of 2013 which was passed unanimously by the House Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday, December 12th, 2013. The amended version of H.R. 2810 will now be combined with a similar proposal considered by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, and could go to the House floor for a vote as early as next month.

12.13.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-15) introduced the bipartisan Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act, legislation that provides expedited tax relief for Americans making charitable donations in support of Typhoon Haiyan recovery efforts in the Philippines. The legislation, H.R. 3771 was co-authored by Reps. Eric Swalwell (D-CA-15), Darrell Issa (R-CA-49) and Joe Heck (R-NV-3). A Senate companion bill was introduced by Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-HI) and Dean Heller (R-NV).While there was an immediate outpouring of donations and other assistance following the Typhoon Haiyan this November, the length of the rebuilding process means contributions are still needed now and in the months ahead. This bill is intended to spur donations to charitable organizations by allowing taxpayers who donate to the relief efforts to receive tax benefits nearly a year faster than usual.“When tragedy strikes around the world, the folks in our country don’t sit on the sideline – they help,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5). “Our allies in the Philippines are still in the early stages of a long-term rebuilding effort and this bipartisan legislation will make sure that our communities are able to provide the help our friends need during this important phase of rebuilding and recovery.” The tax code provides a delayed incentive for making charitable contributions. Taxpayers can claim a tax deduction for contributions they make to charities, but they receive the tax incentive many months later after they file their tax returns the following year. The Philippines Charitable Giving Assistance Act eliminates this delay. The bill would allow taxpayers who donate to the relief efforts in the Philippines before March 1, 2014 to take the charitable deduction when they file their 2013 tax returns. H.R. 3771 was referred to the House Committee on the Budget and the House Committee on Ways and Means, on which Thompson serves as a senior member.

12.13.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Pete King (R-NY) released the following statement on tomorrow’s one-year anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. “One year ago today our nation witnessed a horrific tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. In the year since more than 10,000 people have been killed by someone using a gun and Congress has done nothing to reduce gun violence. That is unacceptable. Congress needs to act, and we should start by passing our bipartisan background check bill so that criminals, terrorists, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill do not have easy access to guns. 187 of our colleagues have co-authored this legislation and more have said they’d vote for it if the bill was brought to the floor. It’s time to get this bill passed and signed into law,” said Thompson and King in a joint statement. King and Thompson are co-authors of H.R. 1565, bipartisan legislation to expand the current background check system to all commercial gun sales. Joining them are original co-authors Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR).

12.12.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted in favor of House Joint Resolution 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. This legislation is a result of the deal struck by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray (D-WA). The legislation sets concrete spending levels for the next two fiscal years and partially replaces across-the-board sequestration cuts mandated by the 2011 Budget Control Act. “This bipartisan budget deal doesn’t include everything I want, nor does it include everything Republicans want. It’s a compromise and both sides had to give,” said Thompson. “While this deal is far from perfect, it provides our country with fiscal stability, allowing us to avert another costly government shutdown, and it eases the job-killing, across the board sequestration cuts. Now we need to build on this modest compromise and focus on finding a long-term budget solution that lowers our debt and deficit by creating jobs, growing our economy, cutting spending, and requiring everyone to pay their fair share.”“We also need to extend unemployment insurance since the House Majority refused to include an extension in today’s budget deal,” Thompson continued. “Cutting off these benefits hurts families, is bad for our communities and our economy. That is why I have co-authored separate legislation extending these important benefits for one year.”The resolution passed by a bipartisan vote of 332-94. It now goes to the Senate where it is expected to be voted on next week.

The report, Guns, Public Health and Mental Illness: An Evidence-Based Approach for Federal Policy, comes from the Consortium for Risk-Based Firearm Policy, a coalition of the nation’s leading researchers, practitioners and advocates in gun violence prevention and mental and public health. A full copy of the report is available here. “Improving our mental health system is an important piece of the puzzle when it comes to reducing and preventing gun violence,” said Thompson. “This report provides evidence based recommendations for federal policy from mental and public health experts. We need to listen to the experts and act on their recommendations.”Recommendations for federal policy offered by the Consortium include making an addition to existing federal mental health firearm disqualification criteria; updating the current process and standards for restoration of an individual’s ability to purchase and possess firearms, following a federal disqualification due to mental illness; as well as enacting new prohibitions on an individual’s ability to purchase buy and possess a firearm based on the presence of evidence-based risk factors for violence such as a prior conviction for a violent misdemeanor.“Every year tens of thousands of families mourn the loss of loved ones who have died by their own hand or by the hand of angry or disturbed partners or relatives, not to mention the victims of predatory violence by armed criminals,” said Richard Bonnie, director of the University of Virginia Law School’s Institute of Law, Psychiatry and Public Policy and the Harrison Foundation professor of medicine and law. “The relation between mental illness, violence and firearms is a complex problem without a single solution. The most prudent response is likely to be a series of small but firm steps on many different fronts. That is the approach we are offering today.”“Far too many people with backgrounds indicating that they are at high risk for committing violence are able to purchase and own firearms under current federal law,” said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research and a member of the Consortium that issued the report. “Research has shown that policies which expand firearm prohibitions for high-risk individuals are associated with significant reductions in violence and fewer lives cut short from gun violence.”“We agree with Vice President Biden that increased public funding is important for improved mental health care, but we also need to make sure that those with an elevated risk of violence don’t have access to firearms,” said Josh Horwitz, Consortium member and executive director of the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence. “The approach that this esteemed group of mental and public health experts offers takes the next step toward stopping gun violence in this country.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.# # #
12.10.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on Vice President Biden's announcement of $100 million in additional funding made available to expand and improve mental health services. $50 million will come through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to help community centers provide more mental health services. The second half of the money, made available through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), will help finance rural mental health facilities. "Improving our mental health system and expanding access to mental health care are essential components of gun violence prevention," said Thompson. "Because of the Affordable Care Act, millions of Americans are gaining access to the mental health services they need, but otherwise wouldn't have. While we know those living with mental illness are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, making sure those who need care can get care makes our communities safer and helps prevent and reduce gun violence." In February, Thompson's Gun Violence Prevention Task Force released a comprehensive set of policy principles designed to reduce gun violence while respecting the Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. While recognizing that the vast majority of people living with a mental illness are non-violent and are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, one of the task force's principles focused exclusively on expanding access to mental health care and improving our nation's mental health care system. Under the ACA, mental health and substance abuse disorder care is being expanded to approximately 60 million Americans -- including 7,559,000 Californians -- representing one of the largest expansions of mental health and substance use disorder coverage in a generation.Because of the health care law, for the first time insurance companies in the individual and small group market are required to cover mental health and substance use disorder services at parity with medical and surgical benefits. This means mental health care must be offered at costs comparable to coverage for medical and surgical care. An estimated one in five adults experiences a mental illness in any given year. While most mental illnesses are treatable, those with mental illness too often cannot access needed treatment if they do not have health insurance that covers mental health services. The Affordable Care Act requires most health plans to cover recommended preventive services like depression screenings for adults and behavioral assessments for children at no cost to consumers. And, because of the law, starting in 2014 insurers will not be able to deny coverage or charge individuals more due to pre-existing conditions, including mental illnesses.

12.06.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) introduced bipartisan legislation expanding access to mental health care for Medicare recipients. H.R. 3662, the Mental Health Access Improvement Act, will add thousands of highly qualified licensed mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists (MFTs) to the network of providers eligible to serve Medicare beneficiaries.“Access to quality mental health care shouldn’t be dependent on how old you are, where you live or how much money you make,” said Thompson. “This legislation will allow thousands of mental health care professionals to provide quality, affordable care to people on Medicare, and it will save money. Right now, there are more than 600 licensed MFTs in my congressional district and more than 31,000 licensed MFTs in California that can provide quality mental health services. Our goal should be to expand access to these professionals and the comprehensive and quality care they provide, not limit it.” Medicare currently recognizes psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers and psychiatric nurses to provide covered mental health services. However, mental health counselors and MFTs, who have equivalent education and training to clinical social workers and provide roughly 40 percent of mental health services, are not eligible to be reimbursed by Medicare. H.R. 3662 would fix this discrepancy by making mental health counselors and MFTs eligible to serve Medicare beneficiaries, adding more than 165,000 licensed practitioners to the Medicare program.Studies have shown that seniors in the Medicare program are often at the highest risk for mental health problems that are not part of the normal aging process such as depression, anxiety, mood disorders and suicide. Many of these mental illnesses can be diagnosed and properly treated if the appropriate care is available, sought and accessed. However, if left untreated, it can lead to higher medical costs and negative health effects. Currently, Medicare beneficiaries who were seeking mental health services from mental health counselors or MFTs prior to their eligibility for Medicare, often stop receiving treatment because their existing provider is not under Medicare. Thompson’s legislation will ensure that seniors have comprehensive access to qualified mental health providers by increasing the pool of mental health professionals that are eligible to serve Medicare beneficiaries.“The National Board for Certified Counselors (NBCC) applauds Representative Thompson for his commitment to ensuring a robust mental health workforce for older Americans,” said Thomas W. Clawson, President and CEO of the National Board for Certified Counselors. “Medicare provides health care to over 49 million people and research shows that fewer than 40% of older adults with mental or substance use disorders obtain treatment. The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act will increase access to needed care by expanding the pool of qualified mental health professionals. Adding mental health counselors and marriage and family therapists as eligible providers will make 200,000 licensed professionals immediately available to the Medicare population. This addition will expand access and reduce costs by providing care in the community and avoiding expensive inpatient services. NBCC commends Representative Thompson for taking a leadership role in this important legislation.” "Members of the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists enthusiastically applaud and support Congressman Mike Thompson's bill to provide greater mental health services to our elderly population,” saidGuillermo Alvarez, Chairman of the California Association of Marriage and Family Therapists. “By allowing Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists to become Medicare providers, many Californians will benefit from their expertise in treating a variety of mental health issues." H.R. 3662 is co-authored by Republican Congressman Chris Gibson (NY-19). The bill has been referred to the House Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means, of which Thompson is a senior member.

11.21.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Kevin Brady (R-TX), senior members of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today introduced bipartisan legislation that will help reduce burdens faced by small businesses and ensure better compliance with complex federal employment tax responsibilities. H.R. 3581, the Small Business Efficiency Act of 2013, would provide clear rules for Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) that are voluntarily certified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect and pay federal employment taxes for their small business clients. The legislation will provide certainty for small businesses that use certified PEO services and allow employers to focus on their business operations, not government paperwork. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and they shouldn’t be held back because of Washington regulations and piles of government paperwork,” said Thompson. “By passing this bill and removing bureaucratic burdens, we can let small businesses focus on what they do best – growing their business, producing quality products and creating good-paying jobs.” PEOs provide human resources services to small business clients. One of the most important tasks that PEOs perform for small businesses is the collection and payment of employment taxes, reducing the amount of burdensome paperwork for small businesses. Currently there is ambiguity about a certified PEO’s (CPEO) ability to assume employment tax responsibility. The Small Business Efficiency Act eliminates this ambiguity by implementing safeguards for the CPEO’s small business clients. To become a certified PEO (CPEO) Thompson and Brady’s legislation requires a PEO to meet certain basic financial conditions, satisfy reporting obligations, and maintain ongoing certification with the IRS. After meeting certification requirements, the CPEO would assume full and sole responsibility and liability for employment taxes due as long as they are certified. The Small Business Efficiency Act creates a voluntary IRS certification process to help PEOs become certified so they can take on small business clients and accept liability for filing payroll taxes for their clients’ employees. Not only will small businesses benefit from the legislation, the federal government directly benefits as well. The IRS has stated that CPEOs would improve compliance with employment tax requirements, reduce the number of returns the IRS has to process, and reduce errors in calculating and paying employment taxes. Presidents Bush and Obama have included very similar proposals in their budget submissions.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California’s 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.19.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05), chair of the bipartisan Invasive Species Caucus, hosted a caucus hearing about the threat invasive species pose to local budgets, agriculture, infrastructure and the environment across California's 5th Congressional District and other communities across the country. “Invasive species pose a costly challenge to our economy, infrastructure, agriculture and the environment,” said Thompson. “In the counties that make up our District, three lakes are rated at the highest risk for a quagga invasion. If such an invasion occurs, it could devastate our local budgets, wreck our water infrastructure and threaten native species. That's why I brought together experts for a bipartisan hearing on the plans Congress and local leaders need to put in place to protect our communities from invasive species before they become a major problem.” At the hearing, members of the Caucus heard from experts about federal coordination of state-based efforts for invasive species control. Thompson asked about quagga mussel control in the state of California and commented on the need for improved prevention activities such as watercraft inspection and decontamination. Thompson also highlighted the need for rapid response to relatively new infestations, such as the tree-of-heaven in California's 5th Congressional District. Co-Chairman Benishek (R-MI-1) mentioned the need for an increased focus on state and local efforts for invasive species such as eurasian milfoil in the Great Lakes. Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA-32), also in attendance, commented on the need for better federal agency coordination in the prevention of infrastructure-damaging invasive species at federal waterways. All members present agreed to an ongoing commitment to work with federal agencies to continue to improve invasive species prevention and control across the country. Experts joining Thompson at the hearing to testify were Susan Mangin, Executive Secretary, Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force; Lori Williams, Director, National Invasive Species Council; and Bill Hyatt, Invasive Species Committee Chair for the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. Invasive species threaten communities by devastating native habitats, damaging crops, clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, and outcompeting native species. This can lower crop yields, pose health hazards, damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. Nationwide, damages associated with invasive species cost an estimated tens of billions of dollars per year. In the 5th Congressional District, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk level for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes has been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and negatively impact the water supply for residents in Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. Aquatic mussels such as quagga and zebra mussels have cost U.S. communities more than $5 billion since their introduction in the 1980's. The Congressional Invasive Species Caucus, co-chaired by Reps. Mike Thompson and Dan Benichek is an informal, bipartisan group dedicated to raising awareness about invasive species issues, supporting local communities who are bearing the brunt of this problem, and promoting efforts to prevent and control the spread of invasive species. The Caucus provides opportunities for Representatives to meet with the most important policy makers, organizations, and industry leaders that are impacted by invasive species.

11.18.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted to pass H.R. 2061, the Digital Accountability and Transparency (DATA) Act of 2013. This bill requires information on all federal spending to be posted to a single, comprehensive and searchable website, USASpending.gov. The DATA Act also limits federal agency travel expenses to 70 percent of their Fiscal Year 2010 travel costs, limits the allowable costs of agency conferences and requires extensive new reporting and public disclosure of conference costs and activities.“Taxpayers deserve to know their money is being spent wisely and effectively on smart investments that create jobs, grow our economy and move our country forward,” said Thompson. “This legislation will increase transparency, help make sure taxpayers are getting the most bang for their buck, and allow us to hold agencies and individuals accountable for wasteful spending and lavish junkets funded by hard-earned tax dollars.” In 2012, the General Services Administration (GSA) held a lavish $823,000 conference in Las Vegas and former GSA executive Jeffrey E. Neely spent $40,000 on a trip he and his wife took to Napa. The extensive new reporting and public disclosure of conference costs and activities would help prevent these kinds of abuses from occurring in the future. In addition, the bill expands the role of the Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board that was created by the 2010 stimulus law to oversee stimulus spending. The DATA Act will require the board to help make sure tax dollars are being spent wisely and effectively by detecting waste and fraud at all levels of federal spending. H.R. 2061 passed the House and will now go the Senate for consideration.

11.15.2013	Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Scott Peters (CA-52) introduced H.R. 3507, the 21st Century Care for Military & Veterans Act. This bipartisan legislation would expand coverage of telehealth services to active-duty servicemembers, their dependents, retirees, and veterans. Because of provider shortages at local practices, many servicemembers and veterans lack access to a primary care physician, and in rural and underserved communities patients often must travel extended distances to see a healthcare provider. The bill would establish and expand reimbursement policies covering the use of telehealth services, including essential mental health monitoring, under TRICARE and the VA.“Often times telehealth provides the best care available and as a wounded combat Vietnam veteran, I understand that our servicemembers, veterans and their families have earned and deserve the best,” said Thompson. “This bill will make sure our men and women of the Armed Forces and their families can get the highest quality care in a timely manner no matter where they live or how far away they are from the doctor they need to see. It's the right thing to do for those who have sacrificed so much for us.” “As we look for ways to provide the best-quality care for our servicemembers and veterans, telehealth technologies are increasingly important to the full range of options we should be offering,” Peters said. “We've already seen that these technologies create a more responsive and more efficient health care system that provide for better care and lower costs. That's the type of commonsense approach that can make a real difference in military and veterans communities in San Diego and across the country.” The legislation introduced today would leverage innovative technologies already in use today - including audio and video conferencing, smart devices, and remote monitoring - to bring the doctor to the patient. Telehealth technologies, in their various forms, bring a host of benefits including improved patient outcomes, decreased disparities and variations in care, and vastly expanded options for outpatient health treatments. The VA has already seen both clinical and cost-saving benefits through telehealth technologies, including a 40 percent reduction in bed days and an 87 percent reduction in annual per-patient cost between when compared to existing home-based care programs. In addition to Peters and Thompson, the bill is co-sponsored by Reps. Gregg Harper (R-MS-3) Peter Welch (D-VT At-Large). H.R. 3507 has been endorsed by the American Telemedicine Association.

11.14.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement on President Obama's announcement that insurance companies can continue offering insurance plans for another year even if those plans do not meet the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) minimum standards. “Today's decision by President Obama to allow people who like their insurance plans to keep them, even if those plans don't meet the minimum standards set by the Affordable Care Act, is a step in the right direction towards fixing issues with the health care law. This was a promise that was made and it is a promise that should be kept. The action taken by President Obama today directs insurance companies to notify consumers that their plans do not meet minimum standards. If people decide they would rather have a plan that meets these minimum standards than they can shop online at Covered California for better plan at a competitive price. “I've said from the beginning that the health care reform law isn't perfect. But instead of engaging in partisan bickering and playing blame games, I want to work to make health care reform better. That's why I will continue working to make sure people are able to get quality health insurance that fits their budget and their health care needs. If we quit the partisan games, we can build on the reforms made in Obamacare, work out the imperfections, and make sure every American can get quality, affordable health insurance. That is a goal worth fighting for.” The President's announced policy will allow individuals who enrolled in plans after the ACA was signed into law on March 23rd, 2010 to keep their plans even if these plans do not meet the ACA's minimum standards. Also under the President's announced policy, insurance companies must notify consumers that their plans do not meet minimum standards. For those who want a plan that does meet the ACA's minimum standards, they can shop online at CoveredCA.com for higher quality plans at competitive prices. People who enrolled in plans that do not meet the ACA's minimum standards before the ACA was signed into law are not impacted by this updated policy. Their plans are grandfathered in and they can keep their plans until their insurance company decides to change or cancel their plan.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

11.13.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), two senior Members of the House Committee on Ways & Means, led a letter to President Obama urging him to work collaboratively with Congress to craft Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. Strong TPA legislation that enhances the consultative role of Congress throughout the course of trade negotiations will help increase our nation's international competitiveness, grow the U.S. economy and create good American jobs. “Increasing exports and eliminating trade barriers can be a win for our economy provided the playing field is level and everyone operates under a fair and basic set of rules," said Thompson. “Any Trade Promotion Authority must support and help create good American jobs, grow the U.S. economy, set basic standards for our partners to live up to, improve market access, protect the environment, and allows for Congressional oversight. By meeting these basic benchmarks, the Administration can work with Congress on meaningful trade policy.” “This letter lays out a clear path of how the administration can work with Congress to craft a thoughtful approach to TPA,” said Blumenauer. “Democratic members of the House Ways & Means Committee who have signed this letter are inclined to be supportive. We believe, however, that TPA must reflect a trade policy that not only creates and strengthens jobs here in the U.S. while improving market access, but also promotes high-quality standards abroad that prevent a race to the bottom. Meeting that benchmark will be critical to our continued support.” The letter presents the ways in which a properly structured TPA can build on the progress Congress has made to transform American trade policy into more than just a means to eliminate trade barriers. It can also be an integral tool for improving the working conditions and environmental protections among our trading partners through enforceable, meaningful standards. In addition, the letter states that TPA should include incentives to help keep well-paying jobs at home; contain a reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs; and adequately fund our trade enforcement agencies so that we ensure other countries adhere to their commitments and provide fair market access. The full text of the letter is below. November 8, 2013 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama: We support your stated goal of promoting American exports and eliminating barriers to trade. We are optimistic that such efforts, done correctly, will grow our economy and lead to more well-paying U.S. jobs by expanding access to U.S. goods and services abroad and leveling the playing field for American companies and workers. To pursue this goal, we understand that your Administration plans to work with Congress to craft new legislation reauthorizing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). To gain the broadest possible support for TPA in Congress, this proposal cannot just be an extension of earlier trade promotion authorities. Any new proposed TPA must reflect the changing nature of international trade and ensure that Congress plays a more meaningful role in the negotiating process than in the 2002 TPA, which did not receive large bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. Moreover, we believe that any proposed negotiating authority should help our country and its workers better compete in the modern global economy. A new TPA should include incentives to help keep well-paying jobs at home, and to help spur new American innovation and job creation across all sectors of our economy. A new TPA should also include a reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) programs to help retrain workers impacted by changing global trade and by the implementation of trade agreements. Finally, any new TPA should strengthen our trade laws and adequately fund our trade enforcement agencies so that we can hold other countries accountable and ensure they adhere to their commitments and provide fair market access. We note that a well crafted TPA can help build on the progress Congress has made to transform American trade policy into more than just a means to eliminating trade barriers, but as a tool for improving the working conditions and environmental protections among our trading partners through enforceable, meaningful standards . For example, the May 10th Agreement, which incorporated significant improvements in labor and environmental commitments into previous agreements, should serve as a baseline for future agreements. We believe that TPA must reflect a trade policy that not only creates and strengthens jobs here in the U.S. and improves market access, but also promotes high-quality standards abroad that prevent a race to the bottom. Thank you for your attention to this letter. We look forward to your response.Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON Member of Congress EARL BLUMENAUER Member of Congress CHARLES B.

11.01.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) was honored today for his years of work to make sure service members who were subjected to the Department of Defense's (DOD) chemical weapon testing are able to receive full medical care and disability compensation for their service-connected medical conditions. In late 2002, the DOD revealed for the first time that between 1962 and 1974 it had tested harmful chemical and biological agents by spraying them on ships and sailors. These tests - known as Project 112, which included Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD), exposed at least 6,000 service members without their knowledge to harmful chemical and biological weapons, including some of the most deadly chemicals on Earth: Vx Nerve Gas, Sarin Nerve Gas and E. coli. Thompson was presented his award by Cal Maritime graduate and former Senior Navy Officer Jack Alderson. Alderson commanded some of the ships used in the Project 112/SHAD experiments. He has since been diagnosed with malignant Melanoma, several types of skin cancers, prostate cancer and doctors have found four occurrences of asbestos in his lungs. As a senior officer, Alderson was notified of some military chemical tests performed on animals on his ship while he was in service. Once he started getting sick, he asked Thompson to investigate whether or not there could be a link between his health problems and Project 112/SHAD.“It is a high honor to receive this recognition from a true American hero,” said Thompson. “I will not stop working until every veteran who was unknowingly subjected to these harmful chemical tests gets the full benefits they have earned.” Many veterans who were subjected to chemical tests as part of Project 112/SHAD have developed serious medical issues but do not currently receive priority care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or disability benefits because the VA does not officially recognize any long-term health consequences from exposure to the chemical agents from these specific tests. In 2002, Thompson led Congress to direct the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to conduct a study of the health effects associated with the chemicals used during Project 112/SHAD. Numerous reports by other agencies and departments within the U.S. government, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, say exposure to these substances have long-term health consequences. However, after five years of research, the IOM study found no connection existed between the substances tested and the health problems now widely seen among known SHAD veterans. As a result, the VA does not recognize any long-term health consequences from the Project 112/SHAD tests. The IOM has since conceded that the first study did not adequately sample the full universe of Project 112/SHAD veterans, and that the study panel could not obtain sufficient information to assess levels of exposure to specific agents. The initial study also failed to account for the job and duty assignments of various personnel on board all the ships and tugs involved in the chemical testing. Because of this, the first study failed to take into account the different levels of exposure. For instance, some personnel were exposed during training and testing to multiple weapons, experimental vaccines, trace elements, stimulants, and decontamination agents, whereas other personnel would have had limited exposure because of where they were stationed. For these reasons, Congress passed a provision in 2010 co-authored by Thompson requiring the VA to contract with IOM for a second study considering the health impact on veterans that were part of Project 112/SHAD. If the scientific study by the IOM finds a connection between the chemical testing and long-term health consequences, the VA will likely be compelled to provide all service members exposed to this testing priority medical care and full disability compensation. “Jack, and all the people who served with him, deserve to know the truth,” Thompson continued. “If we don't get these service members the care they need, then how can we ask our current service members to put their lives on the line knowing that harm from the enemy may not be the only danger they encounter? Many brave men who served our country are now sick or have passed away because of Project 112's chemical and biological testing. It is our duty to right this wrong and get our service members the care they need.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.# # #
10.30.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, announced today that he introduced H.R. 3439, the New Markets Tax Credit Military Installation Act of 2013. This bipartisan legislation, co-authored by Republican Rep. Ralph Hall (TX-4), expands the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) program by authorizing up to $100 million per year for distressed communities that have had military installations closed or realigned. The NMTC program targets low-income communities suffering from chronic unemployment and high poverty rates by providing investors with a seven-year, 39 percent federal tax credit. By expanding these high-value tax credits, the bill incentivizes private sector investments in communities that have been hit hard by the closure or realignment of local military installations. “These tax credits are job and revenue creators that can help resurrect communities that have been devastated by military base realignments and closures,” said Thompson. “They have already proven successful, but the supply of these tax credits simply doesn't meet the demand or the need. By expanding the New Markets Tax Credit program, we can promote private sector investment, put people back to work, and help communities grow their economy.” “Military bases are the heartbeat of defense communities - they provide jobs and economic value to the local community, as well as a sense of pride and togetherness. As a proud representative of a valuable defense community in Texarakana - the Red River Army Depot, I am honored to join Rep. Thompson in sponsoring this important legislation that will help people in communities affected by base realignment and closures,” said Hall. “While I have been outspoken in my disagreement with the Department of Defense for its BRAC decisions at a time when we still have so many troops overseas and there is so much political unrest in unfriendly nations, I believe we must look for solutions to the BRAC decisions. We should do all we can to responsibly help these defense communities rebuild. Their hard work and efforts continue to help keep our troops safe, and we owe these people the same hard work and dedication.” Over the past several decades, hundreds of military installations around the country have been realigned or closed altogether through the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process, as well as through other base closure laws, leaving communities scrambling to make up for the lost jobs and revenue. Currently, when a military base is closed, the Department of Defense (DOD) is required to complete any necessary environmental cleanup at the former base and then transition the property to a Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA). Together, DOD's Office of Economic Adjustment and the LRA create a redevelopment plan for the property. The goal of this process is to lead to a timely, beneficial, revenue generating reuse of these former military bases. However, numerous military installation cleanups take much longer and cost much more than expected, significantly delaying their reuse and causing many of these communities to become or remain economically distressed. H.R. 3439 helps address this by authorizing up to $100 million per year in additional tax credits so that communities specifically impacted by BRAC can take advantage of the NMTC program. The NMTC program has proven effective at growing local economies and creating jobs. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, every $1 invested through the NMTC program generates $12 of private investment. Using the NMTC program, Brunswick, Maine has successfully redeveloped a former Naval Air Station into a $15 million, 80,000 square foot medical manufacturing facility. A second NMTC was also used in Brunswick, Maine to make $20 million in renovations to facilities now operated by a private aircraft manufacturer. However, this project could have been three times as large had additional NMTC funds been available. Combined, these two projects will bring more than 200 high-tech, high-wage jobs and other significant economic benefits to this former military community. In the 5th Congressional District, communities such as Vallejo, where the Mare Island Naval Shipyard was closed in 1996, could be eligible for the tax credits made available in Thompson's legislation. “On behalf of the City of Vallejo, we strongly support adoption of the proposed bill to focus a portion of the New Markets Tax Credits Program to communities like ours that have continued to suffer from the closure of a military base,” said Mark Sawicki, Community and Economic Development Director for the City of Vallejo. “While much progress has been made since the Mare Island Naval Shipyard was closed in 1996, the environmental clean-up is only 50 percent complete, infrastructure is only 40 percent complete, and building rehabilitation is only 30 percent complete. The City continues to struggle to find funding sources to match and leverage local public and private investment, and thereby generate even a fraction of the jobs erased with the loss of the primary employer in the region, the Navy. The NMTC Program would be an instrumental tool to facilitate new development and we urge Congress to pass this bill.” “Every dollar invested in the New Markets Tax Credit program generates about $12 of private investment in distressed communities, promoting job growth and economic stability while providing a positive return on taxpayer dollars. Strong competition for limited credits, however, has put redevelopment projects at a disadvantage,” said Robert M. Murdock President of the Association of Defense Communities which has officially endorsed the legislation. “That's why Congressman Thompson's legislation providing additional New Markets Tax Credit opportunities to defense communities is so important. It's a solution that will help many communities across the country overcome the economic challenges posed when nearby military missions are closed or realigned.” H.R. 3439 was referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means on which Thompson is a senior member. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.24.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today secured the passage of a provision in H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA), that allows the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to continue working with the Sonoma County Water Agency to enhance six miles of endangered coho salmon habitat along Dry Creek, located between Warm Springs Dam and the Russian River near Healdsburg. This restoration work is required under the Russian River Biological Opinion issued by the National Marine Fisheries Service in 2008 to protect coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead trout; all listed as endangered or threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act. “With the passage of this provision, we are helping restore habitat for endangered species and protecting our local tax dollars,” said Thompson. “By making sure the Army Corps can continue working with the Sonoma County Water Agency, we can speed up the habitat restoration work along the Russian River, protect endangered coho salmon, Chinook salmon and steelhead trout, and make sure Sonoma County isn't left on the hook for building an unnecessary $300 million pipeline.” Without this provision, it is unclear if the Army Corps would carry out their responsibilities as required by the Russian River Biological Opinion, leaving the Sonoma County Water Agency solely responsible for fulfilling this work by 2016. The amount of work required under the biological opinion can only be achieved with the cooperation of the Army Corps. If the requirements made under the biological opinion are not met, Sonoma County would be required to build a $300 million pipeline to mitigate habit impacts. WRRDA was passed by the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 417-3. The Senate passed a different WRDA bill, S. 601 on May 15th by a bipartisan vote of 83-14. The bills are now expected to go to a conference committee to resolve their differences.

10.24.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and George Miller (CA-11) today secured the passage of a provision in H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2013 (WRRDA), that will de-authorizes a four-mile segment of the existing Walnut Creek Project, taking it out of Army Corps control. De-authorizing this four-mile segment eliminates unnecessary U.S. Army Corps bureaucracy and allows the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District to directly perform flood control and habitat restoration on the remaining 18 miles of the Walnut Creek Project. “Because of bureaucratic barriers in place due to Army Corps regulations, our local partners cannot complete the necessary work to prevent localized flooding, restore habitat, and maintain channel depth,” said Thompson. “By removing this four-mile segment from the Army Corps control, our local partners at the Contra Costa County Flood Control and Water Conservation District can get this necessary work done in a timely manner.” “Currently there are maintenance limitations on our local partners that increase the likelihood of localized flooding, so I'm pleased to see progress in deauthorizing this four mile segment of the Walnut Creek Flood Project,” said Miller. “My colleagues and the County agree, an alternative flood management approach is necessary to facilitate much needed flood protection and habitat restoration.” The Walnut Creek Project is a 22-mile flood control project that was previously authorized by Congress in 1960. During a recent evaluation of the project, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the entire 22-mile project does not meet their standards because four miles of the project, near the mouth of the creek, were of concern. To bring the entire 22-mile project up to standard, work would need to be done on the four miles identified by the Corps' evaluation. However, this work on a very limited segment of the project would likely be significantly delayed due to numerous Corps requirements to consult with various federal agencies. By removing the four-mile portion that is of concern to the Corps, Thompson's provision will leave the status of the remaining 18-miles of the Walnut Creek Project unchanged, while allowing for more efficient management of the lower four miles. WRRDA was passed by the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 417-3. The Senate passed a different WRDA bill, S. 601 on May 15th by a bipartisan vote of 83-14. The bills are now expected to go to a conference committee to resolve their differences.

10.24.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson's (CA-5) bipartisan amendment requiring a federal study on impacts of invasive species passed the House today. The amendment was passed as part of H.R. 3080, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) of 2013. Specifically, the amendment requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study on the impacts of aquatic invasive species on federal assets and current federal spending on aquatic invasive species prevention. “Invasive species pose a major financial risk to our local communities, and we need to make sure we're spending our money wisely and efficiently on prevention rather than responding to an invasion after it occurs,” said Thompson. “The cost of dealing with invasive species after they become established in a new area is often far higher than what the cost of prevention would have been. Our amendment will help us to more efficiently address the problems posed by invasive species by proactively identifying where money needs to be spent, finding gaps in our current efforts, and helping minimize the duplication of federal and state activities.” Thompson co-authored the amendment with his co-chair of the Congressional Invasive Species Caucus, Rep. Dan Benichek (R-MI-1), and Reps. Mike Simpson (R-ID-2), Peter DeFazio (D-OR-4), and Dina Titus (D-NV-1). Aquatic invasive species pose a costly challenge to water infrastructure, fisheries, and the environment in local communities across the United States. However, this problem often only receives attention after an invasive species has become established in a new area and has begun clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, and outcompeting native species. These impacts can damage fisheries, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. For example, aquatic mussels such as quagga and zebra mussels have cost U.S. communities more than $5 billion since their introduction in the 1980's. In the 5th Congressional district, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk level for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes has been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and negatively impact the water supply for residents in Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. “Invasive species are a national problem with major local implications,” Thompson continued. “This study will help make sure we're spending federal dollars in a way that prevents invasions before they happen so we can protect our communities from their devastating impacts.” The amendment was passed by a bipartisan vote of 417-3. WRRDA was passed by a bipartisan vote of 417-3. The Senate passed a different WRDA bill, S. 601, on May 15th by a bipartisan vote of 83-14.

10.23.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced today that he introduced, H.R. 3306, the Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2013, bipartisan legislation to expand telemedicine. By allowing Medicare payments for remote patient monitoring, the bill expands the locations where patients can receive Medicare-covered teleheath services. The bill also gives states the opportunity to expand Medicaid coverage to include telehealth services for women with high-risk pregnancies. U.S. Reps. Gregg Harper (MS-3-R.), Devin Nunes (CA-22-R), and Peter Welch (VT-D-AL) joined Thompson in introducing the legislation. “Telehealth is health care, and it should be a tool in every doctor's toolbox,” said Thompson. “By expanding Medicare and Medicaid telehealth coverage through this legislation, we can make sure more people can get high-quality care no matter where they live or how far away they are from a doctor. Patients and providers want telehealth health, and the reason is simple - it saves money and saves lives. This bill is a big step in the right direction, and we need to keep working until telehealth is an option for everyone.” Under the Telehealth Enhancement Act, patients will be able to receive Medicare-covered teleheath services at an expanded network of locations such as critical access and sole community hospitals, a patient's home, and/or other locations that are convenient, necessary and appropriate for the care of the patient, such as hospice care, home dialysis and homebound beneficiaries. States who choose to expand Medicaid coverage to include telehealth will be able to create birthing networks that would allow medical providers to treat conditions such as gestational diabetes and hypertension for women with high-risk pregnancies. During his time in the California State Senate Thompson introduced and passed the Telemedicine Development Act of 1996, the foundation of California's robust telehealth system. Thompson's State Senate-passed legislation prohibits private and public insurers from requiring in-person services for services appropriately provided through telemedicine. Thompson has continued to be a leader on telehealth issues. He has introduced legislation to strengthen and expand telehealth in each of the last three Congresses. “Studies have shown that telehealth can improve access, reduce costs and improve the quality of healthcare,” said Jonathan Linkous, chief executive officer of the ATA. “To unlock this potential, we need to give health providers the ability to use this technology wherever appropriate. ATA supports this legislation because it takes a sensible approach to move aside government restrictions and allow patients access to health services wherever they are located. Instead of going to the doctor, it allows the doctor to go to the patient.” The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means on which Thompson and Nunes serve, and the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on which Harper and Welch serve.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.16.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted to reopen the government and make sure the United States pays its bills on time. The legislation, H.R. 2775, passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 285-144. 198 Democrats and 87 Republicans voted to pass the bill. The Senate passed the legislation earlier today by a bipartisan vote of 81-18. The bill now goes to the President for his signature. The legislation funds the government through January 15, 2014, extends the debt ceiling until February 7, 2014, requires income verification for recipients of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act's exchanges, and provides backpay to furloughed federal workers. The agreement also requires a bipartisan, bicameral budget conference to come up with long-term spending plans by December 13. Thompson released the following statement on the passage of the legislation. “Today's bipartisan agreement will finally bring this reckless and unnecessary government shutdown and default crisis to an end. For two-plus weeks Tea Party radicals have kept the government closed and threatened default because they were obsessed with derailing health care reform at any cost - a fight they've lost nearly 50 times in Congress, once in a national election, and once in the Supreme Court. The negative impacts of this strategically planned crisis have been staggering. It has cost our economy $4.8 billion. It has prevented Congress from focusing on important national issues such as job creation, gun violence prevention, immigration reform, the Farm Bill, a balanced budget, economic growth and fiscal responsibility. It has eroded the faith people have in our institution of representative government, both at home and around the world. And it achieved nothing. “I applaud the Senate for working across the aisle to reach an agreement, and I am glad that some responsible Republicans in the House joined with Democrats in voting to reopen our government and pay America's bills. We can now get back to making sure seniors can apply for Social Security, veterans can have their benefits processed, small businesses can get loans, and life-saving medical research can continue. “While today's deal avoids the worst, it's far from the best we could have done. We cannot continue engaging in partisan brinkmanship and governing from crisis to crisis. Our nation faces serious fiscal and economic challenges and they need to be met by serious and responsible solutions. The best way to get our debt and deficit under control is through a balanced approach that cuts spending, requires everyone to pay their fair share, creates jobs, and protects the longevity of important programs like Social Security and Medicare. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we develop a balanced plan that puts our nation on a long-term, fiscally sustainable path.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.11.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today introduced bipartisan legislation to ensure that Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs) such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and American Legion can continue to work alongside Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at VA Regional Offices during the shutdown. This week, the VA announced that 7,800 support staff members are being furloughed at Regional Offices around the country. “Sending home 8,000 VA workers will only further delay benefits and services to our nation's veterans,” said Thompson. “As a veteran myself, I understand the importance of VA services. By allowing VSOs to continue working during the shutdown, we can help make sure our veterans get the benefits they've earned and services they need.” VSOs provide valuable volunteer assistance to veterans and their families, helping veterans maneuver the VA system and navigate the complex claims application process. VSO representatives often work in VA regional offices, acting as liaisons between veterans and VA employees and providing guidance and expertise to claims processors. The government shutdown has prevented VSOs from providing their expert volunteer service at VA Regional Offices, despite the fact that these are completely volunteer organizations, operating at no expense to the federal government. The halt in funding for the VA has already led to claims processing delays for 1,400 veterans per day. Before the shutdown, employees who process benefits claims had been working overtime to help reduce the backlog, but the government shutdown has led to an elimination of overtime. Without action, the already large backlog of disability claims stands to increase dramatically. The Veterans Services Support Act is cosponsored by Rep. Walter Jones, Rep. Corrine Brown, Rep. Jerry McNerney, and Rep. Rush Holt.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.09.2013	Congresista Mike Thompson anuncio ahora que es un coautor de H.R. 15, Acta de Seguridad Fronteriza, Oportunidades EconÃ³micas, y ModernizaciÃ³n Inmigratoria. HR 15 es la versiÃ³n bicameral de la CÃ¡mara de Representantes del proyecto de ley para reforma inmigratoria que fue pasado en el Senado. -Pasando este proyecto de ley es lo que se debe de hacer para nuestro paÃ­s, y estÃ¡ en lÃ­nea con los principios fundamentales de nuestra naciÃ³n, ayudara a nuestra economÃ­a y bajara nuestras deudas.- dijo Congresista Mike Thompson Este proyecto de ley de la CÃ¡mara de Representantes contiene las mismas provisiones que el proyecto de ley, bicameral, pasado en el Senado (S. 744), que protege trabajadores, une familias, y ofrece a inmigrantes un camino para la ciudadanÃ­a. TambiÃ©n contiene las mismas provisiones de S. 744 que reforma nuestros programas de visas e imposiciÃ³n de leyes inmigratorias. La Ãºnica diferencia entre los proyectos de ley del Senado y la CÃ¡mara de Representantes es que el proyecto de ley en la CÃ¡mara reemplaza las provisiones de seguridad fronteriza del Senado con una provisiÃ³n pasada con unanimidad por la ComitÃ© de Seguridad Nacional en mayo. El proyecto de ley del Senado daba un plan de seguridad fronteriza, y la legislaciÃ³n de la CÃ¡mara simplemente dirige al Departamento de Seguridad Nacional para que desarrolle un plan estratÃ©gico para asegurar la frontera, que despuÃ©s serÃ¡ aprobado por el congreso. SegÃºn la Oficina Independiente Congresional de Presupuestos, el proyecto de ley para reforma inmigratoria pasado por el Senado, reducirÃ­a el dÃ©ficit por $850 billones. La Oficina Independiente Congresional de Presupuestos tambiÃ©n estima que S. 744 aumentarÃ­a la economÃ­a 3.3 por ciento en 2023 y 5.4 por cientos en 2033.

10.08.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson announced today that he has co-authored H.R. 15, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act. H.R. 15 is the House version of the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill passed by the Senate. “Not only is passing this bill the right thing to do for our country and in line with our nation's most fundamental principles, it will boost our economy and lower our debt,” said Thompson. “The Senate has passed a tough, fair, bipartisan comprehensive reform bill that strengthens our borders and offers an earned pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living, working and raising families here. It's time the House did the same.” This House bill contains the same provisions from the bipartisan Senate-passed bill (S. 744) that protect workers, unite families, and offer immigrants an earned pathway to citizenship. It also contains the same provisions from the bipartisan Senate-passed bill that reform our visa programs and the enforcement of immigration laws. The only difference between the House and Senate bills is that the House bill replaces the Senate's border security provision with a provision unanimously passed by the House Committee on Homeland Security in May. While the Senate bill spelled out a specific border security plan, the House legislation simply directs the Department of Homeland Security to develop a strategic plan to secure the border which will then be approved by Congress. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), enactment of the bipartisan Senate-passed comprehensive immigration reform bill would reduce the deficit by $850 billion. The CBO also estimates that the Senate-passed bill would increase economic growth by 3.3 percent in 2023 and 5.4 percent in 2033. The legislation has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.02.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today issued the following statement on the ongoing government shutdown. “Today a needless and reckless government shutdown continues. There is no reason for us to be in this situation. Our government is closed because 40 or so radical Tea Party Republicans refuse to vote for any funding bill that doesn't delay or defund the Affordable Care Act. This is a fight they've lost nearly 50 times in Congress, in a national election, and in the United States Supreme Court. Keeping the government shut down because Democrats want to make sure people can buy affordable health insurance is a thoughtless disregard for responsible governance and the people we serve. “Democrats have compromised. I agreed to support a funding measure that included $72 billion dollars in annualized across the board spending cuts to keep the government open. The Senate passed this legislation multiple times before the government closed, but this wasn't enough for the Tea Party wing of the House Majority - for them to vote for any measure the Affordable Care Act had to be defunded or delayed. “Their refusal to compromise is hurting our economy and country. It's putting 800,000 federal employees out of work and delaying paychecks for two million more, cutting off food-safety operations and infectious disease surveillance, stopping important medical research, halting the disbursement of new small business loans, and costing the tax payers $150 million a day. “Now the House Majority is trying to pass piecemeal funding measures to fund things like our national parks and the Department of Veterans Affairs. These bills are nothing more than cynical political ploys designed to lessen the outrage the House Majority is facing for shutting down the government. By passing these piecemeal measures, the House Majority is choosing which people the government works for and which people it ignores. That's not the way government works. It's irresponsible. And while it might be good for politics it's terrible for our country. “The right thing to do for our nation would be to pass the Senate's compromise government funding legislation that protects health care reform and reduces spending. I stand ready to support such a bill. Democrats stand ready to support such a bill. And many responsible members of the Republican Party in the House stand ready to pass such a bill. If it was put on the floor of the House today it would be passed and our government would be open tomorrow. “It's important for everyone in our nation that the institution of representative government works. Right now this important institution is being held hostage by a small fraction of extremists in the House Majority who are obsessed with sabotaging health care reform. It's time for the House Majority to put the interests of our nation ahead of the interest of the Tea Party, pass the Senate's compromise bill, and reopen our government.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

10.01.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson announced that, beginning today, millions of Americans will have access to affordable, quality health insurance as new online Health Insurance Marketplaces open in every state, under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. California's online marketplace is Covered California. “Starting today, people in our district and across our country can, for the first time, purchase affordable, quality health insurance through a new online marketplace,” said Thompson. “This is what the Affordable Care Act is all about. People can go online, see what discounts they qualify for, compare plans, and pick one that's right for them, their budget, and their health care needs. Health care reform is already saving money and lives. Now with the opening on these marketplaces, even more people will be able to get affordable, quality coverage, increasing their health and economic security.” Already because of health care reform, more than 38,000 children with preexisting conditions are now covered in California's 5th District. More than 6,000 seniors have saved $7 million on prescription drugs in California's 5th District. And more than 235,000 people have benefited from no longer having a lifetime limit on their coverage in California's 5th District. Also because of health care reform, insurance companies can no longer drop a woman's coverage because she becomes pregnant, or kick people off of their insurance plan if they become sick. In the new online Marketplace, constituents in California's 5th District looking for coverage will be able to shop among affordable choices at CoveredCA.com. It is estimated that more than half of those shopping in the new marketplace will qualify for discounts on their monthly premium, based on their income. In the new online Marketplace, there is no denial for pre-existing conditions, no annual or lifetime limits on coverage, and no higher rates for women compared to men. If constituents have questions about the Marketplace, they can call 1-800-318-2596, a toll-free hotline open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

09.30.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) voted today for the third time against government funding legislation that attempts to defund or delay all or part of the Affordable Care Act, and moves the federal government closer to a shutdown. The Senate is expected to again reject the House's latest attempt to undermine the health care law, and the President will veto any such legislation. A government funding resolution must be passed by Congress and signed by the President by midnight or the government will shutdown. “Enough is enough. For a third time now, the House Majority has moved to shutdown the government by passing extreme, Tea Party driven legislation that stands no chance of being passed by the Senate or signed by the President. “With hours left before a shutdown, the House had an opportunity to act responsibly and pass the Senate's bill that keeps the government running and protects health care reform. Instead, they once again passed legislation that undermines health care reform and all but ensures a dangerous government shutdown that will damage our economy, put people out of work, deny affordable health care to millions of Americans, risk cutting off benefits to seniors and veterans, and could cost taxpayers billions of dollars. “Shutting down the government at midnight because Democrats want to make sure folks can afford health insurance is reckless and irresponsible. Since the Affordable Care Act was passed, I have said that I am open to making improvements to the law. But instead of working with Democrats to improve the law, the House Majority is attempting to sabotage the law through the threat of a government shutdown. This is a dereliction of duty and a total disregard for responsible governance. It's time for the House Majority to put the interests of our nation ahead of the interest of the Tea Party and join with Democrats to keep the government open.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.29.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against legislation that again attempts to delay the Affordable Care Act and puts the federal government on a path towards a shutdown. Earlier this week, the Senate rejected the House-passed government funding measure that undermined the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is not expected to pass any legislation that defunds or delays health care reform, nor will the President sign any such legislation. A government funding resolution must be passed by Congress and signed by the President by October 1st, 2013 or the government will shutdown. “For the second time in less than ten days, the House Majority has voted to pass extreme, Tea Party driven legislation that undermines health care reform and puts our nation on a dangerous path towards a government shutdown. Threatening to shutdown the government at midnight on Monday because Democrats want to make sure folks can afford health insurance is reckless and outrageous. This will damage our economy, put people out of work, deny affordable health care to millions of Americans, and risk cutting off benefits to seniors and veterans. The Senate responsibly passed a bill that would keep the government running and protect health care reform. The House needs to get back to work and do the same before time runs out,” said Thompson. Thompson voted in favor of a separate measure on the floor that ensures U.S. troops get paid in the event of a government shutdown.

09.27.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), announced today that all members of HPSCI have signed on as co-authors of H.R. 3103, Thompson's bipartisan Intelligence Oversight and Accountability Act of 2013. H.R. 3103 requires that any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) decision, order or opinion that includes a denial of an IC request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) be shared with Congress.“Every member of the Intelligence Committee - Republican and Democrat - has signed on in support of this bill because it responsibly strengthens Congressional oversight and improves accountability of our Intelligence Community,” said Thompson. “Through this increased oversight and accountability, we can help make sure our Intelligence Community operates within legal and constitutional boundaries while they continue their brave work to keep Americans safe.” Currently, when the FISC or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review issues a decision, order, or opinion, the Attorney General (AG) must determine if the issue considered by the FISC includes a “significant construction or interpretation of the law.” If the AG determines that the decision is significant, that information must be shared with Congress. However, if the AG determines that the decision is not “significant,” the AG is not required to share the information with Congress. H.R. 3103 requires the AG to share all FISC decisions, orders or opinions that include a denial of an IC request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of FISA with Congress. Removing discretionary elements regarding what Congress should and should not receive from the FISC, will increase the Congressional oversight of Intelligence Community tools and programs to ensure their proper use. The bill also will allow Congress to properly assess whether information collected pursuant to, or programs authorized by, the PATRIOT Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), are being implemented in a manner consistent with Congressional intent and are compliant with Congressional notice requirements. In addition, the bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to include enhanced summaries of the FISC's decisions, orders, and opinions to make the facts, issues, and legal reasoning involved in these matters more accessible to Congress. Thompson was joined by U.S. Reps. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ-02), Luis Gutierrez (D-Il-04), and J. Randy Forbes (R-VA-04) in introducing the bill earlier this month. H.R. 3103 has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, on which both Gutierrez and Forbes are senior members, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), on which Thompson, LoBiondo and Gutierrez are senior members. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.26.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today announced a $2,834,293 magnet school development grant for the Napa Valley Unified School District (NVUSD). The school district is also eligible to receive up to $2,834,293 in each of the next two years. The grant is paid for by the U.S. Department of Education with funds approved by Congress through the annual appropriations process. The funds will go to Harvest Middle School, Napa Junction Elementary and Pueblo Vista Elementary. “One of the most essential elements to our nation's long-term economic success is education,” said Thompson. “I am proud to support these grants that will help make sure students from all backgrounds are able to get a quality education that prepares them to compete in a global economy.” Magnet schools offer a specialized theme or curriculum and are designed to attract students from diverse backgrounds from throughout NVUSD. Harvest Middle School and Napa Junction Elementary will be the two new magnet schools, joining the NVUSD's four other magnet schools. Harvest will offer Dual Language Immersion and will become an International Baccalaureate World School, providing a continuation of these programs currently offered at Napa Valley Language Academy (Dual Immersion), Bel Aire Elementary and Mt. George (both International Baccalaureate). Napa Junction will become NVUSD's first STEM school emphasizing Engineering along with technology, math and science. Napa Junction is also part of the NexTech project in partnership with NapaLearns and the New Tech Network that is focused on bringing technology-infused project-based learning which compliments perfectly the STEM theme. The new grant will also support Pueblo Vista-Vista 360 by adding Dual Language Immersion to its Environmental Sciences magnet theme. The District's current magnet schools include Bel Aire Park (IB candidate school), Salvador-a Visual and Performing Arts Integration school and Alta Heights-a Math, Science, Art and Technology school. The awards will help school districts bring diverse groups of children together through the use of innovative educational programs and will create more school choices for parents. “Magnet schools play a critical role in providing school and program options for our parents and help diversify public schools in our valley,” NVUSD Superintendent, Patrick Sweeney said. “These themes fit perfectly with our vision to develop lifelong skills in our students to prepare them for college and careers in the 21st Century.” The Magnet Schools Assistance Program is authorized under Title V, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Act, as amended in 1994 and is administered by the Office of Innovation and Improvement.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.25.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today announced a number of U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) block grants totaling $802,141 to help support economic opportunities and grow local markets for specially crops. The grants, made through the 2013 Specialty Crop Block Grant (SCBG) Program, will assist growers of specialty crops and help strengthen and expand markets for their products. The goal of the grant program is to promote and increase opportunities for specialty crop producers. The grants are paid for by the USDA with funds approved by Congress through the annual appropriations process.“Agriculture is the backbone of our economy and these investments will strengthen our district's specialty crop industry by supporting local markets, promoting quality products, and increasing the availability of freshly grown fruits and vegetables to schools and commercial buyers,” said Thompson. The Specialty Crop Block Grant Program is part of USDA's integrated approach to programs and policies that stimulate food- and agriculturally-based community economic development. Grants that will benefit California's 5th Congressional District include: $357,000 for the Sonoma Valley Vintners Association to increase wine consumer awareness of the high-quality wines from the Sonoma Valley American Viticultural Area through a marketing campaign that will include website redesign, social media and email campaigns, and print and online advertising. $55,120 for Solano Grown to promote and encourage purchases of local specialty crop products by developing an online farmers' market for Solano County specialty crop producers. $390,021 for North Coast Opportunities, Inc. to make more Lake and Mendocino County specialty crop products easily available to schools and other institutional and commercial buyers by creating a California specialty crop grower distribution hub. The Food Hub will handle only eligible specialty crops to ensure that grant funding supports only specialty crops.

09.23.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released a video message honoring Hispanic Heritage Month which runs from September 15th to October 15th. Below is a transcript and link to the video. “Hi, I'm Mike Thompson. “At the base of the Statue of Liberty there is an inscription that reads â€˜Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.' “For centuries, generations of immigrants have come to our shores in search of new freedoms and greater opportunities. “Those immigrants have enriched our country and they've shaped our society. “Today, more than 50 million Latinos are serving our nation as leaders in business, the military, government, and science. These leaders strengthen our nation and contribute to our economy. “Hispanic Heritage Month, which started the 15th of September and runs through the 15th of October, is an opportunity for all Americans to recognize the importance of our Latinos and their contributions to our nation's social and economic fabric. “And, it is a time for all Americans to recommit ourselves to the fight for civil rights, equality, and social and economic justice. “The front line of that fight is comprehensive immigration reform. “We're a nation of laws. And it's important that we enforce those laws. Immigration reform must strengthen our borders and be fair to U.S. taxpayers. “But we're also a nation of immigrants. Every year millions of immigrants come to our country in search of greater opportunities for themselves and for their families. “Comprehensive immigration reform must allow immigrants to earn the right to fully join us as participating citizens and taxpayers. “It must establish a streamlined program for temporary workers. “It must create an earned path to citizenship for those immigrants who are currently living and working in our country, and choose to pursue that path. “It must include the DREAM Act so that those students who were brought here at a very young age can pursue their dreams - their dreams of a collage education or brave military service. “It must keep families united and protect our workers. “The Senate has passed a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill. It's time that the House did the same thing. “Our nation was built by immigrants - by people who came here in pursuit of the American Dream - a dream of liberty in a country where, if you work hard, and play by the rules, you find a job, buy a house, send your kids to college, and save for retirement. “It's a dream that knows no race, creed nor color. It's a dream that brought my grandparents to America from Italy. And it's a dream that still brings millions to our nation every year. “By working together, we can fix our broken immigration system. “And we can make sure we preserve the American Dream - not only for those who were born within our borders - but also for those who have arrived on our shores in search of a better life. “It is my pleasure to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month with you and the people of our district - and to celebrate the contributions Latinos make to our communities, not just this month, but 12 months a year. “Thank you.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.20.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against House Resolution 59, legislation that defunds the Affordable Care Act and puts the federal government on a path towards a shutdown. The Senate is not expected to pass any legislation that defunds the Affordable Care Act and the President has said he would veto the House resolution. A resolution must be passed by Congress and signed by the President by October 1st, 2013 or the government will shutdown. “Threatening to shut down the government in two weeks because Democrats want to make sure folks can afford to see a doctor is reckless and outrageous,” said Thompson. “The House Majority's partisan, Tea Party driven legislation puts our nation on a path to a government shutdown. This would wreck our economy, deny affordable health care to millions of middle-class families, cut off paychecks to the brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces, and halt government programs that our children and seniors depend on. The other side has lost this fight 40-plus times in Congress and once in the Supreme Court. They need to get their head out of the sand and pass a bill that keeps the government running, spurs job growth, and protects our seniors, veterans and children.” House Resolution 59 would fund government operations through December 15, 2013. House Resolution 59 passed by a vote of 230-189.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.19.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant of $1,066,584 to the City of Vallejo to hire or rehire four law enforcement officers. The grants were made available through the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). “These grants put cops on the beat and make our streets and communities safer,” said Thompson. “I am a proud supporter of the COPS Hiring Program and will continue working to make sure our cities and towns have the resources they need to keep our people safe.” The COPS Hiring Program offers grants to state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies to hire new or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. The program provides salaries and benefits for officer and deputy hires for three years. Grantees for the 2013 hiring program were selected based on their fiscal needs, local crime rates, and community policing plans. Since 1995, COPS has awarded over $14 billion to advance community policing, including grants awarded to more than 13,000 state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to fund the hiring and redeployment of approximately 125,000 officers and provide a variety of knowledge resource products including publications, training, and technical assistance. Additional information about the 2013 COPS Hiring Program can be found on the COPS website at www.cops.usdoj.gov.

09.19.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.R. 3102, a House Majority bill that would cut $40 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The cuts made in H.R. 3102 would take food assistance away from nearly 4 million Americans next year. Three-fourths of households receiving SNAP include a child, senior, or someone who is disabled. A record-high of one-in-five children, or 16 million children, struggle with hunger.“This bill is staggeringly out of touch with what the American people want and need. Cuts of this magnitude take food out of the mouths of millions of Americans and doom any hope of compromise on a full five year extension of the Farm Bill,” said Thompson. “Instead of wasting time on bills like the one offered today by the House Majority, we should be working with the Senate on a compromise bill that is fair to our farmers and ranchers, incentivizes conservation, and protects hard working families, seniors and children from devastating cuts that will cause millions to go hungry.” After a failed attempt to pass a Farm Bill with $20.5 billion in nutrition cuts, the House Majority passed a Farm Bill that, for the first time, did not address the food aid programs at all. H.R. 3012 is the House Majority's legislation to deal with the food aid programs they failed to address in the Farm Bill. The legislation passed by the House today severally hurts the chances of a new Farm Bill being passed. The cuts in H.R. 3102 are almost ten times those in the Senate-passed Farm Bill, making any chance at bipartisan agreement on a Farm Bill nearly impossible. The legislation cuts 210,000 children off of free school lunch and breakfast and jeopardizes food aid for an estimated 170,000 veterans. H.R. 3102 passed by a vote of 217-210.

09.18.2013	Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Earl Blumenauer (OR-03), along with more than 100 other members of the House of Representatives, sent a letter to the leadership of the House urging them to adopt language from the Senate Farm Bill, S. 954, the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2013, which maintains the decades old compact between taxpayers and producers known as conservation compliance, when the Farm Bill goes to conference with the Senate. “Through conservation compliance, we've improved our water quality and drinking water supplies and protected important habitat. Conservation compliance has contributed to a more sustainable agriculture system and benefited farmers, consumers and the environment. These successes should be continued,” the letter reads. “The Senate extended conservation compliance to their crop insurance and revenue support programs, and there is significant support for such provisions in the House. We urge you to include conservation compliance in any eventual conference report.” As a result of conservation compliance measures Congress enacted in 1985, farmers have adopted basic land management practices to reduce soil erosion and protect wetlands in exchange for farm program benefits. As a result of these measures, soil erosion has been reduced by 40 percent on over 140 million acres of farmland. Agricultural productivity has increased, drinking water and important habitat have been protected, and water quality has improved. “We're gratified to see more than 100 Members of Congress support extension of a common sense conservation policy that we know works,” said Tim Male, Vice President for Conservation Policy at Defenders of Wildlife. “Basic soil and wetland protection has been linked to farm subsidies for many years and has been one of our most successful if least well-known conservation programs on America's farms.” “We've lost more wetlands and prairie to the plow in the last four years than we have in the last 40 years,” said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group. “That's why it's so important that basic protections are tied to our farm safety net.” “We thank these members of Congress for sending the message that farm subsidies should not be used to harm our nation's soil, water and wildlife. We hope the final farm bill includes these critical conservation measures,” said Julie Sibbing, Director of Agriculture and Forestry Programs at the National Wildlife Federation.

09.18.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement today on the bipartisan Mayor's Against Illegal Guns collation's investigation that found 1 in 30 would-be gun buyers on the popular website Armslist.com are prohibited from possessing a firearm and could not pass a background check if they attempted to purchase a firearm though a licensed dealer. Current federal law does not require background checks for internet sales. “It's outrageous that thousands of criminals, terrorists, domestic abusers, and dangerously mentally ill individuals can bypass a background check and get a gun online with a few clicks of a mouse. This investigation found that one website could transfer more than 25,000 guns a year to individuals with criminal records, with no questions asked. We need to close this loophole. That's why I've introduced bipartisan legislation requiring background checks for firearm purchases made over the internet, at gun shows and through classified ads. The American people deserve for this bill to be signed into law. It respects our Second Amendment rights and will help save lives,” said Thompson. Thompson is a co-author of H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). More than 180 House members have cosponsored the bill. H.R. 1565 expands the existing background check system to require comprehensive and enforceable background checks for all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. More than 180 House members have cosponsored the bill. The full report of the investigation done by Mayor's Against Illegal Guns can be found here.

09.17.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on yesterday's shooting at the Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. “Yesterday at a Navy base in Washington, D.C., twelve people were murdered and several more were wounded in yet another horrific mass shooting. While important facts are still being gathered, one thing is clear - Congress cannot keep standing on the sidelines while more and more lives are senselessly cut short by gun violence. “It's tragic that nine months after the massacre of innocence in Newtown, it takes another mass shooting to restart the debate on how we can best prevent gun violence. 12 innocent public servants didn't come home from work yesterday. Every day, more than thirty people are killed by someone using a gun. Enough is enough. “We know there is no one law or set of laws that will stop every act of gun violence. But that cannot be used as an excuse to do nothing. Congress needs to act.” Thompson's task force recommendations released in February are available here. Thompson is a co-author of H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY).

09.17.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Glenn â€˜GT' Thompson (R-PA-5) today introduced H.R. 3112, the bipartisan Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2013, legislation that will reduce federal spending by eliminating fraudulent payments from Medicare, while ensuring that adequate prosthetic and orthotic services are provided to Medicare beneficiaries. “Keeping fraudulent providers out of the Medicare program will save money and help make sure that high quality care is provided,” said Rep. Mike Thompson. “This bill will strengthen Medicare benefits for orthotics and prosthetics beneficiaries by reducing fraud and abuse, improving health care quality and reducing Medicare spending.” "When unlicensed and unaccredited providers deliver prosthetic and orthotic services, both Medicare beneficiaries and the American taxpayer are shortchanged," stated Rep. Glenn Thompson. "Despite previous Congressional mandates, not enough has been done to ensure that legitimate and licensed practitioners are providing these items and services. The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2013 will protect Medicare beneficiaries by identifying and addressing fraudulent payments, and hold government accountable by reducing fraud and abuse within Medicare.” The Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of (BIPA), legislated by Congress in 2000, mandated that a "practitioner" or "supplier" had to be certified in order to be paid for certain orthotic and prosthetic services under Medicare. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not enforced these provisions, which has contributed to fraudulent payments and leaving Medicare patients vulnerable to substandard, and in some cases duplicative or unwarranted, care. The Medicare Orthotics and Prosthetics Improvement Act of 2013 would require the CMS to reimburse only those providers who have been accredited or licensed in orthotics and prosthetics. Rep. Mike Thompson serves on the House Committee on Ways and Means' Health Subcommittee. Rep. Glenn Thompson, a former therapist and licensed nursing home administrator with 28 years of experience in a non-profit health care setting, currently serves on the House Education & the Workforce Committee.

09.16.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-05), Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ-02), Luis Gutierrez (D-Il-04), and J. Randy Forbes (R-VA-04) introduced bipartisan legislation today that would strengthen Congressional oversight and improve accountability of the Intelligence Community (IC). The Intelligence Oversight and Accountability Act of 2013, H.R. 3103, requires that any Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) decision, order or opinion that includes a denial of an IC request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) be shared with Congress. “Our government has a responsibility to both protect American lives and our citizens' civil liberties,” said Thompson. “This bill helps us meet that responsibility by strengthening Congress' aggressive oversight of our Intelligence Community. Through the oversight and accountability provided by this bill, we can help make sure our Intelligence Community operates within legal and constitutional boundaries while they continue their brave work to keep Americans safe.” “The system of checks and balances as envisioned under the Constitution is essential to the protection of our citizens' interests and role of our government. This bipartisan legislation will further enhance Congressional oversight over the intelligence operations of the executive branch, ensuring legal guidelines are adhered to,” said LoBiondo. “We have great respect for the men and women serving in the Intelligence Community and will continue to work to ensure they receive the support they deserve.”“Our intelligence agencies do critical work to protect our society and way of life and they must have the public trust that comes with vigorous oversight and accountability,” said Gutierrez. “This bipartisan legislation will facilitate robust oversight and build public trust. Americans expect the government to protect national security and civil liberties with equal vigor. This bill helps us make sure the brave men and women in the Intelligence Community who work to keep America safe can continue that important mission while ensuring compliance with the legal guidelines that we have established.”“This bipartisan legislation comes at a crucial time when many Americans no longer see their government as a force for good, but rather an invasive institution which has abused the powers its citizens bestowed on it. The security and safety of our nation must not come at the cost of our freedoms or individual liberties as American citizens. This bill will provide much needed oversight and accountability of a system which has run aground of its constitutional authority,” said Forbes. Currently, when the FISC or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review issues a decision, order, or opinion, the Attorney General (AG) must determine if the issue considered by the FISC includes a “significant construction or interpretation of the law.” If the AG determines that the decision is significant, that information must be shared with Congress. However, if the AG determines that the decision is not “significant,” the AG is not required to share the information with Congress. H.R. 3103 requires the AG to share all FISC decisions, orders or opinions that include a denial of an IC request, a modification of an IC request, or results in a change to any legal interpretation of FISA with Congress. Removing discretionary elements regarding what Congress should and should not receive from the FISC, will increase the Congressional oversight of Intelligence Community tools and programs to ensure their proper use. The bill also will allow Congress to properly assess whether information collected pursuant to, or programs authorized by, the PATRIOT Act or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), are being implemented in a manner consistent with Congressional intent and are compliant with Congressional notice requirements. In addition, the bill requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to include enhanced summaries of the FISC's decisions, orders, and opinions to make the facts, issues, and legal reasoning involved in these matters more accessible to Congress. H.R. 3103 has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, on which both Gutierrez and Forbes are senior members, and the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), on which Thompson, LoBiondo and Gutierrez are senior members.###
09.10.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement in response to President Obama's address on the situation in Syria. “The use of chemical weapons is appalling no matter who uses them or why. When these weapons of mass destruction are used to massacre innocent men, women and children, as appears to be the case in Syria, there should be a robust, global response to deter these types of atrocities from ever happening again. Any such response, military or otherwise, must be taken with a strong, international coalition. “I am cautiously hopeful that a diplomatic solution can be found where Assad allows international inspectors to take control of the regime's chemical weapons arsenal. This Russian-proposed solution has been accepted by Syria and is supported by China and Iran. Members of the U.N. Security Council are working on a resolution requiring Syria to place its chemical weapons under international control where they could then be destroyed. This proposal must be closely monitored by the international community to ensure 100 percent of Assad's chemical weapons are surrendered to the international community without delay. “I support the president's decision to delay a vote seeking authorization for the use of military force from Congress in order to pursue a diplomatic solution. After several intelligence briefings, I remain skeptical that a limited U.S. military strike will be effective in diminishing Assad's ability to carry out a chemical weapons attack or deter his willingness to use weapons of mass destruction in the future. I am hesitant to believe such a strike would deter other would-be aggressors. And I am concerned such a strike could lead to long-term ramifications that put American lives, our interests and our allies at risk. “As a combat veteran who was wounded in Vietnam, I do not take the decision to authorize the use military force lightly and believe it would be irresponsible to commit to voting one way or the other until all intelligence has been reviewed and I see exactly what the authorization bill looks like. I will continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and work to pursue a non-military course of action that places Syria's chemical weapons under international control.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

09.05.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced $125,000 in new Drug-Free Communities Support Program (DFC) grants to Catalyst Coalition, a program at the Napa County Office of Education. The DFC grant funds will be used to involve and engage the local community to prevent substance use among youth. “The best way to reduce drug use is to stop it before it starts,” said Thompson. “These grants provide Napa County with the resources we need to help prevent substance abuse, and organize our community around the goal of having healthy kids and drug-free communities,” “The Catalyst Coalition has done amazing work to rally the community to prevent substance use in young people. The statistics show a strong need for our county to commit to ongoing prevention. We are grateful to the federal government for continuing to support us in this vital endeavor,” said Dr. Barbara Nemko, Napa County Superintendent of Schools. Over the past 8 years, the Catalyst Coalition has worked diligently to partner with local schools, families, organizations and businesses in Napa County to identify and address the most pressing issues related to youth drug and alcohol use. With the collaboration of the cities, county and law enforcement, Napa County now has streamlined its social host ordinances so that they are easier to enforce, with more meaningful consequences. Other initiatives include youth marijuana prevention, and coordination with local pediatricians to encourage early screening of their middle school patients. The DFC Program was created by the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, and reauthorized by Congress in 2001 and 2006. Since 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has awarded more than 2,000 Drug-Free Communities grants to local communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Palau, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.

08.29.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, Chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on the swearing in of Todd Jones as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) and the Obama Administration's releasing of new executive actions to reduce gun violence. “Today, the White House has once again taken important steps that will help reduce and prevent gun violence. Now, Congress needs to act. Congress cannot continue standing by and doing nothing when more than 30 people are killed every day by someone using a gun. The most important thing we can do is pass my bipartisan bill requiring that anyone who buys a gun at a gun show or over the Internet get a background check. This is a commonsense step that will help keep guns from criminals, terrorists, and the dangerously mentally. The American people deserve for Congress to step up and vote on this bill.” Thompson is the co-author H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). More than 180 House members have cosponsored the bill. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
08.28.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced grants from the Department of Transportation (DOT) totaling $39.7 million for Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport. The funds will be used to lengthen and improve the safety of the airport's runways. The runway project will help the airport accommodate regional jets flying longer distances to and from an increased number of air travel destinations. “This project is a huge economic win for Sonoma County and our region. Having an airport that's a short drive away, and that can accommodate travel to and from major inland airports, will attract more tourists and businesses to our area,” said Thompson. “If you're a business based in Arizona or Colorado and want to expand into the Bay Area, this project makes Sonoma County an even greater option because you'll be able to easily get back and forth, and fly customers or cargo in and out. Tourism will also see a boost because this project will make it easier for folks around the country to get to Sonoma County.” "We're grateful to Congressman Thompson for his leadership and unwavering support of the Sonoma County Airport project,” said Sonoma County Supervisor Mike McGuire. “These enhancements will continue to move our local economy forward by creating jobs and opening up new markets for local business. We'll also be implementing measures to protect the quality of life of surrounding communities by introducing a quieter landing approach for commercial airlines - this is a balanced project." "The safety improvements and runway extensions these grants support will make a major contribution to the efficiency and competitiveness of local business," said Guy SÃ©nÃ©, President of Agilent Technologies' Electronic Measurement Group, which is headquartered in Santa Rosa. "Commercial flights to and from eastern destinations will be convenient and cost-effective for companies like Agilent that have a business need to travel to locations such as Denver." The runway project will allow the airport to support and attract major airlines that would be able to fly to larger airports further inland. Currently the airport offers flights to Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The project will also improve safety by separating two runways that currently end at the same location. Creating two separate endpoints for the runways will help eliminate pilot confusion. The funds will also address environmental requirements to protect and mitigate the impact to local endangered plant and animal species. Thompson worked with the Federal Aviation Administration, other federal resource agencies, and local officials to address these environmental mitigation concerns. The addressing of these environmental concerns was required for the airport to receive this funding.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.16.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement today after the Washington Post reported that National Security Administration (NSA) violated privacy rules thousands of times according to an internal audit and other documents. “Reports indicate that the NSA repeatedly overstepped its legal boundaries, broke privacy regulations, and attempted to shield required disclosure of violations. If accurate, this is outrageous, inappropriate and must be addressed. These reports highlight the need for aggressive oversight of the NSA's intelligence gathering activities. This is exactly why I worked to establish an independent Inspector General for the intelligence community that will detect and deter abuse and misconduct within intelligence programs. Now we must act to make sure the abuses are not repeated. “Congress and the Intelligence Committees can and should do more to ensure the NSA's operations respect Americans' civil liberties, that all incidents of non-compliance, if substantiated, are reported in a timely and comprehensive manner, and that appropriate steps are taken to make sure the incidents are not repeated. “I do not believe protecting our citizens' lives and civil liberties are mutually exclusive pursuits. Through aggressive oversight we can ensure our intelligence community can continue working to keep our country safe while respecting our citizens' constitutional rights.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.12.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) was inducted into the California Waterfowler's Hall of Fame yesterday. The Waterfowler's Hall of Fame was established in 2006 by the California Fish and Game Commission to recognize individuals who have made significant contributions to enhancing and conserving waterfowl and their habitats in the state. Thompson is the first sitting elected official to be inducted into the Hall of Fame. “It is a tremendous honor to be inducted into the Waterfolwer's Hall of Fame,” said Thompson. “California is home to the greatest waterfowl habitat in our country. I am proud to be included among those who have worked long and hard to protect and preserve our great wetlands and diverse wildlife.” "Waterfowl have no greater champion in Congress today than Mike Thompson," stated California Fish and Game Commission President, Mike Sutton. "During his service in the California State Legislature and his current tenure in Congress, no one has done more to promote waterfowl conservation in California." The California Fish and Game Commission recognized Thompson for his years of substantial contributions to waterfowl and land conservation during his time in Congress and the California State Senate. Thompson is a lifelong hunter and conservationist. As an elected official, Thompson secured more than $20 million to restore the Napa-Sonoma Salt Marsh, one of the largest wetlands restoration projects in U.S. history. He also is a strong supporter of the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, which has conserved more than 23 million acres of wetlands across North America, and is a co-author of the reauthorization. In the early 1990s, when the homeless started camping along the South Spit of Humboldt Bay the land quickly deteriorated. Garbage was piling up, and abandoned cars, busses, and trailers leaked fluids into wetlands. Thompson led the efforts to clean up the site, make sure the homeless were offered services, and save the hunting lands. Thompson also helped forge a deal in Del Norte County to save the Aleutian Goose. The goose population was growing and they needed more grazing areas to forage. The geese competed with local ranchers, cattle, and dairy operations which created hardship for both the geese and the local farmers and ranchers. Thompson struck a deal with California State Parks that allowed the land to be restored to short grass, the preferred forage for Aleutians. This was a true win for the geese and the landowners. Nominations to the California Waterfowler's Hall of Fame are made by the California Waterfowler's Hall of Fame Nomination Committee - which includes representatives from the California Waterfowl Association (CWA), Ducks Unlimited (DU), the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and other recognized individuals who have been deeply involved in waterfowl conservation in California. The slate of nominees is then ratified by the California Fish and Game Commission.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.02.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Lee Terry (NE-2) today introduced H.R. 2969, the bipartisan “Medicare Patient Access to Hospice Act,” which expands access to high quality health care by allowing physician assistants to continue caring for Medicare patients after they move from the hospital to hospice care. Currently, physician assistants cannot be reimbursed by Medicare for hospice services. The Medicare Patient Access to Hospice Act addresses this problem. “Entering hospice should not mean losing the health care provider a patient has come to depend on and trust,” said Thompson. “This bipartisan bill will allow Medicare patients to continue seeing the health care provider they know, are comfortable with, and that understands their health history.” “Patients who are entering hospice deserve to have the peace of mind that they'll be able to depend on trusted health care they've previously received,” said Terry. “Whether it be from the physician or a physician assistant, our legislation will ensure that Medicare patients will be able to depend on this same quality of care they've come to know and trust when entering hospice.” Often, physician assistants are the only health care professionals in many underserved areas. In 2010 alone, more than 3 million patient visits were made to physician assistants. While Medicare coverage was originally extended to physician assistants through the 1977 Rural Health Clinic Services Act, the program was never updated to allow physician assistants to deliver hospice care. Under current law, physician assistants may provide care to Medicare patients - until hospice care is needed. At this point, Medicare patients must then find an alternative provider, disrupting the continuity of their care. With this legislation, individuals and families who rely on physician assistants as their primary health care professional would be ensured continuity of quality medical care when patients move from the hospital to hospice care. “I commend Representatives Lee Terry and Mike Thompson for introducing the Medicare Patient Access to Hospice Act,” said American Academy of Physician Assistants President Lawrence Herman. “The bill will increase access to quality hospice care for those relying on Medicare. Currently, physician assistants cannot provide hospice care for their terminally ill Medicare patients, and an undue burden falls on the patient and family to find alternative care. We cannot deny patients access to their â€˜medical home' at a time when they are the most vulnerable.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.01.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) released the following statement today in response to an agreement among House Republicans to introduce a nutrition bill that would cut $40 billion from food aid programs. After a failed attempt to pass a Farm Bill with $20.5 billion in nutrition cuts, the House Majority passed a Farm Bill that did not address the food aid programs at all. Today's announced agreement is the House Majority's attempt to deal with the food aid programs they failed to address in the Farm Bill. “The proposal to cut food aid programs by $40 billion is staggeringly out of touch with what the American people want and need. The mere mention of a cut of this magnitude dooms any hope of compromise on a full five year extension of the Farm Bill. The Senate bill that passed on a bipartisan vote cuts food aid programs by $4 billion. “Instead of wasting time on proposals like the one offered today by House Republicans, we should be working with the Senate on a compromise that is fair to our farmers and ranchers, incentivizes conservation, and protects hard working families, seniors and children from devastating cuts that will cause millions to go hungry.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

08.01.2013	The Eisenhower Memorial Commission (EMC) today announced that U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) has been appointed by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to serve on the EMC. “The National Eisenhower Memorial is a truly important project - for our nation and for the world,” said Thompson, an Army veteran and co-chair of the Congressional Military Veterans Caucus. “Ike was a giant on the world stage and his story, as told by the memorial, is of tremendous historical importance. I am grateful to Leader Pelosi for the opportunity to serve on the Commission. There is work to do, and I can't wait to get started.”EMC Chairman, Rocco Siciliano, said on Thompson's nomination, “I can think of no better addition to the Commission than Mike Thompson. He joins us at a pivotal moment in the memorial's evolution as we move toward final approvals and groundbreaking. His wisdom and moderation will be an important addition to the Commission, and we look forward to having him join us.”Senator Pat Roberts, a senior member of the EMC commented on the appointment, “We very much welcome Mike's spirit, energy and expertise. He understands and appreciates President Eisenhower's accomplishments and great legacy. Mike knows Washington, and he is experienced in working collaboratively to get things done.” The bi-partisan EMC was created by Congress in 1999. The 12-member Commission includes four Members of the United States Senate and four members of the U.S. House of Representatives. World renowned architect Frank Gehry was selected to design the memorial through a federal competition process managed by the General Services Administration's Design Excellence Program in 2009 and the Commission chose a preferred design concept for the memorial in 2010. Commission Chairman Rocco Siciliano, a World War II combat veteran, has served as Chairman of the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute. The late Senator Daniel Inouye, D-HI, also a World War II combat veteran and Congressional Medal of Honor recipient, served as Vice Chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial Commission until his death in December, 2012.

07.31.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted to pass bipartisan compromise legislation (H.R. 1911) that will help keep down student loan interest rates, allowing students to take advantage of historically low interest rates. The Senate passed the agreement by a bipartisan vote of 81 to 18 on July 24th. The House passed the legislation by a bipartisan vote of 392 to 31. The bill will now go to the President for his signature. “Our middle class will continue to struggle and our economy will never reach its full potential if we don't work together to make college more affordable for working families,” said Thompson. “This agreement is a positive step that will save students and their families thousands of dollars. Now, Congress must continue working to make sure no student is ever denied a college education because he or she can't afford it.” The bill sets the interest rates for subsidized and unsubsidized undergraduate loans at 2.05 percent above the current rate of the 10-year Treasury note. The bill sets unsubsidized graduate loans at 3.6 percent above the 10-year Treasury note. Graduate PLUS loans are set at 4.6 percent above the 10-year Treasury note. Rates are capped at 8.25 percent for undergraduate loans, 9.5 percent for unsubsidized graduate loans, and 10.5 percent for PLUS loans. The bill allows students to lock in today's low interest payments for the life of the loan, so they will know how much they will owe before taking out a loan. The 10-year rate at the most recent Treasury auction was 1.81 percent, meaning that for Academic Year 2013-2014, the interest rate would be 3.86% for subsidized and unsubsidized undergraduate Stafford loans compared with 6.8% currently. The new rates are retroactive for any loans taken out since July 1, 2013. Over the 2013-2018 period, undergraduate students will save $25 billion compared to the current law's 6.8 percent interest rates, according to the Congressional Budget Office. A freshman undergraduate student, who begins school this year and takes out the maximum amount of loans, will save $3,300 on his or her interest payments.

07.31.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on the Senate vote confirming Todd Jones as the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF). “In February my task force released a comprehensive set of policy principles that respect the Second Amendment and would reduce gun violence. The confirmation of a permanent ATF Director was one of our recommendations and I commend the Senate for taking this important step in confirming Director Jones. However, this is just the first of many important steps we must take to reduce gun violence in our nation. We need to pass legislation requiring that anyone buying a gun at a gun show or over the Internet get a background check. This is the first line of defense against criminals, the dangerously mentally ill and terrorists getting guns.” Thompson co-authored H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). More than 180 House members have cosponsored the bill. Thompson's task force recommendations released in February are available here.

07.30.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that Mel Orpilla will serve as the new District Representative and Ryan Labar will serve as a new Constituent Services Representative in Thompson's Vallejo office. Orpilla replaces outgoing District Representative Brian Bottari. Labar was hired through the Wounded Warrior Program announced by Thompson in February. “I am thrilled to have Mel and Ryan on our team,” said Thompson. “They are both smart, talented, hard working individuals who will provide great service to the people in our community.” Orpilla has worked in non-profit management, public affairs, and journalism for the last twenty-five years. He spent nine years as the Community & Government Relations Manager for Kaiser Permanente in the Napa-Solano Area before taking a position as the Field Representative for State Senator Lois Wolk. Orpilla serves the community on a number of boards - Salvation Army of Solano County, Rebuilding Together Solano County, Leadership Vallejo, and the Filipino American National Historical Society. He formally served on boards ranging from the Vallejo Naval & Historical Museum to the Benicia Vallejo Humane Society. Orpilla was born and grew up in Vallejo, where he still lives. He has two sons. “I'm honored to represent Congressman Mike Thompson out of his Vallejo District Office,” said Orpilla. “As a native-Vallejoan and now his staff person, I am looking forward to supporting Congressman Thompson's efforts to strengthen Solano County, Contra Costa County and the entire District.” Labar joined the army in November 2000 as an infantryman, and has served in almost all infantry levels including, rifleman, Bradley gunner, team leader, squad leader and Bradley commander. He also served as a recruiter for two-and-a-half years. Labar spent 6 years stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia where he had his first deployment to Kosovo. Upon his return, Labar's unit was part of the spearhead invasion of Iraq with the 1st battalion 30th infantry regiment. One year later, Ryan returned for another one-year deployment with the same battalion to Iraq. After his second tour, Labar moved to a recruiting assignment and spend two and half years on recruiting duty before he was sent to Korea. Due to injuries incurred in the military Labar was medically retired in November 2010 at the rank of Sergeant. Labar is from Vacaville, California where he currently lives. He is married with one daughter. “Veterans need to know that there are people out there that want to help, and understand what they have been through,” said Labar. “It's an honor for me to serve my fellow Veteran's in this position with Congressman Thompson.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.25.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Pete Sessions (TX-32) announced today that funding for their bipartisan legislation to improve treatment options for active duty soldiers with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) was approved by the House of Representatives. The funding was approved through H.R. 2397, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014. The Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) innovative treatment program was authorized in June 2013 through H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014. The funds will allow servicemembers to access innovative treatments offered outside military and veteran medical facilities. “This funding will make sure that our troops get the very best care America has to offer,” said Thompson. “We know that oftentimes the best treatments for TBI and PTS aren't available at military medical facilities, but rather at places like the Pathway Home in Yountville. By putting this funding in place, we will make sure that when our heroes return from combat they get the best care, no matter where it's provided.” “I'm pleased that our colleagues in the House have once again joined us in supporting our nation's soldiers and veterans who return from combat suffering from TBI and PTSD,” said Sessions. “These brave men and women have sacrificed for our country and we have a solemn duty to ensure that they have access to leading-edge treatments.” H.R. 2397 provides $10 million in funding for a new five-year pilot program created by Thompson and Sessions that allows military patients to receive treatment from health care facilities outside of the Department of Defense (DOD) that are utilizing an array of cutting-edge, successful therapies to treat TBI and PTS. Under this pilot program, physicians and residential treatment centers like The Pathway Home in Yountville, CA may qualify for payment from DOD through a “pay-for-performance” plan. This means they must prove that a patient has experienced demonstrable improvement. Treatment and reimbursement safeguards in the amendment ensure access to innovative private treatments while reserving payment only for treatments that work. To reach the long-term objective of incorporating cutting-edge medical practices into military hospitals, Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the program, encouraging a constant flow of new and innovative treatments. H.R. 2397 will now go to the Senate for approval.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.25.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson's (CA-5) bipartisan provision requiring every American flag purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent of grown, produced or manufactured in the United States, was again passed by the House of Representatives. Thompson's provision passed as part of H.R. 2397, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2014. The provision was previously included in H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014, which passed the House of Representatives on June 14, 2013, but has not yet been considered by the Senate. “Our men and women in uniform should never fight under an American flag made overseas,” said Thompson. “I am going to keep working to make sure that every American flag the DOD buys is made in America, by American workers with American products.” Specifically, Thompson's provision applies the Berry Amendment to the American Flag. The Berry Amendment, originally passed in 1941, prohibits DOD funds from being used to acquire food, clothing, military uniforms, fabrics, stainless steel, and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the United States, except in rare exceptions. Thompson's provision applies the same rules for the DOD's acquisition of American Flags, which previously were not listed as a covered item. Precedent already exists for such a provision. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase U.S.-made American Flags for serivcemembers' funerals. H.R. 2397 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 315-109. The legislation will now go to the Senate for approval. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.24.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Gene Green (TX-29) today introduced H.R. 2791, the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act (RERA) of 2013. The legislation promotes the U.S. recycling industry by prohibiting the exportation of some electronics whose improper disposal may create environmental, health, or national security risks. This helps bring recycling jobs back to the U.S. According to a recent study by the Coalition for American Electronics Recycling, restrictions on e-waste exports could create up to 42,000 new direct and indirect jobs with a total payroll of more than $1 billion. While there are domestic recyclers that currently process e-waste, they have a hard time competing with overseas recycling facilities that have few, if any, labor and environmental standards and are thus able to offer cheaper services. A U.S. International Trade Committee (ITC) report also states the RERA will help increase U.S. exports and create jobs. Discarded computers, TVs, phones and other consumer electronics - commonly referred to as electronic waste or “e-waste” - now comprise the fastest growing waste stream in the U.S. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the U.S. generates more than 3.4 million tons of e-waste a year.“Each year, millions of tons of e-waste are discarded in the U.S. and shipped to developing nations for unsafe salvage and recovery,” said Thompson. “By carefully regulating the export of e-waste, this bipartisan legislation creates good-paying recycling jobs here in the U.S., while taking concrete steps to address a growing environmental and health crisis.”“E-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the United States and can pose serious environmental and health problems here and around the world when not handled properly,” said Green. “As a senior member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I look forward to working with the majority in the House to pass this important legislation which will create thousands of jobs at home while helping protect human health and the environment.” H.R. 2791 has garnered bipartisan support with original Republican cosponsors, Reps. Mike Coffman (CO-6), Steve Stivers (OH-15) and Mike McCaul (TX-10). Original Democratic cosponsors include Reps. Thompson, Green and Louis Slaughter (NY-25). The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act creates a new section in the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) that prohibits the export of “restricted electronic waste” from the U.S. to countries that are not members of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the European Union (EU). Restricted electronic equipment refers to any equipment that contains specific toxic materials at levels greater than those deemed non- hazardous by the EPA. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that many of the developing nations that receive e-waste from the United States do not have the capacity or facilities to safely recycle and dispose of these used electronics. Under the legislation, tested and working equipment can still be exported to promote reuse. Products could also still be exported for warranty repair or due to recall. However, consumer electronic equipment, parts, and materials that contain toxic chemicals could not be exported to nations outside of OECD member countries or the EU. This legislative approach is consistent with the e-waste policies adopted by most other developed nations via international treaties, such as the Basel Convention and Basel Ban Amendment. H.R. 2791 also creates a research program at the Department of Energy to help assess the recycling and recovery of Rare Earth Metals from electronics. This provision will help ensure the proper collection and recycling of precious and strategic metals. The legislation is broadly supported by the electronics industry, including official backing from Hewlett Packard, Dell, Apple, Samsung, and Best Buy. It is also widely supported by the recycling industry, including the Coalition For American Electronics Recyclers, which includes more than 100 companies operating more than 185 processing facilities in 34 states; and the environmental community, including the Electronic TakeBack Coalition (ETBC) and the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC).Steve Skurnac, President of Sims Recycling Solutions and CAER steering committee member, said “By requiring responsible recycling of electronic scrap within our borders, RERA will create valuable recycling jobs that add significant economic value.” Neil Peters-Michaud, CEO of Cascade Asset Management and CAER steering committee member, noted “RERA will promote investment in our domestic recycling industry that can boost trade in tested, working electronics as well as processed e-scrap commodities.” “This is the most important step our federal government can take to solve the e-waste problem - to close the door on e-waste dumping on developing countries,” said Barbara Kyle, National Coordinator of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, a national environmental coalition which promotes responsible recycling of e-waste. “Consumers want to recycle their electronics, but they shouldn't have to worry about whether their old products will really be recycled, or just exported to China.” "Samsung Electronics America prioritizes responsible electronic recycling and is proud to again support the passage of RERA," said Joel Wiginton, Vice President of Government Relations of Samsung Electronics America. H.R. 2791 has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.###
07.23.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Jim Gerlach (R-PA) today announced that they will introduce the bipartisan Conservation Easement Incentive Act of 2013. The legislation provides a permanent tax incentive to family farmers, ranchers, and other landowners who chose not develop their land and instead preserve their property for conservation. By providing tax benefits to landowners who choose conservation, the bill helps preserve our nation's farm lands and open spaces for future generations. The bill has received broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, with more than 125 original co-sponsors. “Conservation easements work. They've already encouraged landowners to conserve millions of acres of farm lands and scenic open spaces, but there's more we can do” said Thompson. “By making this important conservation tool permanent, our bill will give landowners the certainty they need to preserve and protect even more land and natural resources for future generations.” "Whether you are a farmer looking to preserve land that's been in your family for generations or a local land trust forging community partnerships to protect natural resources, this legislation gives you greater freedom to make critical choices about future land use," Gerlach said. "Our effort to make the conservation easement tax incentive permanent has generated bipartisan support because it makes sense. I look forward to continue working with Congressman Thompson and my colleagues in the House to provide certainty and ensure that conservation easements remain an option for all property owners in the future." Under Congressmen Thompson and Gerlach's bill, landowners who donate their property's development rights would maintain ownership and management of the land, but forgo their rights to develop the land in the future. The Conservation Easement Incentive Act would make permanent an enhanced tax incentive for donating development rights that will otherwise expire at the end of 2013. The incentive's current uncertainty discourages conservation because it takes an average of three years to set up a conservation easement. Landowners who want to donate their development rights for conservation may not know if incentive's tax benefits will be available to them by the time their conservation easement is established. Eliminating this ever-changing deadline will give more farmers, ranchers, and forest owners the assurance they need to choose land conservation over development. In addition, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act would also help moderate-income landowners choose conservation by: - Raising the maximum deduction a donor can take for donating a conservation easement from 30 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year to 50 percent; - Allowing qualified farmers and ranchers to deduct up to 100 percent of their AGI; and - Increasing the number of years over which a donor can take this deduction from 5 to 15 years. The Conservation Easement Incentive Act has been endorsed by the Land Trust Alliance, Ducks Unlimited, National Wildlife Federation, National Cattleman's Beef Association, American Forest Foundation, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, and more than fifty other groups. The bill will be referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means for further consideration, on which Congressmen Thompson and Gerlach both serve.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.23.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today testified at a Committee on Natural Resources' Subcommittee on Public Lands and Environmental Regulation hearing on H.R. 1025, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. H.R. 1025, introduced by Thompson in March 2013, would designate the 350,000 acre Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under this designation, all currently owned federal lands within the NCA boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed according to the site-specific needs. The region would also be permanently protected under a NCA designation, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's natural beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters - which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. Thompson testimony as prepared for delivery is below. “Thank you Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and subcommittee members for holding today's hearing on H.R. 1025, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. “This legislation would designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). “The Berryessa Snow Mountain area in Northern California encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald eagles, black bears, mountain lions, elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. “This is one of the largest regions of relatively undisturbed public lands in California and can be easily visited from both the Sacramento and San Francisco areas. This makes it an ideal area for wildlife and public recreation. “Under this designation, all current federally owned lands located within the proposed NCA boundary would be permanently protected as a conservation area and united under one management plan. This would allow the region to be managed according to the site-specific needs located there. “Establishing this NCA would improve coordination among federal agencies; protect essential migratory corridors for wildlife; keep water clean; and may lead to federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. “It is important to note that the proposed NCA would only apply to federal lands and would not impact in any way, other lands located within its boundaries, including private property. As a result, current access to, and uses of, private land would not be affected by this proposal. “In addition, no legally open roads or motorized vehicle trails would be closed as a result of this proposed NCA designation. The NCA designation would also not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use located there. “Over the last three years, in developing this legislation I have worked closely with all stakeholders in the Berryessa Snow Mountain region, held public meetings for residents to express their views, and updated the bill based on their feedback. In fact, the bill you are considering today reflects changes I promised my constituents at town hall meetings last year. “These changes include additional bill language to further clarify that the proposed NCA designation would not impact the use of private property in the region, and additional language to ensure that the legislation would not impact motorized recreation on Lake Berryessa. “I also updated language at the suggestion of local farmers and ranchers to ensure that all existing grazing located within the proposed NCA will continue unchanged. “As the committee knows, outdoor recreation and protected lands help the local economy. Jobs and personal income often rise in local communities after nearby areas are permanently protected. That same potential is offered in the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. “H.R. 1025 has broad local support. It is supported by Boards of Supervisors, Chambers of Commerce and local cities. “It is also supported by more than 65 local elected officials; more than 200 businesses representing all five involved counties; nearly 30 landowners and farmers; and more than 35 recreation and conservation groups. “The Berryessa Snow Mountain Region is a national treasure. We have a responsibility to preserve it and make sure the region is managed efficiently and responsibly. “Designating the region as a National Conservation Area would preserve the land, help our local economies, and benefit those who live in and visit the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region. “Thank you again for holding today's hearing and I welcome any questions you may have.” Thompson was joined by Judy Ahmann, a Private Land Owner and Rancher from Napa at the hearing. Her testimony, as prepared for delivery is below. “Thank you Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and Members of the Subcommittee for giving me this opportunity to speak to you today regarding H.R. 1025, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. I would also like to thank Congressman Thompson for introducing this important legislation as well as Ranking Member Grilajva, and Representatives Huffman and Garamendi, and the other bill co-sponsors. “My name is Judy Ahmann and I am a private landowner and rancher from Northern California. I have been actively involved in the California Cattlewomen's Association and have served as the President at the local and state levels. I have also served on the Executive Board of American National CattleWomen. I am a member of the Napa County Farm Bureau and donate time and raise money for scholarship funds for the local 4H and Future Farmers of America groups. “My husband, John, and I operate a 3,000 acre cattle ranch, Running Deer Ranch, located on the northeastern shoreline of Lake Berryessa in the Blue Ridge, which we have recently gifted to our three daughters. Our ranch is directly adjacent to Bureau of Land Management lands that are proposed to be included in this national conservation area. We are strongly supportive of the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act because we believe this legislation will help forever preserve this wonderful place and our way of life. “I live and work in an incredible place. Deer and black bear freely roam the steep hillsides while bald and golden eagles, osprey and falcons soar on rising thermals. We love the blue oak woodlands and marvel at the rare plants found on the serpentine soils. A national conservation area designation will keep the region the way it is, creating a lasting legacy of public enjoyment of the outdoors for activities like hunting, grazing, hiking, and rafting. “There are many benefits to a national conservation area, but one that is of particular importance to me is that this designation will require the three federal land managers - the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Reclamation - to develop a cohesive and comprehensive management plan for all the federal lands in the conservation area. A comprehensive management approach will allow the federal agencies and the local community to better coordinate on important regional land use issues such as fire management, noxious weed control, and eradication of illegal marijuana production. “As a rancher, I am supportive of the grazing language included in the legislation. The legislation does not impact existing grazing operations. The legislation also permits new grazing within the conservation area, so long as it is consistent with existing law and the purposes of the area. Grazing may also be used as a management tool for activities such as noxious weed control or fire suppression. “As a private land owner, I am supportive of the private property language within the legislation. The legislation applies only to Federal lands and does not impact any non-federal land, including private property. Nothing in the legislation requires a landowner to allow public access to private property. And, the land management agencies must continue to provide adequate access to private inholdings within the conservation area. “Representative Thompson and his staff worked closely with local stakeholders to personally hear their thoughts and input, and to incorporate many of their ideas and suggestions. Because of this, H.R. 1025 has strong public support. Cities, counties, chambers of commerce and businesses throughout the region recognize the economic potential of this land designation. Landowners, farmers, and ranchers throughout the region support the bill because they see the value in preserving this area and their way of life. Recreation users from horse riders, to off road vehicle users and mountain bikers, to anglers, birders, hikers, and sportsmen treasure the region and are supportive of the proposed conservation area to maintain their recreational access. I have a list of supporters for this bill that I would like to submit with my testimony for the record. “By being a grandmother, protecting our public lands for future generations is important to me. I want to make sure that this scenic treasure is permanently protected so that it can be enjoyed by my grandchildren and their grandchildren. I am proud to say that my husband and I have been able to do just that. We have placed a conservation easement on Running Deer Ranch to ensure permanent protection of our ranch and the valuable habitat it provides, it is important to us to know that our ranch will remain a ranch as it is into the future. “In addition to permanently protecting the open space of our ranch, we also put a trail easement on our property to open public access to 9,100 acres of Bureau of Land Management federal public lands that had been landlocked. Today, the public can hike a path up to the Berryessa Peak public lands, legally, for the first time in 150 years. Breathtaking vistas, camping opportunities, rugged cliffs and seasonal creeks all can be enjoyed by the public now and for many years to come. I look forward to my grandsons hiking this trail with their Boy Scout troops. “In conclusion, the Berryessa Snow Mountain region deserves to be permanently protected for the enjoyment and benefit of current and future generations. I strongly support H.R. 1025 to protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain region and urge favorable and swift action on this bill. Thank you for the opportunity to testify.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.19.2013	Today, several U.S. Representatives from Northern California called on the Brown Administration to withdraw and fully revise their proposed Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) in light of draft environmental documents being found “biased” and “insufficient” by federal agencies in public comments made available yesterday. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Marine Fisheries Service provided these comments to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) as part of a review of the draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS). “These reports confirm what we've been saying all along - this proposed BDCP is not a workable solution to California's water challenges. It's rushed, flawed, hurts wildlife and puts the interests of South-of-Delta water contractors ahead of North-of-Delta farmers, fishers and small business owners. Until we have a plan that is transparent, based on sound science and developed with all stake-holders at the table, then any process that moves us closer to building these tunnels will recklessly risk billions of California tax dollars and thousands of jobs.” - Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) "We have said from day one that any proposal related to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta must be based on sound science and an accurate cost-benefit analysis. The recently-released reports clearly show that Governor Brown's misguided plan for the Delta is based on neither. To continue to move forward without taking into consideration the concerns of all stakeholders, the countless jobs that could be lost, and the billions of taxpayer dollars at stake is a clear disservice to the people of California. I will continue to fight against any plan that would divert more water from the Delta, and to stand up for the families, farmers and small business owners who rely upon a healthy Delta for their livelihoods." - Jerry McNerney (CA-09) “The Governor's administration told us time and again that their process would be governed by unbiased, sound science. But these federal reports confirm the opposite. As we suspected, this process has been rushed, biased, and excludes viable alternatives at the behest of big irrigators and agencies that stand to gain huge profits from their increased access to northern water. To proceed any further without major revisions that take into account the concerns of all stakeholders, not just those with political and financial influence, would be shortsighted, unproductive, and ultimately a failure.” - Rep. George Miller (CA-11) “The federal agency comments on the BDCP's draft environmental documents continue to show not only that the project doesn't solve the water problems that face our state, but that the BDCP as written is truly flawed. Until we have a process that includes all stakeholders and is based on sound science, we are wasting precious time and taxpayer money. This is time and money that we do not have. In the meantime, the environment of the Delta continues to decline and our state's water problems continue to grow. We must get on track with a process that will produce a viable solution for California's future.” - Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-6) “The peripheral tunnel plan is incredibly destructive, and because it does not add one drop to our water supply, incredibly unproductive. The current plan concludes that massive water diversions south of the Delta are needed and then twists arguments to meet that conclusion. Instead, we need a scientific process, freed from the blinders of bias, to meet the legally mandated co-equal goals of ecological conservation and reliability of water supply - both of which are essential to the state's economy. As an alternative to the current BDCP, I have proposed a framework that would expand our water supply and protect the Delta through greater water conservation, recycling, and storage, levee improvements, and the protection of existing water rights. We need a water system that meets the needs of all Californians.” - Rep. Garamendi (CA-3). As someone who played a major role in California's landmark 2009 water reforms, I have been concerned from the very beginning that the Bay Delta Conservation Plan is not meeting the high standards and requirements established in that legislation. These reports are just the latest in a series of wake up calls showing that the BDCP is headed in a dangerous direction. We need a plan for the Bay-Delta that is based on science and follows the law, and it looks to meâ€”and clearly, to many othersâ€”like the BDCP continues to fall short. - Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-02)###
07.18.2013	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Jared Huffman (D-San Rafael) today introduced bipartisan legislation to address the environmental damage caused by rampant trespass marijuana cultivation. The Protecting Lands Against Narcotics Trafficking Act (PLANT Act) would establish new penalties for causing environmental damage while cultivating marijuana on federal public lands or while trespassing on private property. Thompson and Huffman introduced the bill with bipartisan cosponsors Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), and Doug Lamborn (R-CO). “These illegal grow sites are threatening lives, destroying public lands and devastating wildlife,” said Thompson. “There should be stiff penalties for the people whose reckless and illegal actions are causing this environmental damage. Our legislation will make sure these criminals are held fully responsible for the harm they cause.” “Throughout my district and increasingly throughout the United States, we're seeing trespass marijuana grows threatening endangered wildlife, contaminating fragile salmon streams, and making forests unsafe for working and recreation,” said Congressman Huffman, who represents the "Emerald Triangle" of Mendocino, Humboldt and Trinity counties in northern California. “As we move toward more rational marijuana policies, which I believe should be left to the states, it's important that we address the immediate threat to our environment and public safety posed by trespass growing operations. Where it is lawful to grow marijuana, it must be done lawfully and responsibly.” “The widespread illegal marijuana cultivation we're facing in rural areas creates a strain on law enforcement, endangers our citizens and damages our public lands. Americans should never be concerned for their safety when visiting our National Forests, and the environmental damage these criminals cause places an increased burden on legal users of public lands,” said Congressman LaMalfa. “The PLANT Act gives law enforcement another tool to pursue and prosecute those who act as if our nation's laws don't apply in rural areas, creating a strong deterrent against these illegal operations.” In 2012, nearly one million marijuana plants were eradicated from 471 sites on National Forest lands found in 20 states across the country. The operators of these illegal grow operations frequently level hilltops, starting landslides on erosion-prone hillsides, divert and dam creeks and streams, and use excessive pesticides to protect their crop. Individuals and private landholders, including ranchers, timber companies, and forest trusts, report that they are increasingly forced to confront criminals and eradicate drug operations from their own land, endangering lives and costing significant sums of money for eradication and reclamation. Cultivation of illegal drugs on federal property is already a crime under the Controlled Substances Act, but prosecutions are rare and environmental damage is almost never fully accounted for. Under current law, environmental damages such as water diversions and vegetation removal are not considered as separate or aggravating offenses. The PLANT Act, introduced today in the House, instructs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to establish penalties for the environmental damage caused by marijuana cultivation and other controlled substance production on “trespass grows” on private property or on federal public lands. The new legislation specifically identifies three areas of concern: - Unlawful use of poisons or hazardous chemicals such as pesticides, rodenticides, or high grade fertilizers. - Substantial impairment or taking of water from local aquifers, rivers, or bodies of water. - Significant removal of vegetation or the clear cutting of timber. The bipartisan legislation was referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it awaits further consideration.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

07.12.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced four grant awards totaling $548,897 to help community health centers enroll the uninsured in new health insurance options made available by the Affordable Care Act. With this award, the health centers will help consumers understand their coverage options in California's new Health Insurance Marketplace - Covered California. The awards will also allow the health centers to help people determine their eligibility for Medi-Cal, the Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as other forms of financial assistance. “The Affordable Care Act is providing people in our district with access to affordable health insurance,” said Thompson. “This award will help people identify options for coverage and enroll in an affordable insurance plan that suits their needs. “Not only is this good for those looking for affordable health insurance options, it's also good for health care costs overall. Right now, our clinics and hospitals are providing millions of dollars of uncompensated care and that cost is ultimately passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. Covering the uninsured will drive down health care costs for everyone.” Clinic Ole in Napa was awarded a $126,364 grant. Santa Roswa Community Health Centers was awarded a $224,055 grant. Sonoma Valley Community Health Center was awarded an $86,678 grant. Contra Costa County Health Center in Martinez was awarded an $111,811grant. With these funds: - Clinic Ole expects to expand one current part-time position to full-time and hire one additional worker who will assist local residents with enrollment into affordable health insurance coverage. - Contra Costa County Health Center expects to hire two additional workers, who will assist local residents with enrollment into affordable health insurance coverage. - Sonoma Valley Community Health Center will hire two full time employees who will assist local residents with enrollment into affordable health insurance coverage. - Santa Rosa Community Health Center will hire four new employees, and will train five current employees to conduct outreach and assist residents with enrollment into the new, affordable health insurance options. In California, 129 health centers operating 1,221 sites served 3,261,720 patients last year, 42 percent of whom were uninsured. Today's announcement is part of a larger effort to make applying for health coverage as easy as possible. The new, consumer-focused HealthCare.gov website and the 24-hour-a-day consumer call center (1-800-318-2596) are available to help people in California's 5th District prepare for open enrollment and ultimately sign up for health coverage. These new tools will help residents understand their coverage options and select the plan that best suits their needs when open enrollment in the new Health Insurance Marketplace, Covered California, begins on October 1, 2013. The awards were issued by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA).

07.10.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) today announced that he founded the bipartisan Congressional Invasive Species Caucus. Thompson co-founded the caucus with Rep. Dan Benishek (R-MI-1). The Caucus will serve to raise awareness about invasive species, support local communities who are bearing the brunt of this problem, and promote efforts to prevent and control the spread of invasive species. The Caucus will provide opportunities for Members of Congress to meet with other policy makers, organizations and industry leaders that are working to prevent the spread of invasive species.“Invasive species pose a costly challenge to infrastructure, agriculture and the environment,” said Thompson. “By bringing together experts and industry leaders, we can come up with plans to protect our communities from invasive species before they become a major problem.” Invasive species threaten communities by devastating native habitat, damaging crops, clogging water pipes, infecting plants and animals with dangerous diseases, or outcompeting native species. These impacts can lower crop yields, pose health hazards, irreparably damage natural environments, and take a severe toll on local, state, and federal budgets. Thompson recently co-authored bipartisan legislation, H.R. 1823, the Protecting Lakes Against Quagga Act, that would add quagga mussels to the national invasive species list. This listing gives federal agencies greater ability to prevent the spread of the invasive species. In the 5th Congressional district, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma, and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes has been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and impact the water supply for residents in Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. The Congressional Invasive Species Caucus will work to develop plans to combat the spread of invasive species like the quaggas.

07.03.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today that the Headquarters Building of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) at Fort Campbell, Kentucky will be dedicated in honor of Colonel Robert Howard. Col. Howard served with the 5th Special Forces in Vietnam, and was Thompson's company commander when Thompson was an airborne instructor at the Army Airborne School at Fort Benning, Georgia. Thompson requested the Army establish a memorial honoring Colonel Howard and worked with the Army to identify the facility at Fort Campbell. “During this week where we celebrate America's independence, it's fitting that we honor a man who fought and sacrificed so much for the freedoms we all enjoy. I had the honor to serve under Colonel Howard while I was stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia,” said Thompson. “He is one of the most decorated soldiers in American history and he has earned the honor of having 5th Special Forces Group Headquarters forever named in his honor.” Colonel Robert Howard, a Green Beret, was awarded the Medal of Honor (the citation of which can be found here), the Distinguished Service Cross, a Silver Star, a Defense Superior Service Medal, four Bronze Stars for Valor, eight Purple Hearts, four Legion of Merit awards, three Meritorious Service Medals, and more than forty other awards and decorations for his service. Colonel Howard enlisted in the Army in 1956 at the age of 17 and served in the Army for 36 years. He served five tours (54 months) in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in the Army Special Forces and was wounded 14 times. After his retirement, Colonel Howard worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs, combining for more than 52 years of government service on behalf of veterans and members of the Armed Forces. During his retirement, he traveled to war zones to speak to and inspire troops several times during the current conflicts. Colonel Howard died of pancreatic cancer on December 23, 2009, at the age of 70, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on February 22, 2010, with full military honors.

06.28.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced a $238,000 federal grant that will provide Sonoma County veterans with job training, job placement, housing and other services. The grant, provided through the Department of Labor (DOL), will be awarded to Vietnam Veterans of California, Inc. in Santa Rosa. The grants were awarded through the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP). “No one who has fought for our nation in uniform should have to fight for a job or a roof over their head when they return to civilian life,” said Thompson. “Too many of our nation's heroes live every day without a job or shelter. This is a disgrace and as a combat veteran myself I know we must do better. This grant will ease the transition to civilian life for Sonoma County's veterans and help make sure can find work, get a home and support their family.” The HVRP grants will help homeless veterans reintegrate into society and the labor force while providing services aimed at addressing the complex challenges that homeless veterans often confront. The services provided by grantees will include job placement, on-the-job training, career counseling, life skills and money management mentoring, as well as help in finding housing. Funds were awarded on a competitive basis to state and local workforce investment boards, local public agencies and nonprofit organizations, including faith-based and community organizations. These organizations are familiar with the areas and populations to be served and have demonstrated that they can administer effective programs to help veterans. More information on the Department of Labor's unemployment and re-employment programs for veterans can be found at www.dol.gov/vets.

06.27.2013	With student loan rates set to double on Monday, July 1st, U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson yesterday called on the House to immediately bring up legislation he co-authored, H.R. 1595, the Student Loan Relief Act. Thompson's bill would allow college students to benefit from historically low interest rates by freezing the current 3.4 percent rate on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years. The House Majority blocked H.R. 1433 from coming to the floor for consideration. “Students and the thousands of hardworking families across our district and nation already carry $1 trillion in student loan debt,” said Thompson. “Allowing these rates to double undermines our economy, weakens our middle class, and puts college out of reach for millions of students. Congress needs to act now. Time is running out.” The House Majority recently passed legislation, H.R. 1911, which would make college more expensive for students and families by forcing them into loans with interest rates that fluctuate year by year. Under H.R. 1911, interest rates on loans would be reset every year. So, the interest rate on a loan taken out next year by a freshman may start off low, but she doesn't get to keep that interest rate for the life of the loan. It will change every year, potentially skyrocketing. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the bill would charge millions of students and families $3.7 billion over the next decade in additional interest payments relative to current law. The CBO also found that H.R. 1911 is even worse for students and families than allowing interest rates to double on July 1st as currently scheduled. Under H.R. 1911, students who borrow the maximum amount of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans over five years would pay nearly $2,000 more in interest costs than if interest rates doubled. “Our students and families deserve better than a bill that makes many students pay higher interest payments than they would if Congress did nothing and interest rates doubled,” said Thompson. “The one essential element to our nation's long-term economic success is education. Instead of passing bills that would increase the debt burden for students and families, we need to work together to keep college costs down. The bill I've co-authored would do just that.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.27.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the “Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act,” a comprehensive immigration reform bill, by a vote of 68-32: “Today, the Senate passed bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform. Not only is this bill the right thing to do for our country and in line with our nation's most fundamental principles, it will boost our economy and lower our debt. “Now it's time for the House to get to work on tough, fair comprehensive reform that strengthens our borders and offers an earned pathway to citizenship for the 11 million undocumented immigrants already living, working and rising families here.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.26.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement on the United States Supreme Court's rulings on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) and Proposition 8. “Today, the Supreme Court took a stand for equal justice under the law, ruling that laws that deny equality are immoral, unjust and unfair. This is a giant step forward, but we must continue working until every American has the right to marry whoever they love no matter where you live.” In a 5-4 ruling the Supreme Court struck down DOMA, a law passed by Congress in 1996 that denied federal benefits to legally married gay couples. Justices Anthony Kennedy, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan constituted the Court's majority. Dissenting were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court issued a procedural ruling that said the people who brought the Proposition 8 case to the court had no legal standing to do so. The ruling allows a lower court decision striking down Proposition 8 to take effect, clearing the way for same sex marriage to resume in California. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan constituted the Court's majority.

06.24.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that he successfully secured $16.62 million in funds in the Army Corps of Engineers' Fiscal Year 2013 work plan to complete the Napa Flood Project's Downtown Bypass Channel. Once complete, this project will provide 100-year flood protection to the City of Napa and support business development and job creation throughout the community. “This project will be a lynchpin of economic development and job creation in our community for decades to come,” said Thompson. “A lot of time and effort went into this. We worked countless hours with Senator Dianne Feinstein, community leaders and stakeholders, and now we can finally say we're finishing the job. Because of this project, thousands of jobs will be created and supported. This is truly a great day for Napa.” The project will improve water quality, create urban wetlands, and enhance wildlife habitats, while also providing flood protection to 2,700 homes, 350 businesses, and more than 50 public properties. Already, this project has provided tremendous economic benefit, sparking almost $900 million in local public and private economic activity since it was begun. The Bypass Channel represents a small portion of the project's overall cost and is of central importance to the project's overall success. According to an economic analysis study requested by the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, constructing the Bypass Channel will represent no more than four percent of the entire project cost, while providing more than 30 percent of the flood protection benefits. Thompson previously worked to secure more than $226 million on this project. To date, over $900 million in public and private investment has been made in Napa because of the promise that the project's completion will reduce instances of flooding in the City and County. With the certainty of construction for the project's central component being funding, more investment can follow.

06.20.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and a bipartisan coalition of House members voted down H.R. 1947, the House Republican's harmful Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management Act, or Farm Bill. The House Republican's bill failed by a bipartisan vote of 195-234. “Today, the House rightfully rejected the Majority's harmful Farm Bill that would have hurt conservation and gutted food programs important to children and working families,” said Thompson. “We need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a bipartisan solution that is fair to our farmers and ranchers, incentivizes conservation, and protects hard working families, seniors and children from devastating cuts that will cause millions to go hungry.” The House Republican's bill would have cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) by $20 billion, stopping food aid to 2 million Americans. The bill would have also cut off school lunches and breakfasts to 210,000 children. Additional amendments were added to the bill that would have resulted in even deeper cuts to SNAP, further disadvantaging people who need help the most. The Senate passed its version of the bill by a bipartisan vote of 66 to 27 on June 10th. The major difference between the two bills is that the Senate bill cuts SNAP by only $4 billion.

06.18.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today released the following statement on the White House's announcement of significant progress being made on executive actions aimed at reducing and preventing gun violence. “The Administration's executive actions are helping reduce gun violence, but the policies that would have the greatest impact require that Congress act. The most important thing Congress can do is pass bipartisan legislation that helps keep guns from criminals, terrorists and the dangerously mentally ill by expanding background checks. The bill I've introduced with Pete King has more than 180 co-sponsors and even more of our colleagues have said they would vote yes if the bill was brought to the floor. The American people deserve a vote in the House on this bill,” said Thompson. Thompson co-authored H.R. 1565 with Pete King (R-NY). The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). More than 180 House members have cosponsored the bill. The legislation helps prevent guns from falling into criminal hands and reinforces the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. By closing these loopholes, the legislation greatly reduces the number of places that criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can buy guns. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a table or out of someone's trunk at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because no background check is required for these kinds of sales. Last year, the background check system identified and denied more than 88,000 sales to criminals, domestic abusers, those with serious mental illnesses, and other prohibited purchasers. However, those same prohibited purchasers could buy those guns at a gun show or over the Internet without any questions asked. More than 40 percent of gun transactions are conducted without a background check. The King-Thompson bill helps fix this by expanding the current background check system to close these loopholes. Under the bill, background checks will continue to be conducted though a licensed dealer and records will be kept in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. The legislation also strengthens the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners by banning the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers and allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state they are stationed. It lets gun owners use a state concealed carry permit issued within the last five years in lieu of a background check and permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. The bill also improves the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will also reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

06.18.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.R. 1797, a bill offered by House Republicans that would place severe restrictions on health and reproductive rights of women. The legislation would institute a national ban on abortions after 20 weeks, with no exception to protect a woman's health. “This bill is an unacceptable and unconstitutional attack on women's health care,” said Thompson. “Congress has absolutely no business interfering in decisions best made between a woman, her family and her doctor. “Instead of passing bills that are a direct attack on a woman's health, her privacy and the Constitution, Congress should concentrate its efforts on reducing the number of unintended pregnancies through education and family planning. I will continue working to make sure women have the right to make their own choices about their own health care.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.14.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson's (CA-5) bipartisan provision requiring every American flag purchased by the Department of Defense (DOD) to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent of grown, produced or manufactured in the United States, was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this week. Thompson's provision passed as part of H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014. “Every American flag the DOD buys should be made in America, by American workers with American products,” said Thompson. “At a time when our manufacturing sector is struggling and millions in our country are out of work, it is a slap in the face to all Americans to have their tax dollars spent on U.S. flags that are made overseas.” Specifically, the provision applies the Berry Amendment to the American Flag. The Berry Amendment, originally passed in 1941, prohibits DOD funds from being used to acquire food, clothing, military uniforms, fabrics, stainless steel, and hand or measuring tools that are not grown or produced in the United States. Thompson's provision applies the same rules for the DOD's acquisition of American Flags, which previously, were not listed as a covered item. Precedent already exists for such a provision. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase U.S.-made American Flags for serivcemembers' funerals. Thompson's provision was originally introduced in committee as an amendment to the NDAA by Rep. Frank LoBiondo (R-NJ-02). A similar Thompson provision was included in the draft Fiscal Year 2014 DOD Appropriations Act, which is scheduled to be considered by the full House of Representatives in the coming weeks. “It is unbelievable and unacceptable that our men and women who wear the uniform in defense of our nation have fought under a flag that could be manufactured outside of the United States,” said LoBiondo. “I appreciate Representative Thompson for his joint leadership in correcting this injustice and ensuring the honor of military service is reinforced by the pride of an American-made U.S. flag.” The legislation will now go to the Senate for approval. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.14.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Pete Sessions (TX-32) announced today that their bipartisan legislation to improve treatment options for veterans and active duty soldiers with Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS) passed the House. This amendment to H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2014, allows veterans and service members to access innovative treatments offered outside military and veteran medical facilities. “Our troops and veterans have earned the very best care America has to offer,” said Thompson. “When the best treatments aren't available at military and veteran medical facilities, then our servicemembers should be able to go elsewhere. Our amendment will make sure that our heroes who return from combat with TBI or PTS have access to the best care, no matter where it's provided.” “I'm delighted that our House colleagues have joined us in supporting this initiative to ensure that our troops have access to the most effective treatments available,” said Sessions. “By prioritizing treatment results over treatment location, our nation's heroes who return from combat with TBI and PTSD will have the option to utilize an array of leading-edge therapies. They deserve nothing less than to receive the most successful and highest quality care in America.” Thompson's and Sessions' amendment creates a new five-year $10 million pilot program that allows military patients to receive treatment from health care facilities outside of the VA that are utilizing an array of leading-edge, successful therapies to treat TBI and PTS. Under Thompson's and Sessions' amendment, physicians and residential treatment centers like The Pathway Home in Yountville, CA may qualify for payment from the Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs through a “pay-for-performance” plan, meaning they must prove that a patient has experienced demonstrable improvement. Treatment and reimbursement safeguards in the amendment ensure access to innovative private treatments while reserving payment only for treatments that work. “Today, veterans and active duty soldiers across the country feel sense of hopefulness that their need for access to best practice treatment for Post Traumatic Stress and Traumatic Brain Injury is close at hand. The bipartisan amendment to H.R. 1960, sponsored by Congressmen Mike Thompson and Pete Session is example of how leaders in Washington DC can come together like our military personnel on battlefield,” said Fred Gusman, Executive Director of the Pathway Home in Yountville. “On Battlefield politics is put aside and our men and women stand together to complete the mission at hand. In war there are many obstacles to contend with, and that is expected, but when our warriors return home they expect that our country will "keep the promise" to provide the care they are entitled too. The Thompson-Sessions amendment H.R. 1960 sends clear message that today's veterans and active duty soldiers will not be left behind.” To reach the long-term objective of incorporating leading-edge medical practices into military hospitals, Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the program, encouraging a constant flow of new and innovative treatments. The legislation will now go to the Senate for approval.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.13.2013	Today, House Republicans rejected consideration of a bipartisan amendment authored by U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL-27) that would have allowed active duty soldiers and veterans who serve honorably to expedite the citizenship of their family members and helped to protect them from deportation. Thompson and Ros-Lehtinen had offered the amendment to H.R. 1960, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014. “The fact anyone could reject this amendment is a slap in the face to our veterans, our servicemembers, and our history as a nation of immigrants,” said Thompson. “We have men and women risking their lives to defend America and protect our way life. The last thing they should have to worry about on the battlefield is the immigration status of themselves or their family." The Congressional Research Service reports that more than 45,000 non-citizens are serving in the United States Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard). In addition, many U.S. citizens serving in the military have family members who are not U.S. citizens. Non-citizen servicemembers and service members with non-citizen family members represent a significant portion of U.S. Armed Forces, and they often face daunting and complex immigration law and procedure. The Thompson-Ros-Lehtinen amendment addressed these immigration concerns of America's military personnel, our veterans, and their family members back home by: - Helping Veterans Who Have Served Honorably Become U.S. Citizens: The legislation allows soldiers who serve honorably during certain contingency operations to become U.S. citizens expeditiously. - Reuniting Lawful Permanent Residents Serving in Active-Duty with Family Members: The bill exempts immigrant petitions filed for the spouses and children of military personnel from numerical caps that limit the number of immigration petitions that can be granted each year. - Preserving Family Unity of Military Personnel: The bill permits immediate family members of military personnel to apply for lawful immigration status, subject to all necessary criminal and security background checks; and codifies existing guidelines for placing active-duty soldiers or veterans into removal proceedings.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.13.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives today in commemoration of the six-month anniversary of the tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut. Thompson is the co-author of legislation that would expand background checks to cover all advertised firearm sales. Below are his remarks: “Thank you, Mr. Speaker. “Six months ago, our nation witnessed a horrible massacre of innocence in Newtown, Connecticut. “In the six months since, there are two important facts that we should note. First, nearly 5,000 more Americans have been killed by people using guns. Second, Congress has done absolutely nothing to reduce and prevent these deaths. “The Senate took one vote to expand background checks. Sadly, it failed when a minority of Senators voted against the wishes of 90 percent of Americans. “The only thing more disappointing than the Senate voting down this pro-gun owner, anti-criminal legislation, is that the House has refused to vote at all. “Peter King and I have introduced H.R. 1565, legislation that's identical to the Senate background check effort. We have 3 Republicans. We have 179 Democrats. A total of 182 co-authors. “Surely, we need more support from the Republican side of the aisle. But the truth is, this shouldn't be a controversial bill and it shouldn't be partisan. Background checks are something everyone in both parties should be able to agree on. “Everyone says they're against criminals, terrorists and the dangerously mentally ill getting guns. But you can't be against that and be against background checks. Background checks are the first line of defense. “Our bipartisan bill strengthens that first line of defense. “It's anti-criminal. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad - because those sales don't require a background check. “Last year, the background check system identified and denied 88,000 gun sales to criminals, domestic abusers, those with dangerous mental illnesses, and other prohibited purchasers. However, those same criminals could buy those same guns at a gun show or over the Internet without any questions asked - because those sales don't require a background check. “Our bill closes this huge loophole, greatly reducing the number of places a criminal can buy a gun - because our bill would require background checks at all gun shows, and for internet or newspaper sales. “Our bill is pro-gun owner and pro-Second Amendment. It provides reasonable exceptions for firearm transfers between family and friends. You won't have to get a background check when you inherit the family rifle, or borrow shotgun for a hunting trip, or purchase a gun from a friend, hunting buddy or neighbor. “It bans the creation of a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. “It allows active duty military to buy firearms in their home states and the state in which they are stationed. “It authorizes the use of a state concealed carry permit in lieu of a background check to purchase a firearm. “And, it allows interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. “We have a bill ready for the floor. It's bipartisan. It will help keep guns from criminals, terrorists and the dangerously mentally ill. And it supports the Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. “If the bill didn't support the Second Amendment, my name wouldn't be on it. I am a gun owner and I believe that law-abiding Americans have a constitutional right to own a firearm. “But I'm also a father and grandfather and I know we have a responsibility to do everything we can do reduce gun violence. “This bill deserves a vote. The people of Newtown deserve a vote. The families of the nearly 5,000 people who've been killed since Newtown deserve a vote. Our kids and grandkids deserve a vote. “Mr. Speaker, please give us a vote.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.11.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) yesterday hosted a summit on economic revitalization of Mare Island. The meeting took place on Mare Island. Thompson was joined by representatives from the U.S. Navy, the Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment, the City of Vallejo and local business and elected leaders. The summit focused on the clean up, redevelopment, long-term economic opportunities available on Mare Island. “Mare Island has the potential to become a center of economic activity in the Bay Area,” said Thompson. “The first step in that process is bringing all the stakeholders to the table and start developing a plan. That's what this meeting was about. We have a long way to go and a lot more work to do, but this was a very productive meeting and all parties are committed to revitalizing Mare Island.” A readout of Thompson's Mare Island Summit is below. On June 10th, 2013, Congressman Mike Thompson organized and led a diverse group of agencies and elected officials in a review of the status of the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo, California. Represented at the meeting were State Senator Lois Wolk and State Assembly Member Susan Bonilla, and Solano County Supervisor Erin Hannigan. Vallejo Mayor Osby Davis and staff participated as the Local Redevelopment Authority for Mare Island. Federal representatives, in addition to Congressman Thompson, were Navy officials from Washington D.C. and San Diego, and the Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment in Sacramento. The day began with introductions and an overview, including a brief history of the closure of the Mare Island Naval Ship Yard under the Base Realignment and Closure process, beginning in 1993. The group then toured Mare Island, visiting a variety of public and private sector locations on the island where redevelopment has been evolving. The range of reuse spans recreational, educational, residential, green technology business, light and heavy industrial, historic preservation and government. The tour concluded at the northern end of Mare Island where dilapidated buildings mar the landscape and present the most significant obstacle to a full revitalization of Mare Island. This area is the gateway to the rest of the island, as well as a gateway to the City of Vallejo. During the meetings the Navy reviewed the progress of the environmental cleanup occurring with the oversight of State and Federal regulatory organizations. While progress has been slow at times, the commitment to complete the cleanup is strong and the end is in sight. Funding commitments are strong. The meeting's main focus was to examine new opportunities for economic redevelopment. The Navy's role is to complete environmental cleanup as soon as possible and transfer property to the City of Vallejo. The Department of Defense Office of Economic Adjustment supports redevelopment through planning grants and coordinates federal agency resources to assist in community economic recovery. Ideas emerged as to how to seek additional funding sources and develop marketing strategies to attract developers to north Mare Island. Thompson committed to continue working with all stakeholders on the cleanup and economic revitalization of Mare Island.

06.11.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $200,000 grant for Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC). The National Science Foundation grant will fund a project at SRJC aimed at improving sustainable agriculture education and enhancing collaborative efforts between SRJC, local high schools and public universities in California. “Agriculture is the economic heartbeat of Sonoma County,” said Thompson. “Having a well-educated workforce that's knowledgeable in sustainability will help make sure our community's tradition of sustainable agriculture remains strong for generations to come.” The project, entitled "Improving Pathways in Sustainable Agriculture Education," provides a more streamlined education in the field of sustainable agriculture by improving collaboration between Santa Rosa Junior College, local high schools and state-supported universities in California. High school students will be introduced to sustainable agriculture through outreach and a summer academy program where they receive dual credit and also credit by examination for selected high school courses. For students enrolled in sustainable agriculture programs at SRJC, the program will improve retention and completion rates through enhanced advising, modifications to curriculum, increased course offerings and the development of internship opportunities. The project also improves the collaboration of sustainable agriculture courses with California's state-supported four-year institutions such as UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, Chico State and Fresno State to allow more students to pursue and complete four-year degrees in sustainable agriculture. Students will benefit from practical "farm to table" learning at SRJC's 365 acre Shone Farm. Students will also learn business and marketing aspects that are important to a successful sustainable agriculture operation through internships and student enterprise projects. Long-term benefits of the project include improved stewardship of the land and natural resources, decreased use of chemicals, healthier food supplies, and new ways to support small and medium farms.

06.06.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced that the Napa County Airport's glideslope receiver system is operational. Over a nine year period, Thompson has secured funding on three separate occasions, totaling nearly $1.5 million for the project. The glideslope allows approaching pilots to land during periods of low visibility due to adverse weather conditions.“This public safety project has been many years in the making and I am thrilled that we have finally crossed the finish line,” said Thompson. “With the glideslope up and running, it will enhance the safety of folks flying in and out. It will boost the use of our airport which will help local businesses and improve tourism. And, it will relieve pressure on other area airports.” “This is an important safety tool for those who fly in and out of the Napa County Airport and it would not have been installed if it were not for Congressman Thompson's hard work,” said Napa County Airport Manager, Martin Pehl. Thompson first secured $800,000 in a 2003 appropriations bill. He then secured $380,000 in a 2009 appropriations bill and $280,000 in a 2010 appropriations bill. Before the instillation of the glideslope, aircraft arriving in Napa County during heavy storms or fog have been diverted to other area airports, such as those in Sacramento, San Francisco or Oakland.

06.06.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a Targeted Brownfields Assessment award of up to $75,000 for the City of Vallejo to examine a series of dilapidated buildings on North Mare Island. These funds will be used to provide technical assistance to the City of Vallejo through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) which supplements the Brownfields Grant Program by promoting the cleanup and development of Brownfields. “Mare Island has the potential to be a center of economic activity in the Bay Area,” said Thompson. “Getting this funding support to assess cleanup and redevelopment on North Mare Island is an important first step in this process.” "The successful redevelopment and reuse of Mare Island will be significantly enhanced through the rehabilitation of the gateway area of North Mare Island,” said Dan Marks, Economic Development Director for the City of Vallejo. “Through the help of Congressman Thompson who identified this EPA funding opportunity, the City of Vallejo can take another important step in the redevelopment process and make further progress toward tackling the challenges we face on the north end of the island." Brownfields are real property, where the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these properties protects the environment, reduces blight, and takes development pressures off greenspaces and working lands. The grant announced today will provide funding for an EPA contractor to focus on some of the worst buildings on North Mare Island which were transferred by the U.S. Navy to the City of Vallejo as part of a larger transfer of assets from the former Mare Island Naval Base. This detailed assessment will evaluate the hazards and costs of building demolition for the highest priorities on the north end of Mare Island so that economic redevelopment of this area can move forward.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.05.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson announced today that the House of Representatives passed legislation with language called for by Thompson and other California Democrats that would hold the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) accountable for ending the backlog of claims at the Veterans Benefits Administration. The language was included with H.R. 2216, the Fiscal Year 2014 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill.“We must make sure our veterans and their families receive the benefits they have earned,” said Thompson. “It is unacceptable for a veteran to be forced to wait for care and benefits, in some cases for more than a year, because the VA is backlogged. We're going to make sure the VA continues to do everything possible to get this problem fixed.” Currently, new claims by veterans can take almost 300 days to process, delaying access to care and benefits. Many California veterans in the 5th Congressional District are serviced by the Oakland Regional Office which has one of the longest claims backlog in the country. The language included in H.R. 2216 will require a monthly report from each regional office and the national VA office detailing the current backlog of claims. Additional reporting will be required from offices with backlogs averaging more than 200 days. In an April letter to the House Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Thompson and other members of the California delegation requested these additional reporting requirements that were included in the bill passed out of Committee and then by the House. A full copy of the letter is below. April 22, 2013 The Honorable John Culberson Chairman Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs HVC-227, The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable Sanford Bishop Ranking Member Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs 1016 Longworth HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Culberson and Mr. Bishop: On the battlefield, the motto is to leave no soldier behind. As a nation, it is our duty to ensure that we leave no veteran behind. Sadly, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) has had a backlog in veteran disability claims for many years, and the Oakland Regional Office has the dubious distinction of having the largest backlog in the country. I know you share our concern about the unacceptable amount of time VBA takes to process a new benefits claim and the unacceptable volume of the existing, unprocessed backlog. We appreciate the recently announced VBA policy to provide provisional expedited claims decisions for those veterans waiting longer than a year. Coupled with the changes VBA is making to address the backlog, including new technology and new intake procedures, we understand that VBA believes it will eliminate the backlog by 2015. However, there is still much work to be done. A recent report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the VBA's backlog reduction plan does not articulate performance measures for each initiative, including their intended impact on the claims backlog. Furthermore, while improvements in technology can speed up many processes and eliminate unnecessary or duplicative paperwork, we remain skeptical that new technology alone is the magic bullet for this complex problem. VETERANS ADMINISTRATION Veterans Benefits Administration Report LanguageThe Committee finds the VBA justification for the backlog of claims unacceptable. For the last four years, the Committee has fully funded the President's budget request for additional FTEs and increased IT funding, yet the claims backlog remains largely unchanged from 2008. The Committee understands the VBA thinks it will be able to process claims within 125 days by 2015 when the new VBMS system is fully operational. While the Committee supports VBA's use of technology to improve performance, as noted in House Report 112-491, the Committee is skeptical that the new VBMS procedures will ensure timely processing of the backlog by 2015. Therefore, the Committee expects the VBA to report to the Committee on the progress made to eliminate the backlog, at each regional office, 90 days, 180 days, and one year after VBMS is operational at each regional office, to ensure that the Committee can track the progress made on the backlog. Thank you for your commitment to resolving the claims backlog at the Veterans Benefits Administration and specifically, the Oakland Regional Office.

06.05.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA-5) and Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE-1) today introduced H.R. 2260, The Crop Insurance Accountability Act of 2013. The bipartisan legislation enhances conservation by incentivizing responsible farming practices. Under this legislation, in order for farmers to qualify for taxpayer subsidies of crop insurance, they must meet basic conservation requirements that minimize the impact to some of our most sensitive areas such as highly erodible lands and wetlands.“It's important that American farmers have a strong and reliable safety net, and that's why American taxpayers invest heavily in crop insurance,” said Thompson. “But it's also important that farmers take steps to protect and conserve our wetlands and highly erodible lands for the benefit of everyone. By relinking crop insurance subsidy assistance to basic conservation compliance measures, we can continue providing that important safety net while also protecting some of our most sensitive areas.” “Our farmers and ranchers are the first stewards of the land. This bill continues the practice of conservation planning for our most fragile lands to ensure we meet important environmental stewardship goals,” said Fortenberry. “This concept is widely upheld as an important conservation initiative by many in the ag and environmental communities. I look forward to its passage or inclusion in this year's Farm Bill.” The bipartisan Crop Insurance Accountability Act of 2013 would: - Apply to annually-tilled crops grown on highly erodible lands (HEL) or any crops in wetlands, as determined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); - Require farmers in these areas to file a conservation plan with USDA that states how they will reduce and offset impacts in these areas; - Require farmers to be in compliance according to their USDA-approved conservation plan in order to receive federal subsidies for their crop insurance premiums; - Delay the date for producers to come into compliance who are subject to conservation compliance for the first time for five years; - Allow for all appeal processes to be exhausted before farmers are found to be out of compliance; and - Provide exemptions for circumstances beyond the farmers control and actions taken in good faith. Currently, crop insurance for farmers is subsidized by an average of 62 percent. The Crop Insurance Accountability Act would require farmers to meet a certain conservation compliance standard to continue qualifying for subsidized crop insurance. If a farmer chooses not to participate in conservation compliance or is found to be out of compliance, they may still purchase crop insurance but would be responsible for 100 percent of the insurance premium. Since the 1985 Farm Bill, conservation compliance has been required for participation in many farm bill programs. The 1996 Farm Bill disconnected conservation compliance from crop insurance premium subsidies and instead tied it to the direct payments, or fixed payments, farmers receive every year based on their lands production history. The proposed 2013 Farm Bill (H.R. 1947) has essentially eliminated direct payments, and in doing so has also ended conservation compliance requirements for many of those crops and lands. The Crop Insurance Accountability Act re-links conservation compliance measures to crop insurance premium subsidies. "It is no secret that much of agriculture fought the conservation compliance linkage requirement during last year's debate on the farm bill,” said Bob Stallman, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation. “But our desire to avoid a time-consuming and contentious debate with our long-standing partners on workable environmental stewardship programs helped build a consensus around rational provisions that protect farmers while furthering the conservation of natural resources.” “The Crop Insurance Accountability Act closes a dangerous loophole which threatens soil and water quality as well as habitat for fish and wildlife. By linking key soil and wetlands protections to federal crop insurance premium subsidies, this bill will help to ensure that in exchange for receiving taxpayer-funded subsidies, farmers help to protect wetlands and reduce soil erosion on their land,” said Larry Schweiger, president and CEO of the National Wildlife Federation. “Farmers and ranchers deserve a safety net against severe weather and natural disasters,” said Ducks Unlimited CEO Dale Hall. “But it's just as crucial to make sure that crop insurance isn't an incentive to destroy wetlands and grasslands that protect drinking water, mitigate the impacts of floods and provide habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife. The Crop Insurance Accountability Act ensures the continuation of these basic conservation measures. Congressmen Fortenberry and Thompson are trying to protect our nation's wetlands and highly erodible lands with this bill. Ducks Unlimited stands among the many conservation, agriculture and taxpayer protection organizations who appreciate their leadership.” H.R. 2260 has been referred to the House Committee on Agriculture.Conservation compliance provisions are supported by: Conservation compliance provisions are supported by: American Association of Crop Insurers, American Farm Bureau Federation, American Farmland Trust, American Society of Agronomy, American Soybean Association, Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, Audubon, Bull Moose Sportsmen's Alliance, Crop Insurance and Reinsurance Bureau, Crop Science Society of America, Defenders of Wildlife, Ducks Unlimited, Environmental Defense Fund, Environmental Working Group, Izaak Walton League of America, Land Improvement Contractors of America, League of Conservation Voters, National Audubon Society, National Association of State Conservation Agencies, National Association of Conservation Districts, National Association of Resource Conservation and Development Councils, National Conservation District Employees Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National Farmers Union, National Wildlife Federation, Pheasants Forever, Pollinator Partnership, Quail Forever, Soil and Water Conservation Society, Soil Science Society of America, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, The Nature Conservancy, Wildlife Mississippi, World Wildlife Fund, R Street Institute, Cost of Government Center, American Commitment, Americans for Tax Reform, Less Government, Center for Individual Freedom, National Taxpayers Union Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

06.04.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced a $521,500 Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Port Security Grant for the Mare Island Ship Yard (MISY). The funds will be used for emergency response equipment. “This funding positions the Mare Island Ship Yard as the go-to emergency responder for marine vessels in the San Francisco Bay Area,” said Thompson. “The new equipment will improve response time, help our first responders save lives and enhance the overall safety of the San Francisco Bay region.” “Mare Island Ship Yard is greatly honored to work with our partners Congressman Mike Thompson, FEMA, Marine Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region and Lennar Corporation in being able to provide greater benefit to the marine community and the region,” said Tom Wilson, Ship Yard Superintendent. The equipment being purchased - transportable lighting plants and man lifts - will provide MISY with the capacity to rapidly respond to emergencies on board vessels in the San Francisco Bay Region. The mobile capability of the equipment will allow MISY to respond to emergencies both at the ship yard and throughout the San Francisco Bay area. This grant is the result of collaborative efforts of the MISY, Congressman Mike Thompson, FEMA, Marine Exchange of the San Francisco Bay Region and Lennar Mare Island Corporation. As the only ship yard in the San Francisco Bay Region to be awarded this type of grant, Mare Island Ship Yard, LLC is now positioned as the first responder for emergencies on board vessels in the San Francisco Bay region.

05.30.2013	Today, several Members of Congress from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta region spoke out against the current Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) and the lack of input afforded their constituents at a press conference in Sacramento. The current BDCP proposed by Governor Brown, the U.S. Department of Interior and south of the Delta interests would devastate the Delta region and ignores the concerns repeatedly raised by stakeholders in the Bay-Delta region. Recently, the State of California released a 20,000 page long Administrative Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact Statement (EIR/EIS) for the BDCP. Chapters 1-7 of the plan were released in the last few months and Chapters 8-12, which include the financing mechanism, were released yesterday. “The proposed BDCP is not a workable solution. It puts the interests of South-of-Delta water contractors ahead of the Delta's and North-of-Delta's farmers, fishers and small business owners. Livelihoods are at stake. Until we have a plan that is transparent, based on sound science and developed with all stake-holders at the table, then any process that moves us closer to building these tunnels will recklessly risk billions of California tax dollars and thousands of jobs. Let's take the time to get this right.” - Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) “The State of California, in partnership with the federal government, is on the verge of recommending a plan for California's water future that does nothing to solve California's water problems and is a disaster for northern California. For more than six years the BDCP has ploughed its way ahead led by a very small group of individuals, none of whom represent northern California. Our constituents and stakeholders in the Bay-Delta region have been shut out of the process. To find a long-term solution all of the stakeholders, not just the beneficiaries of the project, must have a seat at the decision-making table. We can and we must do better for California. Unfortunately, the current BDCP falls far short.” - Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-6) "The Governor recently released additional information on his deeply-flawed plan for the Delta region, which further proves he is intent on forcing this plan forward without any regard for the farmers, families and small business owners who rely upon a healthy Delta for their livelihoods, or for the incredible environmental damage that will result. As it stands, the plan will cost billions of dollars, devastate the most valuable water resource we have in California, and ultimately create no new water. There is a better way forward, and it must include the input of the people who stand to lose the most if the Delta is destroyed." - Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-9) “Governor Brown and his administration officials have failed to demonstrate that they are taking into account the real physical and financial harm that can come to Bay-Delta communities if a BDCP plan is pushed through without the proper cost benefit analysis of alternatives, an adequate finance plan, or without acknowledging the best available scienceâ€”science that has pointed to the real possibility that this plan could overtax our water resources and devastate the Bay-Delta region. Without doing so the BDCP is further than ever from a sustainable policy. It is time to seriously reevaluate this plan to ensure it fulfills the co-equal goals that it is mandated to adhere to, and takes into consideration the concerns of the businesses, families and communities that rely on a viable, healthy Bay-Delta region for their livelihoods.” - Rep. George Miller (CA-11) “The California water system is under enormous stress from a growing population and climate change. The proposed peripheral tunnel plan fails to deliver a real solution for this fundamental problem. Without adding a single drop of new water to the state's supply, the tunnels would deliver massive amounts of water from Northern to Southern California, destroying the Sacramento Delta in the process. Instead of wreaking havoc on the Delta region with a massive, expensive plumbing system, we need a cost-effective, comprehensive water plan. I have outlined a strategy that would add to our water supply through conservation, recycling, storage, and improvements to our levees while respecting water rights and using the best science. It's time for a midstream correction to the BDCP: let's bring everyone to the table and develop a plan that meets the needs of all Californians.” - Rep. John Garamendi (CA-3) “All of us here understand that water is critical in our state and that there needs to be a bay delta solution that does not put south-of-delta water contractors ahead of everyone in or north-of-delta. It's vital for our health, our environment, and our wallets that we have a comprehensive, long-term plan for securing water access and storage that's based on sound science. The livelihoods of our local farmers, anglers, and small business owners are at stake, and the potential risk to jobs and billions of California tax dollars is too big to ignore. Continuing with this plan, without getting input from all stakeholders, and without considering other alternatives is a bad idea for Sacramento County families.” - Rep. Ami Bera (CA-7)# # #
05.29.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today that his office is accepting applications from those ages 17-23 who are interested in attending the four service academies requiring nominations: United States Air Force Academy, United States Merchant Marine Academy, United States Military Academy at West Point, and the United States Naval Academy. The fifth service academy, the Coast Guard Academy, does not require a nomination.“It's an honor and privilege to annually nominate exceptional candidates across our Districts to these four service academies,” said Thompson. “If offered appointments by the academies, these young men and women will receive both a world class education and the skills they will need to become tomorrow's military leaders.” Eligible candidates must be at least 17 years old, but younger than 23, in the year of their admission to the academy, a United States citizen, unmarried, and a resident of California's 5th Congressional District. Interested applicants should contact Thompson's Santa Rosa District Office at CA05ServiceAcademy@mail.house.gov or 707-542-7182 for an application packet and further info.

05.24.2013	Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Ted Poe (TX-02) announced they introduced H.R. 2133, the Veterans Back to Work Act of 2013. This legislation would make the veterans' tax credit permanent and make it easier for employers to take advantage of it. “No veteran who has fought for our county overseas should have to fight for a job when they get home,” said Thompson. “Our veterans are some of the most skilled workers our country has to offer. Some are trained medics or mechanics. Some have led platoons. Others have experience with state-of-the-art technologies. All of them are assets to businesses. With one-in-five veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan looking for employment, we have a responsibility pass bill like the Veterans Back to Work Act to help get them hired. ” “It's a national tragedy to have a high unemployment rate for our nation's warriors,” said Poe. “After fighting in war, the last thing a veteran should have to worry about is an unemployment line. This Veterans Back to Work Act incentivizes the hiring of our veterans with a permanent tax credit and makes the paperwork easier for businesses to do so.” The unemployment rate for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was 9.9% last year. For female veterans, it was 12.5 percent, and for male veterans ages 18-24, it jumped to 20 percent. Over the past six years, Congress has passed temporary extensions of the veterans' tax credit to help transition our nation's warriors back into the workforce. While well intentioned, this tax relief was always temporary, required complicated paperwork and took too long for employers to actually take advantage of the tax credit and put veterans back to work. The Veterans Back to Work Act of 2013 seeks to fix these complications by making the tax credit permanent, reducing the paperwork, and allowing employers to have the choice to collect the credit at the end of each quarter or at the end of the year, whatever makes the most sense for them. HR 2133 has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means, of which Thompson is a senior member.

05.23.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Pete King (R-NY) today announced that a broad coalition of nine law enforcement organizations have endorsed H.R. 1565, the King-Thompson bipartisan compromise to expand the current background check system to all commercial firearm sales. “Our law enforcement officials know firsthand the dangers of criminals, terrorist and the dangerously mentally ill getting guns, and they understand background checks are the first line of defense against firearms falling into the wrong hands. We will not give up on a bill that makes our law enforcement officials' jobs easier and our streets safer. It should be passed and signed into law,” said Thompson and King. The nine law enforcement organizations endorsing the legislation are the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA), the Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association (HAPCOA), the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA), the International Association of Police Chiefs (IACP), the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCC), the National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives (NAWLEE), the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), and the Police Foundation (PF). Collectively, the nine organizations make up the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence. In a letter to Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, chair of the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence, and Baltimore County Chief Jim Johnson wrote, “[b]ackground checks for firearm purchasers are highly effective in keeping guns from those too dangerous to possess themâ€¦We urge you to support this important legislation, and if you have not done so already, we ask that you add your name as a cosponsor to this bill that we in law enforcement know will save lives.” The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). More than 175 House members have cosponsored the bill. The legislation helps prevent guns from falling into criminal hands and reinforces the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. By closing these loopholes, the legislation greatly reduces the number of places that criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can buy guns. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a table or out of someone's trunk at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because no background check is required for these kinds of sales. Last year, the background check system identified and denied more than 88,000 sales to criminals, domestic abusers, those with serious mental illnesses, and other prohibited purchasers. However, those same prohibited purchasers could buy those guns at a gun show or over the Internet without any questions asked. More than 40 percent of gun sales are conducted without a background check. The King-Thompson bill helps fix this by expanding the current background check system to close these loopholes. Under the bill, background checks will continue to be conducted though a licensed dealer in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. The legislation also strengthens the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners by banning the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers and allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state they are stationed. It lets gun owners use a state concealed carry permit issued within the last five years in lieu of a background check and permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. The bill also improves the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will also reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. A full copy of the letter to lawmakers is below. May 22, 2013 Dear Members of Congress: I write to convey the strong support of the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence (the Partnership) for H.R. 1565, the “Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act.” The Partnership is an alliance of the nation's law enforcement leadership organizations concerned about the unacceptable level of gun violence in the United States. Our members include the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA); Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association (HAPCOA); International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators (IACLEA); International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP); Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCC); National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives (NAWLEE); National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE); Police Executive Research Forum (PERF); and the Police Foundation (PF). We commend Representatives Peter King and Mike Thompson for introducing this legislation that will take two important steps forward in strengthening and expanding the existing background check system. First, extending the federal background check requirement to gun shows, to online advertisements, postings, displays and other listings, and to publications will block prohibited purchasers from acquiring firearms through these additional channels. Second, encouraging states to report all of their disqualifying records to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) will improve checks by ensuring that all prohibited purchasers are in the background check system. Ideally, the legislation would require background checks for all gun sales, closing more avenues for criminals and the dangerously mentally ill seeking to acquire guns. However, this extension of background checks to all firearm sales at gun shows, and to postings online and in publications is an important step forward. Background checks for firearm purchasers are highly effective in keeping guns from those too dangerous to possess them. According to the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, since the Brady Law took effect in 1994, background checks blocked more than 2 million prohibited purchases from acquiring guns through federally licensed firearm dealers. We urge you to support this important public safety measure, and if you have not done so already, we ask that you add your name as a cosponsor to this bill that we in law enforcement know will save lives.

05.23.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today voted against H.R. 1911, the House Majority's Making College More Expensive Act, which would make college more expensive for students and families by forcing them into loans with interest rates that fluctuate year by year. This would further compound the student debt crisis. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the bill would charge millions of students and families $3.7 billion over the next decade in additional interest payments relative to current law. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, the House Majority's bill is even worse for students and families than allowing interest rates to double on July 1st as currently scheduled. Under H.R. 1911, students who borrow the maximum amount of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans over five years would pay nearly $2,000 more in interest costs than if interest rates doubled.“Our students and families deserve better than a bill that makes many students pay higher interest payments than they would if Congress did nothing and interest rates doubled,” said Thompson. “Total student debt currently stands at $1.1 trillion, greater than credit card debt. This bill would increase that debt. Instead we should pass the bill that I co-authored which would prevent student loan interest rates from doubling on July 1st and would save hard working families millions of dollars.” Under the House Majority's bill, interest rates on loans would be reset every year. So, the interest rate on a loan taken out next year by a freshman may start off low, but she doesn't get to keep that interest rate for the life of the loan. It will change every year, potentially skyrocketing. The House Marjory's Leadership refused to allow the House to consider the Democratic bill co-sponsored by Thompson to block student loan rates from doubling on July 1st. This bill, H.R. 1433, the Student Loan Relief Act, continues to allow college students to benefit from historically low interest rates by freezing the current low 3.4 percent rate on subsidized Stafford loans for the next two years. “The one essential element to our nation's long-term economic success is education. We need to work together to keep college costs down,” said Thompson.

05.17.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced Benjamin Yu from Jesse M Bethel High School in Vallejo as the winner of the 2013 Congressional Art Competition. Benjamin's artwork, titled “Monotony” will represent California's 5th Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where it will be displayed starting June 4th for one year. Benjamin and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony in June. “Every year I am impressed by our student artists' talent and creativity,” said Thompson. “Many thanks to everyone who participated in this year's competition, and the parents, teachers and judges who make this annual event possible. Congratulations to Benjamin. I am honored to be able feature his artwork in the U.S. Capitol.” “He really has a gift for embracing discoveries in his work. Although, he's a perfectionist and spends a lot of his time pre-thinking what he is going to do, he does come across some experimental moments and he actually discovers in his work something new,” said Jesse M Bethel High School Art Teacher, Dr. Randall Goni. Benjamin is a senior in high school. This fall he will attend the Academy of Art University in San Francisco as a Fine Arts Major on a full scholarship. Benjamin was one of five regional winners chosen by local artist judges. The four other finalists were: - Contra Costa: Jessica Loyd from John Swett High School - Napa winner: Maia Rios from Vintage High School - Lake County winner: Micah McDaniel from Kelseyville High School - Sonoma County: Annika White from Cardinal Newman High School The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition. A photo of Benjamin's work can be seen here.

05.16.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5), Joe Heck (NV-3), and Mark Amodei (NV-02) today announced that they introduced H.R. 1823, the Protecting Lakes Against Quagga Act of 2013 which would add quagga mussels to the national list of invasive species. This listing gives federal agencies greater ability to prevent the spread of the invasive species. “These invasive species wreak havoc on boats, concentrate pollutants and litter shores with razor sharp shells,” said Thompson. “When these mussels clog pipes, they suppress our ability to deliver water, protect our communities against fires, and irrigate farms. This bill will help us prevent the spread of quaggas and save taxpayers millions in maintenance costs.” "Quagga mussels pose a constant threat to our local environment and economy. In Nevada, the Bureau of Reclamation at Hoover Dam alone spends $1 million annually on quagga mussel control”, said Heck. “This is a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation that will ease the burden on taxpayers in Nevada, protect Lake Mead from further being invaded by this species, and prevent other lakes across the country from being affected in the future.” “Halting the spread of the invasive quagga mussels is vital from practical and environmental perspectives,” said Amodei. “The quaggas do costly damage to our water infrastructure, which in the West is a serious matter, and they pose a threat to ecosystems, such as Lake Tahoe, which we work so hard to protect. If we wait for administrative action to declare the quaggas an invasive species, it may already be too late.” The most common way for quagga mussels to spread from lake to lake is by “hitchhiking” on recreational boats. Listing quagga mussels as an invasive species will give federal agencies more authority to check boats crossing state lines or entering federal land. While quagga mussels can only spread by “hitchhiking,” once they are established in a lake they multiply quickly and are extremely expensive and difficult to remove. Since their invasion in the 1980's, quagga mussels, and their close relative Zebra mussels, have cost more than $5 billion in prevention and control - more than any other aquatic species. While Zebra Mussels are on the invasive species list, quagga mussels are not. In the 5th Congressional district, Clear Lake, Lake Sonoma, and Lake Berryessa are all rated at the highest possible risk for quagga invasion. Currently none of these lakes has been invaded by quagga mussels. However, if quaggas invade one of these lakes, control and treatment would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year and impact the water supply for residents in Sonoma, Lake, and Solano Counties. If quagga mussels invade the state water infrastructure it could cost millions every year to keep the pipes clear. Administrative action to put quagga mussels on the invasive species list takes an average of 10 years. HR 1823 would do the same thing right now. HR 1823 has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

05.16.2013	Today, U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) voted for the 37th time against a partisan attempt to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This is the House Majority's 37th vote in the last 2 years to repeal the healthcare law and take away the patient protections it provides. The 37 votes have cost taxpayers more than $52 million. “This is a shameful waste of time and taxpayer dollars,” said Thompson. “Instead of spending more than $50 million to repeal a law that is saving lives and money, we should be working to improve our healthcare system and expand on the benefits the law provides. “It's time to put these political games aside. By building on the reforms made in the Affordable Care Act, we can make sure every American can afford to go to the doctor. And that's what matters.” Since the ACA was signed into law in 2010, more than 800,000 jobs have been created in the health care industry. The law has made investments to increase the number of health care providers and strengthen the primary care workforce. Specifically, it makes investments to help alleviate the current shortage of primary health care providers, including physicians, physician assistants, and nurses. According to the latest available estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the health care law is also expected to reduce the federal deficit by $109 billion over the next 10 years and over $1 trillion over the following decade. The law is also saving money for consumers and slowing health care spending. Since the ACA was enacted, the growth in overall health care spending and Medicare spending has decreased to record lows. As a result, Medicare and Medicaid will now spend $700 billion less over the 10-year period from 2011 through 2020 than previously projected. And, last summer nearly 13 million Americans benefited from $1.1 billion in consumer rebates provided by the ACA. Insurers were required to provide rebates if they failed to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on health care.

05.15.2013	Today, U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Dave Reichert (R-WA) introduced the bipartisan Medicare Secondary Payer and Workers' Compensation Settlement Agreement Act, H.R. 1982 into the House of Representatives. The legislation aims to protect injured workers whose workers' compensation claims overlap with Medicare coverage. Far too often, these claims are subjected to lengthy and cumbersome reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine appropriate set-aside amounts to pay for future medical costs in which Medicare may have an interest. The delays associated with this review place unfair burdens upon the injured party. “The last thing injured workers should have to worry about is if needless bureaucracy is going to prevent their medical bills from being paid,” said Thompson. “This bill will make sure hard working families' medical claims are processed efficiently and quickly, it will reduce bureaucratic headaches for businesses, and it will save taxpayers money. I will continue working with Congressman Reichert to get this bipartisan bill signed into law.” “This is a common-sense measure to ensure that hard-working Americans are not left in limbo because of inefficient bureaucratic procedures,” said Reichert. “Injured workers must have the confidence that their heath care claims will be processed in a fair and timely manner. By introducing this bill, Rep. Thompson and I aim to do just that: protect our hard-working citizens by making sure our systems serve them and their families.” Background The Medicare Secondary Payer and Workers' Compensation Settlement Agreements Act establishes clear and consistent standards for an administrative process that provides reasonable protections for injured workers and Medicare. It would benefit injured workers, employers and insurers by creating a system of certainty, and allows the settlement process to move forward while eliminating millions of dollars in administrative costs that harm workers, employers and insurers. The legislation has widespread support from groups such as the American Insurance Association, the American Bar Association, the National Council of Self-Insurers, Property Casualty, Insurers Association of America, UWC-Strategic Services and the Workers Injury Law and Advocacy Group (WILG). Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and chairs the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.# # #
05.15.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that he has led a bipartisan letter with Reps. Mark Amodei (R-NV), Steven Pearce (R-NM), Joe Heck (R-NV), Jared Huffman (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA) and Juan Vargas (D-CA) calling on President Obama to protect local clean energy royalties from harmful budget cuts. The letter urges the President to not repeal the sharing of geothermal royalty payments with counties. Because of the high burdens that geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, counties currently share in the revenue of the federal receipts. Revenue sharing was targeted for cuts in the President's FY 2014 budget. “Geothermal development comes at a cost so if a community invests in developing geothermal energy they deserve to get their fair share in returns,” said Thompson. “Repealing geothermal royalty payments to counties is a short sighted, fiscally irresponsible plan that will have no meaningful impact on deficit reduction. It will strip away funds that our counties use to pay for public safety, road maintenance and law enforcement.” Revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Ending this sharing would negatively impact counties while having no meaningful deficit reduction impact. Over a ten year period, revenue sharing accounts for less than one tenth of one percent of the federal debt. Currently, counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Last year, Lake County received more than $760,000 a year in geothermal royalties. Last year, Sonoma County received $1 million in geothermal royalties. The full text of the letter is below. May 9, 2013 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama, We are writing to express our disappointment that your Fiscal Year 2014 Budget proposal repealed the sharing of geothermal royalty payments to counties. We understand the need to propose a fiscally prudent budget, but repealing geothermal royalty payments to counties is a short sighted method that does nearly nothing to solve our fiscal problems. In the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where geothermal development is located, these counties should share in the revenue of the federal receipts. In turn, counties have used these revenues to pay for critical governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. This revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners, and ultimately champions, in the continued development of geothermal energyâ€”a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. Ending the geothermal revenue sharing plan would have a significant negative impact on our districts, while the overall effect on our nation's fiscal well-being would be minisculeâ€”$4 million in 2014 and $48 million over 10 years. Many of the counties that receive revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural communities facing precarious budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. We strongly support geothermal revenue sharing with counties and we encourage you to reconsider its repeal in future budget and deficit reduction proposals. We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to working with you to promote geothermal energy production and provide support for the surrounding communities.

05.08.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today led more than 100 of his colleagues in sending a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi urging that Fiscal Year 2014 appropriations bills not include legislative language, or “riders”, that would block efforts to reduce and prevent gun violence. “These riders aid criminals and make our communities less safe,” said Thompson. “They are nothing more than backdoor legislative tactics that prevent the Centers for Disease Control or the National Institutes of Health from conducting research on the causes of gun violence. And, they restrict our law enforcement officers' ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. The American people deserve an open debate." In previous appropriations bills, gun-related riders have been added without open debate and have acted as roadblocks to reducing and preventing gun violence. These riders have prevented law enforcement from requiring federally licensed firearm dealers from keeping an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of criminal gun transfers, and stifled scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. Thompson's task force recommended that Congress should act to repeal these riders and restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence. The task force urged Congress to fund law enforcement's efforts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into the causes of gun violence. In policy principle number nine found here the task force recommended that Congress remove the Dickey, Rehberg and Tiahrt restrictions. The full text of the letter is below. May 7, 2013 The Honorable John Boehner Speaker of the House U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Minority Leader U.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: As the House Committee on Appropriations develops each of the twelve fiscal year (FY) 2014 appropriations bills, we urge that you ensure the committee's legislation not include any legislative language or “riders” that impact the enforcement of gun laws, the operations of Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL), or research into the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. Gun violence reduction and prevention is an important and sensitive issue. Given the renewed national focus on gun violence prevention, now is not the time to include controversial appropriations riders that impact gun laws. Instead, gun violence prevention measures must be seriously and properly considered by Congress through the regular order. This must be done in an open and transparent process where a full range of options can be frankly discussed and debated by the proper committees of jurisdiction and the entire House of Representatives. We believe that the appropriations process, which determines funding levels for the federal government, is not the appropriate way to modify or implement gun laws. In addition to bypassing the proper congressional process, these riders have had unintended consequences that would have come to light had they been properly discussed. As you know, previous appropriations riders have acted as a roadblock to reducing and preventing gun violence. The Tiahrt and Rehberg amendments, among others, have prevented law enforcement from requiring FFLs to keep an inventory of their firearms, prevented law enforcement and academic institutions from using gun trace data to better understand the pattern of crime gun transfers, and chilled unbiased scientific research into the causes of gun violence and the means of preventing it. As the FY 2014 appropriations process begins through its respective subcommittees, we urge you to support the development of legislation that is free from all gun related riders. Thank you for your consideration of this matter.

05.07.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Pete King (R-NY) today released the following statement on the growing momentum in support of the H.R. 1565, the King-Thompson bipartisan compromise to expand the current background check system to all commercial sales. The bill currently has more than 150 co-sponsors. Joining them are original co-authors Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR). “The support we have received for this commonsense legislation that will strengthen the Second Amendment rights of lawful Americans, and keep guns from criminals, terrorist and the dangerously mentally ill has been overwhelming. We're more than half-way home, but we still have a lot of work to do. We're not giving up. The American people deserve for this bill to be signed into law,” said Thompson and King. The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). The legislation helps prevent guns from falling into criminal hands and reinforces the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners. It expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. By closing these loopholes, the legislation greatly reduces the number of places that criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can buy guns. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a table or out of someone's trunk at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because no background check is required for these kinds of sales. Under the bill, background checks will continue to be conducted though a licensed dealer in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. The legislation also strengthens the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners by banning the government from creating a federal registry and makes the misuse of records a felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It provides reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers and allows active military personnel to buy guns in the state they are stationed. It lets gun owners use a state concealed carry permit issued within the last five years in lieu of a background check and permits interstate handgun sales from licensed dealers. The bill also improves the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. The bill will also reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. ###

04.24.2013	U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA), Ted Poe (R-TX), Peter Welch (D-VT) and Chris Gibson (R-NY) today introduced bipartisan legislation in support of an “all of the above” energy approach. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act will modify the federal tax code to make it easier and more attractive for private capital to invest in renewable energy. “We need an all-the-above approach to America's energy future,” said Thompson. “This bill levels the playing field by freeing up money for private investment in renewable energy. It will help us create jobs, strengthen our national security, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and move closer to energy independence.” “It is time for the United States to make Middle Eastern turmoil irrelevant to our energy security,” said Poe. “In order to do this we must pursue a comprehensive energy strategy that empowers all sources of domestically produced energy. This common-sense bill will do just that. It's time for Washington to make it easier not harder to produce energy in this country” “Expanding MLP financing to renewable energy projects will be a boost for the renewable industry and for a cleaner energy future. If oil, gas, and coal projects can take advantage of this important tool, there is no reason why renewable projects should be excluded. This is a simple, common sense idea that will drive investment in renewable energy projects for years to come,” Welch said. “This is an important initiative that I'm proud to join with my colleagues to support. This free market approach encourages investment in renewable energy without picking winners and losers, a key to growing our domestic energy supply. By promoting solutions like this legislation, it is my hope that we can drive down energy costs for hardworking families, small businesses and farmers in my district and across our country,” said Gibson. A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business that is taxed as a partnership but whose shares are traded like stock on a market. Because MLPs have access to capital at a lower cost and a more liquid financing, this makes them very attractive to private investment. Currently, only oil, natural gas, coal extraction, and pipeline projects are allowed to qualify for MLPs. This bill would simply amend the federal tax code to allow investment in renewable energy projects in the same way. Companion legislation, S. 3275, has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK). This legislation is endorsed by Third Way, American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Biomass Power Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Advanced Biofuels Association, Offshore Wind Development Coalition, Advanced Ethanol Council and Environmental Entrepreneurs.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.19.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) announced today that he has introduced H.R. 1433, the Student Loan Relief Act. The legislation will ensure that interest rates on subsidized Stafford student loans for undergraduate students do not dramatically increase on July 1st of this year. Without congressional action, rates are set to double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent. “The one essential element to our nation's long-term economic success is education,” said Thompson. “If our nation is going to continue producing the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators, then a college education must be an affordable option for working families. This bill is one important step of many that Congress must take to lower to cost of high-education.” In 2007, Thompson voted to pass the College Cost Reduction and Access Act which made historic investments in student aid. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act lowered need-based subsidized Stafford student loan rates from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent over a four-year period, easing the burden on thousands of students and their families. With the lower rate set to expire last year, Thompson helped lead the effort in the 112th Congress to ensure a one-year continuation of the current interest rate. Congress passed legislation extending the lower interest rate though July 1st, 2013. Now, without congressional action, interest rates on subsidized Stafford student loans for undergraduate students will double from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on July 1st of this year. The bill co-authored by Thompson would extend the 3.4 percent rate for two years to July 1st, 2015, making student loans more affordable for low- and middle-income students. If Congress doesn't act, more than 7 million students will incur an additional $6.3 billion in repayment costs for the academic school year. That means college next year, and every additional year Congress doesn't act, gets $1,000 more expensive for each student borrower.

04.18.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-05) and Chris Gibson (NY-19) announced today that they have joined together to introduce H.R. 1465, The Storage Technology for Renewable and Green Energy 2012 Act (STORAGE) in the United States House of Representatives. The STORAGE Act would provide a tax credit to individuals and businesses when they invest in energy storage systems. Energy storage systems allow businesses and consumers to store excess generated energy then use that energy during periods of peak demand. This helps reduce consumers' electricity bills, greatly enhances the reliability of alternative energy sources, and makes our electric grid more efficient and secure. “When it comes to addressing American's energy challenges, we need an all the above approach,” said Thompson. “The wind doesn't blow 24 hours a day and the sun doesn't shine 24 hours a day. By providing these tax credits we can incentivize investments in storage systems that collect and save energy for use during peak times. This will save folks money and make our power grid more secure.” Businesses and individuals would both be eligible for tax credits under the STORAGE Act. Businesses and factories that generate energy via large compressed air systems, flywheels, and large arrays of fuels cells and batteries would be eligible for a 30 percent tax credit. Households and businesses that purchase energy storage systems for their property would also be eligible for a 30 percent tax credit. The tax credits would also help improve our alternative energy infrastructure. The current alternative energy electricity infrastructure is highly inefficient. Right now, alternative energy sources are often shut down if the energy cannot be used immediately. Energy storage systems can help fix this problem by storing energy temporarily and delivering it when it is needed. Energy storage systems also help cope with peak demand. By allowing consumers to store energy, rather than draw on the system during peak demand time, it can reduce the number of power plants that are needed.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.17.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, issued the following statement on the Senate vote against the Manchin-Toomey expanded background checks amendment. “I'm disappointed with the Senate for going against the will of nearly 90 percent of the American people and voting down this anti-crime, pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment bipartisan compromise. Voting “no” on this amendment is a vote to allow criminals and the dangerously mentally ill easy access to guns and a vote against lawful gun-owners and the Second Amendment. You can't hold the position that criminals or the dangerously mentally ill shouldn't have firearms and be against background checks - that's incongruent. Background checks are the first line of defense. “The only thing more disappointing to the American people than the Senate voting this amendment down would be for the House to not vote on it at all. Pete King and I introduced bipartisan legislation to expand background checks in the House and the American people deserve a vote on it.” The bipartisan King-Thompson legislation introduced this week is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). The bill is co-authored by U.S. Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR). This bipartisan legislation is anti-criminal and pro-lawful gun owner. It will expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. By closing these loopholes it greatly reduces the number of places that criminals and the dangerously mentally ill can buy guns. Right now, a criminal can buy a firearm at a table or out of someone's trunk at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad because no background check is required for these kinds of sales. Last year, the background check system identified and denied nearly 90,000 sales to criminals, domestic abusers, those with serious mental illnesses, and other prohibited purchasers. However, there is no way of knowing if those near 90,000 prohibited purchasers bought a gun at a gun show or over the internet after being denied at a federally licensed dealer. The King-Thompson bill helps fix this by expanding the current background check system to close these loopholes. The legislation also supports the Second Amendment rights of lawful gun owners. It provides reasonable exceptions to the background check requirement for firearm transfers between family, friends and hunting buddies. It explicitly bans the federal government from creating a registry and makes the misuse of records to create a registry a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison. It allows active military to buy firearms in their home states and the state in which they are stationed. And it allows gun owners to purchase firearms with a state concealed carry permit issued within the last five years in lieu of a background check because background checks are required to receive conceal carry permits.

04.16.2013	U.S. Reps. Pete King (R-NY) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) last night introduced H.R. 1565, the U.S. House of Representatives' version of the Manchin-Toomey Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2013. U.S. Reps. Mike Fitzpatrick (R-PA), Pat Meehan (R-PA), Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY) and Peter Defazio (D-OR) joined King and Thompson in co-authoring the legislation. The King-Thompson legislation is identical to the bipartisan agreement on background checks struck by Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). “Background checks are the first line of defense against criminals and the dangerously mentally ill getting guns. This bill is comprehensive, it is enforceable, it will save lives, and it will protect the rights of law abiding Americans to own guns. It's time for Congress to act. The American people are getting a vote in the Senate. They deserve one in the House,” said Thompson and King in a joint statement This bipartisan legislation will expand the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet or in classified ads. It provides reasonable exceptions for family and friend transfers. Under the legislation, background checks would be conducted though a federally licensed dealer. Licensed dealers will run background checks on potential buyers and keep records of sales in the same manner as they have for more than 40 years. Failure to conduct a background check on is punishable by up to five years in prison. The bill also improves the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve their reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill by eliminating unnecessary responsibilities for states and directing future grant money towards creating systems to send records to NICS. The bill will also reduce federal funds to states that do not comply. Like the Manchin-Toomey legislation, the King-Thompson bill explicitly bans the federal government from creating a registry and makes the misuse of records to create a registry a felony punishable by 15 years in prison. H.R. 1565 is backed by a number of organizations including the pro gun group, the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, the second-largest gun rights organization in the country. It has also been endorsed by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.

That's why the American people, gun owners, NRA members, and even many House Republicans support background checks. “The bipartisan background check legislation that I will introduce and will be voted on in the Senate is enforceable, will save lives, and respects the Second Amendment rights of law abiding Americans.

04.10.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee On Intelligence today introduced and passed several privacy related provisions to H.R. 624, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA) during today's committee proceedings on the bill. CISPA allows for information sharing about cyber threats between the intelligence community and businesses. The intelligence community would keep businesses aware of potential cyber attacks that threaten national security and the economy. Businesses would keep the intelligence community informed when cyber attacks on their systems occur. Thompson provisions address privacy concerns with the legislation. “There is no reason we can't protect our country and economy against a crippling cyber security threat and protect the constitutional privacy rights of Americans,” said Thompson. “The provisions I offered to this bill will provide additional oversight to the sharing of cyber threat information, makes sure that sensitive personal information is not exchanged, and that individual privacy rights are protected.” Thompson's first amendment would expand oversight of the information sharing by providing the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, each agency's privacy officer and Congress with additional oversight authority. The amendment also requires a new report by the privacy officials of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Department of Justice (DoJ), in consultation with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB), the Office of Intelligence Community Inspector General, and individual agency's privacy officials. These reports are to be prepared in both a classified and unclassified form to guarantee CISPA's transparency and accountability moving forward. The second provision authored by Thompson amends a committee amendment that deals with limiting the amount and kinds of information that can be shared by businesses with the intelligence community. The provision requires the head of each federal agency receiving cyber threat information to notify the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the Attorney General, and the congressional intelligence committees of any significant violations of information sharing. It requires the DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Secretary of Defense to oversee compliance with the bill's established limits on information sharing. CISPA does not require anyone to provide anything to the government. All sharing of cyber threat information would be voluntary, it forbids the government from retaining information shared that is not cyber threat information, and it restricts the government to use cyber threat information for national security purposes.

04.10.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today released the following statement on the exclusion of the Napa Flood Project in President Obama's budget. “This is disappointing. Our economy is still recovering and we're supposed to be doing everything we can to put people back to work. There is no better way to create jobs than through infrastructure investments like the Napa Flood Project. The flood project creates and supports thousands of jobs for those in construction and those employed by the businesses that have been able to open because of the project. “We shouldn't drop the ball after we've come so far. I will do will do everything I can to make sure we finish the Napa Flood Project.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.05.2013	Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced more than $3.9 million to improve Lakeport's drinking water system. $3,182,000 will be provided to Lakeport though a loan to be repaid over 40 years at a low interest rate of 1.875 percent. $750,000 will be provided to Lakeport through a grant. The money will be provided through the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Office of Rural Development.“This money will create jobs and save tax payer money by improving Lakeport's water infrastructure,” said Thompson. “These are the kinds of smart investments we need to make to get our economy back on track and support our rural communities. I am proud to have worked to help get these funds for Lakeport.” The money will be used to make improvements to the water system, including the installation of approximately 2,300 new water meters, a new supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) control system, and the purchase of land to secure the City of Lakeport's wells.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

04.02.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force today released the following statement on the National Rifle Association's (NRA) National School Shield Program. “School safety is an important component of any comprehensive plan to reduce and prevent gun violence. That's why my task force recommended that Congress take steps to enhance school safety nearly two months ago. We should do everything we can to keep our kids safe, and that includes having school resource officers in those schools that want them, and urging our communities to develop safety plans in case of emergencies. However, arming school personnel and training them for shootouts will only exacerbate problems. “While school safety must be part of any comprehensive gun violence prevention plan, it cannot be the only part. We need to invest in mental health and other preventive efforts. We need to enforce the laws that are on the books by cracking down on gun trafficking and straw purchasing. And, we need to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill by making sure everyone purchasing a gun gets a background check. “Passing legislation that enhances school safety is not an acceptable alternative to passing other gun violence prevention measures such as background checks. Congress can and should do both.” Thompson's task force recommended in early February that Congress help all schools implement evidence-based strategies that support safe learning environments tailored to the unique needs of students and local communities. The task force also recommended that Congress work with schools to develop emergency response plans. A full report of the policy principles released by the task force can be seen here. Thompson, who chairs the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, is a hunter, gun owner, and wounded veteran who carried an assault weapon in Vietnam. He is a supporter of the Second Amendment and believes that Congress can take meaningful steps to reduce and prevent gun violence while also protecting the constitutional rights of law abiding Americans.

03.14.2013	Today, several U.S. Representatives from northern California spoke out in opposition to the release of the first four chapters of the Governor's proposal for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. The Governor's flawed plan would devastate the region and has met strong opposition from the area's Congressional delegation. “Once again, the Governor is attempting to rush forward with his deeply flawed plan to build tunnels that will send our water south and devastate the families, farmers and small business owners who rely on a healthy Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta for their livelihoods. I have heard time and again from real people in our region who stand to have their farmland flooded or see their small business fail if the Governor's plan is put in place. These people deserve to have their interests represented in any plan related to the Delta, and I will continue to call on the Governor and the Obama Administration to give them - and all of the people in our region - a voice in the process. To move forward with today's release of a portion of the draft plan without examining all possible options and listening to all affected parties is foolhardy, and will cost California taxpayers billions of dollars and cost countless jobs.” - Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-9) “A BDCP plan is moving forward before all the work has been done. Moving this project forward before the science is examined puts the interests of south-of-Delta water contractors before our farmers, fishers and small business owners who depend on the Delta for their livelihoods. Before we move forward with any one BDCP plan, we need to make sure that the process to create it is transparent, all necessary stakeholders are at the table, and is based on sound science. The current plan is none of these.” - Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-5) “The Governor's plan must adhere to the established co-equal goals of protecting the health of the Bay-Delta and improving water reliability. If his current proposal remains unchanged it may expose the Bay-Delta to a real risk of environmental and economic degradation. Draining more water from the region is not a sustainable policy and will jeopardize local fisheries, endangered species, and the livelihoods of thousands of farmers, fishermen, and business owners who all depend on a healthy ecosystem. It would be a mistake to embark on a large and expensive infrastructure project of far-reaching consequence without first giving serious consideration to a broader, portfolio-based alternative that would responsibly expand water reliability while protecting the environment and providing local agencies the financial flexibility to implement the water projects they need.” - Rep. George Miller (CA-11) “This draft Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) continues to ignore the very real concerns expressed by northern California stakeholders. To solve California's water issues, northern California must be part of the decision making process. Unfortunately, despite our requests to be part of the planning process we have continued to be shut out. Clearly, there are still many unaddressed issues, and they must be addressed before any BDCP moves forward. In addition to the massive infrastructure that will be housed in Sacramento County and the threat to northern California water rights, I remain seriously concerned about the governance plan proposed in the BDCP. This draft BDCP once again includes no benefits to Sacramento, only negative impacts.” - Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-6) “Today, the state releases the first few chapters of the peripheral tunnel plan. Unfortunately, state and federal officials have already written a conclusion to this story, and it's an end to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta as we know it,” said Congressman John Garamendi (CA-3). “However, this is not inevitable and I completely committed to changing the present plan. Instead of a plumbing system that costs at least $14 billion, we need a comprehensive water plan for all of California that is driven by the best science and incorporates conservation, recycling, the creation of new storage systems, levee improvements, habitat restoration, and honors existing water rights. The Bay Delta Conservation Plan should and can be a story of California communities pulling together to meet our common needs. As currently planned, it is not a solution for California's water future, it is a problem.” - Rep. John Garamendi (CA-3) “The giant peripheral tunnels or any alternative plan cannot come at the cost of devastating communities that depend on salmon. We saw from 2008-2010 that when salmon seasons were closed or minimal, small family businesses up and down the coast had to close their doors. We need a science-based plan for water distribution in the Central Valley that protects salmon runs.” - Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-14) “Today, the state of California released the first four chapters of a draft of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) without fully researching the plan's effects, without getting input from all stakeholders, without considering other options, and without knowing how they'll fund the project. That's a disservice to Sacramento County families. Water is a vital resource to our state, and it is critical for our health and well-being, for our environment, and for our wallets that we have a comprehensive, long-term plan, based on sound science.” - Rep. Ami Bera (CA-7) “I will be reviewing this week's Bay Delta Conservation Plan documents carefully since this plan has significant implications for my North Coast district. The proposal must clear a very high bar: the comprehensive 2009 water reform laws that we enacted in California require the state to use less water from the overtaxed Delta, and to place the restoration of that ecosystem at equal footing with a reliable water supply. This is California's opportunity to move away from unsustainable water uses and towards a healthy watershed and restored fisheries. Unfortunately, previous drafts of these documents did not meet these tests, and I hope that this Bay Delta Conservation Plan draft represents an improvement over previous efforts. We cannot provide decades-long regulatory permits for unsustainable water plans.” - Rep. Jared Huffman (CA-2)###
03.12.2013	Congressman Aaron Schock (R-IL) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) both of the Ways & Means Committee joined today to praise the inclusion of the Small Business Accounting and Tax Simplification Act in the House Ways and Means small business tax reform discussion draft. The Schock-Thompson legislation, H.R. 947, would allow small businesses with up to $10 million in gross receipts to be eligible for a more simplified accounting and tax filing method with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under current law, most businesses are required to use accrual accounting when filing their taxes with the IRS. For many small businesses, the alternative cash-basis method offers more flexibility in tax planning, since cash accounting is a simplified method that more accurately reflects the way a business collects income and claims expenses for business purposes. “With a bloated tax code, which stands at over 70,000 pages, small businesses are put at a disadvantage when it comes to dealing with the IRS,” said Schock. “By expanding the eligibility for small businesses to use cash accounting, we will provide them with a vital tool to save time and money, and allow these entrepreneurs to focus more on growing their business than complying with complex IRS regulations.” “No matter which side of the aisle you're on, we should all be able to agree that simplifying taxes for small businesses is good policy,” said Thompson. “That's what our bill is about. It will save small businesses time, paperwork and headaches during tax season by expanding cash accounting, allowing them to focus their efforts on what they do bestâ€”growing their businessâ€”not on complicated accounting practices.” “One key provision included in today's discussion draft is based on a provision championed by Congressmen Schock and Thompson that is aimed at simplifying and expanding the use of cash accounting for small businesses. Allowing businesses with $10 million or less in gross receipts to use cash accounting can simplify their tax compliance efforts so that they can use their time, energy and resources in a more effective way - toward growing their business. Aaron and Mike's commonsense proposal will ease the burden that too many face as they struggle with today's broken tax code and is a step toward the fairness and simplicity that small businesses need and want,” said Chairman Camp. According to the National Federation of Independent Business small businesses spend annually between 1.7 billion and 1.8 billion hours on tax compliance and $18 billion to $19 billion on compliance costs. The result is that 88 percent of small business owners hire a paid tax preparer to complete their returns. “This expansion of the availability of cash accounting for tax purposes will help simplify tax filing and reduce the paperwork burden for many small businesses,” said Dan Danner, President and CEO of the National Federation of Independent Business. “NFIB and its members would like to thank Congressmen Schock and Thompson for this common-sense approach to helping job creators operate as efficiently as possible during this time of economic recovery. It will certainly help make it easier for many small businesses to grow and create jobs.” As part of the Ways and Means committee's broader effort on comprehensive tax reform, Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) today released the small business tax reform discussion draft. Reforming the tax code for small business will be a significant part of any tax reform package. Eight out of ten businesses file their taxes as individuals, not as corporations and the pass-through model of small businesses (Sole proprietorships, S-corps, LLCs and Partnerships) has tripled from 10.9 to 30 million over the past 30 years. These pass-through businesses should be afforded flexible tax and accounting rules that reflect their needs for current cash flow to finance operations. “One key provision included in today's discussion draft is based on a provision championed by Congressmen Schock and Thompson that is aimed at simplifying and expanding the use of cash accounting for small businesses. Allowing businesses with $10 million or less in gross receipts to use cash accounting can simplify their tax compliance efforts so that they can use their time, energy and resources in a more effective way - toward growing their business. Aaron and Mike's commonsense proposal will ease the burden that too many face as they struggle with today's broken tax code and is a step toward the fairness and simplicity that small businesses need and want,” said Chairman Dave Camp. “Employers who pay their business taxes as individuals account for 54 percent of all private sector employment in the U.S. Our country's ability to put people back to work is proportional to how we treat small businesses under the tax code and how we provide employers with the flexibility they need to focus on building a business's versus dealing with a burdensome tax system. This discussion draft will allow the committee to continue its work toward creating a fairer tax system that doesn't penalize success and will help grow our economy at the same time,” added Schock. ###
03.11.2013	U.S. Rep Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force today released the following statement on the economic report recently released by the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation (CSF) documenting the importance of sportsmen's activities in America.“Hunting, fishing and sportsmen's activities are a cornerstone of our economy. In 2011, sportsmen and women spent a total of $90 billion, or more than was spent globally on iPads and iPhones combined. $3 billion of that went to conservation alone. “There are nearly 37.5 million hunters and anglers in the U.S. Their money supports rural towns, small businesses and conservation efforts. “An overwhelming majority of them also believe in the Second Amendment and support commonsense legislation to prevent gun violence. I'm one of them. As chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force I will work to make sure Congress respects the rights of law abiding Americans and acts to keep our communities safe.” A link to the full report can be found here.

03.11.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5) today announced the beginning of the 2013 Congressional Art Competition, and urged high school students in California's 5th Congressional District to enter their artwork. The annual competition showcases the artistic talents and abilities of students in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. The 2013 competition is open to all high school students in California's 5th District. “The Congressional Art Competition is an excellent opportunity for our community to support our student artists, and I encourage all eligible students to apply,” said Thompson. “Every year our office receives outstanding submissions from talented artists all across our district. I look forward to seeing all of this year's artwork.” Since 1982, the Congressional Art Competition has given Members of Congress the opportunity to encourage the artistic talents of their young constituents.

03.07.2013	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-5), John Garamendi (CA-3), Jared Huffman (CA-2), Anna Eshoo (CA-18) and Ami Bera (CA-7) today introduced H.R. 1025, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act of 2013. U.S. Senator Barbara (D-CA) introduced S.483 the companion bill in the Senate. The legislation would designate the 350,000 acre Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under this designation, all currently owned federal lands within the NCA boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed according to the site-specific needs. The region would also be permanently protected under a NCA designation, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's natural beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters - which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities. The NCA designation only applies to lands managed by the federal government. Current access to and uses of private land will not be affected by this proposal. As the legislation states, “this Act should apply only to federal land and interests in federal land, and should not apply to private property or other non-federal land.” In addition, the legislation further protects private property rights by clearly stating that nothing in the legislation requires a private property owner to allow public access to their property. “The Berryessa Snow Mountain Region is a national treasure. We have a responsibility to preserve it and make sure the region is managed efficiently and responsibly,” said Thompson. “Designating the region as a National Conservation Area will preserve the land, help our local economies, and put all federal lands under one management plan. The bill does not impact private land in anyway. It will only protect and enhance the public lands for those who live in and visit the Berryessa Snow Mountain Region.” “With its magnificent vistas and diverse wildlife, the Berryessa Snow Mountain region is one of California's greatest natural treasures,” Senator Boxer said. “This bill will expand opportunities for outdoor recreation and help preserve this spectacular area for current and future generations.” “The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Act is a way to reap the benefits of our modern world while also protecting and promoting the beauty, serenity, and healthy activity that the natural world offers,” said Garamendi. “By conserving this natural setting, we are maintaining a prized commodity that will bring tourists, boost economic activity, and support local jobs. This bill will fully respect property rights and is a win-win for residents of our region and our entire country.” “Designating the Lake Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area is responsible stewardship of one of northern California's most treasured natural resources. The bill ensures the region's continued use as a recreation area and a safe haven for rare wildlife,” said Eshoo. “Berryessa Snow Mountain is one of California's natural wonders and I am proud to cosponsor legislation that will turn this beautiful region into a National Conservation Area,” said Bera. “As a lifelong Californian, I have spent countless hours enjoying our state's natural beauty by camping, hiking, and fishing, and I am fully committed to protecting our natural treasures. This new National Conservation Area will both help Northern California's economy, and allow us to protect and manage these lands for those who visit the region today and in the future.” “I applaud Congressman Thompson's foresight in introducing legislation to designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area. Consolidating the management will enhance the land's recreational uses and will be an environmental and economic boon for our region. The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area is a unique and biologically diverse area that should be protected for generations to come,” said Huffman. Establishment of a NCA will improve coordination between federal agencies; protect essential migratory corridors for wildlife adapting their ranges to a changing climate; keep water clean; and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. The bill reflects the changes promised by Thompson to constituents at Lake Berryessa Town Hall Meeting last year. These changes include adding additional language to ensure that NCA designation has no impact on the use of private property, and maintains access to private inholdings and adding additional language to ensure that the legislation will not impact motorized recreation on Lake Berryessa. The new legislation also modifies grazing language to ensure that all existing grazing will continue unchanged. The bill does not prohibit other grazing in additional areas as long as it is accordance with all laws and regulations. And the bill allows for the expanded use of grazing as a management tool. The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches more than 100 miles from the lowlands of Putah Creek below Lake Berryessa, across remote stretches of Cache Creek, and up to the peak of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 350,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake, Solano and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. “We're pleased that Congressman Thompson has recognized the natural wonders and recreational opportunities offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain regionâ€”and the strong desire by community members to protect this scenic treasure so that it can be enjoyed by future generations,” said Sara Husby-Good, Executive Director of Tuleyome. “His National Conservation Area proposal is a win-win for everyone.” Outdoor recreation and protected lands help the local economy. Recent studies by Headwaters Economics, a non-partisan, independent, nonprofit research group, have found that jobs and real personal income rose in local communities after nearby areas were permanently protected. That same potential is offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. Napa County Supervisor, Keith Caldwell agrees that the proposed Conservation Area will be good for business. He stated, “Legislation to protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area is definitely something to get excited about. As someone who hikes, paddles and rides my motorcycle in the area, I have a vested interest in insuring this land remains public open space.” Supervisor Caldwell continues, “Protecting our public lands is also an economic investment. Lake Berryessa is a wonderful place for people to swim, boat, fish, and more, but there are also a lot of local businesses that depend on the traffic that the Lake attracts. NCA status will not only help protect the existing recreational uses, it will attract eco-tourism, create jobs and support local businesses.” “Protecting special places increases recreation opportunities, encourages tourism, and supports local businesses,” said Yolo County Board of Supervisor Don Saylor. “That's why I was pleased to see that Representative Mike Thompson re-introduced legislation to protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area, supporting local businesses, and most importantly is a gift to future generations.” The white water rapids of Cache Creek, Lake Berryessa's bass fishery, and mountain bike and horseback riding opportunities make the Berryessa Snow Mountain region a major outdoor recreation destination. Permanent protection for the region would improve management of recreational trails and campsites. It would also increase user education and help draw visitors to the area. “I applaud the reintroduction of legislation to permanently protect the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. The proposed National Conservation Area will not only preserve a very special region of California, but also provide opportunities for the public to reconnect with the outdoors,” said Tom Ward, California Policy Advisor for the International Mountain Bicycling Association (IMBA). “IMBA is supportive of the proposed Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area because it would maintain and enhance trails and preserve important recreational uses in the region.” “We are pleased that Representative Thompson has reintroduced the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act, safeguarding the region's recreation opportunities and natural beauty and improving coordination between federal agencies and the local community,” said John and Judy Ahmann, ranchers and adjacent private landowners. “We feel better management and coordination by federal agencies will help us to fulfill our own stewardship goals with conservation easements on our private land. It is important to have strong stewardship of both public and private lands so that this incredible landscape can be enjoyed by future generations.” No legally-open roads or motorized vehicle trails will be closed as a result of the NCA designation. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the NCA and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The NCA designation would not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of the NCA. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. Lake, Napa, and Yolo County Board of Supervisors; the Calistoga and Napa County Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; and the cities of Calistoga, Clearlake, Davis, St. Helena, West Sacramento, and Winters support permanently protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. Also in support of the designation are: - More than 65 elected officials including former Congressman Pete McCloskey, co-author of the Endangered Species Act. - More than 200 businesses representing all five involved counties - Nearly 30 landowners and farmers. - More than 35 Recreation and conservation groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition, International Mountain Bicycling Association, Ducks Unlimited, the Backcountry Horsemen of California, and the National Hispanic Environmental Council The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

03.01.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-27) yesterday introduced H.R. 932 The Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and their Families Act. The bi-partisan legislation cosponsored by 4 other members of Congress allows active duty soldiers and veterans who serve honorably to expedite the citizenship of their family members and helps to protect them from deportation. “This legislation will help fix our broken immigration system that unnecessarily burdens active-duty service members, veterans who honorably served our nation, and military families,” said Thompson. “The brave men and women of our armed forces are willing to fight and die for our nation - the last thing they should have to worry about on the battlefield is their family's immigration status.” “I thank Mike for his leadership in introducing this important legislation,” said Ros-Lehtinen. “This bill will expedite the U.S. citizenship of the men and women who have sacrificed so much to protect the freedoms and principles upon which our nation was founded. It will also promote family unity by allowing their immediate family members to apply for lawful immigration status. Our patriots have risked their lives to secure our nation's ideals of opportunity and democracy for future generations to come. These brave servicemen and servicewomen deserve our support; we will keep fighting for their rights.”“This bill is an important step forward in resolving the serious immigration problems of America's military families and of military veterans,” said Margaret D. Stock, Counsel to the Firm, Lane Powell PC, and Lieutenant Colonel (retired), US Army Reserve, Military Police Corps. “For too long, our complex and dysfunctional immigration system has imposed grave hardships on military families and military veterans. In the face of Executive Branch inaction on the issue, Congress needs to take action.” The Congressional Research Service reports that more than 45,000 non-citizens are serving in the United States Armed Forces (Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard). In addition, many U.S. citizens serving in the military have family members who are not U.S. citizens. Non-citizen servicemembers and service members with non-citizen family members represent a significant portion of U.S. Armed Forces, and they often face daunting and complex immigration law and procedure. The Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and their Families Act addresses these immigration concerns of America's military personnel, our veterans, and their family members back home by: - Helping Veterans Who Have Served Honorably Become U.S. Citizens: The legislation allows soldiers who serve honorably during certain contingency operations to become U.S. citizens expeditiously. - Reuniting Lawful Permanent Residents Serving in Active-Duty with Family Members: The bill exempts immigrant petitions filed for the spouses and children of military personnel from numerical caps that limit the number of immigration petitions that can be granted each year. - Preserving Family Unity of Military Personnel: The bill permits immediate family members of military personnel to apply for lawful immigration status, subject to all necessary criminal and security background checks; and codifies existing guidelines for placing active-duty soldiers or veterans into removal proceedings. H.R. 932 has since been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Armed Services where it awaits further action.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.27.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), chairman of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today with task force vice-chair Jackie Speier (CA-14) introduced H.R. 848, the Armed Prohibited Persons Act of 2013. This legislation will help states launch initiatives to remove guns from the hands of convicted criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. The legislation will establish a competitive grant program within the Department of Justice for states that voluntarily develop a system that removes firearms from people who bought them legally but later lost their right to own those firearms by committing a crime or being deemed dangerously mentally ill. This legislation is modeled after a 2001 California state law that established the state's Armed Prohibited Persons System (APPS). California Attorney General Kamala D. Harris endorsed the legislation. “No matter which side of this debate you are on, no one wants criminals or people with a history of dangerous mental illness to have guns,” said Thompson. “This bill does nothing to limit a law abiding citizen's Second Amendment Rights. It simply gives states an incentive to develop successful programs that will keep guns out of the hands of people we all agree shouldn't have them. It will help prevent gun violence, and it will make our schools, streets and communities safer.” "California's armed and prohibited persons program is a proactive, smart, efficient tool that is taking firearms out of the hands of people who are prohibited from possessing them,” said Attorney General Harris. “I applaud Rep. Thompson for introducing this bill that will expand efforts nationwide to take dangerous weapons from those who are prohibited by law from possessing them."“The NRA is the first to say that we need to get the guns out of the hands of criminals. This bill does just that. We anxiously await their support,” said Speier. California's APPS helps make sure those convicted of certain crimes or deemed to be dangerously mentally ill relinquish or sell any firearms they own. Since 2007, under California's APPS, law enforcement has collected more than 10,000 guns from people who after legally purchasing them, became prohibited from owning them. More than 11,000 assault magazines have also been seized. Last year alone, more than 1,800 firearms where taken out of the hands of convicted criminals and the dangerously mentally ill. Other states, including Iowa, have systems to ensure persons who have domestic violence protective orders issued against them dispose of their firearms for the duration of the protective order. Most recently, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement (SAFE) Act included provisions to remove firearms from armed prohibited persons and the state will be developing a system to facilitate this. Specifically, the Armed Prohibited Persons Act of 2013 would make grants available to States who: - Develop programs with the goal of removing firearms from armed prohibited persons; - Provide assurances that an armed prohibited person will have a reasonable opportunity to lawfully dispose of their firearms before the State takes action to retrieve them; - Will contribute pertinent information to the National Criminal Instant Background Checks System (NICS); and - Can sustain the operation of the proposed program.

02.22.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced that the House of Representatives Wounded Warrior Program is accepting applications for positions in congressional offices around the country, including in his Vallejo office.“As a combat Vietnam Veteran, it is my high honor to have the opportunity to add one of our nation's brave servicemembers to my dedicated staff,” said Thompson. “This is an excellent opportunity for the men and women who served our nation in the Armed Forces to continue their public service.” The position available in Thompson's Vallejo office is for a caseworker, who would be responsible for facilitating and coordinating responses to a wide range of requests received from constituents. District caseworkers also help constituents interact with administrative and government agencies by acting as facilitators, ombudsmen and, in some cases, advocates. A full job description can be found here. The Wounded Warrior Program was established to create fellowships that provide employment opportunities within the House of Representatives. The fellowships will provide veterans with experience and exposure to ultimately broaden their scope of transition opportunities. Positions are available in congressional district offices nationwide. According to the Wounded Warrior Program, applicants must have served on active duty since September 11, 2001, have a 30 percent or greater service-connected disability rating and less than 20 years of service. In addition to a current resume, applicants must submit a copy of their DD214 and a VA letter confirming that they have at least a 30 percent service-connected disability rating. Interested applicants can visit the Wounded Warrior Program's website for more information.

02.22.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson today released the following statement in response to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announcing that local air traffic control towers could be shut down because of sequestration. Towers at the Napa County Airport and the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport could be closed.“These political games being played by the House Majority in Washington are costing real people their jobs here at home and unnecessarily putting people's safety at risk,” said Thompson. “This needs to stop. If sequestration goes into effect we will see arbitrary, harsh, across-the-board budget cuts that Republicans, Democrats, economists and business leaders all say would send our economy into a tail spin and cause essential government services, like air traffic control, to close. In California alone sequestration would cost us more than 225,000 jobs. Instead of this manufactured crisis, we need a balanced, bold plan that creates jobs, cuts spending, reforms our tax code so that everyone is paying their fair share and protects Social Security and Medicare. That's what I am working for.” Both the Napa County Airport and the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport would be forced to furlough or release a number of employees if their respective air traffic control towers close, even temporarily. All planes at both airports would be operating in uncontrolled airspace. Currently, almost all flights in and out of these airports is during controlled air times. Should these air towers close, the closest FAA air traffic control towers would be at the Sacramento International Airport and the Oakland International Airport. Sequestration is a result of the Joint Committee on Deficit Reduction, or “supercommittee”, failing to reach a solution to cut government spending last year. Legislation was written that said if no compromise was reached by the supercommittee then $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts would take place over the next decade. These cuts will come equally from defense and non-defense spending. It is estimated that sequestration would result in cuts totaling $85 billion in the remaining months of this fiscal year.

02.21.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-05) announced today that Congressman Jared Huffman (CA-02) will co-chair the Congressional Wild Salmon Caucus with Congressman Don Young (AK-at large). “I am proud to pass along the chairmanship of the Congressional Wild Salmon Caucus to my colleague Rep. Jared Huffman. I am confident that Jared, as the new representative of California's North Coast, will work to protect and maintain our salmon and steelhead populations. His environmental advocacy and passion for California fisheries will help aid the collaborative congressional effort to continue conservation of salmon populations throughout the United States” said Thompson. Congressman Huffman comes to Congress with a keen understanding of salmon issues in the rivers of Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. As a former environmental lawyer and state assemblyman, he fought legal battles and authored legislation based on sound science to speed recovery of critical species. One such bill, the Coho Salmon Habitat Enhancement Leading to Preservation Act (AB 1961), which streamlines the permit process of voluntary habitat improvements for California's struggling coho salmon, helps landowners quickly improve conditions for these iconic fish. AB 1961 was signed into law by Governor Brown on Sept 25, 2012. “I am honored to join my colleagues in leading the Wild Salmon Caucus in this new session of Congress, and I am excited to take on this challenge,” said Huffman, who represents a Northern California coastal district that is home to salmon rich rivers and fishing communities. “These issues are critical to my congressional district, to our fishing industry, and to our nation's coastal communities.” Reps. Mike Thompson and Don Young (AK- at large), founded the Congressional Wild Salmon Caucus in 2010, at the start of the 112th Congress. During the 113th Congress, the goal of the caucus is to serve as an informal, bipartisan group of members dedicated to conserving and restoring wild salmon populations, supporting salmon fishermen and the salmon fishing industry, and educating other members on wild salmon issues. One of the first orders of business for the Wild Salmon Caucus will be to address the issue of genetically engineered (GE) salmon, sometimes referred to as “Frankenfish”. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is moving closer to approving fish that are developed by artificially combining growth hormone genes from an unrelated Pacific salmon, with DNA from the anti-freeze genes of an eelpout. If approved, this would be the first food from a transgenic animal, one whose genome has been altered, available for public consumption. The caucus will work to address the issue over the coming weeks. The economic impact of the salmon industry in California is vast, ranging from fishermen, to boat operators, to ice providers, and more. Studies show that a restored salmon industry could contribute up to $5 billion and 94,000 jobs to the California economy. Reps. Huffman and Thompson are committed to continue pushing for salmon protection in Congress. The 113th Wild Salmon Caucus will be co-chaired by Reps. Jared Huffman and Don Young, with Rep. Mike Thompson serving as vice chair.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.21.2013	Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-5) and Paul Gosar (AZ-4) today introduced H.R. 750, a bipartisan measure to honor Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall with the Congressional Gold Medal for his years of public service. Secretary Udall was a champion for the environment and conservation, a civil rights activist, an advocate for Native American rights, and a supporter for the arts. “This bill will ensure Secretary Udall receives the recognition he earned,” said Thompson. “He made our country a better place by protecting our lands, enriching our lives with more access to fine arts, fighting to desegregate our schools and communities, and advocating for our Native Americans. He deserves the Congressional Gold Medal.” “Stewart Udall served Arizona and our nation admirably in the military, in Congress, and finally as Secretary of the Interior for over twenty years,” said Gosar. “Today his legacy lives on and he deserves this important recognition.” The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award Congress can confer upon an individual. Stewart Udall dedicated his life of public service. He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and was a B24 waist gunner in Italy during World War II. During that time, he flew more than 50 missions, earning him the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. After returning home and obtaining a law degree from the University of Arizona, Mr. Udall served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1960, President Kennedy appointed him as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held for eight years. During his cabinet career, Secretary Udall helped guide numerous landmark conservation and ecological protection measures through Congress. Secretary Udall's worked influenced every state in the nation and continues to improve our natural resources to this day. Secretary Stewart Udall helped create some of our nation's most beautiful parks, monuments, and historic places. Some of these majestic landscapes include: - Point Reyes National Seashore - Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area - John Muir National Historic Site, Canyonlands National Park - San Juan Island National Historic Park - Guadalupe Mountains National Park - Marble Canyon National Monument (now a part of the Grand Canyon National park) - Redwood National Park Secretary Udall's foresight in selecting these important landscapes has created landmarks that millions of visitors continue to visit today. During his cabinet career, Secretary Stewart Udall also fought against segregation. He successfully broke down barriers when he threatened to refuse the all-white Washington Redskins access to a new D.C. stadium, of which he was the Federal landlord. This was the first time in history when the federal government attempted to desegregate a professional sports team. After his cabinet career, Mr. Udall continued helping the American people by advocating for victims of radiation exposure, particularly Native Americans, resulting from the government's Cold War nuclear programs. As a private attorney in the 1970s and '80s, he won a 30-year battle to get Navajo uranium miners compensated for lung cancer incurred on the job. He also helped pass the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990. Secretary Udall passed away in 2010. Stewart Udall is the father of Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) and the uncle of Senator Mark Udall (D-CO). The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services.

02.20.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), today released the statement below following a HPSCI trip to Israel and Palestine. “With the President coming to Israel next month, this is an important time for the region. Our relationship with Israel is as strong as it has ever been. There is unprecedented transparency, information sharing and cooperation between both nations. “Also, our relationship with the Palestinians has never been better than it is now. Palestinian officials continue to show a genuine commitment to a counter-terrorism strategy and they have shown to be a professional and reliable protector of regional stability. “The Palestinians and Israelis are building a productive professional relationship on common security issues. People on both sides of the border want a stable region and I am confident that given the strong state of our relationships with Israel and the Palestinians we can take meaningful steps that enhance regional stability and improve regional security.” Thompson met with Israeli National Security Advisor Yaakov Amidror, Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority Salam Fayyad and Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority Said Abu-Ali. Thompson also met with Israeli and Palestinian intelligence officers to gain perspective and assessment of the security environment from officials in the field. The meetings took place in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Ramallah from February 16th - 18th.

02.15.2013	A broad coalition of groups back the House's Gun Violence Prevention Task Force's Policy Principles. The task force, chaired by Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released a comprehensive set of policy principles that both respect the Second Amendment and will reduce gun violence last week. The complete set of principles can be seen here. “Folks on all sides of this issue agree that we need a comprehensive approach to reduce gun violence,” said Thompson. “Our task force's comprehensive set of policy principles both respect the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans and will reduce gun violence. It's time for people on both sides of the aisle to work together and get legislation based on these principles signed into law.” Organizations and groups backing the task force's policy principles include: Mark Glaze, Director, Mayors Against Illegal Guns Mayors Against Illegal Guns and our 1.25 million grassroots supporters know that support for the Second Amendment goes hand-in-hand with keeping guns out of the hands of criminals . We applaud the extraordinary work Chairman Thompson and the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force are doing to enact common-sense reforms like background checks for all gun sales, removing military-style assault weapons from our streets and gun trafficking legislation. These sensible reforms will save American lives and keep our children safe. Chuck Canterbury, National President, Fraternal Order of Police The FOP strongly supports several measures, all absolutely critical elements of addressing gun violence, in the comprehensive plan put out by the Gun Violence prevention Task Force. With the horrible tragedy in Newtown, the increased number of mass shootings in our country, and, candidly, the gun violence which happens on some scale every day in big and small municipalities across the county, many plans are being offered to curb the violence and better protect our citizens. We are happy to see many of the ideas we discussed in Task Force meetings were included in your plan. Arkadi Gerney, Senior Fellow, Center for American Progress We applaud the House Democrats for joining President Barack Obama in putting forward a comprehensive and common-sense plan to combat gun violence. The House task force plan addresses the two most important challenges we face: keeping military-grade weapons off the streets; and keeping all guns out of the hands of felons, domestic abusers, and the seriously mentally ill. We urge the House and Senate Republican leadership to also come to the table with a plan to help prevent gun violence because that's what the American people expect and deserve.Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence We thank Chairman Congressman Mike Thompson for his tremendous leadership in helping to move this issue forward. The package of recommendations is a comprehensive set of solutions that would make a major impact on reducing gun violence. We look to Congress to take action, and we also know that now it's up to us. We need to continue to let our voices be heard so that leaders like Congressman Thompson and all of those members in Washington can be forceful advocates in the debate for change. As a nation, we know we are better than this, and the recommendations put forth by the Congressional task force are a important step in reaching our goals.Josh Horwitz, Executive Director, Coalition to Stop Gun Violence The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) applauds the comprehensive policy principles developed by the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. These recommendations, if implemented, would save countless American lives in the years ahead by keeping firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals and giving law enforcement the tools they need to prevent and solve gun crimes. We support all of the major elements of the task force's package, including your calls for universal background checks on all gun sales, a renewal of the federal ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, enhanced criminal penalties for straw purchasers and firearms traffickers, and the elimination of restrictions on federally-funded research into the causes of gun violence. Along with partners in the gun violence prevention movement, we will be mobilizing grassroots activists across the country to support these recommendations. Georges Benjamin, MD, Executive Director, American Public Health Association: The American Public Health Association commends the U.S. House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force for releasing a set of comprehensive policy recommendations today that follow evidence-based public health principles to address the growing crisis of gun violence facing communities across the country. Today's proposal includes a range of sensible and critically needed measures to prevent gun violence, a leading cause of preventable death in this country, including restoring unrestricted funding to conduct research at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on the causes of gun violence and how to prevent it. The plan also takes important steps to close serious gaps in local, state and federal gun policies by banning the sale of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines, mandating background checks for all gun purchases and improving access to mental health care in this country, clarifying that doctors are not prohibited from discussing gun safety with their patients among other proposals. They hold tremendous potential to dramatically reduce the scourge of gun violence in neighborhoods across the country. Mary Kusler, Director of Government Relations, National Education Association On behalf of the more than three million members of the National Education Association - dedicated educators who serve and protect millions of children every day - we would like to commend the Congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force for releasing comprehensive recommendations to address the gun violence plaguing our nation. We would like to thank you for the inclusive nature of your work, and particularly your efforts to ensure that all voices were at the table to provide input. NEA was very pleased to be able to represent educator concerns and provide recommendations to the Task Force that reflected educators' experience and expertise. NEA supports the Task Force recommendation regarding school safety. We are particularly pleased that the Task Force is recommending “an evidence-based approach to supporting a safe learning environment that is tailored to the unique needs of the students and local community.” We believe it is critical that local districts be given the flexibility and authority to decide what sorts of supports and personnel they need to ensure the safety of their students and staff. We also strongly agree that all school personnel must have resources and training to implement safety plans. Finally, we are very pleased that the Task Force is recommending that safety policies “promote a positive school climate that meets both the learning and emotional needs of all students.” Safer, more nurturing school climates that include positive student supports and anti-bullying initiatives will help students find non-violent alternatives to resolve conflicts and will allow staff to identify and address potential problems before they escalate. The National Juvenile Justice & Delinquency Prevention Coalition The tragic December 14th shootings in Newtown, Connecticut shook our nation's confidence in its ability to prevent violence and keep our children and our communities safe. It also strengthened our resolve to prevent future violence. The grief and anguish connected with the violence in Newtown cause us to remember that in far too many communities, violence is commonplace; an everyday occurrence...Across the country, people are searching for answers. The NJJDPC views this as a critical moment to invest more broadly in the true safety of proven strategies, not in the false sense of security of arming teachers or increasing police presence in every school. It is our view that true safety will not result from having more guns in schools or other places where youth congregate. True safety comes from comprehensive, evidence-based approaches that have been demonstrated to reduce violence. The National Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Coalition (NJJDPC) endorsed the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force recommendations on juvenile justice.Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence Faiths United To Prevent Gun Violence, a coalition of over 40 national faith denominations and organizations commend the Recommendations released by the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force led by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA). The Recommendations include all three of the gun violence prevention policies which forty-seven top national faith leaders urged President Obama and Congress to enact in the attached letter sent on January 15. 1. Mandating universal background checks on every gun purchased, including those bought at gun shows or in private sales. 2. Banning high-capacity magazines and implementing a rigorous ban on assault weapons. 3. Imposing stronger penalties on gun trafficking. Now that both President Obama and the Task Force have endorsed these life-saving policies, we urge that Congress enact them as soon as possible.General Board of Church and Society of The United Methodist Church The United Methodist General Board of Church & Society (GBCS) welcomes the findings released today by the U.S. House of Representatives' Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. Chaired by Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., the task force's findings support Vice-President Biden's task force in proposing a strong plan to reduce gun violence in the United States. GBCS urges Congress to work on this issue immediately so that no more lives are lost to any further unnecessary tragedies. We believe Congress has a moral imperative to enact many of the life-saving measures proposed by the House task force so that we do not have any further tragedies like Tucson, Aurora, Newtown or the numerous victims of gun violence even since the shooting in Newtown," said Jim Winkler, GBCS chief executive. The release of the findings by the House task force is part of the growing momentum towards real and necessary reform that has been building since the tragedy last fall in Newtown, according to Winkler. Preceding the release of the House findings, President Obama and Vice President Biden have both spoken repeatedly in favor of needed reforms to keep communities safe. Entertainment Software Association We commend Congressman Thompson and the members of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force for its comprehensive overview of the causes of gun violence and its thoughtful recommendations. The video game industry is committed to continuing our longstanding effort to provide parents the tools they need to make appropriate entertainment decisions for their families. As the report notes, the Entertainment Software Rating Board is widely utilized by parents and widely acknowledged by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Supreme Court, among others, as extremely effective. We thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership and thorough analysis, and look forward to continued discussions with elected officials in the important dialogue that seeks real solutions to this national problem.Brian Dyak, President and CEO, Entertainment Industries Council Gun violence, firearm safety and injury prevention is a detailed discussion with many intersections, including mental health. We must harness the power of the entertainment industry and news media to encourage safety and injury prevention and accurately address mental health concerns that would foster help-seeking behavior.The Sentencing Project Among our most solemn responsibilities as a nation is to protect and nurture our children. Unfortunately, we have seen a troubling shift in our response to at-risk youth in recent decades. When crises strike, there is often a temptation to tighten sanctions and add new punishments, but we know that these actions have a disparate effect on youthâ€”especially youth of colorâ€”long after the crisis has passed. We commend the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force for recognizing that comprehensive, evidence-based solutions in the areas/neighborhoods/jurisdictions where they are needed are necessary to build strong communities and keep our children safe.Josh Sugarmann, Executive Director, Violence Policy Center The Violence Policy Center (VPC) applauds the comprehensive set of principles put forward today by the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force. The task force's careful and deliberative approach to the problem of gun violence acknowledges that there is no one solution to this complicated issue. The tragedy in my home town of Newtown has galvanized the American public and the Violence Policy Center looks forward to working with a broad coalition of organizations and policymakers to implement the strong new laws endorsed by the House task force. These proposals will save lives and make all Americans safer in their schools, workplaces, and public spaces.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.12.2013	House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force Chair Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today released a letter signed by more than 50 constitutional law experts written and organized by leading members of the American Constitution Society (ACS) and a memo commissioned by the Center for American Progress (CAP) and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, (LCPGV) which each highlight that laws aimed at reducing gun violence and respect for the Second Amendment are not mutually exclusive. The documents are being released in advance of today's Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on the constitutionality of gun violence prevention legislation. “As a hunter and gun owner, I believe that we should protect the Second Amendment right of law-abiding individuals to own firearms. I will never give up my guns and I will never ask law-abiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to give up theirs. Not only am I personally against this, but the Constitution wouldn't allow it. In District of Columbia v. Heller, the Supreme Court affirmed once and for all that Americans have an individual right to keep and bear arms,” said Thompson. “As a dad and grandfather, I also believe that we have a responsibility to make our schools, streets and communities safe. Constitutional experts agree: we can do both.” “Justice Scalia's opinion in the Heller case makes clear that Americans have a constitutional right to have a handgun in their homes for self-defense. And, the case makes equally clear that reasonable laws designed to keep military-style weapons off our streets and keep all guns from felons, domestic abusers, and the seriously mentally ill are constitutional,” said Arkadi Gerney, a Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress. "The Court's opinion reflects the view of the vast majority of the American people, who agree that supporting the rights of responsible, law-abiding Americans goes hand-in-hand with doing more to fight gun crime."ACS President Caroline Fredrickson lauded the statement as a succinct, but significant, contribution to the discussion over measures to curb gun violence. “Regardless of some of the overwrought claims emanating from those opposing any new gun regulations, this letter clearly explains why sensible and limited regulations to curb gun violence do not violate the individual right to bear arms. There is no effort afoot to shred the Second Amendment, only discussion of ways to address gun violence without violating constitutional rights.” Said Robyn Thomas, Executive Director of the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, "The Supreme Court made it clear in Heller that, while the Second Amendment protects the right of law-abiding individuals to possess firearms for self-defense in the home, that right does not interfere with the ability of Congress, states and cities to enact smart gun laws. Because there is no constitutional impediment to common sense proposals aimed at reducing gun violence, such as universal background checks, banning dangerous assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and cracking down on gun traffickers, Congress has an important opportunity right now to enact new laws that we know will save lives." The letter, signed by more than 50 constitutional scholars, was crafted by two ACS leaders; UCLA School of Law Professor Adam Winkler and University of Chicago Law School Professor Geoffrey Stone are both longtime ACS supporters. Stone is the former chair of the ACS Board of Directors and Winkler is the adviser of the UCLA ACS student law chapter. The letter makes the case that measures being considered by national lawmakers to curb violence do not subvert the Second Amendment right to bear firearms. It goes on to argue that proposals like universal background checks, regulation of high-capacity ammunition magazines and military-style assault weapons are “clearly consistent with the Second Amendment.” The full text of the letter can be seen here. The Center for American Progress and Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence memo finds that the many forms of firearm regulation remain constitutional, including laws to prevent firearm possession by criminals and limitations on the possession of dangerous and unusual weapons. The measures endorsed by President Obama and proposed by Congress are safely within these confines; they reflect the sort of reasonable regulation that the Supreme Court endorsed in Heller and has accepted in a host of other constitutional contexts.

02.12.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) released the following statement in response to the State of the Union. “The state of our union is getting stronger, but we have more work to do. Whether it's creating jobs, getting our fiscal house in order, fixing our broken immigration system, or putting policies in place that respect the Second Amendment while also reducing gun violence, our nation faces big challenges. We won't overcome these challenges as Democrats versus Republicans - we must meet them together as Americans. “We need to put people to work fixing our roads, bridges, overpasses and waterways while also building an economy that can compete long-term by investing in new industries like clean energy. To get our fiscal house in order, we need a balanced approach that focuses on job creation, makes sure taxpayers are getting the most bang for their buck, and reforms our tax code so everyone pays their fair share. We need to avoid manufactured crisis that do nothing but hurt our economy. And, we need a bipartisan, comprehensive fix to our broken immigration system. “Finally, tonight President Obama once again called on Congress to pass legislation that will reduce gun violence. Last month the President acted by signing a series of executive actions that will have a meaningful impact on reducing gun violence. But as we know, the policies that would have the greatest impact require congressional action. “Whether you're an NRA member like Elvin Daniel, the guest I hosted at tonight's State of the Union, a hunter and gun owner like me, or one of the millions of Americans who have never fired a gun, we can all agree that when thirty-plus people die every day from gun violence that it's time for Congress act. My task force is already acting. Last week we released a comprehensive set of policy principles that both respect the Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans and will prevent gun violence. We're using these policy principles to develop and influence legislation in both the House and Senate and are working to get legislation based on these principles signed into law. “But this can't just be a Democratic effort. It's time for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to work with us and use the principles we developed to put laws in place that respect the rights of lawful Americans to own firearms and make our schools, neighborhoods, communities and country safer. “As the 113th Congress moves forward, I will continue working to overcome the challenges we face. And I am confident that if we put the partisanship aside and work together then our nation has even better days ahead.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties.

02.11.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05) today announced that he will host Elvin Daniel of McHenry, Illinois as his guest at the State of the Union on Tuesday night. Elvin's sister, Zina Daniel, was shot and killed by her husband inside the Azana Salon and Spa in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Two others were killed and four were injured in the shooting. Since Zina's murder, Elvin has dedicated himself to helping other victims of gun violence. Elvin is a member of the National Rifle Association (NRA). “Whether you're an NRA member like Elvin, a hunter and gun owner like me, or one of the millions of Americans who have never fired a gun, we can all agree that we need to do everything we can to keep firearms out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them,” said Thompson. “Elvin has dedicated himself to helping the victims of gun violence and it is my high honor to host such an extraordinary man at the State of the Union.” "Sadly I am all too well acquainted with the horrors of gun violence. My sister became one of the 33 Americans who are murdered with guns every day after her killer was able to buy a firearm from a private seller without a criminal background check. As a gun owner and an NRA member, I support common-sense reforms to fix our broken gun laws. It's time for our leaders in Washington to act, so that others do not have to experience the grief I'll live with for the rest of my life. I am honored to attend the State of the Union with Congressman Thompson and I am deeply encouraged by his leadership on this most critical issue," said Daniel. Shortly before she was killed, Zina was granted a restraining order against her husband which prohibited him from purchasing a gun. However, Zina's husband was able to bypass a background check and buy a .40-caliber semi-automatic handgun online two days after the restraining order barred him from owning firearms. One of the policy principles announced by the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force last week would close these kinds of background check loopholes. The task force outlined the background check principle saying that Congress should act to: Require a background check for every gun sale, while respecting reasonable exceptions for cases such as gifts between family members and temporary loans for sporting purposes: It is estimated that four out of ten gun buyers do not go through a background check when purchasing a firearm because federal law only requires these checks when someone buys a gun from a federally licensed dealer. That would be like allowing four out of ten people to choose if they'd go through airport security. This loophole allows felons, domestic abusers, and those prohibited because of mental illness to easily bypass the criminal background check system and buy firearms at gun shows, through private sellers, over the internet or out of the trunks of cars.

02.08.2013	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) . Paul A. Gosar, D.D.S (R - AZ), Joe Heck (R-NV) and Jared Polis (D-CO) today introduced The Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act, H.R. 596, legislation that streamlines permitting for renewable energy projects on public lands. “Many of California's public lands are perfect for responsible renewable energy development, but bureaucracy too often prevents us from capitalizing on this economic engine,” said Thompson. “This bill helps fix that. It will streamline responsible renewable energy projects on public lands, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and put Californians back to work. That's good for our economy, environment and national security.” “Arizona can be a model for energy-driven economic recovery in this country, but bureaucratic red tape has gotten in the way. This bill is a part of a comprehensive energy policy that gets the government out of the way, grows our energy sector and spurs job creation,” said Congressman Gosar. “Renewable energy development on public lands will create jobs and move us closer to energy security, but permits must be processed more efficiently so projects can actually get started,” Rep. Joe Heck said. “This bill will streamline the approval process so states like Nevada, where more than 80% of the state is owned by the federal government, can reap the benefits of renewable projects. If we truly want to pursue an "all of the above" national energy strategy, we must develop all energy sources on all possible lands: publically-held lands offer some of the best renewable energy development opportunities. I'm pleased to join this bipartisan group of lawmakers in introducing the Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act and look forward to working to see it passed.” “This legislation will ensure that Colorado is at the center of the coming renewable energy boom,” said Congressman Polis. “We know we must grow our economy by producing cheaper, renewable energy and this bill will help the West lead the way.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

02.07.2013	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today announced the task force's comprehensive set of policy principles designed to reduce gun violence while respecting the 2nd Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. “As a hunter and gun owner I believe we should protect law-abiding individuals' 2nd Amendment right to own firearms. As a father and grandfather I also believe that we have a responsibility to make our schools, neighborhoods and communities safe. This comprehensive set of policy principles accomplishes both those goals and Congress should act on them without delay. Moving forward I will use these recommendations to develop and influence legislation in both the House and Senate and work to get legislation based on these principles signed into law,” said Thompson. “As a survivor of the mass shooting in Tucson two years ago, I am determined that no one else should have to endure such grief and loss. And as a member of Congress and as a vice chairman of this task force, I am unwavering in my commitment to push forward with legislation that will protect our children and our communities,” said Rep. Ron Barber (AZ). “I commend Chairman Thompson for his hard work in making this a fair, open and transparent process, as we look to find a balanced way to protect both our families and our Second Amendment rights. I still have genuine concerns about some of these recommendations. There are many that I support, and I believe that moving this process forward and continuing this important conversation is what the American people deserve. I will release further comments on these recommendations separately,” said Rep. John D. Dingell (MI). “In conversations I've had with residents in Newtown and across my district and in the thousands of letters, emails, and phone calls I've received from constituents on gun violence, I've heard a resounding call for commonsense policies to save lives. I'm proud to support these commonsense, comprehensive principles as a guide for our continuing national discussion on gun violence prevention and for action moving forward. What happened almost two months ago in Newtown was an unimaginable tragedy. What happens now is up to us. We must meet this call to action to protect our children, our families, and our communities,” said Rep. Elizabeth Esty (CT). “This task force has worked diligently to provide a comprehensive list of recommendations that will be first steps in reducing gun violence, all of which I support. I'm pleased to have specifically recommended two of the provisions included in the list; more funds for tip lines that offer financial rewards to individuals to help recover illegal guns and locks for the safe storage of firearms. We are determined to lead the effort for real change that will reduce gun violence and protect our children while also protecting an individual's right to bear arms for sport or self-defense. Americans are insisting that now is the time to act,” said Rep. Chaka Fattah (PA). “When 20 kids are gunned down in their classrooms and over 30 Americans are killed with guns every day, to do nothing in response is to fail the American people. We've thoroughly researched and presented a range of options, each of which can help save lives and reduce injuries, and many of which have been proposed by others as well. It's long past the time for Washington to finally act,” said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (NY). “Thank you to Chairman Thompson and my colleagues on the Task Force for recognizing that mental health is a critical part of the conversation on gun violence prevention and for understanding how it affects our families, communities, and businesses. We must continue to de-stigmatize the issue of mental illness and elevate mental health to achieve parity with physical health. Americans have demanded that action be taken, and these principles are a critical first step in protecting the well-being of all,” said Rep. Grace Napolitano. "I believe in and value the Second Amendment. It is a part of our American history and way of life. But, after so many gun violence tragedies, we in Congress have an obligation to make gun violence less easy, less frequent, and less deadly. I know from listening to my constituents there are sensible solutions most Americans support such as the ones outlined by our Task Force. These measures should be brought to a vote in Congress with bipartisan support. We cannot wait another day, week or month to keep our kids and communities safe," said Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO). “Our people have a right to expect that they will be free from harm in their communities and their children will be safe in their schools. The Task Force's recommendationsâ€”which reflect input from a wide range of stakeholdersâ€”prioritize keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people, enhancing mental health services, cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and removing military-style assault weapons from our streets. I urge the leadership of this House to act immediately on these reasonable and common-sense principles which respect the rights of responsible gun owners and make our communities safer,” said Rep. David Price (NC). “Sustained gun violence prevention is achievable through scientifically proven general violence prevention strategies. Such general violence prevention strategies require comprehensive, evidence-based services for at-risk children and families delivered through a collaborative plan involving law enforcement, social services, schools, mental health, businesses, non-profit, faith-based and other community-based organizations working with such children and families. This approach has been scientifically proven to not only greatly reduce gun violence and crime, but it also saves much more in avoided criminal justice and social welfare expenditures than the evidenced-based services cost,” said Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott (VA). “The American people have already spoken in outrage about the human toll of gun violence in our country. We have no more excuses, now is the time for Congress to act on this issue. Our children, friends, and loved ones will be safer when we pass common sense gun laws that keep military-style weapons and large magazines off our streets and out of our communities. The members of our diverse task force agree that all Americans have the right to be safe and the right to live without the fear of a shooting at their child's elementary school, their college campus, their shopping mall, or their street corner. I commend Congressman Thompson for his leadership of this group of Members with wide ranging views on gun ownership, gun safety, and gun violence prevention. We worked together to develop principles that reflect the values of all Americans who want to prevent the next Sandy Hook, Aurora, or Virginia Tech,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (CA). “A comprehensive approach to address gun violence should be taken to protect the freedom and safety of all Americans. I look forward to working to enact meaningful legislation that will help make our streets and communities safer while also protecting law-abiding individuals' right to own firearms,” said Rep. Bennie Thompson (MS). For nearly two months, the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, under the leadership of Chairman Mike Thompson, has met with people on both sides of the aisle and all sides of the issue to develop a comprehensive set of policy principles that respect the 2nd Amendment and will make our schools, neighborhoods, and communities safer. The task force met with and solicited input from victims of gun violence and gun safety advocates; gun owners, hunters, and outdoor sportsmen; federal, state, and local law enforcement; educators and community workers; mental health experts and physicians; representatives of the motion picture, television, music, and video game industries; leaders in our faith communities; and representatives of gun manufacturers and retailers, as well as cabinet secretaries and the Vice President of the United States. The task force also met with Members of Congress from all sides of the issue, and held hearings in Washington, DC to consider ways to address this issue. Chairman Thompson and the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force urge Congress to: Support the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. The United States Supreme Court affirmed individuals' 2nd rights to firearms in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). However, the Supreme Court also held that “the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,” Within the limits described by Heller, the federal government has the responsibility to take appropriate steps to protect our citizens from gun violence. Support citizens' rights to possess firearms for hunting, shooting sports, defense, and other lawful and legitimate purposes: In the United States, there is a long tradition of hunting and recreational shooting, and firearms are often passed down within families from generation to generation. Policies passed by Congress should respect this. Reinstate and strengthen a prospective federal ban on assault weapons: These weapons are designed to fire a large number of rounds in a short period of time. They constitute a lethal threat to law enforcement and other first responders Reinstate a prospective federal ban on assault magazines: These magazines hold more than ten rounds and allow a shooter to inflict mass damage in a short period of time without reloading. Banning them will save lives. Require a background check for every gun sale, while respecting reasonable exceptions for cases such as gifts between family members and temporary loans for sporting purposes: It is estimated that four out of ten gun buyers do not go through a background check when purchasing a firearm because federal law only requires these checks when someone buys a gun from a federally licensed dealer. That would be like allowing four out of ten people to choose if they'd go through airport security. This loophole allows felons, domestic abusers, and those prohibited because of mental illness to easily bypass the criminal background check system and buy firearms at gun shows, through private sellers, over the internet or out of the trunks of cars. Strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) database: Immediate action is needed to ensure the information in the NICS database is up to date. Many federal and state agencies remain deficient in transferring important records to the database. Without the information, the background checks aren't complete. This needs to change. Prosecute those prohibited buyers who attempt to purchase firearms and others who violate federal firearm laws: Federal law bars nine categories of peopleâ€”including felons and those prohibited because of mental illness â€”from buying guns. But when prohibited persons attempt to buy guns, they are hardly ever prosecuted. More can and must be done to make these investigations and prosecutions a priority. Pass legislation aimed specifically at cracking down on illegal gun trafficking and straw-purchasing: Straw-purchasing is when a prohibited buyer has someone with no criminal history walk into a gun store, pass a background check and purchase a gun with the purpose of giving it to the prohibited buyer. This puts guns in the hands of people who are prohibited from having them. Congress should pass a law that will put an end to this practice. Restore funding for public safety and law enforcement initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence: Congress should fund law enforcement's efforts to reduce gun violence, while supporting federal research into causes of gun violence. Put simply, there is no reason the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) or the National Institute of Health (NIH) should be inhibited from researching the causes of gun violence. And there is no reason for the restrictions federal law places on our law enforcement officers' ability to track and combat the spread of illegal guns. Support initiatives that prevent problems before they start: Local communities should have assistance in applying evidence-based prevention and early intervention strategies that are designed to prevent the problems that lead to gun violence before those problems start. Close the holes in our mental-health system and make sure that care is available for those who need it: Congress must improve prevention, early intervention, and treatment of mental illness while working to eliminate the stigma associated with mental illness. Access to mental health services should be improved, the shortage of mental health professionals should be addressed, and funding should be made available for those programs that have proven to be effective. Help our communities get unwanted and illegal guns out of the hands of those who don't want them or shouldn't have them: Congress should help support and develop local programs that get unwanted guns off our streets. And Congress should work with states to develop programs that get guns out of the hands of those convicted of certain crimes or those prohibited because of mental illness. Support responsible gun ownership: Congress should support safety training, research aimed at developing new gun safety technologies and the safe storage of firearms. Take steps to enhance school safety. Congress must help all schools implement evidence-based strategies that support safe learning environments tailored to the unique needs of students and local communities. And Congress must work with all schools to develop emergency response plans. Address our culture's glorification of violence seen and heard though our movie screens, television shows, music and video games: Congress should fund scientific research on the relationship between popular culture and gun violence, while ensuring that parents have access to the information they need to make informed decisions about what their families watch, listen to, and play.

01.30.2013	Today Maryland Congressman Chris Van Hollen and California Congressman Mike Thompson announced the details of a friendly wager over the outcome of this Sunday's matchup between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. As Members of Congress from the two states represented in the championship game, and as passionate fans of their home state teams, they are competing for both bragging rights and sustenance. If the 49ers win, Congressman Van Hollen will supply his colleague from California with a batch of world-famous Maryland Crab Cakes. If the Ravens win, Congressman Thompson will provide his colleague from Maryland with bottles of wine from Napa, Sonoma, Contra Costa, and Lake Counties . “I look forward to watching an exciting and competitive Super Bowl between the Ravens and Niners, but I am confident that Coach John and his Ravens will ultimately soar to victory and keep our delicacy from the Chesapeake Bay on the right coast,” said Congressman Van Hollen. “I look forward to toasting their success with a glass of excellent wine.” “I'm looking forward to celebrating a Niners Super Bowl victory with some great Maryland Crab Cakes,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “With Coach Jim and Colin Kaepernick on our side, I'm confident our wine won't be leaving the west coast.” ###
01.30.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force in the House, today released the following statement on the Senate Judiciary Committee's hearing on gun violence. “Gun violence is a complex problem with complex solutions. To address it, we need a comprehensive approach that's developed by having every idea on the table and everyone at the table. That's the approach my task force has taken since day one, and it's the approach the Senate started today. “As a hunter and gun owner I will not give up my guns and I will not ask other law-abiding Americans to give up theirs. Not only am I personally against this, the Supreme Court made it clear in the Heller case that the Constitution won't allow it. But as a father and grandfather, I also know we have a responsibility to keep our kids, communities and country safe from gun violence. “This debate isn't a choice between either protecting the Second Amendment or reducing gun violence. It's about the willingness of a responsible majority to do both. By working together - both across the aisle and between Congressional chambers and branches of government - we can put policies in place that reduce gun violence and respect the 2nd Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans.” In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Supreme Court affirmed that Americans have an individual right to keep and bear arms. The court also affirmed that there is no constitutional problem with certain limitations. This ruling provides people with an opportunity to work between the extremes and within the confines of the Second Amendment to pass legislation that will reduce gun violence. Thompson was named to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence in December. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam. The task force is holding a number of meetings and hearings with different experts designed to identify the best policies to reduce and prevent gun violence. A comprehensive set of policy proposals will be released in early February. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 5th Congressional District, which includes the all or part of Contra Costa, Lake, Napa, Solano and Sonoma Counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and sits on the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
01.16.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of a House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, released the following statement on President Obama's announcement of proposals to reduce gun violence. “The president and our task force agree that we need a comprehensive approach to reduce and prevent gun violence. Executive action can and should be part of the process, and many of the executive actions announced today will have a positive influence on reducing gun violence. Now it's time for Congress to step up and do what needs to be done to save lives. Many of the policies that will have the greatest impact on reducing gun violence will require Congressional action. “During the next several weeks our task force will examine the president's proposals and the proposals of others. We will continue meeting with stakeholders on every side of this issue. And we will develop a comprehensive set of policy proposals that both respect peoples' 2nd Amendment rights and help keep our communities safe from gun violence.” Thompson is working closely with Vice-Chairs Ron Barber (AZ), John D. Dingell (MI), Elizabeth Esty (CT), Chaka Fattah (PA), Carolyn McCarthy (NY), Grace Napolitano (CA), Ed Perlmutter (CO), David Price (NC), Bobby Scott (VA), Jackie Speier (CA), and Bennie Thompson (MS) to develop a comprehensive set of policy recommendations that will be released in early February. ###
01.14.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson, chair of a congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force (CA-5) and the vice-chairs of the task force today met with Vice President Joe Biden, Attorney General Eric Holder, Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano and Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius to discuss a comprehensive approach to reduce and prevent gun violence. “Meaningful progress towards reducing and preventing gun violence cannot be made by just one branch of government,” said Thompson. “Our task force looks forward to working with the Vice President, the Obama Administration and all stakeholders to enact a comprehensive set of proposals that both respect the 2nd Amendment rights of law abiding citizens without a history of dangerous mental illness and helps keep our schools, streets and communities safe from gun violence.” Congressman Thompson was joined in the meeting by vice-chairs of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force: Rep. Ron Barber (AZ), Rep. John D. Dingell (MI), Rep. Elizabeth Esty (CT), Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (NY), Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO), Rep. Bobby Scott (VA) and Rep. Jackie Speier (CA). Over the next month the task force will hold a number of meetings and hearings with different experts designed to identify the best policies to reduce and prevent gun violence.

01.04.2013	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-5), chair of a congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, today announced 12 vice chairs to serve on the task force. The vice chairs and Thompson will make up the task force's leadership team. “I am proud to announce our leadership team for the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force,” said Thompson. “Our vice chairs have a wide range of expertise, come from different backgrounds representing all corners of the House Democratic Caucus, and will bring unique ideas to the table as we work to reduce and prevent gun violence while also protecting the rights of law-abiding individuals without a history of dangerous mental illness to own legitimate firearms for legitimate purposes.” Thompson was recently named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam. The 12 Vice Chairs are: - Rep. Ron Barber (AZ) - Congressman Barber had a 30-year career with the Division of Developmental Disabilities in the Arizona Department of Economic Security. Under his direction, the division improved services for families, while running one of the five most cost-efficient, high-quality programs in the country.

She approaches the need for sensible gun policies as a community leader, attorney, and mother who has served as a room parent for a first-grade classroom. As a member of the Connecticut State House of Representatives, Esty advocated for commonsense legislation to reduce gun violence and keep families safe. - Rep. Chaka Fattah (PA) - Ranking Member on House Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and related agencies. Fattah, a major supporter of the ATF, is deeply involved in issues dealing with firearms, public safety and law enforcement. In Philadelphia, he created the successful gun buyback “Groceries for Guns” program that has removed thousands of dangerous, unwanted firearms from streets and homes of Philadelphians in exchange for grocery coupons. - Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (NY) - Congresswoman McCarthy, a lifelong nurse, strode into a life of activism to reduce gun violence after her husband was murdered and son critically wounded in the 1993 mass shooting on the Long Island Railroad in New York. Her activism led her to Washington first to lobby members of Congress as an advocate for victims, and then as a member herself after running against her own congressman who voted against the assault weapons ban. Today she is the House sponsor of bills to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines, close the gunshow loophole, strengthen our national background check database, and ban the anonymous bulk online sale of ammunition. Later this month she will also introduce a new assault weapons ban with Congressman Ed Perlmutter and Senator Dianne Feinstein. - Rep. Grace Napolitano (CA) - Congresswoman Grace F. Napolitano is the founder and co-chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus. In 2001, she secured funding to provide on-site mental health services for schools within her District, which has now expanded to 15 area schools. Napolitano introduced the Mental Health in Schools Act, authorizing funding to implement on-site mental health services for schools on a national level and each year has introduced legislation recognizing May as National Mental Health Awareness Month. In 2010, Napolitano created the Mental Health Task Force, which includes notable figures such as: Los Angeles Laker, Metta World Peace; World Championship Boxer, Mia St. John, and Dancing with the Stars celebrity, Mark Ballas to help raise awareness about mental health, rid stigma, and encourage others to seek help. Additionally, Napolitano established the 38th Congressional District Mental Health Consortium, a group of local mental health professionals in her District to help advise on mental health related issues and policy. - Rep. Ed Perlmutter (CO) -- Congressman Ed Perlmutter represents the 7th Congressional District of Colorado encompassing the northern and western suburbs of the Denver metro region. Residents of the 7th CD are diverse, moderate and middle of the road with their personal values, economics, and education. Perlmutter represented the City of Aurora, CO during the tragic movie theater shootings in July 2012. He also represented the area surrounding Columbine High School when he was serving in the Colorado State Senate.

Bobby Scott (VA) - Congressman Bobby Scott serves as the Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. He is a known leader of legislative efforts to reduce crime and prevent youth violence by advocating for comprehensive, evidence-based solutions. Towards this goal, he has introduced the Youth PROMISE Act. Following the Columbine tragedy, he co-led a bi-partisan effort to develop juvenile crime prevention and accountability legislation that resulted in the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant Program (JABG) legislation which was cosponsored by every member of the Crime Subcommittee on both sides of the aisle and passed into law in 2002. He has also co-led bipartisan legislative efforts to add fines and suspensions to the tools available to the ATF to enable the agency to more effectively enforce gun sale and transfer regulations and to close the gun show loophole. - Rep. Jackie Speier (CA) - Congresswoman Speier was Legislative Counsel to Congressman Leo Ryan in 1978 when she accompanied him to investigate the People's Temple cult in Jonestown, Guyana. Congressman Ryan was assassinated, and Speier was shot five times at close range. She still carries two of the bullets in her body. Since that time, she has been a consistent advocate of gun control, and carried assault weapons ban legislation in California twenty years ago. She supports the 2nd Amendment, but believes we cannot simply blame this crisis on violent video games or mental illness. The proliferation of military style assault weapons and assault magazines are part of the problem, and should be banned. In addition, she believes it is essential that loopholes in the background check process be closed. - Rep. Bennie Thompson (MS) - An avid hunter, Congressman Bennie Thompson has been selected to chair the bipartisan Congressional Sportsman's Caucus during the 113th Congress. Congressman Thompson has served as the lead Democrat on the House Committee on Homeland Security since 2007. Prior to his election to Congress, Congressman Thompson served as alderman and mayor of Bolton, Mississippi and as a supervisor in Hinds, County Mississippi.

01.01.2013	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-01), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee released the following statement on his vote in favor of the bipartisan agreement to avert the fiscal cliff. “This legislation is far from perfect but it's better than the falling off the fiscal cliff. Doing nothing would have sent our economy into a tailspin and triggered another recession. Now that we have done what was needed to avoid the fiscal cliff, it's time to focus on what should have been our priority all along: getting Americans back to work and getting our fiscal house in order.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and sits on the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
12.21.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson, chair of a congressional Gun Violence Prevention Task Force (CA-1) today issued the following statement following the National Rifle Association's (NRA) press conference. “Everyone agrees our schools, movie theaters shopping malls, streets and communities need to be safer. But we need a comprehensive approach that goes beyond just arming more people with more guns to make this happen. “Closing holes in our mental health system, addressing our culture's glorification of violence, improving background checks for everyone who buys firearms, and reinstating the ban on assault weapons and assault magazines all must be part of a comprehensive approach to reduce and prevent gun violence.” Thompson was recently named by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to chair a congressional task force on reducing and preventing gun violence. Thompson is a hunter, gun owner, former chair of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus, and veteran who carried a military-style assault weapon during a tour in Vietnam. # # #
12.21.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) announced today that the Russian River watershed was selected as California's Habitat Focus Area within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Habitat Blueprint. NOAA's habitat conservation experts felt that the Russian River offered the greatest opportunities for NOAA-wide collaboration on habitat conservation among the 17 candidate areas identified by the staff this fall. “I have been impressed with the work being conducted in the Russian River watershed to protect, conserve, and maintain our salmon and steelhead populations. For years, I have promoted, supported, and advocated for this incredible collaborative effort to restore our native fisheries populations and I am pleased that NOAA has recognized the work of this community. I am proud that over the next several years, the Russian River Watershed will be a focal point in salmon restoration, habitat science, and conservation within the United States” said Thompson. “This designation recognizes the Russian River watershed as one of the most promising regions in the nation for real improvements in fish habitat. Stakeholders should be proud of the efforts they've made, whether it's volunteering at river clean-up days, adopting fish-friendly farming practices or creating habitat on their property,” said Sonoma County Water Agency and Sonoma County Chairwoman Shirlee Zane. “The community-wide focus on the watershed is one of the aspects that made this region attractive to the National Marine Fisheries Service.” The Russian River drains 1,485 square miles, including much of Sonoma and Mendocino counties and is home to three fish on the endangered and threatened species lists: coho salmon, Chinook salmon, and steelhead trout. For years, the Sonoma County Water Agency and other stakeholders have worked tirelessly to enhance the fish and wildlife resources of the Russian River, and have developed sound science technology to protect, preserve and restore the threatened and endangered fish species. Because of the community's strong effort to protect the salmon population, NOAA selected the Russian River as California's Habitat Focus Area within NOAA Habitat blue print. The Habitat Blueprint strives to “improve the way NOAA does business”, improving fish habitat protection though increased efficiency and creative partnerships. The Russian River watershed is an excellent example of these partnerships. The habitat enhancement work that is taking place and will continue as part of the Habitat Blueprint include supplementing cold water releases by providing the shady, complex habitat critical for young coho and steelhead, along with other habitat restoration and enhancement projects are being done throughout the Russian River watershed. These efforts are accompanied by extensive monitoring in order to measure success and to continually improve projects and programs. The local community also recognizes the value of a watershed approach to improving the health of the river and its species. Private landowners throughout the watershed are working to create off-stream water storage to use for frost protection and irrigation in order to reduce demand on the river. ###
12.13.2012	Bipartisan legislation co-authored by Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) that provides better protection for taxpayer dollars today passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 402-0. The legislation, H.R. 4053, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA), will better identify, prevent and recover payment error, waste, fraud and abuse within federal spending by making sure federal agencies have policies in place to prevent and recover improper payments. “Taxpayers deserve to know that there money is being spent wisely and monitored closely,” said Thompson. “Every dollar counts. This bill will help us lower our debt by cutting down on billions in wasteful spending.” According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), federal agencies reported an estimated $125.4 billion in improper payments in FY2010. Among many other provisions, this new bill will help federal agencies cut down on wasteful spending by creating a government-wide Do Not Pay List to block improper payments before they go out and to stop payments to deceased individuals, such as for Social Security. This legislation builds on a similar improper payments law passed last year, the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act of 2010, which was part of the Blue Dogs' Blueprint for Fiscal Reform - a 15-point plan to balance the budget and lay the groundwork for sound fiscal policies over the long term. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and sits on the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
12.12.2012	Rep. Mike Thompson and a bipartisan group of 29 Senators and Representatives sent a letter to President Obama Wednesday calling for Master Limited Partnerships and Real Estate Investment Trusts to be a priority in the federal government's “all of the above” energy strategy. The letter was led by the lead sponsors of the bipartisan Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act: U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), and U.S. Representatives Ted Poe (R-TX-02), Mike Thompson (D-CA-01) and Peter Welch (D-VT-AL). The legislation, H.R. 6437 and S. 3275, will modify the federal tax code to make it easier and more attractive for private capital to invest in renewable energy. “Minor changes to the federal tax code could provide the renewable energy industry access to large pools of low-cost private capital,” the lawmakers wrote. “Already, oil, gas, and coal infrastructure projects raise cheap capital by selling shares of Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), as do energy transmission projects using Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects cannot use these investment tools and, therefore, suffer from high costs of capital.” “Opening MLPs and REITs to renewable energy would level the playing field by giving renewables the same access to low-cost capital enjoyed by oil, gas, coal and transmission infrastructure projects,” the letter continues. “Small tweaks to the tax code could attract billions of dollars in private sector investment to renewable energy deployment, reduce the cost of renewable electricity by up to one third, and dramatically broaden the base of eligible investors.” A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business structure that is taxed as a partnership but whose shares are traded like stock on a market. Because MLPs have access to capital at a lower cost and a more liquid financial approach, this makes them very attractive to private investment. Currently, only oil, natural gas, coal extraction, and pipeline projects are allowed to qualify for MLPs. This bill would simply amend the federal tax code to allow investment in renewable energy projects in the same way. The MLP Parity Act has been endorsed by the American Wind Energy Association, Third Way, Solar Energy Industries Association, Biomass Power Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, American Council on Renewable Energy, Natural Resources Defense Council, Advanced Biofuels Association, Offshore Wind Development Coalition, the Advanced Ethanol Council, Silicon Valley Leadership Group, International District Energy Association, and Environmental Entrepreneurs. The text of Wednesday's letter is below: December 12, 2012 The President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President, Over the past four years, the renewable energy sector has seen major reductions in technology costs, including a 75 percent decline in the price of solar panels and about a 25 percent decline in the price of wind turbines. But even as technology costs have dropped, the cost of capital required to deploy those technologies has remained stubbornly high - inflating overall project costs and presenting a major barrier to wider deployment. Minor changes to the federal tax code could provide the renewable energy industry access to large pools of low-cost private capital. Already, oil, gas, and coal infrastructure projects raise cheap capital by selling shares of Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs), as do energy transmission projects using Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). Wind, solar, and other renewable energy projects cannot use these investment tools and, therefore, suffer from high costs of capital. Opening MLPs and REITs to renewable energy would level the playing field by giving renewables the same access to low-cost capital enjoyed by oil, gas, coal and transmission infrastructure projects. Small tweaks to the tax code could attract billions of dollars in private sector investment to renewable energy deployment, reduce the cost of renewable electricity by up to one third, and dramatically broaden the base of eligible investors. In fact, bipartisan legislation has already been introduced in both the House and the Senate (H.R. 6437 and S. 3275 respectively) to allow renewable energy projects to raise low-cost capital through the MLP structure. In the case of REITs, a straightforward ruling by the Treasury Department would allow access to this investment vehicle for renewable energy projects. We strongly support moving America towards energy independence using an “all of the above” energy strategy. Renewable energy can play a critical role in accomplishing that goal. We ask that your administration move to unlock capital markets for broad-scale investment in renewable energy and help move our country towards cleaner, more efficient energy. We stand ready to work with you to accomplish this goal. Sincerely, Senator Chris Coons (D-DE) Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) Senator Mark Begich (D-AK) Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO) Senator Jon Tester (D-MT) Senator Scott Brown (R-MA) Senator Al Franken (D-MN) Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) Representative Ted Poe (R-TX-2) Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA-1) Representative Peter Welch (D-VT) Representative John Carney (D-DE) Representative Betty McCollum (D-MN-4) Representative Jim Moran (D-VA-8) Representative John Garamendi (D-CA-10) Representative Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-9) Representative William Lacy Clay (D-MO-1) Representative Larry Kissell (D-NC-8) Representative Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM-3) Representative Raul Grijalva (D-AZ-07) Representative Lois Capps (D-CA-23) Representative Gerry Connolly (D-VA-11) Representative Doris Matsui (D-CA-5) Representative Mel Watt (D-NC-12) Representative Andre Carson (D-IN-7) Representative Mike McIntyre (D-NC-7) Representative Russ Carnahan (D-MO-3)Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

12.11.2012	21 Medal of Honor recipients sent a letter today urging Senate and House leaders who are negotiating the final version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to include Rep. Mike Thompson's (CA-1) provision honoring Colonel Robert Howard in the legislation. Thompson's provision was passed by the House as an amendment to H.R. 4310, the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2013 and honors Col. Howard by renaming a Special Forces training and support complex being built at Fort Bragg, North Carolina as the â€˜â€˜Colonel Robert Howard Training and Support Complex.'' The complex is currently referred to as â€˜â€˜Patriot Point.''“When 21 Medal of Honor recipients endorse something, people should pay attention,” said Rep. Thompson. “Colonel Howard is one of the most decorated soldiers in American history and he has earned the honor of having “Patriot Point” forever named in his honor. The Senate took this provision out after the House had acted. It's time to put it back in.” Colonel Robert Howard, a Green Beret, was awarded the Medal of Honor (the citation of which can be found here), the Distinguished Service Cross, a Silver Star, a Defense Superior Service Medal, four Bronze Stars for Valor, eight Purple Hearts, four Legion of Merit awards, three Meritorious Service Medals, and more than forty other awards and decorations for his service. Colonel Howard enlisted in the Army in 1956 at the age of 17 and served in the Army for 36 years. He served five tours (54 months) in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in the Army Special Forces and was wounded 14 times. After his retirement, Colonel Howard worked for the Department of Veterans Affairs, combining for more than 52 years of government service on behalf of veterans and members of the Armed Forces. During his retirement, he traveled to war zones to speak to and inspire troops several times during the current conflicts. Colonel Howard died of pancreatic cancer on December 23, 2009 at the age of 70, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery on February 22, 2010 with full military honors. When complete, the Patriot Point complex being developed at Ft. Bragg will be used by Army special operations units, including the 3rd Special Forces Group. In addition to the support of 21 Medal of Honor recipients, Thompson's provision is supported by the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA), the Military Order of the Purple Heart (MOPH), and the Non Commissioned Officers Association of the United States of America (NCOA).

11.16.2012	Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee today released the following statement after a bipartisan Ways and Means Committee meeting on the fiscal cliff. “People across our district and nation are counting on us to work together and find a way to avoid the fiscal cliff. After meeting with my Ways and Means colleagues from both sides of the aisle, and being briefed on leadership meetings at the White House, I am cautiously optimistic that we can find common ground and begin addressing our deficit challenges this year. “The fiscal cliff gives us an opportunity to put policies in place that will set our nation on a fiscally sustainable path. To get on this path, we need a balanced, long-term approach that focuses on three things. First, we need to invest in job creation. More jobs will mean more revenue to help get us out of the red. Second, we will have to take a hard look at all government programs and make sure taxpayers are getting the most bang for their buck. If a program isn't working or running efficiently, it needs to be cut or fixed. Defense cuts must also be on the table. A strong national defense doesn't have to be the most expensive national defense and there are cuts to be made that won't put a single American life at risk. Finally third, everyone must pay their fair share. We can't just cut our way out of the hole we're in. We cannot keep extending tax cuts to those who need them the least at the expense of our long-term fiscal sustainability. “Solving this challenge won't be easy but working together, I am confident that we can reach an agreement that is good for our nation's fiscal future, puts people to work, and protects Social Security and Medicare.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.12.2012	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means today released the following statement after a new Joint Committee on Taxation report showed that eliminating all of the itemized deductions in the tax code would only generate enough savings to reduce marginal tax rates by only 4 percent. The report highlights how the House Majority's tax plan - which calls for much deeper cuts in tax rates, to be offset by eliminating or reducing tax expenditures - would end up either harming middle- and lower-income families or blowing an even deeper hole in the deficit. Thompson: “The Republicans' tax plan simply does not add up. The nonpartisan congressional tax scorekeepers have run the numbers and it shows there are only two ways their plan can work: it will raise taxes on middle class families, or it will further explode the deficit. Neither option is acceptable. We need a tax reform plan that is balanced, focused on job creation, makes smart cuts and asks everyone to pay their fair share.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.01.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $777,690 Economic Development Administration Grant for the Shoreline Recreational Vehicle Park in Crescent City. The grant will fund the construction of water, sewer, roads, drainage and electrical infrastructure for the shoreline facility. “Tourism plays a huge role in Del Norte County's economy, and the Shoreline Park will be a lynchpin of our tourism economy for years to come,” said Thompson. “These funds will put folks to work making infrastructure improvements, and will support local tourism jobs.” Mayor Kathryn Murray stated, “The Shoreline RV Park plays a pivotal role in the tourism based economy for our region. Thousands of visitors come to the park every year infusing millions of dollars into the regional economy. Receiving these Economic Development Administration funds provides the city with an opportunity to update the infrastructure and provide the amenities today's visitor is looking for. The RV Park is at the end of its useful life and without this disaster relief funding the park would face closure. I cannot emphasize enough how important the Shoreline RV Park is to the regional economy and the health of our community. This is fantastic news.” This project is funded through the FY 2012 Disaster Relief Opportunity administered through the U.S. Economic Development Administration. Each disaster recovery investment is intended to support a community's long-term recovery, spur job creation, leverage private investment, and promote disaster resiliency. This funding will help the community recover, attract new businesses and put people back to work. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.21.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today introduced H.R. 6494, a bipartisan measure to honor Former Secretary of the Interior Stewart L. Udall with the Congressional Gold Medal for his years of public service. Secretary Udall was a champion for the environment and conservation, a civil rights activist, an advocate for Native American rights, and a supporter for the arts.“This is about making sure Secretary Udall receives the recognition he earned,” said Thompson. “He made our country a better place by protecting our lands for the future, enriching our lives with more access to fine arts, fought to desegregate our schools and communities, and advocated for our Native Americans. He earned this honor.” The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian award Congress can confer upon an individual. Stewart Udall dedicated his life of public service. He joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and was a B24 waist gunner in Italy during World War II. During that time, he flew more than 50 missions, earning him the Air Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters. After returning home and obtaining a law degree from the University of Arizona, Mr. Udall served four terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1960, President Kennedy appointed him as Secretary of the Interior, a position he held for eight years. During his cabinet career, Secretary Stewart Udall helped guide numerous landmark measures through Congress, including the Wilderness Act of 1964, the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1964, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Secretary Udall's worked influenced every state in the nation and continues to improve our natural resources to this day. Secretary Stewart Udall helped create some of our nation's most beautiful parks, monuments, and historic places. Some of these majestic landscapes include: - Point Reyes National Seashore - Whiskeytown-Shasta-Trinity National Recreation Area - John Muir National Historic Site, Canyonlands National Park - San Juan Island National Historic Park - Guadalupe Mountains National Park - Marble Canyon National Monument (now a part of the Grand Canyon National park) - Redwood National Park Secretary Udall's foresight in selecting these important landscapes has created landmarks that millions of visitors continue to visit today. During his cabinet career, Secretary Stewart Udall also fought against segregation. He successfully broke down barriers when he threatened to refuse the all-white Washington Redskins access to a new D.C. stadium, of which he was the Federal landlord. This was the first time in history when the federal government attempted to desegregate a professional sports team. After his cabinet career, Mr. Udall continued helping the American people by advocating for victims of radiation exposure, particularly Native Americans, resulting from the government's Cold War nuclear programs. As a private attorney in the 1970s and '80s, he won a 30-year battle to get Navajo uranium miners compensated for lung cancer incurred on the job. He also helped pass the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990. Secretary Udall passed away in 2010. Stewart Udall is the father of Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) and the uncle of Senator Mark Udall (D-CO). The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Financial Services. The bill has 45 cosponsors. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.20.2012	Today, U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Ted Poe (R-TX) introduced bipartisan legislation in support of an “all of the above” energy approach. The Master Limited Partnerships Parity Act will modify the federal tax code to make it easier and more attractive for private capital to invest in renewable energy. A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business that is taxed as a partnership but whose shares are traded like stock on a market. Because MLPs have access to capital at a lower cost and a more liquid financial approach, this makes them very attractive to private investment. Currently, only oil, natural gas, coal extraction, and pipeline projects are allowed to qualify for MLPs. This bill would simply amend the federal tax code to allow investment in renewable energy projects in the same way. “We need an all-the-above approach to America's energy future,” said Thompson. “This bill levels the playing field and frees up money for private investment in renewable energy. It will help us create jobs, strengthen our national security, reduce our dependency on foreign oil and move closer to energy independence.” “As recent studies have shown, it is entirely possible that North America could be 100% energy independent in the near future. One way to achieve this goal is to produce as much domestic energy as we can. This bill, along with increased domestic oil and gas production, helps us get closer to that goal and will create jobs in the process,” said Poe. Companion legislation, S. 3275, has been introduced in the Senate by Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.). This legislation is endorsed by Third Way, American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), Biomass Power Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), Advanced Biofuels Association, Offshore Wind Development Coalition, Advanced Ethanol Council and Environmental Entrepreneurs.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.17.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a Department of Transportation (DOT) grant of $67,940 for the Lampson Field Airport. This project will replace the airport's rotating beacon which has reached the end of its useful life. It will also install a perimeter and develop design alternatives for gate placement and fence line routing.“This grant is a win for Lakeport and Lake County,” said Thompson. “It will improve safety by helping guide planes in and out of Lampson Field, and create a more secure facility by deterring unauthorized persons and vehicles from entering onto the airfield.” "On behalf of our local residents, business owners, and pilots, I want to express my appreciation to Congressmen Thompson for his assistance in helping us secure funding for this beacon which will enhance public safety. Despite the fact that funding is limited, Mike continues to fight for his District," said Lake County Supervisor Anthony Farrington. The grant is provided through the DOT's Federal Aviation Administration. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.13.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a federal Food and Drug Administration grant of $70,000 for Lake County Environmental Health. The grant will be used for the evaluation of risk factors and the prevention of foodborne illnesses. “We have a responsibility to make sure safety standards for our food are met,” said Thompson. “This grant will give the dedicated officials at Lake County Environmental Health the resources they need to study risks and prevent foodborne illness. I am proud to have supported this funding, and will continue to support it in the future.” Since 2006 Lake County Environmental Health has been enrolled in the Voluntary National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards. These standards are a valuable tool for local agencies who work to ensure food safety and sanitation through permits and inspections of retail food establishment. However, a small rural jurisdiction operating a Retail Food Safety Program may not have resources available to implement a robust program that uses all of the National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards and their prescribed methodology. “We are looking forward to working with our federal agency partners on this exciting project,” said Jim Brown, Director of Lake County Health Services. “The grant funding allows us now to develop significant consumer protection with the extra cost not directly borne by local businesses.” With this federal grant, Lake County Environmental Health will be able to improve food safety by making further use of the National Retail Food Regulatory Program Standards and their prescribed methodology. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.13.2012	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) and Congresswoman Doris Matsui (CA-05) announced that the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) was one of six awardees nationally, and the only one in California, to receive a $1 million federal award through the Economic Development Administration's (EDA) 2012 i6 Challenge Grant. This grant will be used to create an AgTech Innovation Center that will connect ranchers and farmers with valuable resources to develop their businesses. “Agriculture is the economic backbone of so many of our communities in Northern California,” said Congressman Thompson. “This new innovation center, housed at one of California's top research universities, will allow our farmers and ranchers grow their businesses through the development of new technologies. And when farmers and ranchers grow their businesses, this grows our entire agriculture economy and creates new jobs.” “UC Davis is one of the top research universities in the nation, and I am pleased that this federal grant will help them develop their AgTech Innovation Center,” said Congresswoman Matsui. “Once built, this Center will have a profound impact on the region and the nation; linking our agriculture industry to innovative and new technologies that will sustain our nation's food supply, while fueling job creation and economic growth on farms and in rural communities across America.” The AgTech Innovation Center will connect stakeholders with valuable resources that focus on accelerating entrepreneurial thinking among farmers, ranchers, and researchers in the agricultural field, and develop a network of experts to support entrepreneurs and new ventures. In addition, the Center will create an AgEntrepreneurship Academy, which will help agriculture entrepreneurs identify market needs and opportunities, and create agriculture “food chain” clusters of innovation. “This is tremendous news,” said UC Davis Chancellor Linda P.

09.12.2012	NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, U.S. Army Vice Chief of Staff General J. Lloyd Austin, III and Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Gus Bilirakis, co-chairs of the Congressional Military Veterans Caucus today joined forces at a meeting hosted on Capitol Hill to discuss a collaborative, public-private effort to combat traumatic brain injury (TBI). Said Thompson, “Too many American heroes defending our nation overseas, and too many athletes who give their heart and soul to our nation's most popular sport are suffering from traumatic brain injuries. We need a public-private partnership that brings together the resources and best research to develop the technology and equipment needed to best prevent brain injury. Working together with leaders in Congress, the NFL and Army we can make smart investments in the kind of equipment and technology that will drastically reduce traumatic brain injury.” Said Bilirakis, “Head injuries are the signature - and oftentimes invisible - wounds of war. They are not a sign of weakness or a character flaw, but rather the catalyst of other more serious illnesses, including Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Through advancements in research, diagnostics and treatment, we hope to learn more about head injuries and how we can better diagnose and treat our service members and athletes both on and off the field. I would like to thank NFL Commissioner Goodell, U.S. Army General Austin, my fellow Members of the Military Veterans' Caucus and the Brain Injury Task Force for their participation in this effort. I look forward to working with them as we work toward these common goals.” Said Commissioner Goodell, "We appreciate the leadership of Reps. Thompson and Bilirakis and the participation of General Austin and two dozen members of Congress. Working together we can lead in raising awareness on this issue that affects players in all sports, our men and women in the armed forces, and the broader public." Said General Austin, "We have made great strides in recent years in our efforts to better prevent, diagnose and treat traumatic brain injuries. TBI affects a significant portion of our population, and not just within our military ranks or among professional athletes, but across society as a whole. What we do know is that with proper physical and mental rest, the vast majority of individuals who experience a TBI will fully recover. And so, our goal is to continue to educate folks and to pursue the kinds of partnerships, like the one we share with the NFL, that will lead to further advances sooner in the areas of research, science & technology and treatment methods. The outcomes will benefit our servicemen and women, athletes at all levels and the approximately 1.7 million people in the U.S. who sustain a traumatic brain injury each year." Between 2000 and 2012 more than 244,000 service members have been diagnosed with TBI. Outside of the military, nearly 2 million people across our country suffer a TBI each year, including NFL players and athletes of all ages in all sports.

09.11.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today testified on HR 4969, the California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act of 2012 in front of the House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests & Public Lands. Thompson was joined by Merita Whatley from Mendocino County in testifying before the committee. Whatley is the manager of the Point Arena Lighthouse and a core member of the Point Arena Merchants Association. “Preserving the Point Arena-Stornetta public lands is a win for our environment and our economy,” said Thompson. “The bill will help our travel and tourism economy, an industry that supports 5,000 jobs in Mendocino County. It will also permanently protect this wonderful stretch of coast for future generations of Americans to enjoy.” In her written testimony, Whatley stated, “Our small businesses are still thriving partly due to the large number of visitors coming to visit Point Arena Lighthouse and to experience the natural beauty of Stornetta Public Lands. We need a visitor's information kiosk for education and interpretation, more adequate parking, restrooms, and a ranger on duty to help protect the sensitive habitat areas. We need further surveys to determine means of protecting endangered plant and wildlife on the Lands. Managing these sensitive lands as part of the California Coastal National Monument, as HR 4969 does, will address the most fundamental of these needs and help ensure that future generations will be able to enjoy this area as we do today.” After the hearing is held, the next step is for the bill to be voted on by the full Committee on Natural Resources. It would then be available for a vote by the full House of Representatives.Please find Thompson's full testimony below. Thank you Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, and subcommittee members for holding this hearing on H.R. 4969, the California Coastal National Monument Expansion Act. The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands along the Mendocino County Coast in Northern California are a national treasure. This section of coast is not only one of the most breathtakingly beautiful areas I have ever seen, it is also a major contributor to the local economy, ecologically important, and would be a vital addition to the California Coastal National Monument. The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands border the City of Point Arena, a picturesque small town just a few hours north of the San Francisco Bay area. Traveling this short distance transports you from city streets to tide pools, waterfalls, and blowholes. The view of people, cars, and houses is replaced by wild landscape of endangered butterflies, salmon, Tundra swans, and harbor seals. This pristine area is beloved by the surrounding community and yearly visitors. Travel and tourism are responsible for the largest job sector in Mendocino County. Visitors come from around the world to experience the unique wildlife, landscape, and breathtaking coastline this area of California has to offer, supporting more than 5,000 jobs earning over $114 million a year. These visitors also contribute approximately $19 million in state and local taxes. As traditional jobs in timber and fishing industries decline, these public lands become even more important to ensure that close to 2 million annual visitors continue to come to Mendocino County each year. H.R. 4969 not only helps the economy in Northern California, but also protects an ecologically important area. For example, salmon and steelhead trout spawn in the waters of the Garcia River and migratory waterfowl stopover in the neighboring wetlands. Designating these public lands as a national monument has unprecedented public support and has truly been a grassroots effort. Twenty letters of support have been received from local cities, Mendocino County, the local chambers of commerce, tourist and merchants associations, the Manchester Band of Pomo Indians, and a number of local and national environmental groups. I ask that I be able to submit these letters as part of the committee's record. In addition, both of California's Senators and the two California State Assemblymen who represent this area also support this designation. Perhaps most impressive is a petition of over 750 supporters from the area, throughout the country, and around the world. H.R. 4969 is something the local community and even global visitors want. Of the land included in H.R. 4969, 1,255 acres are already owned by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The remaining 400 acres have been prioritized in the FY 2013 budget by BLM for purchase from a single landowner who fully supports this effort. Expanding the California Coastal National Monument to include the Point Arena-Stornetta lands is a win for the economy, a win for the environment, and a win for the people who will enjoy this area for generations to come. Thank you and I welcome any questions you may have.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today introduced H.R. 6362, the Revitalizing the Economy of Fisheries (REFI) in the Pacific Act of 2012. The bipartisan legislation will help alleviate financial hardship that North Coast fishermen are facing due to loan repayments on the 2003 Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery buyback loan, and ultimately retain fishery jobs and those associated with the fishery including crew members, ship yards, boat mechanics, seafood processors, dock workers, small business owners and others who depend on the fishing industry. Currently, commercial groundfish fishing on Pacific Coast generates more than $90 million in income and supplies more than 3,000 total full and part-time jobs.“Our commercial fishers have been diligently repaying their loans, but in these tough times the loan repayments are making it nearly impossible for our commercial fisherman to stay in business,” said Thompson. “The fishing industry is at the heart of our local economy, and if we do not begin to address this problem, there is a real possibility that our small boat fishers, and the businesses that depend on them, will see even greater economic harm. This legislation will save Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery nearly $2 million per year, allowing more money to be spent on local businesses that support commercial fishing operations and fisherman. Not only will this save local jobs, it will help create jobs.” “This is the type of legislation that the groundfish fishery has been looking for. It's clear that Representative Thompson understands the needs of fishermen and we are grateful for his leadership on this extremely important issue,” said Michelle Norvell, Project Manager of the Ft. Bragg Groundfish Association. “This legislation will have a positive impact on all participants in the Pacific Coast Groundfish fishery but most significantly on the traditional small family fishing operation and historic fishing ports where the groundfish fishery is the mainstay for other fisheries. The strength of this legislation is that it resonates well with fishery participants and stakeholders along the west coast, it responds to the immediate needs of the groundfish fishery, and it's a win for everyone because it aims to preserve jobs and boost the economy.” In 2003, Congress authorized a $35.7 million buyback loan to the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery to help the commercial fishing industry after a collapse in fish stocks. These buyback loans are designed to help prevent or end overfishing, rebuild stocks of fish and improve the conservation and management of the fishery. Those fishermen who remained in the fishery have been tasked with repaying the buyback loan. However, while the fishermen have diligently been paying back the loan plus interest, the fees are proving too much for the small businesses to pay and remain in business. The REFI Pacific Act would help alleviate this financial hardship by: - Extend the loan repayment period from 30 years to 45 years; - Guarantee that the debt obligation paid by the fisherman will not exceed 3% of the offloaded value of all the fish harvested, rather than the current 5% fee; and - Allow the loan to be financed at current interest rates. Cumulatively, the overall value of the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery increased in 2011 to approximately $55 million under the program established though the original buyback loan. The money saved from this new loan will allow for more money to be spent on local businesses that support commercial fishing operations and fisherman. The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources. The bill has ten cosponsors.

09.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced two federal Department of Transportation (DOT) Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants totaling $3,345,306 for Del Norte County Regional Airport, Jack McNamara Field in Crescent City. “Jack McNamara Field Airport is an economic hub for Crescent City and the North Coast,” said Thompson. “These grants will help create jobs, improve our local economy and make the airport safer for passengers and planes.” The first grant of $1,362,523 will be used to complete final design and permitting on a replacement terminal facility. A new terminal building is needed to replace the existing undersized facility. The existing terminal is a 62 year old concrete block and modular structure that is not large enough to meet current passenger and Transportation Security Administration needs. This phase of the project will complete the engineering design through construction drawings and permitting, making the project shovel ready, for the new building and associated infrastructure. The second grant of $1,982,783 will be used for runway safety improvements. The existing runway safety area does not meet Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards and needs to be graded and filled in order to meet current standards and improve safety. This grant will fund the final engineering design and permitting for the airport infrastructure project. Airport Director, Jim Bernard stated, “These two capital improvement projects have been #1 and #2 on the airport's “to-do list” for some time. These two grants will complete the design and environmental permitting for these two projects, making them shovel-ready for construction funding beginning in 2013." The grants are provided through the DOT's Federal Aviation Administration, Airport Improvement grant program. These FAA AIP grants are funded from existing aviation ticket and fuel taxes.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.05.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced $750,000 in new Drug-Free Communities Support Program (DFC) grants to coalitions in California's First Congressional District. The six coalitions who were awarded funding are Action Network with Across Ages and Cultures Prevention Coalition in Gualala, the Anderson Valley Community Action Coalition in Boonville, the Coalition for Gang Awareness and Prevention in Fort Bragg, Laytonville Head Start in Laytonville, Catalyst Coalition, a program at the Napa County Office of Education, and the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drug Prevention Coalition in Eureka. Each coalition will receive $125,000 in DFC grant funds to involve and engage the local community to prevent substance use among youth.“These grants will help make sure that in our district we have healthy kids and drug-free communities,” said Thompson. “This funding will help save lives and allow these organizations to mobilize and organize our community around the goal of preventing youth substance use.” “America's success is in the 21st century depends in part on our ability to help young people make decisions that will keep them healthy and safe,” said Gil Kerlikowske, Director of National Drug Control Policy. “We congratulate this coalition on its work to raise a generation of young people equipped to remain drug free and ready to prosper in school, in their communities, and in the workplace. While law enforcement efforts will always serve a vital role in keeping our communities safe, we know that stopping drug use before it ever begins is always the smartest and most cost-effective way to reduce drug use and its consequences.” The DFC Program was created by the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997, and reauthorized by Congress in 2001 and 2006. Since 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has awarded more than 2,000 Drug-Free Communities grants to local communities in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, Palau, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. A new drug control strategy released by the Obama Administration in April outlines specific actions to be undertaken by the Federal Government to reform U.S. drug policy through innovative and evidence-based public health and safety approaches, which include expanding access to drug treatment and recovery support programs, breaking the cycle of drug use, crime, and incarceration, and supporting youth outreach programs that prevent drug use before it begins.

09.05.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced an agreement between the United States Coast Guard (USCG) and the City of Ferndale to keep the Mendocino Lighthouse Lens in Ferndale. Later this month, the USCG is going to begin the process of dismantling and storing the lens. The city will then build an artifact exhibit at the Ferndale Museum. The city will also raise funds to reassemble, stabilize and partially restore the Fresnel lens. Once the funds are obtained and the exhibit is built, the city will obtain a 25-year loan, renewable upon mutual consent. Thompson, the USCG, and City of Ferndale have worked on finding a solution that keeps the lens in Ferndale for years. “The Ferndale lens is an iconic and historic maritime landmark,” said Thompson. “After years of hard work and compromise, I am pleased to announce that our lens will remain at home in the city of Ferndale.” "The Save Our Lens group is a true reflection of the nature of this tiny community," said Ferndale City Manager Jay Parrish. "To raise $100,000 to keep the Cape Mendocino lens in Ferndale, where it has true historical context and has been taken care of for more than 64 years, shows the commitment of Ferndale to safekeeping its history and important artifacts. We thank Congressmen Thompson for helping us retain this priceless piece of history and we are certain that we will be successful in raising additional funds to place the Cape Mendocino lens in a world-class setting that truly reflects the value this important artifact holds to so many." The First Order Fresnel Lens was built in 1868. It went on to become the Cape Mendocino lighthouse lens, which stood southwest of Ferndale from 1868 until 1948, safeguarding the hundreds of ships destined to Ferndale. Prior to the building of the lighthouse, a steamer known as the Northern struck a submerged rock on January 6, 1860. This is one of the most catastrophic shipwrecks that had occurred before the lighthouse was built. Seventeen passengers and 21 crew members lost their lives. The ship used the last of her steam to get to Centerville Beach (near Ferndale) where the 65 people still on board were rescued. Following World War II, the lighthouse was automated and the Fresnel lens was removed. A rotating aerobeacon was placed in the lantern room in place of the lens. On December 24, 1948 the United States Coast Guard lent the lens to the City of Ferndale. The lens was dismantled in 1949, a replica lighthouse was built, and the lens was put on display in the replica lighthouse. Over time, the lens has begun to deteriorate. Starting in December of 2006, the USCG and the city of Ferndale have been engaged on several levels in an effort to craft a long-term agreement to care, house and preserve the lens. The Fresnel lens was invented by French physicist Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1822. This new feature, designed like a glass beehive, revolutionized lighthouses along North American and European coasts. Before the invention of the Fresnel lens, an open flame was used to project light onto the ocean horizon to alert ships of the coastline. At the time, up to 97 percent of the light was lost and was not very effective. The Fresnel lens design allowed all but 17 percent of light to be captured, allowing for the warning to reach vessels more than 20 miles from shore.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

08.29.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), joined by veterans, local leaders and United States Postal Service (USPS) officials today officially renamed the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office the “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building.” “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz was an American hero, a courageous man and a resident of the Yountville Veterans Home,” said Thompson. “And so, today it is my honor to officially, and forever name our veterans home's postal facility the â€˜Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building.'” Thompson introduced legislation in November to honor Alejandro R. Ruiz Sr., a Medal of Honor winner who spent his career in the U.S. Army and served in World War II. After retirement, Ruiz lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, located in Napa County, California, until he passed away in 2009 at the age of 85. “We are grateful for Congressman Thompson's vigilance on ensuring this post office remains open and we are delighted to honor PFC Ruiz in this renaming ceremony,” said Robin Umberg, CalVet Undersecretary for Veterans Homes. “PFC Ruiz will be forever memorialized on our Yountville campus.” “With this special dedication ceremony, we are paying tribute to a man who gave of himself for his country and his comrades in arms,” said Jack Boster, Manager of Post Office Operations for the Bay Valley District. “The fact that a brave American soldier's name will go on this post office, a post office that is the cornerstone of the community where people and veterans from the hospital come to connect with others through the mail, is very fitting.” On April 28, 1945, Private First Class Ruiz was deployed to Okinawa. While patrolling in a ravine, his unit was ambushed by heavy and camouflaged machine gun fire. Every soldier except Ruiz and his squad leader was killed or injured. With his entire unit pinned down, Ruiz grabbed an automatic rifle and started his solo charge on the bunker. When he reached the bunker his rifle misfired. After beating back enemy soldiers he quickly ran back to where his unit was pinned down to retrieve another weapon. On his second charge towards the bunker he was shot in the leg by enemy fire. By himself he eliminated 12 enemy soldiers and saved the lives of the platoon members. Thompson's bill, H.R. 3004, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 260 California Drive in Yountville, California, as the "Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building" was signed by the President on May 15th, 2012. Thompson's legislation was cosponsored by the other 52 members of the California Congressional Delegation, and both California Senators supported the bill. Ruiz was born in Loving, New Mexico to Mexican immigrants. Of the 3,400 Medals of Honor that Presidents of the United States have awarded, only 44 have been awarded to someone of Hispanic descent. Of the 55,000 residents to have lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, only five have been awarded the Medal of Honor.

08.28.2012	Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-1) today led a bipartisan group of 22 U.S. Representatives in calling on House Leadership to require that every American flag purchased by the Federal Government be manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent grown, produced or manufactured in the United States. Currently the Federal Government is not required to buy American made flags. “Every American flag our government buys should be made in America, by American workers with American materials,” said Thompson. “It is a slap in the face to all Americans to have their tax dollars spent on U.S. flags that are made overseas.” In a letter sent to House Leadership, Thompson requested that language be included in the legislation to fund the federal government into Fiscal Year 2013 that mandates all U.S. flags purchased by the federal government to be made in America, by American workers, using American-grown and manufactured materials. The proposal is supported by Vietnam Veterans of America and the American Legion. “The American Legion fully supports this effort and we appreciate Mike Thompson's leadership in addressing this critical issue that is important to America's service members, veterans and their families,” said Fang A. Wong, National Commander with the American Legion. “Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) strongly supports Congressman Thompson's efforts to work across the aisle to make sure that all American flags purchased by or through the federal government be entirely made in the United States of materials made in the United States,” said Rick Weidman, VVA Executive Director for Policy & Government Affairs. There is already precedent for placing restrictions on the purchase of American-made American flags. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase American made flags for serivcemembers' funerals. The full text of Thompson's letter is below. August 27, 2012 The Honorable John Boehner Speaker of the House House of Representatives H-232 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Eric Cantor Majority Leader House of Representatives H-329 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Democratic Leader House of Representatives H-204 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Steny H. Hoyer Democratic Whip House of Representatives H-148 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Cantor, Leader Pelosi, and Whip Hoyer: We request that you include language into the Continuing Resolution to fund the federal government into Fiscal Year 2013 to require all U.S. flags purchased by the federal government to be made in America, by American workers, using American-grown and manufactured materials. Wherever an American flag is flown, it is a symbol of the freedoms men and women throughout our history have marched, fought and died to secure. There is no greater symbol of our country, our unity, our freedom, and our liberty than our flag. There is precedent to implement these requirements - the Department of Veterans Affairs is already required, by law, to purchase 100 percent American-made flags of American-made materials to drape the casket of each deceased veteran. We believe that it is important that every American flag the federal government buys should be made in America, by American works, and with American materials; and urge that language to this effect be included in legislation funding the federal government for FY2013. At a time when our domestic manufacturing sector is struggling and millions in our country are out of work, it is a slap in the face to all Americans to have their tax dollars spent on U.S. flags that are made overseas. Thank you for your consideration to this matter. We look forward to working with you.

07.27.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means today, with other Ways and Means Democrats announced the introduction of H.R. 6182, the American Advanced Energy Manufacturing Jobs Act of 2012. The legislation provides a 30 percent investment tax credit to businesses that purchase equipment that is used to manufacture components of clean energy projects such as solar panels and wind turbines in the U.S. “This energy tax credit will help make sure energy products like solar panels and wind turbines are made in America by American workers,” said Thompson. “Adding incentives for companies to produce energy products domestically is good for our economy, environment and national security. It will create jobs, reduce our dependence on foreign oil and move us towards energy independence.” “The 48C advanced energy manufacturing tax credit provides a direct incentive to manufacture advanced energy products like solar panels and wind turbines here in the United States and keeps the American renewable energy industry globally competitive,” said Ways and Means Ranking Member Sander Levin (D-MI), a co-sponsor of Thompson's legislation. This bill extends and expands the 48C advanced manufacturing tax credit. It will uncap the credit for certain advanced manufacturing -- solar, fuel cell, battery - and provide a $3 billion capped credit for other manufacturing. The tax credit program helps increase U.S. clean energy manufacturing projects and expands manufacturing capacity to supply the world with U.S. made parts and equipment. More manufacturing facilities will also support significant growth in exports of US manufactured clean energy products. Not only have these clean energy tax credits helped increase domestic production of clean energy, but they have supported an expansion of clean energy technologies made in the United States. By some estimates, today 60 percent of the wind turbines in the United States along with component parts that power them (like towers, blades, gears, ball bearings and electrical switches) are made in America, more than doubling the 25 percent in 2005. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means.

07.25.2012	Today, several U.S. Representatives from northern California responded to the unveiling of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). The representatives have been vocal in their opposition to any BDCP agreement that is not based on sound science and will likely cause economic and environmental harm to the Bay-Delta and northern California. The coalition of representatives have repeatedly called on the U.S. Department of the Interior to include the input of the Bay-Delta communities, demanding a seat at the table as the BDCP has moved forward. Today, Governor Jerry Brown and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced that they intend to move forward with construction of a massive tunnel system underneath the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, ultimately shipping water south and economically and environmentally devastating the region. The members of Congress rejected the proposal by criticizing the void of scientific support as well as the utter lack of regard for current and future water rights for northern California.“Today's proposed Bay Delta Conservation Plan missed a golden opportunity to develop sound water policy, instead choosing politics over science. It will cost jobs, harm our environment and is a bad deal for Northern California,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena). “All that we've insisted on is that any BDCP be based on sound science. Given the announced preferred alternative, this was apparently too much to ask. Before making irreversible decisions, we need a transparent, comprehensive and impartial discussion, with all stakeholders at the table, on how this would impact the farmers, fishers and businesses that depend on the Delta for their livelihoods. Today's announcement ignores the needs of Northern California and will devastate our economy.” “For years, I have been fighting against water exportation that would hurt our community. This BDCP plan is a travesty for northern California and will decimate our region, costing millions of dollars and thousands of jobs. This development is a huge breach of the public trust. Governor Brown and Secretary Salazar have shown today that they have little regard for the people of San Joaquin County. The families, farmers, and small business owners in northern California stand to have their livelihoods destroyed. This will have ruinous consequences for our local economy at a time when we already struggle with record unemployment,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-Stockton). “I am troubled by the tone of today's announcement,” said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez). “If â€˜getting it done' means cutting corners, leaving out details, and getting ahead of the science, we're not actually getting anything done - we're just getting into a trap. There are parts of this proposal that are encouraging and are a step forward from previous efforts, but even after this morning's announcement there's a lot of work left to be done before any final decisions can be made. This process has to engage in the hard work of science - not just leap ahead before we know the impacts of this plan on the health and economy of the Bay-Delta and the communities that depend on it. Keep in mind what is at stake here - a badly designed plan can harm drinking water supplies, further endanger California's salmon runs, and ruin the economic livelihood of tens of thousands in the fishing and related industries up and down our coast.” “To solve California's water issues, northern California must be part of the decision making process. Unfortunately we were not. Imagine if San Francisco decided to build the Golden Gate Bridge without consulting Marin County? The 9,000 cfs facility being proposed is simply not acceptable. It will cause massive impacts in the Sacramento area and suck our river dry. There are still a lot of unaddressed issues, and it is my sincere hope they will be addressed before any BDCP moves forward,” said Rep. Doris O. Matsui (D-Sacramento). “This proposal will also put at risk Senior Water rights that Sacramento County and the Delta region hold. As the member of Congress that represents the Sacramento region, â€˜home' of the project's massive infrastructure, I can tell you there are no benefits to Sacramento, only negative impacts.” “If the State rushes to build a 9,000 cfs water project without doing the science on how it would divert the river, then the Delta will suffer, and farming and fishing jobs that depend on it will be lost. California fishermen and fisherwomen are just recovering from three years of disaster, and now a 50-year permit is being rushed for water contractors for a project that would sell Northern California communities down the river. A plan this reckless will not succeed,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (D-San Mateo). “Today I flew back to California to make it clear to state and federal lawmakers where I stand: the 9,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) conveyance facility being proposed could wreak havoc on the Delta and the jobs it sustains and put existing water rights in the Delta and Northern California at risk,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Fairfield). “It is possible for California to solve its water problems, but the Delta and Northern California counties must be at the table, and it will take a comprehensive, multifaceted approach, not just a piece of plumbing in the Delta. We must address the needs of all Californians by prioritizing storage, conservation, recycling, levee improvements, and habitat restoration. A BDCP without these elements is incomplete at best.” Link to video footage of today's press conference: https://youtu.be/01AwRfzEajo.###
07.19.2012	Today, U.S. Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Paul Gosar (R-AZ) introduced H.R. 6154, The Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act, bi-partisan legislation that streamlines permitting for renewable energy projects on public lands. “By streamlining renewable energy projects on public lands, we can reduce our dependency on foreign oil and put Californians back to work,” said Thompson. “This bill is good for our economy, our national security and our environment. It will spur job growth, grow our energy sector, support conservation and help us pay down our deficit.” “Western states like Arizona contain millions of acres of public lands that are suitable for economic development, but bureaucracy is standing in the way,” said Gosar. “As a true supporter of an all-of-the-above energy approach, I am putting forth these common sense reforms to expand renewable energy production. We can get rural Arizona back on track by facilitating job creation, protecting recreational and tourism areas, and paying down our country's deficit.” Currently, obtaining permits for renewable projects on public lands can take years. The Public Lands Renewable Energy Development Act makes it easier for industry to develop by establishing a straightforward process that treats renewable energy similar to traditional sources of energy development like oil and gas. Additionally, the legislation establishes royalty rates that encourages production, ensures a return for the taxpayer, and maximizes energy generation. Specifically, the revenues sales from projects are divided by dispersing: - 25% to the county(ies) in which a project is located; - 25% to the state in which a project is located; - 15% for a renewable energy permit processing fund; - 25% to a fund to support conservation; and - 10% to deficit reduction in the federal budget. Since public lands are not taxable, this bill will allow state and local governments to have a share of the revenues from the sales of energy production on lands within their borders. These dollars will help local governments deliver services and develop capital improvement projects such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement. The bill was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources, Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. Thompson and Gosar's bill is co-sponsored by Mike Coffman (R-CO), Jim Costa (D-CA), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Cathy McMorris Rogers (R-WA), Jared Polis (D-CO), Michael Simpson (R-ID) and Scott Tipton (R-CO). Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and sits on the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
07.19.2012	Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-1) today secured a bipartisan agreement to require that every American flag purchased by the DOD to be 100 percent manufactured in the United States, from articles, materials, or supplies that are 100 percent of grown, produced or manufactured in the United States. Currently the DOD is not required to buy American made flags. “Every American flag the DOD buys should be made in America, by American workers with American products,” said Thompson. “At a time when our manufacturing sector is struggling and millions in our country are out of work, it is a slap in the face to all Americans to have their tax dollars spent on U.S. flags that are made overseas.” The commitment came during a discussion on the House floor during consideration of H.R. 5856, Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013, when Chairman C.W. Bill Young (R-FL) and Ranking Member Norm Dicks (D-WA) of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense agreed to address this issue and ensure that the Department of Defense only purchase American-made American flags in the final version of the defense funding bill. The agreement is supported by Vietnam Veterans of America and the American Legion. “The American Legion fully supports this agreement and we appreciate Mike Thompson's leadership in addressing this critical issue that is important to America's service members, veterans and their families,” said Fang A. Wong, National Commander with the American Legion. “Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) strongly supports Congressman Thompson's efforts to work across the aisle to make sure that all American flags purchased by or through the Department of Defense (DOD) or any element of DOD must purchase only flags entirely made in the United States of materials made in the United States,” said Rick Weidman, VVA Executive Director for Policy & Government Affairs. There is already precedent for placing restrictions on the purchase of American-made American flags. Currently, the Department of Veterans Affairs is required to only purchase American made flags for serivcemembers' funerals.

07.18.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), co-chair of the bipartisan Military Veterans Caucus, today again secured the passage of his bipartisan amendment with Congressman Pete Sessions (TX-32) to expedite new and innovative treatments to our nations' veterans and active duty soldiers suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). This is the second time the House has passed the amendment. In May, the TBI treatment expansion initiative was adopted as a House amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 4310), however the Senate has yet to take up this bill. Today it was passed as an amendment to H.R. 5856, the Department of Defense (DOD) Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013. The amendment passed by voice vote. The House will vote on H.R. 5856 later this week. “Our troops and veterans have earned the very best treatment and care that we can provide,” said Thompson. “But sometimes the best treatments aren't available at military and veteran medical facilities. My amendment will make sure that our heroes who return from combat with TBI or PTSD have access to the highest quality care our nation has to offer. I will keep introducing this legislation until it is law. It's what our heroes have earned.” “I am pleased that our colleagues have joined us in recognizing the importance of providing treatment options not currently available within military and veteran medical facilities to those who return from combat with TBI or PTSD,” said Sessions. “As we approach the Memorial Day holiday, I believe we can best honor our nation's active duty soldiers and veterans by ensuring that their health is a top priority and that they have access to the most effective treatments available.” "The bi-partisan Amendment offered by Congressman Thompson and Congressman Sessions will provide additional resources to the VA and DoD to formally collaborate with non-government organizations, such as The Pathway Home in Yountville, to provide timely, cost-effective and quality alternative treatment to veterans who have symptoms of PTSD and TBI," said Fred Gusman, Executive Director of the Pathway Home in Yountville. Between 2000 an 2011 more than 230,000 service members have been diagnosed with TBI. Up to 18 percent of U.S. military personnel returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD symptoms. Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment amendment creates a new five-year $10 million pilot program that allows military patients to receive treatment from health care facilities outside of the VA that are utilizing an array of leading-edge, successful therapies to treat TBI and PTSD. Physicians and residential treatment centers like The Pathway Home may qualify for payment from the Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs through a “pay-for-performance” plan, meaning they must prove that a patient has experienced demonstrable improvement. Treatment and reimbursement safeguards in the amendment ensure access to innovative private treatments while reserving payment only for treatments that work. To reach the long-term objective of incorporating leading-edge medical practices into military hospitals, Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the program. It also requires a report on how each Department Secretary plans to integrate successful methods into their own medical facilities, encouraging a constant flow of new and innovative treatments.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

07.13.2012	Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1) today spoke at a Boy Scouts Summit on the on Eagle Scout's 100-Year Anniversary. Please find Thompson's remarks as prepared for delivery below: Thank you. Let's give a hand to all the past and present Scouts here today. Also, how about Scout parents? Let's give them hand. Scouting is a family commitment. Nowhere is that more clear then with the family I met this week in Washington - the LeRoys. Stephan is an Eagle Scout. His dad is an Eagle Scout. And, his twin brother is an Eagle Scout. But whether you have 1 scout in the family or 3, it takes a commitment of support. 2012 marks an important milestone for the Boy Scouts of America. 100 years ago, in 1912 a young man from Brooklyn, New York named of Arthur Eldred was awarded the rank of Eagle Scout. He was the first person to ever receive this recognition. Now, as we mark the Eagle Scouts 100-year anniversary, more than 2 million scouts have earned this coveted rank. It is truly a high-honor. Fewer than 4 percent of scouts earn the distinction. I work with many Eagle Scouts on a daily basis. 29 Members of Congress are Eagle Scouts. This is a pretty impressive number when you consider that only 17 Members of Congress are doctors. Less than 30 are farmers and ranchers. And, only 4 are Peace Corps Volunteers. Throughout this past century, Eagle Scouts have been impressive and gone on to become Olympians, surgeons, civil rights leaders, Pulitzer Prize winners, captains of industry and business, and Congressman and Senators. Many are household names: - Before Gerald Ford was President of the United States, he was an Eagle Scout. - Before Sam Walton founded Wal-Mart, he was an Eagle Scout. - Before Robert Gates was Secretary of Defense, he was an Eagle Scout. - Before James Lovell captained Apollo 13, he was an Eagle Scout. These are names we've heard in the news or learned about in school. But it's also important to remember the tens of thousands of Eagle Scouts who've made enormous contributions but aren't in the history books. One of those names that I'll never forget is the young man I mentioned before - Stefan LeRoy. I met him Wednesday at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington DC. Private First Class Stefan LeRoy is an Eagle Scout who grew up in Santa Rosa. He went to Maria Carrillo High, enrolled at Cal Ploy and became active in their ROTC program. After his freshman year he made the decision to serve his country and become a member of the 82nd Airborne Division. He was stationed in Kandahar. On June 7th while on patrol, his unit was struck by an IED. After the initial blast, Stefan saw a young father from Georgia being carried on a stretcher to a helicopter. He knew his fellow soldier needed help. And so, even knowing that IEDs were in the area, he rushed over his side. He lost both his legs in an attempt to help that young father from Georgia. There is a quote I read from Stefan in our local paper that really epitomizes his character. “You're not going to stop doing something because there might be an IED out there,” Stephen said. “You have to do what you have to do to help your buddies.” This is the character of an Eagle Scout. I asked Stefan what he wanted me to tell you today. First, he said to tell you he says hi. He also said to tell you that Eagle Scouts prepared him better than anything else for what he does, and what he's gone through. He said, “Army training was good, but Eagle Scout training was better.” For scouts, being awarded the rank of Eagle Scout marks the achievement of a major goal. And for most, it is one of the first steps to what Robert Gates once called “the most important goal of all: becoming a good man - a man of integrity and decency, a man of moral courage, a man unafraid of hard work, a man of strong character - the kind of person who built this country and made it into the greatest democracy and the greatest economic powerhouse in the history of the world.” The fate of our nation, and the fate of the free world, depends in large part on the kinds of leaders our young people prove to be. At a time when our nation faces enormous challenges both at home and overseas, we need leaders with the kind of moral compass that's instilled through the Scouts. Eagle Scouts know how to meet challenges and overcome obstacles. Every single Eagle Scout is required to earn merit badges for first aid, camping, personal fitness, emergency preparedness or lifesaving, swimming, hiking or cycling. Eagle Scouts know the importance of community service and civic engagement. Every Eagle Scout must plan, organize, lead, manage and complete a service project that benefits an organization outside of the Boy Scouts - and they have to do it before their 18th birthday. This is important to a young man's journey to becoming an Eagle Scout, and it's also important to our communities. Last year alone, Eagle Scout projects represented nearly 7 million hours of community service. Every one of those hours benefited a community. And finally, Eagle Scouts are prepared to live lives of high, moral character. They are required to earn merit badges for Citizenship in the Community, Nation and World. Eagle Scouts volunteer, donate to charities, vote and work with others to better their community. They embody and develop lifelong values - values such as duty, loyalty, honor, kindness and respect. They share the values with others. They are mentors and role models. So, Eagle Scouts are men who know how to meet challenges, men who know the importance of helping others, men of strong moral character. They are men like Private First Class Stefan LeRoy who put his own well being aside, and rushed to a friend and soldier's side. They are men like Neal Armstrong whose one giant step for mankind captivated the imagination of our nation. Men like Steven Spielberg, who not only won three Academy Awards but also used his talent to direct movies that addressed difficult historical subjects such as the Holocaust, slavery and war. His movies catapulted these events into our national conscience, educated us on the past and provided our nation and the world with a forum for moral contemplation. His work spurred conversation and consideration about where we've been - and where we go. Men like Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer who is a strong and consistent voice for our constitution and founding values. Men like Earnest Green, one of the Little Rock Nine. Three years after Brown v. Board of Education integrated public schools, the governor of Arkansas still refused to let African Americans into Little Rock Central High School. It took the 101st Airborne and President Eisenhower to get the Little Rock Nine trough the school house doors. It wasn't safe and it wasn't made easy, but in 1958 Eagle Scout Earnest Green became the first black student to graduate from Little Rock Central High. They are men like Army Staff Sgt. Jesse Lawrence Williams. Jesse, whose father Herb I mentioned earlier, gave his life in service to our country while serving in Iraq. He received a Purple Heart, and he single-handedly pulled two fellow soldiers from a burning vehicle, earning him a Bronze Star. They are the kind of people our nation needs leading our businesses, communities and country. Let's give them our support. It's an investment that will pay off. Thank you. ###
07.11.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today voted against H.R. 6079, the Patients' Rights Repeal Act. This legislation was the House Majority's 31st bill in the last 18 months to repeal all or parts of the Affordable Care Act. The repeal of health care reform would end patient protections and raise health care costs for millions of Americans. The bill passed the House by a vote of 244-185. It will now go to the Senate. The Senate is not expected to pass the bill and the President has said he would veto the legislation if it reached his desk. “Today the House took its 31st vote to repeal all or part of health care reform,” said Thompson. “Health care reform was in response to a national crisis. Businesses and individuals couldn't afford health care. Hospitals, doctors, and clinics provided billions in uncompensated care and those costs were then passed on to consumers. So, we passed legislation that saves money, saves lives and provides access to quality, affordable health care. Instead of staging these political games and voting to return to this national crisis, we should be strengthening the reforms made to our health care system and focusing on getting people back to work.” In California's 1st Congressional District: - More than 6,000 seniors in the “donut hole” have received prescription drug discounts worth more than $3 million dollars. That is an average of more than $500 per senior. Also, under Medicare, seniors now receive a free annual wellness visit and important preventive services, such as mammograms and colonoscopies. Nationally, more than 16 million have taken advantage of this provision in the first six months of 2012. - Women can no longer be dropped by their insurance company if they become pregnant. - Young adults can now join or stay on their parents' health plan until their 26th birthday, if they do not have coverage of their own. 7,600 young adults in the First District now have health insurance because of this change. - Children younger than age 19 can no longer be denied coverage by an insurance company for having a pre-existing condition. In the First district, 37,000 children with pre-existing conditions are now protected from discrimination. - Small business owners can receive tax credits if they choose to offer coverage to their employees. - Privately-insured Americans can no longer be dropped from coverage by insurance companies because they get sick, and insurance companies can no longer place a lifetime limit on their coverage. In the First District, 460,000 residents are no longer at risk of their insurers dropping their coverage when they get sick. By 2014, virtually all of the law will go into effect. This will result in more than 32 million uninsured Americans gaining access to affordable coverage. The law will also end the hidden taxes that all insured individuals currently pay for emergency room visits by people without insurance. Women will no longer be charged substantially higher premiums than men for the same coverage, and being a woman can no longer be treated as a â€˜pre-existing condition' by insurance companies. Yesterday, Thompson spoke in the House Floor in opposition to the House Majority's repeal legislation. His remarks can be viewed by clicking here. The full text of his statement is below. “I rise in opposition to this legislation that represents the 31st time that we have voted, or will vote, to repeal parts, or all, of the Affordable Care Act. “Instead of staging these political games, we should be spending our time strengthening the reforms that were made in the Affordable Care Act, and working together to put people back to work. “The Affordable Care Act was passed in response to a national crisis. Businesses and individuals could not afford to buy health insurance. “Hospitals, doctors, and clinics provided more than $100 billion a year in uncompensated care -- $50 million in my district alone. Now the good fairy doesn't come and reimburse them for their care. These costs are passed on to all of us who have health insurance in higher taxes and higher premiums, to the tune of $1,000 a year in higher health insurance premiums. “People with preexisting conditions could not get coverage. “People in my district were hitting their lifetime caps, or even annual caps, and being dropped by their insurance company. “Others were self-employed and simply couldn't afford to buy private insurance on the open market. “This was a national crisis that we worked to try and fix, and this is the national crisis that the majority party would like to go back to. “It's not right, it's not good for America, and it's not good for Americans. “So, on behalf of the millions of Americans who are already benefitting from the Affordable Care Act, I urge a “no” vote on this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

07.06.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $457,983 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant for Windsor. The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funds are part of an AFG program called Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) and will be used to make sure fire departments can attain and maintain 24-hour staffing, and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. “With these grants we're helping our fire departments recruit, hire and retain firefighters,” said Thompson. “This will help our economy and help save lives. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” “The apprentice firefighter recruitment and retention program funded by the SAFER grant will increase the safety of our community, as well as surrounding communities, and increase firefighter safety at the same time,” said Fire Captain Ron Busch, author of the grant application. “Equally important, we are training the firefighters of tomorrow.” “The importance of this grant cannot be overstated,” said Windsor Fire Battalion Chief/Fire Marshal Matt Gustafson. “It comes at a time when revenue shortfalls are threatening our ability to provide an adequate level of service. It's a homerun for Windsor Fire.” The funds are being used for recruitment and retention of Apprentice Fire Fighters, as well as for personnel protective equipment, uniforms, medical benefits, workers compensation and pre-employment cost associated with hiring and employing Apprentice Fire Fighters. The two-year apprentice fire fighter program puts apprentice fire fighters on duty in a training capacity with full time fire fighters. The grant will allow The Windsor Fire Protection District to fund the program for both years. The funds also will allow Windsor Fire to increase daily staffing levels at its two stations. The objective of the SAFER program is to award grants directly to volunteer, combination, and career fire departments to help the departments increase the number of frontline firefighters, and to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy. In Fiscal Year 2011, the DHS awarded approximately $380 million to fire departments and volunteer support groups so they could expand the number of firefighters available to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

07.03.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $553,953 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant for Arcata. The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funds are part of the an AFG program called Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) and will be used to make sure fire departments can attain and maintain 24-hour staffing, and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards. “With these grants we're helping our fire departments recruit, hire and retain firefighters,” said Thompson. “This will help our economy and help save lives. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” The award of the SAFER grant will enable the Arcata Fire Protection District to hire and provide benefits for three full-time firefighter positions. Firefighters will be hired and trained within the next 90 days. These additional positions will allow Arcata to meet NFPA 1720 standards for combination Fire department response. “Captain Curt Watkins wrote our grant application and deserves full credit for the success of this award,” said John McFarland, Fire Chief of the Arcata Fire Protection District. “The three firefighter positions will allow Arcata Fire to meet the National Fire Protection Association's staffing and response Standard (NFPA 1720) for combination, career and volunteer fire departments. This is truly a landmark accomplishment for any fire agency.” The objective of the SAFER program is to award grants directly to volunteer, combination, and career fire departments to help the departments increase the number of frontline firefighters, and to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy. In Fiscal Year 2011, the DHS awarded approximately $380 million to fire departments and volunteer support groups so they could expand the number of firefighters available to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public.

07.02.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $216,000 federal Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant for the Cloverdale Police Department. The grant was made through the COPS Hiring Program (CHP). The purpose of these grants is to create and/or preserve law enforcement jobs. The Cloverdale Police Department will use the grant to continue funding an officer position. “These grants are good for our public safety and our economy,” said Thompson. “I am proud to support this funding and thank all our public safety officers for their service.” “The City of Cloverdale is very thankful to the U.S. Department of Justice for awarding us this COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant. It will allow us to retain one of our officers for the next three years. Over the past three years, our workforce has been reduced by 25%, and we can ill afford to lose any more - especially in the critical area of public safety,” said Mayor Bob Cox. CHP provides funding to address the full-time sworn officer needs of state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The grants go directly to law enforcement agencies to hire new and/or rehire career law enforcement officers in an effort to increase their community policing capacity and crime prevention efforts. This year's CHP grants provide 75 percent funding for approved entry-level salaries and three years of benefits for newly-hired, full-time sworn officer position. The grants also provided 75 percent funding for approved entry-level salaries and three years of benefits for rehired officers who have been laid off, or are scheduled to be laid off on a future date, as a result of local budget cuts.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

06.29.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement on the passage of a bill that funds transportation projects for two years: “The best way to get our economy back on track is to put folks to work rebuilding our roads, schools, railways and bridges. And that is why I co-authored an infrastructure jobs bill in the House identical to the bipartisan infrastructure legislation passed by the Senate more than three months ago. But, for more than 100 days, the House Majority refused to bring this bipartisan bill up for a vote, instead passing one short term extension after another. “This delay in passing a bill has hurt our economy. Businesses can't make long-term decisions based on the knowledge that they'll have funding for only months at a time. Just last month, our economy lost 28,000 construction jobs. This was the industry's worst loss in two years. And even today, at the beginning of the summer construction season, businesses still have no idea as to what our transportation policy and corresponding funding are going to look like. The political delay caused us to miss this important window when job creation should have been at its peak. “The delays were a blatant political move that kept people out of work. I am happy this bill finally passed, but it should have been passed months ago. The bill is 90 percent identical to the bill I co-authored more than 100 days ago. The people who will be put to work because of this bill should have already been working. Our economy will continue to struggle until this House Majority is willing to work across the aisle and put the interest of the American people ahead of the next election.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

06.29.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement on the passage of a bill that keeps need based Stafford student loan interest rates from doubling from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent: “Our nation must continue producing the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators to remain competitive in our global economy. And the key to our nation continuing to produce the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators is making sure a college education is an affordable option for working families. “Moving forward, we have to continue working across the aisle to do everything we can to make higher education a realistic and affordable option for any student who chooses this path.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

06.28.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement following the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the Affordable Care Act is constitutional: “Today's ruling by the Supreme Court is a victory for all Americans. The historic health care reform legislation passed by Democrats in Congress is saving money and saving lives. Seniors are paying less at the pharmacy counter; insurance companies can no longer discriminate against people with preexisting conditions or women who become pregnant; millions of Americans can rest assured that if they get sick, they won't have their health coverage dropped. “By 2014, virtually all of the law will go into effect, making even more improvements to our health care system. More than 32 million people who are currently uninsured will gain access to affordable coverage. It will put an end to the hidden taxes that all insured individuals currently pay for emergency room visits by people without insurance. Women will no longer be charged substantially higher premiums than men for the same coverage, and being a woman can no longer be treated as a â€˜pre-existing condition' by insurance companies. “Reforming our health care system is an ongoing process that began with the passage of this bill. It is an important first step towards making quality, affordable health care a reality for all Americans. In the months and years ahead, we need to put politics aside, focus on the facts and work together to further improve our nation's health care system. By building on the reforms made in the Affordable Care Act, we can make sure every American can afford to go to the doctor.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

06.27.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement after testifying at hearing held by the House Committee on Natural Resources' Indian and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee on federal recognition of the Wappo Tribe: “The correct process for federal recognition of a congressionally derecognized tribe rests with Congress. The Wappo tribe is attempting to circumvent Congress and the Department of Interior by going through the courts. This is not in the best interest of the American people, and it's not in the best interests of Napa and Sonoma Counties. “By the tribal chair's own admission, if the Wappos receive federal recognition, they will attempt to build a gaming facility in Napa or Sonoma Counties. In Napa and Sonoma Counties, developments such as a casino would damage our agricultural preserves and put our local economy at risk. This is the absolute wrong region to build a casino.” The Mishewal Wappo Tribe of Alexander Valley filed suit against U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar in January, 2010, charging the federal government acted unlawfully when it disbanded the tribe in 1958. In their suit, the Mishewal Wappo Tribe is asking the U.S. Department of Interior to restore their tribal status, benefits and historic land rights, despite a previous act of Congress terminating federal recognition of the tribe. If successful, the lawsuit could authorize casino gambling on its restored land. In April 2011 Thompson, joined by Representatives Lynn Woolsey and Don Young, wrote a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, raising concerns with the Department's interest in settling this case with the Wappos. In the letter, the representatives argued that it would be inappropriate for Interior to recognize the Wappos through a legal settlement because of the previous Congressional action that terminated federal recognition of the tribe. The hearing held today by the House Committee on Natural Resources' Indian and Alaska Native Affairs Subcommittee was held in part to discuss the involvement of the Department of Interior in settlement negotiations.

06.15.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) today announced a $145,837 federal grant that will help provide permanent housing and support to veterans on the North Coast. The grant, provided through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will be administered by the North Coast Veterans Resource Center and Humboldt County Housing Authority. The funds will be used as vouchers to provide rental assistance for homeless and disabled veterans. Twenty-five vouchers were awarded. “One out of six men and women living in our shelters once served our county in uniform,” said Thompson. “This is a disgrace. We can and must do better. I am proud to have voted to make these grants possible, but we still have more work to do. I am committed to ending veteran homelessness, and these grants will help us find permanent housing solutions for our nation's heroes.” “North Coast Veterans Resource Center is honored to have the opportunity to continue our service of Humboldt's homeless veterans through the HUD VASH program,” said Jason Henry, Site Director at the North Coast Veterans Resource Center. “Our initial award of twenty-five vouchers has allowed us to provide assistance to many previously homeless veterans and their families. The additional twenty-five HUD VASH vouchers will enable us to further our mission to end veteran homelessness in Humboldt County and truly change the lives of some of the men and women that have served our great country.” The permanent supportive housing assistance grants are provided through HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a program administered by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing with case management and other supportive services for homeless veterans across the country. The grants are part of $75 million appropriated for Fiscal Year 2012 to support the housing needs of approximately 10,500 homeless veterans nationwide.

06.15.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement on the Obama Administration's decision to stop deporting and begin providing work permits to young immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children through no choice of their own, and have since led law-abiding lives, and do not present a risk to national security or public safety: “Starting immediately, people who were brought to the U.S. as young immigrant children through no choice of their own, and who don't present a risk to national security or public safety, will no longer be subject to deportation, and will be able to pursue educational and employment opportunities in the United States. “The people we're talking about are young, productive, law-abiding individuals. They go to school with our kids, work in our communities, and some even serve in our military. They are our friends and neighbors. They want to go to college and contribute to our country, and today's decision will give them the opportunity to do so.” To learn more about the decision click here.

06.15.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $325,217 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant for Healdsburg. The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The funds are part of the an AFG program called Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) and will be used to make sure fire departments can attain and maintain 24-hour staffing, and to assure that their communities have adequate protection from fire and fire-related hazards.“With these grants we're helping our fire departments recruit, hire and retain firefighters,” said Thompson. “This will help our economy and help save lives. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” “On behalf of the members of the Healdsburg Fire Department I would like to extend our sincere appreciation to Congressman Thompson for the notification of the award for the 2011/12 fiscal year SAFER grant in the amount of $325,221,” said Steven Adams, Fire Chief - Healdsburg Fire Department. “In these extraordinary financial times, when we are faced with reducing our staffing, the SAFER grant has become more vital to departments our size in order to effectively and safely respond to emergencies in our community. For that we are truly grateful for the grant and for Mike Thompson's assistance.” The award of the SAFER grant will enable Healdsburg Fire Department to restore the critical full-time fire engineer position. While they have an active volunteer program which augments their paid staff, most volunteers, due to other commitments, are routinely unavailable during the day hours when they are needed most. The 40 hour engineer will allow the Healdsburg Fire Department to maintain the required three-person staffing necessary to operate the engine during day hours. The objective of the SAFER program is to award grants directly to volunteer, combination, and career fire departments to help the departments increase the number of frontline firefighters, and to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy. In Fiscal Year 2011, the DHS will award approximately $380 million to fire departments and volunteer support groups so they can expand the number of firefighters available to more effectively protect the health and safety of the public.

06.14.2012	U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (D-CA), Glenn â€˜GT' Thompson (R-PA) and Lois Capps (D-CA) today sent a bipartisan letter to the House-Senate Transportation Conference Committee requesting that conferees adopt minimum funding levels for bridges not on Federal-aid highways under the final surface transportation reauthorization agreement. “We have to make smart investments that keep our local bridges safe and open,” said Thompson. “These investments will help create jobs and they will make sure our counties and local governments have the resources they need to maintain our bridges.” "Without a funding program for off-system bridges, maintenance, repair, and rehabilitation projects essential to the safety of the public will have to compete against all other transportation needs, including system expansion," said Efren Carrillo, Sonoma County Supervisor. "In Sonoma County, roughly 20 percent of our bridges are structurally deficient. Ensuring that there is a dedicated funding stream for off-system bridges will help Sonoma County to fund critically needed bridge projects." Off-system bridges are bridges that are not on a Federal-aid highway but that are owned and operated by local governments. There are over 590,000 bridges in the United States, and more than 50% are off-system. Since 1978, the Highway Bridge Program (HBP) has required states to spend, or set aside, at least 15 percent of their annual apportioned bridge funding for off-system bridges. While the Senate authorization, S. 1813, preserves the off-system bridge set-aside requirement, the House version, H.R. 4348 does not address the issue. The letter, which was signed by 42 Members of Congress and has the support of numerous state and local transportation groups, including the California State Association of Counties, the Regional Council of Rural Counties, and the League of California Cities, requests the members of the conference committee to retain the language included in S. 1813. Additional supporters of off-system bridge program include the National Association of Counties, National League of Cities, National Conference of Mayors, National Association of County Engineers, American Public Works Association, National Association of Regional Councils, National Association of Development Officials and Transportation for America. The full text of the letter is below.Thursday June 14, 2012 Hon. Barbara Boxer Hon. James M. Inhofe Chairwoman Ranking Member Committee on Environment and Committee on Environment and Public Works Public Works 410 Dirksen Senate Office Building 456 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Washington, DC 20510 Hon. John L. Mica Hon. Nick J. Rahall, II Chairman Ranking Member Committee on Transportation and Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Infrastructure 2251 Rayburn House Office Building 2163 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairwoman Boxer, Chairman Mica, and Ranking Members Inhofe and Rahall: As you proceed with a House-Senate conference committee on the multi-year surface transportation reauthorization bill and to resolve differences between S. 1813 and H.R. 4348, we respectfully request that minimum funding levels for bridges not on Federal-aid highways is retained. Specifically, we request that the final conference report include Section 133(g) of S. 1813. As you know, the Highway Bridge Program (HBP) requires states spend at least 15 percent of their annual apportioned bridge funding on bridges located on public roads rather than Federal-aid highways. This requirement, which has been in place since 1978, has allowed local governments to improve and replace locally-owned bridges considered to be “off-system”. More than 50% off the 590,000 bridges in the United States are off-system. Off-system bridges are found in every state. Providing dedicated funding for off-system bridges has been critical to ensuring that these structures remain safe and open to all users. In a recent report on the HBP by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the agency found that “Improvements were most notable in bridges owned by local agencies and on rural routes, which may be attributable, in part, to the federal bridge program requirementâ€”under HBP and some of its predecessor programsâ€”that states spend a minimum amount of their apportionment on non-Federal-aid highway bridges.” (GAO-08-1127T) Section 133(g) of S. 1813, approved as a bipartisan amendment during Senate consideration of the bill, would require each state to obligate for local bridge projects not less than 15 percent of the funds that were apportioned to it under the HBP in fiscal year 2009. Should state and local officials determine that the state has inadequate needs to justify the expenditure, the provision would allow the Transportation Secretary to rescind the requirement. Without dedicated federal funding for off-system bridges, we are exceptionally concerned that bridge maintenance, repair, and capital projects will be unable to effectively compete against other capacity enhancement projects. In turn, the inability to adequately fund bridges - especially safety projects and long-term capital projects - would increase our country's large inventory of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges. The practical implications of this would be to further expose motorists to deteriorating bridges while exacerbating other mobility and commerce-related challenges. Thank you for your dedication and hard work aimed at securing a multi-year transportation bill. Again, we respectfully request that any final reauthorization package retain the bipartisan off-system bridge program as passed by the Senate and as supported by the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the American Public Works Association, the National Association of Development Organizations, the National Association of Regional Councils, and Transportation for America. We thank you for your consideration and look forward to the timely resolution of the policy differences between S. 1813 and H.R. 4348.

06.01.2012	Last night, on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), explained the Bureau of Reclamation's (BOR) shortcomings at Lake Berryessa and secured a commitment from Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen (R-NJ) and Ranking Member Peter Visclosky (D-IN) of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development to address BOR's management problems at Lake Berryessa and at other sites around the country. Frelinghuysen and Visclosky serve as the top two representatives on the House subcommittee that oversees all funding for BOR activities. The agreement was secured during a colloquy on the House floor during consideration of H.R. 5325, the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2013. A colloquy occurs when Members of Congress identify and discuss a problem, state an agreement to fix that problem, and then place that agreement in the Congressional Record. Please find a copy of the verbal agreement for the House record below. MAY 31, 2012 - HOUSE CONGRESSIONAL RECORD Mr. THOMPSON: I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I rise for the purpose of entering into a colloquy. I also want to thank the chairman and his staff, the ranking member and his staff for the help that they've provided on this very important issue. Mr. Chairman, and Members, the Bureau of Reclamation manages Lake Berryessa in my district. They manage it for the purposes of recreational access, and they ensure that the facilities are safe and accessible to local residents and visitors. As part of this, they award concessions to third-party bidders for resort operations. Since the Bureau of Reclamation began the most recent bidding process in 2007, their performance has been disappointing, at best. The concession contract was finally awarded in January 2010, and the third-party contractor has not met the terms of that agreement. The BOR is the responsible agency for concession bidding, and they conducted an inefficient process, provided lax oversight, and refused to take action in a timely manner, despite constant requests from me and local government officials. Now, BOR is entering into mediation, which means even more time to dispute the concessionaire's shortcomings and provide yet another second chance. Mr. Chairman and Members, enough is enough. Reassurances and placations from the Board of Reclamation that they're fixing the problem are no longer enough. We need the matter resolved. The residents of Lake Berryessa and the tourists who visit the area deserve to have this situation fixed. Recreational access to the lake has been restricted, tourism is down, and the local economy has taken a hit. The summer season officially began last weekend, and there's no solution in sight to these problems. I expect the Bureau of Reclamation to take immediate action to right these wrongs and take steps to prevent a similar nightmare from happening in my district or any of your districts. I trust that the chairman and the ranking member share my concerns of the mismanagement of Lake Berryessa by the Bureau of Reclamation and ask that you, Mr. Chairman, and the ranking member work with me to find a way to correct BOR's previous errors and amend the concession bidding process to ensure this doesn't happen again. Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN: Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman, Mr. THOMPSON, for bringing this issue to our committee's attention. We take seriously our obligation of ensuring that Reclamation is efficiently using its appropriated funds to maximize the taxpayer return on investment, and I would be happy to work with the gentleman to continue congressional oversight of the actions at Lake Berryessa specifically. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would also be happy to work with the gentleman from California to ensure that Reclamation is executing its mission in the best interests of the taxpayer. I expect the Bureau of Reclamation to take immediate actions to right these wrongs and to take steps to prevent a similar situation in the future. Mr. THOMPSON: Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their commitment to work with me on this. It's a serious problem. It's hurting people in my district and the surrounding area. I want it stopped, and I don't want to see any of you have to suffer through this process again. Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I would only add that I hope to avoid any further confusion in addressing this issue. And I do appreciate the gentleman's very serious concern here.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.31.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today secured the passage of his amendment to H.R. 5743, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Intelligence Authorization Act that will help make sure small businesses receive fair opportunities to compete for intelligence community contracts. Currently, many small businesses are not made aware of existing contract opportunities within the intelligence community because they lack certain security clearances or access to the classified databases where the opportunities are presented. Thompson's amendment addresses this problem by improving access to the intelligence community's business opportunities. “When small businesses are shut out of these business opportunities we all lose,” said Thompson. “The intelligence community loses access to the best technical solutions. Small businesses lose the opportunity to create and to expand their companies. And the taxpayer loses because the government doesn't get the best price for their contract. My amendment will help small businesses create jobs, strengthen national security and make sure taxpayers get the most bang for their buck.” The reason some small businesses are not made aware of businesses opportunities is not due to a lack of technical expertise or security-cleared employees, but rather a lack of access provided by the intelligence communities. Thompson's amendment addresses this lack of access by requiring an assessment of the intelligence community's current contracting practices, and a review to determine if these practices present unfair barriers to competition for small businesses. Specifically, the amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to report to Congress how the Intelligence Community is currently working with subcontractors and to identify any problems that may reduce the overall effectiveness of this contracting process. In this report, the DNI will also be required to offer recommendations to improve the methods by which subcontractors are granted security clearances and notified of classified contracting opportunities. “We thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership in introducing today's amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 5743),” said Roy Bie, senior vice president of JDSU's Advanced Optical Technology business segment, which produces highly specialized technology for the Intelligence Community. “The security clearance and contracting opportunity process improvements resulting from this amendment will serve the federal government well by matching classified requirements with technology and innovation available from contractors of all sizes. We are pleased with the outcome of today's vote and look forward to enactment of this important legislation.” “Subcontractors that support the technical efforts of the Intelligence Community are an under-utilized asset,” continued Thompson. “Many of these contractors are small businesses that our communities depend on for jobs. My amendment ensures that the intelligence community is getting access to the best available technology, while also making sure that small businesses around the country have a fair shot at expanding their companies.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.28.2012	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) today released the following statement in honor of Memorial Day, which will be observed on Monday, May 28, 2012: “On Memorial Day, we honor the men and women who laid down their lives for our nation's most treasured and highest ideals: freedom, liberty, and democracy. “As we honor their service to our nation, let us also remember the Americans who are serving our nation around the world today. Without the brave efforts of generations of soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Merchant Marines, and Coast Guardsmen and their families, our country would not live so freely. “Let us honor the sacrifice of those who died defending our nation the best way we know how: by ensuring the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, and fellow soldiers they left behind receive the very best our nation can provide. And let us pray for peace - for the day when war is not a reality, but a far-distant memory.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.18.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), co-chair of the bipartisan Military Veterans Caucus, today secured the passage of his bipartisan amendment with Congressman Pete Sessions (TX-32) to expedite new and innovative treatments to our nations' veterans and active duty soldiers suffering from Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The TBI treatment expansion initiative was adopted as a House amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2013 (H.R. 4310). “Our troops and veterans have earned the very best treatment and care that we can provide,” said Thompson. “But sometimes the best treatments aren't available at military and veteran medical facilities. My amendment will make sure that our heroes who return from combat with TBI or PTSD have access to the highest quality care our nation has to offer.” “I am pleased that our colleagues have joined us in recognizing the importance of providing treatment options not currently available within military and veteran medical facilities to those who return from combat with TBI or PTSD,” said Sessions. “As we approach the Memorial Day holiday, I believe we can best honor our nation's active duty soldiers and veterans by ensuring that their health is a top priority and that they have access to the most effective treatments available.” "The bi-partisan Amendment offered by Congressman Thompson and Congressman Sessions will provide additional resources to the VA and DoD to formally collaborate with non-government organizations, such as The Pathway Home in Yountville, to provide timely, cost-effective and quality alternative treatment to veterans who have symptoms of PTSD and TBI," said Fred Gusman, Executive Director of the Pathway Home in Yountville. Between 2000 an 2011 more than 230,000 service members have been diagnosed with TBI. Up to 18 percent of U.S. military personnel returning from deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan have PTSD symptoms. Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment amendment creates a new five-year $10 million pilot program that allows military patients to receive treatment from health care facilities outside of the VA that are utilizing an array of leading-edge, successful therapies to treat TBI and PTSD. Physicians and residential treatment centers like The Pathway Home may qualify for payment from the Department of Defense or Veterans Affairs through a “pay-for-performance” plan, meaning they must prove that a patient has experienced demonstrable improvement. Treatment and reimbursement safeguards in the amendment ensure access to innovative private treatments while reserving payment only for treatments that work. To reach the long-term objective of incorporating leading-edge medical practices into military hospitals, Thompson's and Sessions' TBI treatment initiative requires an annual report to Congress on the results of the program. It also requires a report on how each Department Secretary plans to integrate successful methods into their own medical facilities, encouraging a constant flow of new and innovative treatments.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.16.2012	Calling the most recent BDCP delay the “last, best opportunity to stand up toâ€¦ unreasonable demands,” Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-1), Jerry McNerney (CA-11), George Miller (CA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-5), and John Garamendi (CA-10) called for specific steps to be taken for the BDCP to move forward in a fair and transparent manner. The five members from the California congressional delegation have been vocal in calling for changes to the BDCP and have demanded that any plan has significant input from the Bay-Delta region. In letters sent today to Governor Jerry Brown and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, the lawmakers said, “We recognize that some are now calling for an immediate decision, but we believe that it is critical to get this right; a rushed and inadequate Bay-Delta planning effort will lead to increased litigation, uncertainty, and expense.” “So far in this process we've seen too many back-door deals that put the interests of South-of-Delta water contractors before our farmers, fishermen and local communities. Many of our families and small businesses that depend on the Delta would have their livelihood stripped away and the Delta's diverse wildlife would be destroyed if these politically driven deals were put in place.Federal and state officials need to use this delay to come up with fair and transparent plan that is based on sound science so that our communities, businesses, fish, wildlife and environment in the Delta and north of the Delta are not harmed,” said Rep. Mike Thompson. “I will not accept any plan for the Delta that is harmful to the farmers, families, and small business owners in the Delta region. To date, the planning process for Delta water has been unduly influenced by wealthy water contractors from south of the Delta who would steal our water, costing us millions of dollars and countless jobs. This delay provides an opportunity for the state and federal governments to stand up to the water contractors and ensure that the BDCP includes the input of our region. I will continue to fight against any measures that would destroy the Delta and our way of life,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney. “More than five years into this process, the Bay Delta Conservation Plan still hasn't met basic legal or scientific requirements,” said Rep. George Miller. “This is the last chance to fix it, and that's why this delay is so important: it gives the scientists time to get it right. The Bay-Delta's health is key to California's future - we can either work out a good plan that reduces reliance on the Delta, or we can end up with increased litigation, uncertainty, and expense.” “A 50-year permit needs to be done not only right, but with due diligence and equitable treatment to all those affected. I want to see the federal and state agencies take this opportunity to put forward a process and a plan for the Delta region that recognizes the input they've received not just from south of Delta interests, but north of Delta interests as well. Our state can't afford to get this wrong,” said Rep. Doris Matsui. “As the lynchpin of California's water system, the economic and environmental sustainability of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta must be made front and center in this discussion. It's the law,” said Rep. John Garamendi. “In addition, using the best available science, we must focus on conservation, storage, and recycling to preserve our state's ecosystems and to meet the water needs of nearly 40 million Californians.” The full text of the letter is below. May 16, 2012 The Honorable Ken Salazar Secretary Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, NW Washington, DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar: We write in response to the recently-announced delay in the timeline for releasing additional details of the proposed Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP). We believe that acknowledging the need for changes and additional scientific review is an important first step towards transforming the BDCP into a plan that meets state and federal legal requirements and into a process that is fair, transparent, and inclusive of communities in the Delta region and Northern California. We recognize that some are now calling for an immediate decision, but we believe that it is critical to get this right; a rushed and inadequate Bay-Delta planning effort will lead to increased litigation, uncertainty, and expense. As you know, we have raised many objections during the skewed process that has led to this point. We have reached out to state and federal officials repeatedly, as a group and as individuals, to express our view that the BDCP is failing to adequately address the needs of our constituents and the health of the Bay-Delta ecosystem. Our concerns have been largely reinforced by numerous independent analyses and the release of draft environmental documents which show that the leading BDCP proposal will not meet biological goals and may even lead to the extinction of several species, including some of California's iconic salmon runs. The recent “red flag” comments from state and federal agencies are just the latest indication that the BDCP must be overhauled if it is to be successful. We also understand that, despite the many flaws with the BDCP, state and federal agencies still hope to make a significant announcement on the plan this summer. We would like to reemphasize our conviction that, before making a determination of a preferred project, state and federal agencies have an obligation to ensure that the BDCP will: - Vigorously and meaningfully engage local officials from the Bay-Delta region and Northern California in the BDCP process. - Reflect the best available scientific understanding of the Bay-Delta ecosystem's needs as required by state law, including the reduction of water diversions from the Bay-Delta. - Demonstrate an understanding of the economic issues identified by the Delta Protection Commission's Economic Sustainability Plan for the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta. - Fully analyze a complete range of alternatives, including non-diversion alternatives, the State Water Resource Control Board's alternative, and proposals put forth by experts from the Delta and Northern California. A cost-benefit analysis of each alternative should also be conducted. - Define and meet biological goals and ensure that the preferred BDCP proposal is fully consistent with the best available science and relevant federal and state environmental laws. - Protect water quality and reliability for farmers and communities in the Delta and Northern California. - Rebuild the Bay-Delta's fisheries and the thousands of jobs they sustain. - Preserve flood protection for communities in the Delta and Northern California and include a focus on levee improvements. - Commit to choosing, clearly and with intent, the “least environmentally damaging practicable alternative” as federal law requires. - Meet the requirements of state law by including alternative water supplies as a way to increase water supply reliability and reduce dependence on the Delta. Our constituents have repeatedly demonstrated that they are ready, willing, and able to participate in a BDCP process that is truly collaborative and transparent. Despite the good intentions of our constituents, the BDCP has been dominated by south-of-Delta contractors with a long history of opposing balanced solutions to the challenges facing California's water system. The recently-announced delay in the BDCP may represent the last, best opportunity to stand up to the unreasonable demands of south-of-Delta water contractors and change the BDCP into a plan that can enjoy support throughout the entire state of California. Thank you for your attention to this letter. We look forward to your response.

05.15.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) announced that the President today signed legislation that Thompson introduced to officially rename the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office the “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building.” Congressman Thompson introduced this legislation in November to honor Alejandro R. Ruiz Sr., a Medal of Honor winner who spent his career in the U.S. Army and served in World War II. After retirement, Ruiz lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, located in Napa County, California, until he passed away in 2009 at the age 85. “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Sr. served his country with honor and distinction,” said Thompson. “Today we honor his life, courage and sacrifice by officially renaming the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office after one of its residents and heroes.” On April 28, 1945, Private First Class Ruiz was deployed to Okinawa. While patrolling in a ravine, his unit was ambushed by heavy and camouflaged machine gun fire. Every soldier except Ruiz and his squad leader was killed or injured. With his entire unit pinned down, Ruiz grabbed an automatic rifle and started his solo charge on the bunker. When he reached the bunker his rifle misfired. After beating back enemy soldiers he quickly ran back to where his unit was pinned down to retrieve another weapon. On his second charge towards the bunker he was shot in the leg by enemy fire. By himself he eliminated 12 enemy soldiers and saved the lives of the platoon members. Thompson's bill, H.R. 3004, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 260 California Drive in Yountville, California, as the "Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building" was signed by the President on May 15th, 2012. Thompson's legislation was cosponsored by the other 52 members of the California Congressional Delegation, and both California Senators supported the bill. Ruiz was born in Loving, New Mexico to Mexican immigrants. Of the 3,400 Medals of Honor that Presidents of the United States have awarded, only 44 have been awarded to someone of Hispanic descent. Of the 55,000 residents to have lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, only five have been awarded the Medal of Honor. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition, Co-Chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus, and Co-Chair of the Congressional Military Veterans Caucus. # # #
05.14.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that Julian Gordon of McKinleyville is the winner of the 2012 Congressional Art Competition. Julian's artwork, an oil portrait on canvas titled “Erin”, will represent California's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where it will be displayed for one year. Julian, senior at Arcata High School who is taking Advanced Placement Art, and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony in June.“Our district has extraordinary student artists. Every year I am impressed by their talent and creativity,” said Thompson. “Many thanks to the students who participated in this year's competition, the parents, teachers and judges who make this annual competition possible, and the folks at the Artists of the Valley Gallery who hosted our wonderful reception. Congratulations to Julian. I am honored to be able feature his artwork in the U.S. Capitol. Every community across our district can be proud of Julian's achievement.” "I have been fortunate enough to have been a part of the Arcata Arts Institute for the past three years, where I not only learned a tremendous amount of new skills and techniques to apply to my art, but it is also where I discovered my passion for the arts,” said Julian. “Because of my amazing experience with the program, I know I always want art to play a major role in my life." Julian will be attending Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in the fall of 2012 with a major in studio art. Julian was one of seven regional winners chosen by local artist judges. The six other finalists were: - Del Norte County: Amanda Robertson - Mendocino County: Amelia Hernandez - Lake County: Travis Evans-Britt - Sonoma County: Crysta Jojola - Napa County: Maia Rios - Yolo County: Camille Shea Lichter The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

05.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today voted against H.R. 5652, a spending plan offered by the House Majority that would make harmful cuts to Medicare for seniors, health care for kids, food and nutrition assistance for struggling families, and other vital safety net programs. The bill also protects tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. “We need to get our deficit under control, but the plan offered today by the House Majority is the absolute wrong choice for America,” said Thompson. “We can't reduce the deficit on the backs of seniors, children and the poor. We need a balanced approach where we get rid of programs that aren't needed, where we make sure that programs that are needed are running as efficiently as possible, and where everyone pays their fair share.” The House Majority's bill that Thompson voted against today: - Slashes food assistance by nearly $36 million - reducing food stamps to all recipients and cutting access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to nearly two million people at a time when families can least afford it. - Permanently eliminates the Social Services Block Grant program, which provides assistance for roughly 23 million Americans, including: o Child care and related assistance for 4.4 million children, o “Meals on Wheels” and other home-based services for nearly 1.7 million older Americans, o Child protective services for 1.8 million at-risk children, o Transportation, respite care and other services for nearly 1 million disabled individuals. - Eliminates the Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Maintenance-of-Effort (MOE) requirement included as part of the Affordable Care Act, putting 300,000 children at risk of losing health insurance coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office. - Cuts the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provided 61 communities and states with funding in fiscal year 2011 to implement health and wellness programs and benefited approximately 120 million Americans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.10.2012	Northern California Members of Congress today called on the House leadership to immediately pass a long-term transportation jobs bill. In a letter to the House leadership, the members highlighted the Department of Labor's April 2012 Jobs Report which shows that last month alone, close to 17,000 jobs were lost in the transportation sector. Traditionally, the warm spring and summer months are when transportation and construction jobs are at their peak. A transportation jobs bill like the one passed by a bipartisan vote in the Senate would fund long-term transportation and infrastructure projects, and is estimated by the U.S. Department of Transportation to create 177,500 jobs in California alone.“We need to put politics aside and work across the aisle to put folks back to work,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1). “A bipartisan group of seventy seven U.S. Senators worked together and passed a transportation bill that will create or save more 177,000 California jobs. The American people need the House to do the same. I urge the House Majority pass the bipartisan Senate bill and send it to the President to be signed into law so we can get folks back to work rebuilding our roads, bridges, highways and railways.” “House Republicans continue to stand in the way of new jobs for middle class Americans,” Rep. George Miller (CA-7) added. “Instead of supporting a bipartisan transportation bill that will create hundreds of thousands of construction jobs rebuilding roads, bridges and highways, House Republicans leave American companies and workers idling while doling out more tax breaks to the rich and famous." “We need to focus on creating jobs in California. Investing in our infrastructure will create thousands of good-paying jobs and give businesses the access they need to prosper - jobs that people will be able to support their families on. We need to pass a comprehensive transportation bill and put people back to work. It's long past time to put partisanship aside and put people back to work,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-11). “If a bipartisan Senate can agree on a transportation/jobs bill why can't the House Republicans sign off on it? There's no excuse for putting America's future on hold. We need to act now,” said Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-12). “With unemployment above 11% in my district of Sacramento, passing a long-term transportation bill is critical to our economic recovery, and that of the nation as a whole. Make no mistake: every day a bill is delayed during these warm months, more construction jobs are lost. House Republicans must join us in standing for American jobs, and agree to a bipartisan solution that provides the kind of certainty that our transportation industry desperately needs to begin the 2012 construction season and make progress for the future. We cannot wait,” said Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-5). “House Republican Leadership continues to avoid its basic responsibility of passing a transportation bill that puts American workers back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure,” said Rep. John Garamendi (CA-10). “Construction workers and businesses cannot wait. We should pass the bipartisan Senate bill, so we can Make It In America again.” The House Majority has twice refused to pass long-term transportation legislation, instead passing short-term extensions. The long-term authorization proposed by the House Majority in February contained many politically-driven and unrelated policy riders that prevented the bill from being passed. For example, the bill halted funding for high-speed passenger rail projects; opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska for oil drilling; ended competitive grant funding for road improvements, port upgrades, bridge maintenance and light rail; defunded bike and pedestrian projects; and ended funding that is used to build safer routes to schools. Former Republican Congressman and current Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood called the long-term House bill introduced in February the most partisan and worst transportation bill in decades. In the past, long-term transportation legislation has traditional received strong bi-partisan support. The last long-term transportation bill passed the House in 2005 by a vote of 412-8. Federal funding for transportation projects will run out on June 30, 2012 if not legislation is passed. The full text of the letter is below. May 9, 2012 Hon. John Boehner Speaker United States House of Representatives H-232, US Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Hon. Nancy Pelosi Democratic Leader United States House of Representatives H-204, US Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi, We urge that the House of Representatives immediately consider and pass a long term transportation jobs bill. Passing this legislation is vital during a critical period of our economic recovery. Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that despite the creation of 115,000 jobs during the month of April and the lowering of the unemployment rate to 8.1%, the transportation sector still lost close to 17,000 jobs during that same period. Meanwhile, the House has continued to postpone -- or has given up entirely -- consideration of a transportation bill. Then just a few weeks ago, the House took a series of procedural steps to go to a Conference Committee with the Senate to finally negotiate a long term transportation bill. While we are encouraged that this Conference Committee began their discussions this week; talk of prolonged negotiations, the creation of bargaining working groups involving all 47 members of the Conference Committee, and the insistence that issues unrelated to transportation like the Keystone XL Pipeline be part of a transportation bill, cause us to fear that a long term transportation bill is not going to be agreed to any time soon let alone before the critical summer construction season. Our top priority, and the top priority of the American public, is job creation. It is therefore incomprehensible to us that the House leadership has not even brought up a long-term transportation bill up for a vote, when this indecision has unnecessarily put so many Americans out work; 17,000 people last month alone. With Federal funding for transportation projects set to run out on June 30, 2012, we urge that the House either immediately consider the long term transportation bill that was overwhelmingly agreed to in the Senate, or instruct House Conferees to cede to the Senate language in its entirety so that a transportation jobs bill can be signed into law as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your immediate consideration of this very time sensitive request.Sincerely, Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.09.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), founder and co-chair of the Congressional Wild Salmon Caucus, last night with Republican Rep. Don Young (AK-At Large) led representatives in rejecting an amendment to H.R. 5326, the Fiscal Year (FY) 2013 Commerce, Justice and Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, that would harm Pacific Coast salmon. The amendment, introduced by Rep. Paul Broun (GA-10), would have eliminated $15 million from Pacific Coast Salmon Recovery Funds (PCSRF). The amendment was struck down by bipartisan vote of 239-168. The bill would fund PCSRF at $65 million for FY2013. “A strong salmon population is an important component of a strong economy,” said Thompson. “The PCSRF has been tremendously successful in rehabilitating salmon and by cutting the fund by more than 23 percent would devastate salmon recovery and kill local jobs.” “Alaskans know firsthand the economic benefits of a strong fishing industry,” said Young. “By helping to rehabilitate salmon populations across America, these recovery funds go a long way in building and maintaining healthy fishing industries. I was happy to see that my colleagues recognized this last night and rejected this misguided amendment in a bipartisan manner.” The PCSRF was established by Congress in 2000 to restore, conserve, and protect Pacific salmon and steelhead and their habitats. PCSRF also seeks to maintain the healthy populations necessary for exercising tribal treaty fishing rights and native subsistence fishing. With funding from the PCSRF, states and tribes have undertaken 10,214 projects, which have resulted in significant changes in habitat conditions and availability, as well as the establishment of planning and monitoring programs that support prioritization and tracking for salmon and steelhead population conservation. The salmon industry is important to California's economy. When the salmon industry was shut down in 2008 it was found that the salmon industry contributed $1.7 billion to California's economy and 23,000 jobs were lost. Studies show that if salmon could be fully recovered it could contribute up to $5 billion to California's economy and create 94,000 jobs. With the help of the PCSRF, there have been significant improvements from 2000 to 2011 including: - 879,194 acres of habitat improved or added for salmonid use - 5,336 miles of stream made accessible to spawning populations - Marking programs tagging 238,643,775 fish, improving stock identification and supporting more effective fishery management practices. - Biologists are predicting that as many as 820,000 fish - the most in at least seven years - will return to spawn in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta this year. - The California King Salmon Fishery is open for the first time in four years. In 2010, 787,740 pounds of salmon were caught in U.S. waters, totaling 11 percent of all fish captured that year, and generating more than $554 million dollars.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.08.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), John Garamendi (CA-10) and Lynn Woolsey (CA-6) today introduced H.R. 5545, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. The legislation would designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under this designation, all currently owned federal lands within the NCA boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed according to the site-specific needs. The region would also be permanently protected under a NCA designation, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's natural beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters - which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities.“The Berryessa Snow Mountain Region is a unique national treasure and we have a responsibility to preserve it for our kids and grandkids,” said Thompson. “Designating the region as a National Conservation Area will preserve the land, help our local economies, and protect a wide variety of plants and animals. This is the right way forward for the region and our communities.” “Designating the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area allows for the coordination of federal land management for the benefit of the public,” said Garamendi, a Member of the Natural Resources Committee and former Deputy Secretary of the Interior Department. “This legislation will help preserve the region's natural beauty, increase tourism and outdoor recreation, spur business growth, and create jobs in Northern California. By protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region, this commonsense bill gives visitors the ability to appreciate its splendor while providing economic opportunity for local communities.” “The Beryessa Snow Mountain region is a natural wonder that unquestionably deserves the protection that this designation would provide,” said Woolsey. “For our wildlife who call this area home; for the cleanliness of local drinking water; for the recreational opportunities it will provide for residents and visitors alike, Congress should pass this bill.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches more than 100 miles from the lowlands of Putah Creek below Lake Berryessa, across remote stretches of Cache Creek, and up to the peak of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 319,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. Establishment of a NCA will improve coordination between federal agencies; protect essential migratory corridors for wildlife adapting their ranges to a changing climate; keep water clean; and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. “We're pleased that Congressman Thompson has recognized the natural wonders and recreational opportunities offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain regionâ€”and the strong desire by community members to protect this scenic treasure so that it can be enjoyed by future generations,” said Sara Husby, Executive Director of Tuleyome. “His National Conservation Area proposal is a win-win for everyone.” The white water rapids of Cache Creek, Lake Berryessa's bass fishery, and hiking and horseback riding opportunities make the Berryessa Snow Mountain region a major outdoor recreation destination. Permanent protection for the region would improve management of recreational trails and campsites. It would also increase user education and help draw visitors to the area. “Protecting this area will help the waterways that so many people already love and use,” said Steve Karr, Chairman of the Board for Putah Creek Trout. “A National Conservation Area goes hand in hand with our ongoing efforts to improve the wild trout fishery in Putah Creek and will help foster better outdoor experiences for visitors and residents alike.” Outdoor recreation and protected lands help the local economy. Recent studies by Headwaters Economics, a non-partisan, independent, nonprofit research group, have found that jobs and real personal income rose in local communities after nearby areas were permanently protected. That same potential is offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. “Permanently protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region makes good business sense,” said Denise Rushing, a Lake County supervisor. “Gateway communities - including many here in Lake County - will benefit from the increased tourism and job creation that a National Conservation Area will bring.” "Proponents of this project have worked hard to bring our community together. It will be good for the public having the federal agencies work together," said Napa County Board of Supervisor Chair Keith Caldwell. "Lake County is a great place to visit. The National Conservation Area will be good for the environment and for our local economy," said Rob Brown, Chair of the Lake County Board of Supervisors. “We are excited to know that the National Conservation Ares is moving forward and that it will protect the federal public lands near our Lake Berryessa ranch for future generations,” said first generation cattle ranchers John and Judy Ahmann. Judy is the former president of the California Cattlewomen's Association. The NCA designation only applies to lands managed by the federal government. Current access to and uses of private land will not be changed. No legally-open roads or motorized vehicle trails will be closed as a result of the NCA designation. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the NCA and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The NCA designation would not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of the NCA. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. Lake County, Napa County, the Winters City Council, the Davis City Council, the Clearlake City Council and the Calistoga City Council all passed unanimous resolutions of support in favor of designating the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a NCA. Also in support of the designation are: - 52 elected officials including former Congressman Pete McCloskey, co-author of the Endangered Species Act. - 148 Businesses representing all four involved counties - 29 landowners and farmers - 28 Conservation and Recreation groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition, California Waterfowl Association and the Yolo Audubon Society The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

05.02.2012	Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-01) today announced $10,659,512 in grants for local community health centers across California's 1st District. The funds will be allow the health centers to expand its facilities, improve existing serves and serve more patients. The awards are part of a series of capital investments made available through the Affordable Care Act. “Community health centers are a critical component to the accessibility of quality and affordable health care,” said Thompson. “These funds, which were made possible through the Affordable Care Act, will improve health care and support local jobs for folks across our communities.” Health Centers who received the grants include: CommuniCare Health Centers in Davis - $5,000,000 Sonoma Valley Community Health Center in Sonoma - $5,000,000 Community Health Clinic Ole in Napa - $175,000 Open Door Community Health Centers in Arcata - $484,512 “We were so excited to find out that CommuniCare Health Centers received a $5 million grant to help us build a new facility in Woodland, CA,” said Robin Affirme, CEO of CommuniCare Health Centers. “We will now be able to move forward with our vision to consolidate all of the services we provide currently in two outdated sites into one larger site and estimate that we will be able to serve over 2,000 additional patients in the first year of the new health center. We are shovel ready and expect to meet our time line of moving into the new site by May of 2013. This is great news!” “SVCHC is honored to be selected for this wonderful opportunity! Thanks to the diligent efforts of Congressman Thompson and his staff, SVCHC will be able to enhance our current services as well as offer expanded services including dental. SVCHC's Board and staff welcome the opportunity to serve even more residents as we strive to meet the needs of the Sonoma Valley community,” said Cheryl Johnson Interim Executive Director of the Sonoma Valley Community Health Center. “We are enormously grateful for these funds which will be used to update our Calistoga health center, where we provide nearly 600 medical and dental visits each month,” said Tanir Ami, CEO of Community Health Clinic Ole. “Our staff there has been working with an antiquated phone system and hand-me-down computers and dental equipment and without a dedicated computer server since 1999. Updating this site will improve the quality of care we provide by making sure providers have immediate and consistent access to our electronic health record system with a dedicated server on site; a reliable and less expensive phone system, and dental equipment that doesn't break down, delaying patient treatment.” The grants announced today will help expand access to health care to an additional 860,000 patients nationwide. To date, the health care law has supported 190 construction and renovation projects at health centers and the creation of 67 new health center sites nationwide. Over the next two years the law will support more than 485 new health center construction and renovation projects and the creation of 245 new community health center sites. Overall, since the beginning of 2009, employment at community health centers has increased by 15 percent. And, primarily due to the Affordable Care Act and the Recovery Act, community health centers are serving nearly 3 million additional patients today and will serve an additional 1.3 million additional new patients in the next two years. These health centers improve the health of the nation's underserved communities by ensuring access to primary health care services. Currently, more than 8,500 service delivery sites around the country deliver care to more than 20 million patients regardless of their ability to pay.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

05.02.2012	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1) joined by university leaders and students, today hosted a roundtable discussion at Sonoma State University on college affordability and student loan interest rates. If Congress does not pass legislation by July 1st, seven million students across the country would see their interest rates double on need-based student loans. During the roundtable discussion, Thompson highlighted the impact a rise in interest rates would have on students and families who must borrow to attend college.“If interest rates for students double to 6.8 percent on July 1, more than 572,000 students across California will see their debt load increase by more than $476 million,” said Thompson. “If our nation is going to continue producing the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators to compete in the global economy, then a college education must be an affordable option for working families. College is already costly, and our government doesn't need to make the price tag even higher by allowing interest rates to double. Congress needs to act now to keep this from happening.” If Congress doesn't act, more than 7 million students will incur an additional $6.3 billion in repayment costs for the 2012 - 2013 academic school year. That means college next year, and every additional year Congress doesn't act, gets $1,000 more expensive for each student borrower. In 2007, Thompson voted to pass the College Cost Reduction and Access Act which made historic investments in student aid. The law halved interest rates on these need-based federal student loans to 3.4 percent, making them more affordable for low- and middle-income students. Without Congressional action, the rate will jump back up to 6.8 percent on July 1st. Thompson is a co-author of legislation that would keep the interest rate on the need-based student loans at 3.4 percent. To help make college more affordable, Thompson has also voted to increase Pell Grants to $5,550, and to create the American Opportunity Tax Credit which provides a $2,500 tuition tax credit to eligible families and students.

04.30.2012	U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-01), Laurence Carroll, Director of the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center and new Veterans Affairs (VA) Oakland Regional Office Director Michael Bragg today held a roundtable discussion with local veterans in California's 1st Congressional District. Thompson shared a letter from Brigadier General Allison A. Hickey, detailing the improvements that will be made at the VA Oakland Regional Office. The Oakland office is one of the slowest regional offices in the nation for claims processing. “It is unacceptable that our veterans have to wait so long to receive the benefits they have earned,” said Thompson. “We have a responsibility as a nation to do better, and I look forward to working with the new leaders at the regional VA office in Oakland to make sure veterans' claims are processed in a timely manner.” According to the Oakland office's statistics, Oakland has 30,765 pending disability claims. On average, the wait time on these claims is more than 263 days, 50 days longer than the national average. Of those disability claims, more than 9,200 have been pending for more than a year. Last month Thompson met with Hickey, to express his concerns about the Oakland office. Hickey, the Under Secretary for Benefits at the Department of Veterans Affairs, is responsible for overseeing all non medical benefits and services provided to veterans and their families, including all operations at the VA Oakland Regional Office. A full copy of the letter is below. THE UNDER SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR BENEFITS WASHINGTON D.C. 20420 The Honorable Mike Thompson U.S. House of Representatives Washington D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman, Thank you for your concern for the California Veterans and their families who are experiencing long delays in the processing of their claims as a result of workload and performance issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Oakland. We share your concern and are taking aggressive action to improve the performance of the Oakland RO. A similar response is being sent to Congressman Herger. During our meeting on March 27, 2012, I briefed you, your staff, and other members of the Northern California Delegation on the several actions I directed to improve performance at the Oakland RO. This letter lists the elements of the plan to improve services delivery that we began implementing at the Oakland RO on March 27th. Our goal is to achieve significant improvements in the quality and timeliness of claims processing. We have also made it a priority to enhance our communications with congressional stakeholders. The performance improvement plan includes the following: - Implementing “Challenge” training for the entire regional office in June 2012 to improve employee skill levels and decision quality. Mr. Thomas Murphy, Director of the Compensation Service, will schedule experienced trainers to lead the RO through intensive Challenge training using nationally developed training curricula. This is a major undertaking and a step never executed before - to retain an entire RO. - The Western Area Director. Mr. Willie C. Clark, Sr., will work from the Oakland RO for the next several months to oversee the execution of the improvement plan and mentor the new RO leadership team. - In addition to technical training, the RO will receive team training, supervisory training, and communications training. Utilizing these types of curricula will sharpen focus and improve cooperation and cohesion to achieve mission requirements. - The RO shifted 27 employees to the Rating Veterans Service Representative position and four employees to the Decision Review Officer position to increase the number of employees assigned to its congressional liaison staff in order to improve service and responsiveness to congressional inquiries. - As part of the Veterans Benefits Administration's Transformation plan, the new Simplified Notification Letter process (SNL) was recently implemented at the RO. The SNL initiative allows decision makers to prepare decisions using simpler language and more concise text, resulting in increased productivity and easier-to-understand decision documents with a higher level of quality and consistency. - The RO also established a Quality Review Team, another national Transformation initiative that provides for in-process quality reviews to eliminate errors at the earliest possible stage of the claims process. - The RO is receiving brokering assistance from other VA regional offices to reduce the pending claims inventory. Specifically, new claims and ready-for-decision claims are being sent to regional offices in Lincoln, Nebraska, and Muskogee, Oklahoma, fore processing. This effort began in March 2012. We will establish points of contact at these other regional offices for your staff to call and check on the status of your constituents' claims. - The new Oakland RO Director, Mr. Douglas Bragg, will engage in face-to-face discussions with each of the 21 Northern California congressional district offices over the coming months. Mr. Willie Clark, the Western Area Director, will participate in many of these visits. These visits will introduce the station's leadership team (which will shortly include the new Assistant Director, whose appointment is in the final stages of processing) to congressional stakeholders. They will provide opportunities to address individual and overall service-delivery issues. Mr. Bragg fully intended to begin these visits immediately after the March 27 meeting. Sadly, he unexpectedly experienced the loss of his daughter. Due to family bereavement and burial needs over these last 2 to 3 week, he has not been able to begin these visits. Mr. Bragg and Mr. Clark will be available to begin these visits next week. I am confident that the planned investments in employee training, management oversight, and additional resources focused on Oakland's workload will improve the RO's performance. Our efforts will be enhanced though continued information sharing and open communications with you and your staff. Thank you for your support.Sincerely, Allison A. Hickey Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

04.27.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today introduced H.R. 4969, the California Coastal National Monument Expansion, which would incorporate Stornetta Public Lands and other public lands in the Point Arena area into the existing California Coastal National Monument. These public lands include more than three miles of coastline with natural bridges, tide pools, waterfalls, sinkholes and blowholes. The lands are also open to the public for daytime activities such as hiking, fishing, bird watching, nature photography and wildlife watching.“The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are a national treasure,” said Thompson. “We need to make sure this wonderful stretch of coastline is preserved for the protection of wildlife and the enjoyment of our children and grandchildren.” “Public lands are vital to Mendocino County's economy,” said Scott Schneider, President and CEO of Visit Mendocino County, Inc. “Visitors come from all over the world to experience the beauty and natural wonders of California's North Coast. With the threat of State Park closures and the growing importance of travel & tourism to our economy, increasing visitors' access to public lands is more important than ever. These lands are our “Disneyland” and without them our economy would suffer. Travel & tourism are responsible for the largest job segment in Mendocino County as well as the State of California with close to 5,000 jobs earning over $114 million annually in Mendocino County and over 900,000 jobs earning $30 billion annually throughout California. Visitor spending in Mendocino County brings in $19 million in state and local taxes. With the huge decline in the timber and fishing industries, it is more important than ever to keep the travel and tourism industry strong. These public lands are vital in ensuring our close to 2 million annual visitors to the county continue to visit.” Stornetta is an ecologically important area. It is home of the endangered Point Arena Mountain Beaver and Behren's Silverspot Butterfly, and houses salmon and steelhead trout in the Garcia River, abundant bird life such as the arctic Tundra Swans and harbor Seals. "Congressman Thompson should be commended for working to safeguard California's coastal heritage," said Sam Goldman, California State Director with the Conservation Lands Foundation. "Permanently protecting the Stornetta Public Lands will ensure this iconic section of Mendocino's coastline will be persevered for future generations. It will also protect habitat for migratory waterfowl and the mouth of the Garcia River which is critical for Coho and Chinook salmon." The Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands are contiguous with Manchester Beach State Park, the Point Arena Lighthouse, and the California Coastal National Monument. The California Coastal National Monument is located off the 1,100 miles of California coastline, comprising more than 20,000 small islands, rocks, exposed reefs, and pinnacles between Mexico and Oregon. Current agricultural activities such as grazing are not affected by the designation. “The Stornetta Lands are one of the most ecologically important parts of the northern California coast,” said Dan Hamburg, Mendocino County Supervisor. “They are an essential part of the Garcia River watershed with abundant salmon and steelhead trout. The area has scenic waterfalls, “blowholes” where geysers of salt water shoot upward from caves in coastal bluffs, and abundant bird life including large flocks of elegant Arctic tundra swans. Permanently protecting this area will ensure that residents and visitors alike can continue to enjoy hiking, fishing, bird and wildlife watching and nature photography for generations to come.” “The Stornetta Public Lands are much beloved by our community and thousands of yearly visitors. They provide us the access to experience the exhilarating interface of land and ocean at the very edge of the continent,” said Leslie Dahlhoff of the Point Arena Gateway Committee. “Though only minutes from the City of Point Arena, it's a wild place of coastal prairie and quiet forest, dripping sinkholes, waterfalls, vernal pools and home to endangered plants and animals. It's as though the National Landscape Conservation System was created with the intent to protected and conserve this spectacular piece of the California coast.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

04.26.2012	Reps. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) and Grace F. Napolitano (D-Norwalk) responded today to a scientific review by the Pacific Fishery Management Council which warned that H.R. 1837, the San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act, would damage salmon populations and undermine the recreational and commercial fishing industries that rely on them. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives on February 29, and has now been placed on the U.S. Senate Legislative calendar for consideration. It was recently included in the West Act introduced by Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). “West Coast fisheries and coastal communities rely on a healthy level of salmon production from the Central Valley,” the report stated. “It appears that H.R. 1837's provisions would have an adverse effect on Central Valley salmon habitat, total salmon production, fishery participants, and fishery economic benefits.” “This scientific review shows that the House Majority's water bill puts politics ahead of established science and would kill local jobs,” said Thompson. “The bill is nothing more than a giveaway to well-funded south-of-Delta water contractors. Solutions to California's water challenges should be based on sound science so that wildlife is protected, and our fishers, farmers, families and businesses that depend on the Delta for their livelihoods are not harmed.” “This bill is a water grab,” Napolitano said. “It throws out years of negotiations between California's water users in order to privilege some groups over others. This scientific review shows again how Californians will pay the economic price if this bill, or any part of it, becomes law.” H.R. 1837 rolls back environmental protections for salmon and other species and reroutes a greater share of California's water to agricultural users in the San Joaquin Valley. This lack of protection could lead to salmon die-offs and lost fishing seasons in California and Oregon, similar what happened in 2008 and 2009, when fishermen were unable to fish due to dangerously low population levels, costing jobs and hurting the economy. Full text of the report is available HERE. Some key points:There is a critical link between water flows dedicated to salmon, which allow the fish to spawn, and the overall salmon population. H.R. 1837 undoes many measures Californians have put in place to protect water flows for salmon and potentially puts that population at risk. H.R. 1837 rolls back broader habitat restoration efforts on the San Joaquin and Sacramento rivers directed at boosting salmon populations. H.R. 1837 turns back the clock on Endangered Species Protection to 1994 levels, overturning many critical protection efforts that have been put in place to protect salmon runs since then. Declining salmon populations have a negative effect on both sea and inland commercial and recreational fishing industries, costing jobs and negatively impacting the economy.

04.25.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Congressman Rick Berg (R-ND) joined today to introduce the Small Business Tax Simplification Act. This legislation would allow businesses with up to $10 million in gross receipts to be eligible for a more simplified tax filing method with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).“Simplifying taxes for small businesses is something that everyone can agree on,” said Thompson. “I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation that will save small businesses' time, paperwork and headaches during tax season. Expanding cash accounting for small businesses will allow them to focus their efforts on what they do bestâ€”growing their businessâ€”and not on complicated accounting practices.” “The legislation I am introducing today, known as the Small Business Tax Simplification Act, will simplify the tax code for small businesses across our country,” said Berg. “Instead of being bogged down with complex tax reporting requirements, this bipartisan legislation will allow businesses to use a simplified form of accounting that more closely matches the way a small business owner runs their business. This bill represents a commonsense change that would ease the burden of tax complexity for many small businesses.” Under current law, small businesses are required to use cash-basis or accrual accounting when filing their taxes with the IRS. For many small businesses, the cash-basis method can offer more flexibility in tax planning, since cash accounting is a simplified method that more accurately reflects the way a business collects income and claim deductions for investments. However, only businesses with up to $5 million in gross receipts are currently permitted to use the cash-basis form of accounting. The Small Business Tax Simplification act would allow businesses with $10 million in gross receipts to utilize this method as well. According to the most recent National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Problems and Priorities survey, tax complexity remains one of the top five major concerns for businesses. Dan Danner, President and CEO of the NFIB offered his support of the legislation. “This expansion of the availability of cash accounting for tax purposes will help simplify tax filing and reduce the paperwork burden for many small businesses,” said Danner. “NFIB and its members would like to thank Congressman Berg and Congressman Thompson for this common-sense approach to helping job creators operate as efficiently as possible during this time of economic recovery. It will certainly help make it easier for many small businesses to grow and create jobs.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

04.19.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today voted against H.R. 9, the so-called “Small Business Tax Cut Act.” The legislation, introduced by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (VA-7) is unpaid for, would add $46 billion to the deficit. “This bill will do nothing to create jobs and adds $46 billion to the deficit,” said Thompson. “Instead of spending $46 billion of borrowed money on tax breaks we can't afford, we should help small businesses by investing in job creation so folks can afford the goods and services our small businesses provide.” In addition to adding $46 billion to the deficit, the legislation does not require the creation of jobs. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the economic impact of the bill “is so small as to be incalculable.” Former Reagan Economic Advisor Bruce Bartlett has said this legislation “will do nothing whatsoever to increase employment. It is nothing more than an election year give-away to a favored Republican constituency and should not be taken seriously.” H.R. 9 passed the House today by a vote of 235-173. It now goes to the Senate for consideration. “Just yesterday in the Ways and Means Committee the House Majority voted to cut $68 billion in benefits to the elderly, disabled and poor in the name of deficit reduction,” continued Thompson. “Now today they're turning around and adding $46 billion to the deficit. This is fiscally irresponsible, and it is wrong.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

04.04.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today said that an American Fisheries Society (AFS) review of two agreements that would demolish four Klamath River dams and restore large portions of the Klamath basin shows that legislation to implement those pacts is the best way forward to recovering struggling salmon and other fish populations. “The work done to analyze the effects of these agreements by the U.S. Interior Department, tribal fisheries biologists and others is backed up by some of the top fisheries experts in the world,” Thompson said. “We can revive the Klamath River's salmon - and it is increasingly clear that putting in place the agreements through legislation introduced by me and Sen. Jeff Merkley is the best way to do that.” The AFS letter to U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar weighs whether implementing the Klamath Hydropower Settlement Agreement (KHSA) and the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) would be more beneficial to fisheries than following the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) process to relicense the dams. AFS said it strongly supports implementing the KHSA and KBRA, saying the FERC process - were it to lead to dam removal - would not reintroduce salmon, solve nutrient problems, resolve water management issues, recover endangered sucker fish or reduce fish diseases in the basin. “Despite the uncertainties surrounding dam removal and overall long-term successes, AFS believes that the current situation is highly problematic and undesirable for fishes and fishers, and is likely to eventually lead to extinction of one or more fish populations,” AFS wrote. “Therefore, AFS strongly supports the proposed actions.” The Klamath Basin Economic Restoration Act (H.R. 3398) introduced by Thompson and Merkley would implement a comprehensive plan, developed through a multi-year collaborative effort among farmers, ranchers, fishermen, Tribal leaders, and conservationists, to settle one of the nation's most volatile water wars by authorizing the implementation of the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA). The legislation approves both agreements and authorizes the U.S. Department of Interior to sign and implement the KBRA, implement the KHSA and take the necessary steps to move the agreement forward, changes or establishes federal policy to assist implementation of the agreements, and establishes a process to plan for and implement dam removal. According to an analysis released by the U.S. Department of the Interior, the removal of four dams on the Klamath River would create more than 4,600 jobs in the basin, including hundreds of jobs in fishing and agriculture, while restoring historical habitat for salmon, steelhead and other fish and wildlife.

03.30.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) today announced a $445,331 federal grant that will help provide permanent housing and support to veterans in Sonoma County. The grant, provided through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will be awarded to the Santa Rosa VA Outpatient Clinic. The funds will be used as vouchers to provide rental assistance for homeless and disabled veterans. “One out of six men and women living in our shelters once served our country in uniform,” said Thompson. “This is a disgrace. We can and must do better. I am proud to have voted to make these grants possible, but we still have more work to do. I am committed to ending veteran homelessness, and these grants will help us find permanent housing solutions for our nation's heroes.” “As a community based veteran's service organization it is extremely important for us to have this funding for Sonoma County veterans. In conjunction and collaboration with the Veterans Administration we are able utilize our VA funded Supportive Services Veteran Family grant to assist those veterans who will receive these vouchers. Our goal is to assist homeless veterans move into an affordable permanent housing units and to help prevent a veterans from becoming homeless; North Bay Veterans Resource Center would like to thank Congressman Mike Thompson for all his hard work on this issue and a thank you to all those who have made this grant award possible,” said Don Wrestler, Site Director of the North Bay Veterans Resource Center. The permanent supportive housing assistance grants are provided through HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a program administered by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing with case management and other supportive services for homeless veterans across the country. The grants are part of $75 million appropriated for Fiscal Year 2012 to support the housing needs of approximately 10,500 homeless veterans nationwide.

03.30.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) today announced a $108,210 federal grant that will help provide permanent housing and support to veterans on the North Coast. The grant, provided through the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), will be awarded to the Ukiah VA Outpatient Clinic. The funds will be used as vouchers to provide rental assistance for homeless and disabled veterans. “One out of six men and women living in our shelters once served our country in uniform,” said Thompson. “This is a disgrace. We can and must do better. I am proud to have voted to make these grants possible, but we still have more work to do. I am committed to ending veteran homelessness, and these grants will help us find permanent housing solutions for our nation's heroes.” "We're extremely excited to get this grant for this very important type of assistance for homeless and disabled veterans," said Michele Roth, housing program manager of the Community Development Commission (CDC) of Mendocino County. "Our Section 8 voucher program for rental assistance has been closed for a year so without this new grant we would not have been able to provide this kind of help to more veterans," said Todd Crabtree, executive director of the CDC. The permanent supportive housing assistance grants are provided through HUD's Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing Program (HUD-VASH), a program administered by HUD, VA, and local housing agencies to provide permanent housing with case management and other supportive services for homeless veterans across the country.

03.29.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced $739,800 in federal grants for the Eureka Fire Department. The grants were awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Eureka Fire Department (EFD) will use the grant to purchase a new ladder truck.“EFD needs up to date equipment to perform a variety of roles to protect the public,” Thompson said. “This new ladder truck replaces one that is on its last legs and can't serve the department much longer.” The Assistance to Firefighters Grant will help replace EFD's 1977 Sutphen ladder truck. The department's only ladder truck is underpowered with a manual transmission, does not seat firefighters in a rollover-protected cab and can't reach some of Eureka's tallest buildings. The new truck would allow EFD to more effectively perform its expanded roles of firefighting and medical response, hazardous materials, technical rescue, urban search and rescue, water rescue, water borne firefighting and animal rescue. “This grant will make a tremendous impact for the City of Eureka and its fire department's ability to provide the highest level of fire protection services well into the future,” EFD Chief Ken Woods said. “Replacing our aging ladder truck with a modern apparatus helps ensure that the fire department can continue to fulfill its mission of protection.” The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $5 billion in grants to first-responder organizations to obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training. During fiscal year (FY) 2011, the AFG will award another $380 million to first-responder organizations that need support to improve their capability to respond to fires and emergencies of all types. “These grants are a win for the public and our local fire departments,” Thompson continued. “They will help our firefighters protect the health and safety of the public by improving their ability to respond to fire and fire-related emergencies. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service to our communities.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.26.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that Open Door Community Health Centers has been awarded $396,815 through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for treatment of patients living with HIV. “The HIV services provided by Open Door Community Health Centers are an indispensible part of health care in Humboldt and Del Norte counties,” Thompson said. “Some of our most vulnerable patients will get the care they need through this program.” Open Door provides comprehensive HIV primary medical care services at three of its community health centers: Del Norte Community Center in Crescent City; Humboldt Open Door Clinic in Arcata; and Telehealth & Visiting Specialist Center in Eureka. The grant will fund staffing and training, visits, medical supplies, and laboratory costs for uncompensated patients. The number of patients enrolled in Open Door's HIV care program has more than doubled since 2002. “This grant is crucial to the care of HIV positive individuals in our community,” said Open Door HIV Project Director Jay Molofsky. “Without this funding, access to HIV primary medical and dental care in Humboldt and Del Norte Counties would be limited.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.23.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office will remain open despite having been considered last year for closure by the United States Postal Service (USPS). Last July, the post office was included on a list of approximately 3,700 others being considered for closure by the USPS. Thompson, who represents the Yountville veterans home, led the effort against its closure. “Today's announcement says to the veterans here in Yountville and to veterans across our country that we stand by your side,” said Thompson. “The people who live in this home are heroes who put their lives on the line to serve our nation. Because we fought to keep the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office open, many of our aged and disabled veterans will still have access to their mail, packages and prescription drugs.” "After a long and careful review, I determined that the customer service options that would be left for our veterans and staff would not be sufficient to meet their needs or our obligation to serve them," said USPS Bay-Valley District Manager Kim Fernandez. “We are greatly pleased with Congressman Thompson's efforts for keeping the post office open at the Yountville Veterans Home,” said Peter J. Gravett, Secretary of the California Department of Veterans Affairs. “Having convenient access to a post office is but one of the many benefits and services our veterans deserve for having worn our nation's military uniform.” The Yountville veterans home is one of the oldest in the nation and currently houses over 1,000 veterans, representing every era of warrior from World War II to the present conflicts. The residents range from those who are in the final stages of their lives to those who are trying to adjust from Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Yountville Veterans Home Post Office was the only post office on the USPS's potential closure list that is located in a veterans home. The USPS estimated that the closure of the Yountville Veterans Home post office would only save approximately $1,000 per year. In August 2011 Thompson wrote to Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe urging that he reconsider closing the post office. Thompson also worked with local town and county officials, the American Legion and the California Department of Veterans Affairs to oppose the closing of the veterans home post office.

03.21.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today co-sponsored H.R. 14, an infrastructure jobs bill identical to the infrastructure legislation passed last week by the Senate by a bipartisan vote 74-22. The bill would fund transportation and infrastructure projects for two years, and is estimated by the U.S. Department of Transportation to create 177,500 jobs in California alone. “The political games need to stop, and we need to pass a long-term transportation plan that puts folks back to work rebuilding or roads, highways and bridges,” said Thompson. “Seventy seven U.S. Senators from both sides of the aisle have come together and passed a bill that will create or save more than two million jobs across our nation. The American people need the House to do the same, and I urge the House Majority to bring the bipartisan Senate bill up for a vote, and for the House to send this jobs bill to the President to be signed into law.” The House Majority has twice refused to pass long-term transportation legislation, instead passing short-term extensions. The long-term authorization proposed by the House Majority in February contained many politically-driven and unrelated policy riders that prevented the bill from being passed. For example, the bill halted funding for high-speed passenger rail projects; opened the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska for oil drilling; ended competitive grant funding for road improvements, port upgrades, bridge maintenance and light rail; defunded bike and pedestrian projects; and ended funding that is used to build safer routes to schools. Former Republican Congressman and current Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood called the long-term House bill introduced in February the most partisan and worst transportation bill in decades. In the past, long-term transportation legislation has traditional received strong bi-partisan support. The last long-term transportation bill passed the House in 2005 by a vote of 412-8. Federal funding for transportation projects will run out on April 1st, 2012 if not legislation is passed. “We have an opportunity to work across the aisle and pass a bill that is good for our economy and improves out national infrastructure,” Thompson continued. “The clock is ticking - we need to quit playing politics and pass this bill that puts people back to work.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.20.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member on the House Ways and Means Committee, made the following statement on the House Republican's budget proposal that was released today: “The budget released today by the House Majority falls short of making sure hard working families get the fair shake they deserve. It provides tax breaks to those who need them the least at the expense of our seniors and those who need them the most, and it turns the guarantee of Medicare and retirement security into a voucher that will shift higher and higher costs to seniors over time. “I support simplifying the tax code but it needs to be done responsibly. A plan like we saw today that balances tax breaks on the backs of our seniors and pays for tax breaks by undermining the very things we need to grow our economy and create jobs - things like education, innovation, and new sources of energy - is not responsible. “We need to invest in rebuilding our infrastructure so we can put people back to work fixing our roads, schools and bridges. We need to invest in new economic engines like renewable energy that will create jobs. And we need to invest in education so that our nation continues to have the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators to compete in the global economy. If we make these smart investments, if we make a commitment to shared responsibility, and if we ask everyone to pay their fair share, then we can pass a budget that creates jobs, protects our seniors and supplies a long-term solution to our national debt.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.06.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that The Port of West Sacramento has been awarded a grant of more than $960,000 from the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for construction of a rail loop track that will increase freight capacity and handling efficiency. “The Port of West Sacramento is a lynchpin of Northern California's economy,” said Thompson. “With this grant, the port will be able to handle more business, more efficiently. I will keep working to make sure our port receives the funds it needs because these are the types of infrastructure investments that will get our economy moving by creating jobs and increasing competition.” “We're excited to now be moving forward with this important rail project, which is another important step in further strengthening our role as a competitive Northern California goods-movement hub,” said Mike McGowan, Chair of the Sacramento-Yolo Port Commission. The rail loop project will enable train switching and storage operations to take place solely on Port property. It also will significantly reduce surface-street blockages by freight traffic and provide for a more secure Port perimeter. The Port is one of 12 recipients that will share $16.9 million in funding to relocate, replace and improve railroad track segments under the FRA's Rail Line Relocation and Improvement grant program. The FRA received more than $67 million in state and local government requests. “The overwhelming number of applications we received for this program shows that state and local officials recognize the economic boost that comes with improving transportation infrastructure,” said Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood in an FRA news release. FRA's rail line relocation competitive grant program funds projects that reduce the adverse effects of rail infrastructure on safety, motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic, community quality of life, or economic development. Funding for these grants is made available through annual appropriations and requires a 10 percent contribution from project sponsors. The Port in January 2012 opened a new 5,000-foot rail track extension that links the Port Main Terminal with the Cemex cement and aggregate facility near the Port, and expects to launch a new federal stimulus-funded marine highway container-barge service with the Ports of Oakland and Stockton later this year.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.06.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $36,213 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant for the City of West Sacramento. The grant was awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The grant will be used to secure a mobile “vent over fire prop.” The prop is a large trailer with a special roof that can be cut, allowing firefighters the opportunity for hands on, ventilation training while working at structure fires. The trailer also has applications that will allow training in confined space entry as well as several locked doors which will enhance forcible entry training. “This grant is a win for the public and our local fire department,” said Thompson. “It will help our firefighters protect the health and safety of our communities by improving their ability to respond to fire and fire-related emergencies. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” “West Sacramento is happy to receive this award at a time when budget cuts are a fact of life. We expect that the mobile fire training trailer will be shared regionally to enhance structure fire operations throughout the Sacramento metro region,” said John Heilmann, Division Chief of the West Sacramento Fire Department. “It will help ensure a quick and aggressive fire attack by firefighters that ultimately will save many lives.” The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $5 billion in grants to first-responder organizations to obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training. During fiscal year (FY) 2011, the AFG will award another $380 million to first-responder organizations that need support to improve their capability to respond to fires and emergencies of all types.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

03.01.2012	Congressmen Mike Thompson (CA-01) and Chris Gibson (NY-20) announced today that they have joined together to introduce H.R. 4096, The Storage Technology for Renewable and Green Energy 2012 Act (STORAGE) in the United States House of Representatives. The STORAGE Act would provide a tax credit to individuals and businesses when they invest in energy storage systems. Energy storage systems allow businesses and consumers to keep excess energy generated when energy is in low demand and then use it during periods of peak demand, reducing consumers' electricity bills, greatly enhancing the reliability of alternative energy sources, and making our electric grid more efficient and secure. “When it comes to addressing American's energy challenges, we need to use every tool in the box,” said Thompson. “These tax incentives will move us closer towards energy independence by making our electric grid more reliable, using energy more efficiently, reducing costs and creating jobs.”Janice Lin, Executive Director of the California Energy Storage Alliance said, “Congressman Thompson's legislation is key for California's economic and environmental future. Energy storage is critical to help contain electric costs for California consumers and make our state's power grid cleaner, “smarter” and more reliable. The Thompson bill's investment tax credits for advanced energy storage will help California companies create thousands of welcome high-tech, skilled and semi-skilled jobs in advanced energy storage. We applaud Congressman Thompson for his bi-partisan leadership and we call on the entire California delegation to cosponsor this essential legislation.” Businesses and individuals would both be eligible for tax credits under the STORAGE Act. Businesses and factories that generate energy via large compressed air systems, flywheels, and large arrays of fuels cells and batteries would be eligible for a 20 percent tax credit. Households and businesses that purchase energy storage systems for their property would be eligible for a 30 percent tax credit. The tax credits would also help improve our alternative energy infrastructure. The current alternative energy electricity infrastructure is highly inefficient. Right now, alternative energy sources are often shut down if the energy cannot be used immediately. Energy storage systems can help fix this problem by storing energy temporarily and delivering it when it is needed. Energy storage systems also help cope with peak demand. By allowing consumers to store energy, rather than draw on the system during peak demand time, it can reduce the number of power plants that are needed. A companion bill, S. 1845, was introduced in the United States Senate last fall by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), and Susan Collins (R-ME).Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.29.2012	Today, a leading group of U.S. Representatives who support the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta voted against the passage of H.R. 1837, the so-called Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act. As written, the legislation would divert additional water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta to south-of-Delta water users, running counter to established economic thought, environmental policies and leading scientific research. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 246-175, and now goes to the Senate for consideration. The lawmakers responded today after the vote: “The fact that this legislation passed the House shows that some Representatives are more concerned with satisfying well-funded south-of-Delta water contractors than protecting state laws and finding science-based solutions to California's water challenges,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-1). “This bill puts politics ahead of established science, guts environmental protections and kills local jobs. The Senate should reject it, and solutions to California's water challenges should be based on sound science so that wildlife is protected, and our fishers, farmers, families and businesses that depend on the Delta for their livelihoods are not harmed.” “This bill would only help a few well-connected water agencies, to the detriment of everyone else in California,” Rep. George Miller (CA-7) said of the legislation. “It is a selfish and extreme approach that would end all productive efforts to solve water problems in California. If this bill were ever enacted, it would unravel legal settlements, defy Supreme Court precedent, and pose a serious threat to water management all across the West. HR 1837 is bad for the Bay, bad for the Delta, bad for California's environment, and bad for our economic future. By asking Congress to override state water law - against the state's wishes -- and by ending the collaborative work that's taking place in California, the special interests and water exporters who are supporting this bill are playing a very dangerous game.” “This bill is a blatant attempt to steal water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. It would undermine existing state and federal laws and forever harm the millions of people who live from Sacramento to Stockton to Brentwood in the Delta region. This bill was crafted without any input from the Delta communities, farmers, and businesses that will be devastated by its enactment, and it should not move forward. It is a bad bill that robs Peter to pay Paul. To steal from one community for the benefit of another, while creating a worse problem for everyone, is completely shortsighted and unacceptable. I will continue to stand up for the farmers, families, and small business owners who rely upon a healthy San Joaquin Delta for their livelihoods. My colleagues who pushed this bad piece of legislation forward will have to answer for playing games with the precious water supplies in California,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-11). “In Northern California, we have balanced our watershed to the benefit of our cities, farms, and habitat. However, this legislation will throw our work out the window, along with the ability of California to make its own decisions on its water resources. H.R. 1837 is an unprecedented and unacceptable water grab, and California cannot afford for it to pass - the stakes are simply too high,” said Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-5). “This is not the time to reignite the California water wars of the past. This is not the time to pit Californians against each other,” said Rep. John Garamendi (CA-10). “This is the time to focus on meeting the coequal goals of water supply and ecosystem protection. We must focus on responsible, science-based water management, with conservation, storage and recycling playing a prominent role. That is the solution to California's water needs. H.R .1837 takes us in the opposite direction.” "On leap day, House Republicans are telling California and other states who want to manage their own water to take a flying leap. This bill is the ultimate in Washington power grabs, telling the states that we don't trust you to manage your own water for your people and your farmers," said Ed Markey (MA-7), Ranking Member of the House Natural Resources Committee.###
02.27.2012	Amid the continuing national foreclosure crisis that has impacted millions of Americans, a unilateral decision by Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to block all forms of principal write-down for loans backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has prevented the housing market from recovering more quickly, said U.S. Reps. George Miller (D-Martinez) and Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena), who today ramped up pressure on the FHFA to reverse the decision that has stymied a more buoyant housing recovery. Miller and Thompson joined Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-San Jose) and over 110 Democratic Members of Congress in writing to FHFA Acting Director Ed DeMarco today urging him to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to engage in principal forgiveness in cases where it benefits both homeowners and taxpayers. DeMarco has categorically prevented principal reduction on Fannie- and Freddie-backed loans despite the fact that his own analysis shows that a properly structured principal reduction program could save billions of taxpayer dollars compared to sending underwater homeowners into foreclosure. The lawmakers wrote, “Despite this weight of expert opinion, you have refused to permit Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to write down the principal balances of any underwater mortgages, even in cases where it can be demonstrated that doing so would yield the greatest long-term savings for taxpayersâ€¦ Your unilateral decision to block all forms of principal write-down has prevented the housing market from recovering more quickly.” Miller, who helped lead the charge on the issue among his colleagues, said “We cannot allow this crisis to continue. It's time for Director DeMarco to get to work on stabilizing the housing market and providing real help to homeowners. It makes no sense to send families in the Bay Area and across the country into foreclosure simply because one regulator is ideologically opposed to solutions that work better for everyone. This is a serious issue for too many families and for our country - the FHFA should take it seriously as well.” “The FHFA's refusal to help underwater homeowners is slowing our economic recovery and costing taxpayers billions of dollars as more and more homes are sent into foreclosure,” said Thompson. “We need a responsible principal reduction plan that will help keep people in their homes and keep neighborhood values up - it is good for homeowners, good for communities and good for our economy.” “Our country faces a national foreclosure crisis,” the lawmakers also wrote in the letter. “The American people expect government officials, whether elected or part of the civil service, to solve the complex problems that our nation confronts. We therefore urge you to harness your agency's powers, resources, and financial expertise to prevent more foreclosures and reduce negative equity.” The letter sent today is part of ongoing efforts by California Democrats pressuring the FHFA to make the best decisions on behalf of homeowners. Most recently, the lawmakers wrote to President Obama asking for a recess appointment of a new FHFA director.A copy of the letter is here. # # #
02.24.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced $256,145 in federal grants for the American Canyon Fire Protection District. The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The grant will be used for a 2,000 gallon water tender. The replacement of the American Canyon Fire Protection District's old water tender will improve personnel safety and fire suppression capability when the District is requested to provide aid for fires in areas not covered with a hydrant system. The new water tender will be designed and built to assure operator safety. It will have the ability to deliver large amounts of water to support engine companies in non-hydrant areas. “This grant is a win for the public and our local fire department,” said Thompson. “It will help our firefighters protect the health and safety of our communities by improving their ability to respond to fire and fire-related emergencies. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” “Replacement of the Districts 1993 water tender will benefit our community and our neighbors for many years in the future. We are excited and thankful that the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program recognized the need for support of our requested funding for a new water tender for the American Canyon Fire Protection District,” said Glen Weeks, American Canyon Fire Protection District Fire Chief. The new water tender will be equipped with a large capacity pump, drafting capability and the ability to dump the load of water into portable tanks and refill in a timely manner, a task which the current water tender cannot do. The new water tender will also be built utilizing a stainless steel water tank so that in the event of a disaster that disrupts the public water system, such as an earthquake, the new water tender could be used as a means of transporting and supplying potable water. The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $5 billion in grants to first-responder organizations to obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training. During fiscal year (FY) 2011, the AFG will award another $380 million to first-responder organizations that need support to improve their capability to respond to fires and emergencies of all types.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.23.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today demanded that service members who were subjected to the Department of Defense's (DOD) chemical weapon testing be able to receive full medical care and disability compensation for their service-connected medical conditions. In late 2002, the DOD revealed for the first time that between 1962 and 1974 it had tested harmful chemical and biological agents by spraying them on ships and sailors. These tests - known as Project 112, which included Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense (SHAD), exposed at least 6,000 service members without their knowledge to harmful chemical and biological weapons and included some of the most deadly chemicals on Earth: Vx Nerve Gas, Sarin Nerve Gas and E. coli. Many veterans who were subjected to chemical tests as part of Project 112/SHAD have developed serious medical issues but do not currently receive priority care from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) or disability benefits because the VA does not officially recognize any long-term health consequences from exposure to the chemical agents from these specific tests. In 2010, Congress passed a law requiring the VA to contract with the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to consider the health impact on veterans that were part of Project 112/SHAD. The IOM Study committee charged with investigating these potential health impacts today held a field hearing in Sacramento. If the scientific study by the IOM finds a connection between the chemical testing and long-term health consequences, the VA will likely be compelled to provide all service members exposed to this testing priority medical care and full disability compensation. Thompson today submitted testimony to the committee. “Our country must ensure that any service member who has become sick or developed a disability because of these tests is provided with the treatment they deserve and benefits they've earned,” said Thompson. “We cannot wait any longer. Many brave men who served our country are now sick or have passed away because of Project 112's chemical and biological testing. It is our duty to right this wrong and get our service members the care they need.” In 2002, Congress directed the IOM to conduct a study of the health effects associated with the chemicals used during Project 112/SHAD. Numerous reports by other agencies and departments within the U.S. government, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, say exposure to these substances have long-term health consequences. However, after five years of research the IOM study found no connection existed between the substances tested and the health problems now widely seen among known SHAD veterans. As a result, the VA does not recognize any long-term health consequences from the Project 112/SHAD tests. The IOM has since conceded that the first study did not adequately sample the full universe of Project 112/SHAD veterans, and that the study panel could not obtain sufficient information to assess levels of exposure to specific agents. The initial study also failed to account for the job and duty assignments of various personnel on board all the ships and tugs involved in the chemical testing. Because of this, the first study failed to take into account the different levels of exposure. For instance, some personnel were exposed during training and testing to multiple weapons, experimental vaccines, trace elements, stimulants, and decontamination agents, whereas other personnel would have had limited exposure because of where they were stationed. For these reasons, Congress passed a 2010 law requiring a second study. Thompson provided testimony along with former Senior Navy Officer and Humboldt County resident Jack Alderson today at the committee. Alderson was in charge of five different light tug operations from 1964 to 1967. As a senior officer, Alderson was notified of some military chemical tests performed on animals on his ship while he was in service. Once he started getting sick, he asked Thompson to investigate whether or not there could be a link between his health problems and Project 112/SHAD. It was found that the DOD performed experimental tests by spraying live chemical and biological agents on ships and sailors to test the Navy's vulnerability to toxic warfare. Alderson commanded some of the ships used in these experiments. He has since been diagnosed with malignant Melanoma, several types of skin cancers, prostate cancer and doctors have found four occurrences of Asbestos in his lungs.“Jack, and all the people who served with him, deserve to know the truth,” said Thompson. “If we don't get these service members the care they need, then how can we ask our current service members to put their lives on the line knowing that harm from the enemy may not be the only danger they encounter? It is imperative for us to right our governments past wrongs and help these brave veterans who were unknowingly subjected to these tests.” For more information on the IOM study click here: https://iom.edu/Activities/Veterans/SHADII.aspx Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.17.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that final approval has been given to build the Willits Bypass. The approval permits were necessary for Caltrans to proceed with its plans to reroute a segment of U.S. Highway 101 around the city of Willits in Mendocino County. “This bypass has been decades in the making,” said Thompson. “Two years ago the project appeared dead, but we worked with Caltrans, the Army Corps and community stakeholders day-in and day-out to revive the project. Now, I am proud to announce we will break ground this year. The bypass will improve air quality, relieve congestion, help folks save gas and improve local commerce. It is truly a win for our community.” “The mood of the downtown merchants is that they are looking forward to having their Main Street back where they will have more control over the design of the streetscape,” said Alan Falleri, City of Willits Community Development, Redevelopment, and Economic Development. “They are happily anticipating street improvements that will create a sense of place, increase safety for all modes of transportation, provide a more attractive place to shop and result in increased property values; a win-win scenario for the entire community.” “As the prospective stewards of the mitigation lands, in partnership with the California Department of Fish and Game, the Mendocino County Resource Conservation District (MCRCD) is pleased to learn the USACE has approved the mitigation plans for the Willits bypass,” said Janet Olave, Executive Director of the Mendocino County Resource Conservation District. “MCRCD supports an ecosystems approach to conservation and we appreciate the efforts of all the agencies in ensuring these lands benefit the natural resources, and also continue to provide economic benefits to the community.” The Willits Bypass Project is a freeway segment of U.S. 101 that would bypass the City of Willits with several bridges spanning creeks and local roads, a viaduct spanning the floodway, and interchanges on either end of the bypass. Thompson has worked with local stakeholders on a compromise adaptive mitigation plan that balances the interests of the Willits community, the environment, and the agricultural economy. As a result, of the 1670 acres that would be impacted by the project, more than two-thirds will still be available for grazing.

02.17.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced $604, 578 in federal grants for the Arcata Fire Protection District. The grant was awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The grant will be used to update the entire Humboldt County Fire Radio Network. This includes the Mountain Top Radio Repeaters, the dispatch console in the command center, and the infrastructure that supports it. “This grant is a win for the public and our local fire department,” said Thompson. “It will help our firefighters protect the health and safety of our communities by improving their ability to respond to fire and fire-related emergencies. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service.” “I am pleased to receive this grant award and very proud to have sponsored it for the entire Humboldt Fire Community,” said Arcata Fire Chief John McFarland. “The grant was prepared by Arcata Fire Captain Curt Watkins - congratulations from all 43 agencies go to Captain Watkins. This grant carries an anticipated 20% match which will be funded by the local agencies bringing the total for this emergency communications project to over $700,000.00.” The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $5 billion in grants to first-responder organizations to obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training.

02.17.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) is leading a group of Representatives in calling on President Obama to protect the U.S. agricultural workforce from a harmful “enforcement-only” approach to immigration reform. In a letter to the President, Thompson and his colleagues in the House wrote that if only mandatory worker verification methods like E-Verify were implemented without regard to workers and employers, it would risk the economic vitality of the entire American agricultural industry. “We need a fair and practical approach to immigration reform that ensures our agricultural industry has an adequate, legal, and stable workforce,” said Thompson. “An enforcement-only approach is unworkable for our farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers and would only exacerbate our current agricultural labor shortages. Our skilled farm workers are responsible for getting food on American tables, and they deserve a workable solution to our broken immigration law. E-Verify alone is not that solution.” “Rep. Thompson and Rep. Farr clearly recognize the importance of finding a solution to the immigration debate,” said Paul Wenger, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. “A solution that recognizes California's unique labor needs is crucial to family farmers and ranchers.” According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, if the mandatory E-Verify program goes forward by itself, without providing producers a source of legal workers, it would cost our economy up to $9 billion a year in lost agricultural production. Please find the full text of the letter below. February 13, 2012 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama, As your Administration works towards immigration reform, we urge you to consider the impact some policy changes under discussion would have on the agricultural industry. We are committed to working to protect our borders, providing support to those willing to follow our immigration laws and ensuring that those seeking a better life have the legal opportunity to embrace the American dream. We must enact immigration policies that are tough, fair and practical. Successful immigration reform must establish common sense rules for whom and how many people are legally allowed into our country. With that principle in mind, we are concerned that the acute shortage of agricultural workers across our districts has not been adequately taken into consideration. We believe that any immigration reform legislation must provide farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers with a stable and legal workforce. It has been established that for every job created on a farm, many more non-farm support jobs are created in the supply chain of distribution. Yet our nation's farmers, who are responsible for billions of dollars of economic activity every year, continue to face significant barriers to finding a legal and stable workforce. We are becoming increasingly concerned that some interim immigration reform proposals would create even more devastating labor shortages for growers. It is irrational to think mandatory worker verification methods (like E-Verify) alone are the solution to our country's illegal immigration issues. If implemented improperly and without regard to workers and employers, it would risk the economic vitality of the entire American agricultural industry. We need to find the right balance between ensuring American citizens have the best chance of finding a job while also ensuring our agricultural industry has an adequate, legal, and stable workforce for years to come. We stand ready to work with you to accomplish that goal. Sincerely, ___________________________ Rep. Mike Thompson ____________________ Rep. Sam Farr ____________________ Rep.

02.16.2012	Ten Northern California representatives are today calling on the House Committee on Natural Resources to oppose H.R. 1837, the so-called San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act. As written, the legislation would divert additional water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay Delta to South-of-Delta water users, running counter to established economic and environmental policies. In a letter to the Committee on Natural Resources, U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), George Miller (CA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-5), Jerry McNerney (CA-11), John Garamendi (CA-10), Jackie Speier (CA-12), Mike Honda (CA-15), Lynn Woolsey (CA-6), Zoe Lofgren (CA-16) and Anna Eshoo (CA-14) wrote that the bill grossly dismisses the best available science, would cause job losses, repeals environmental protections, damages local tourism, hurts fishers and farmers, and should be rejected. The lawmakers responded today as the legislation is being considered by the House Committee on Natural Resources: “This legislation is nothing more than an attempt by well-funded south-of-Delta water contractors to steal water from the North with no regard for the fishers, farmers, families and businesses who depend on the Delta for their livelihoods” said Thompson. “This bill puts politics ahead of a half-century of established science, guts environmental protections and kills local jobs. It should be rejected, and solutions to California's water challenges should be based on sound science so that our Delta communities, wildlife and environment are not harmed.” "Last summer, we said that this bill would do serious damage to California's water future. Republicans took their extreme bill behind closed doors for the rest of the year, tinkered with it, and emerged with an equally radical and damaging bill. Their bill undermines water policy throughout the west, including state policy, federal policy, and court approved settlements. Their bill takes years of collaboration and compromise and just blows it all up. Their bill is nothing more than a deliberate special interest attack by a small group of well funded water agencies, their lobbyists, and Republican members of Congress to undermine a sound, workable and equitable solution to our state's serious water problems. Californians should recognize this bill for what it is and Congress should reject it,” said Miller. “This bill is a brazen move by the water contractors and their allies who want to steal water from the Delta. The farmers, families, and business owners in our region rely upon a healthy Delta for their livelihoods. The bill before the committee today has been crafted without the input of stakeholders from the Delta and should not move forward. It would have a disastrous effect on the Delta communities and cause countless jobs to be lost. To steal from one community to benefit another is completely unacceptable,” said McNerney. “H.R. 1837 is a shameless attempt to draw water from the farmers and urban areas of Northern California for the use of junior water right holders in the Central Valley,” said Matsui. “Further, the bill would preempt the state from passing any stricter laws needed to protect endangered and native species, and restrict California's ability to pass tougher legislation to restore the San Joaquin River. This would dramatically undermine our state's authority to monitor, allot, and safeguard its own natural resources, as well as set a dangerous precedent for government interference in the ability of states to protect local agricultural and environmental interests. At a time when we should be working together to solve California's water problems through a balanced approach, H.R. 1837 is anything but balanced and will only create further discord.” “H.R. 1837 would alter the entirety of California's water laws,” said Garamendi, former Deputy Secretary of the Interior. “We have had only one day to understand its implications. This could be disastrous for California's water interests. I strongly urge we step on the brakes before running roughshod over state law, threatening jobs, the environment, and our public health.” Please find the full text of the letter below. February 16, 2012 The Honorable Doc Hastings Chairman Committee on Natural Resources United States House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable Tom McClintock Chairman, Subcommittee on Water and Power Committee on Natural Resources United States House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable Edward J. Markey Ranking Member Committee on Natural Resources United States House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable Grace Napolitano Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Water and Power Committee on Natural Resources United States House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Hastings, Ranking Member Markey, Chairman McClintock, and Ranking Member Napolitano: We are writing today to express our strong opposition to Representative Nunes's so-called San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act (H.R. 1837). As Northern Californians, we believe this legislation fundamentally runs counter to our established economic and environmental policies. These broadly supported policies were established to protect natural resources, promote conservation efforts, and foster economic development within the San Joaquin Valley region. This bill would repeal environmental protections and lead to catastrophic impacts to our valuable coastal resources, damage local businesses and tourism that rely on these resources, and could harm local farmers. This bill grossly dismisses the best available science and further jeopardizes iconic salmon and steelhead that are the focal point of many California State regulations. We have seen what happens when science is ignored for the sake of politics - this became devastatingly clear during a Northern California salmon fish kill in 2002 and fishery disaster in 2006 that were a result of too little water being delivered to critical habitat. These disasters diminished a valued natural resource and harmed associated economies. H.R. 1837 sets the stage for a similar disaster in the Bay-Delta by reverting environmental protections back to 1994 levels, undermining the Endangered Species Act, and - equally important - countering the desires of community members, elected officials, and current State policies. Aside from gutting environmental protections, H.R. 1837 does the exact opposite of what it claims: it kills local jobs. The diversion of water south of the Delta takes it from northern farmers who rely on this supply for successful harvests and livelihoods. Economic losses to the farming industry are added to those due to a decline in tourism and local business following the decline in the natural resources that support them. The San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act is nothing more than an attempt by powerful water districts south of the Sacramento River Delta to abscond with water from the north. This was highlighted in the two hearings on the bill, during which the majority of the witnesses' testimony indicated that it was seriously flawed. And yet, the Committee is voting on it with no further hearings, discussion, or collaboration. For all of these reasons, we strongly urge your reconsideration of H.R. 1837. Sincerely,Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.16.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Lynn Woolsey (CA-6) today introduced an amendment to ban drilling on of California's North Coast. H.R. 3408, the Protecting Investment in Oil Shale the Next Generation of Environmental, Energy, and Resource Security Act would automatically open the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, Alaska's Bristol Bay, Southern California, and the Virginia coast for oil and gas leasing. The bill could also potentially open up California's North Coast to drilling - even if the state objects to offshore drilling in the region.“Oil drilling is an important component of our energy solution, but we should only drill where it's appropriate - and that means no drilling off the North Coast,” said Thompson. “The North Coast is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, supporting salmon, Dungeness crab, rockfish, sole, and urchin populations. It is one of four major upwellings in all the world's oceans, allowing nutrient-rich water to rise supporting an abundance of marine life. Thompson continued, “If an oil spill were to occur in this area, not only would the economic damage to businesses and tourism be staggering, the rocky shores and rough seas would make a cleanup impossible. This amendment should be passed, and Congress must affirm that although oil is a part of our energy solution, we will not be opening up the North Coast for drilling.” “The waters off California's North Coast are some of the most abundant and exquisitely beautiful on the face of the earth,” said Woolsey. “Our commercial fishing industry depends on this thriving marine ecosystem, as do our research scientists. They are critical to our local economy, supporting thousands and thousands of tourism-related jobs. Who would visit the North Coast to look at an oil derrick? We must block any attempt to open these waters to drilling.” In a decision to “trust but verify,” Thompson and Woolsey introduced an amendment clarifying that the North Coast may not be opened for drilling under H.R. 3408. Passing the amendment will affirm that there would not be North Coast drilling in the future. According to a 2009 Energy Information Administration report, opening up waters that are currently closed to drilling would only yield an enough oil to reduce gas prices by no more than 3 cents a gallon - in 2030. In Northern California, the potential economic impact of the region's oil supply is even smaller: if all the recoverable reserves of Northern California's Outer Continental Shelf were tapped, they would provide enough oil to fuel the U.S. for only 100 days. Thompson and Woolsey have been a longtime opponent of efforts to open drilling off the coast of Northern California. In May he introduced a similar amendment to H.R. 231, the Reversing President Obama's Offshore Moratorium Act that would affirm the North Coast would not be opened to drilling. In January, he reintroduced legislation to ban drilling off the coast of Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties. Woolsey is the author H.R. 192, co-sponsored by Thompson and 53 others and widely supported in the local community, which would permanently protect the Sonoma Coast from oil and gas exploration by more than doubling the size of the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries.Please find the full text of Thompson's remarks on the House Floor introducing the amendment. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. Now, I request to yield myself as much time as I may consume. I represent a coastal community and take seriously threats to our nation's coastline. The Thompson/Woolsey amendment #127 would clarify that H.R. 3408 would not open drilling along the Northern California coast. Proponents of H.R. 3408 claim that Northern California does not meet the minimum production potential to be eligible for offshore drilling. However, I do not simply want to take the House Majority's word for it. In a Congress that has seen an unprecedented push to weaken safety standards for the oil and gas industry, I do not want to leave the door open for alternative interpretations. The people of the North Coast of California want to ensure that their environmentally unique and critical coast is protected. Period. Because this amendment is a clarification of the legislation's intent, there is no cost associated with it. It is important to me and to my constituents that H.R. 3408 makes clear that drilling will not occur in the Northern California Planning Areaâ€”along the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt, Del Norte, Sonoma, and Marin counties. The coastal area of my district is one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, and supports salmon, Dungeness crab, rockfish, sole, and urchin populations. If an oil spill were to occur in this area, the environmental and economic costs would be staggering. Response and clean-up efforts would be hazardous and minimally effective given the rocky shores and rough waters. Drilling for oil or gas off of California's North Coast could cause serious harm to the unique and productive ecosystem and abundant marine life. The economic damage to businesses and tourism that rely on these pristine areas would also be substantial. This amendment will simply clarify that this bill does not require drilling off the North Coast of California. I urge a yes vote on this amendment and I reserve my time.

02.15.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced $2 million in federal funding for the Humboldt Bay Municipal Water District (HBMWD). The Pre-Disaster Hazard Mitigation grant through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will go toward replacement of a failing pipeline on the Samoa Peninsula outside Eureka. “This funding will allow HBMWD to get out ahead of a potential disaster by replacing a seismically vulnerable pipeline that supplies drinking water to a large part of the Samoa Peninsula,” Thompson said. “This upgrade is a great example of how communities should protect aging vital infrastructure - replacing last-generation materials with next-generation materials.” HBMWD will replace 10,500 feet of an 18-inch pipeline on the Samoa Peninsula with the funds. The pipeline serves about 7,400 residents, a power plant and the U.S. Coast Guard Station Humboldt Bay. The new pipe is made of High-Density Polyethelene, which is stronger and more flexible than the current Techite pipeline that is vulnerable to failure in earthquakes. The FEMA grant will cover three-quarters of the project cost. “Replacement of the Techite pipe is a very important project for the regional water system and will significantly improve water supply reliability to our community,” HBMWD General Manager Carol Rische said. “Grant funding for water infrastructure is hard to come by and it took a lot of work and a team effort by HBMWD, our District Engineer Winzler & Kelly, Congressman Thompson, Assemblyman Wesley Chesbro and Senator Noreen Evans.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.13.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-5) recently lead a bi-partisan group of Representatives in sending a letter to the House and Senate group negotiating an extension of the payroll tax credit, calling on them to extend Medicare provisions that benefit rural communities. The provisions help ensure quality health care in rural communities and support local jobs. “High quality health care in rural America cannot fall victim to partisan games,” said Thompson. “Folks on both sides of the aisle agree - regardless of if you live in a big city, small town, or rural community, everyone deserves access to affordable, quality care. Congress has extended these benefits many times before and we must do it again so that rural families continue receiving the same level of health care services.” Approximately one fourth of all Americans live in rural areas that rely on local community hospitals, clinics and independent practices for their health care. Many of these facilities face challenges that these important provisions help them overcome such as remote geographic location, workforce scarcity, physician shortages and constrained financial resources. Extending Medicare health benefits help rural facilities and health providers recruit and retain skilled practitioners, provide quality outpatient care and mental health services, and respond to emergency health events. In addition to the health benefits provided by rural health care facilities, they also provide jobs to rural communities. The average Critical Access Hospital directly employs more than 100 people and provides more than $4 million in direct salary, wages and benefits. An independent physician in a rural area supports more than 20 jobs and provides $1 million in economic benefit to their communities. “The Medicare “extender” provisions are vital to ensuring that rural hospitals, doctors and other health care professionals can provide needed emergency and primary care,” stressed Gail Nickerson, President California State Rural Health Association. “The expiration of Medicare extenders will inhibit the ability of hospitals and providers to recruit and retain professionals, negatively impact patient access, and will have a devastating impact on the economies of our rural communities, because health care is a major employer and business in most rural areas.” Below is the full text of the letter. February 7, 2012 The Honorable Dave Camp The Honorable Max Baucus Chairman Chairman Committee on Ways and Means Committee on Finance U.S. House Representatives U.S. Senate 1102 Longworth House Office Building 219 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Washington, DC20510 Dear Chairman Camp and Chairman Baucus, Rural Americans depend on local community hospitals, clinics and independent practices as vital access points to critical primary, emergency and mental health care. These facilities also provide a significant number of jobs in hard hit rural areas. In fact, a single community hospital can mean as much as 20% of total economic activity in small rural communities. Health Care providers in rural America, though, face significant barriers- remote geographic location, small size, workforce scarcity, physician shortages, unpredictable case and payer mixes, and constrained financial resources. Because of these challenges, Congress has enacted a number of programs that help these facilities and other rural providers recruit and retain skilled practitioners, provide quality outpatient care and respond to emergency health events. These programs, which were extended in P.L. 111-309 and P.L. 112-78, have long received bipartisan support. Other hospital provisions, which expire at the end September, accomplish many of these same goals and their extension is similarly vital. Across the country, these programs have helped sustain fragile health care delivery systems and ensure that these facilities remain open and that access for rural Americans remains as strong as possible. Because of the vital nature of these facilities and the fragile nature of the delivery system in rural areas, we urge you to extend these vital provisions as part of the conference agreement.

02.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that Humboldt Harbor and Bay would receive an additional $450,000 for dredging. The funds come from the Army Corps of Engineers' discretionary account, and were awarded in order to address the operation and maintenance needs of Humboldt Bay. “Humboldt Bay is a lynchpin of the North Coast economy, serving as hub for trade and commerce within the U.S. and internationally,” said Thompson. “With these funds the waterways at Humboldt Bay will continue functioning at the depth level necessary for the only deep water port on the North Coast of California. It is important that we continue to maintain and improve this economic engine.” “The Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District very much appreciates the commitment, hard work and advocacy that Congressman Thompson and his staff have done to help keep our harbor infrastructure maintained” said Mike Wilson, President of the Board of Commissioners of the Humboldt Bay Harbor, Recreation and Conservation District. On an annual basis, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determines the amount of funds required to maintain harbors and navigable waterways throughout the United States. The $450,000 is in addition to the $2.74 million previously requested by the Corps and appropriated by Congress last December for Fiscal Year 2012. Annual harbor channel dredging is critical to maintaining harbor entrance safety for our shipping and fishing feet as well as enhancing environmental protection such as the prevention of fuel barge accidents. This dredging effort is also essential in preserving Humboldt Bay as an important part of the north coast economy and transportation system and maintains our area's competiveness for exports to Asia.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) has co-authored legislation that would authorize $1.1 million in federal funds for the Town of Yountville to expand the water recycling facility. The legislation, HR 3910, would expand the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Coalition (BARWC), allowing local water agencies to partner with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to build water recycling facility pipelines and associated infrastructure. The Yountville water recycling system is part of the BARWC. “Expanding Yountville's water recycling system will lessen demand for imported water and reduce wastewater flows to the Napa River, all while supporting up to 130 regional jobs,” said Thompson. “This project helps our environment, it helps our communities, and it helps our local economy. These are the smart investments we need to keep making as our economy continues to recover.” “As a small wastewater utility system with only 800 customers, the Town is extremely appreciative of the opportunity to partner with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to help us fund an environmentally sustainable and reliable source of water for our local vineyards that produce some of the finest wines in the world. We also are thankful for the assistance Congressman Thompson and his team has given us toward this effort," said Mayor John F. Dunbar. The Yountville recycled water project will expand the existing recycled water system that supplies irrigation water to vineyards the Napa Valley. The project will lessen the dependence on imported Sacramento River Delta water, local surface water and groundwater basins. The project will also help reduce wastewater discharged into the Napa River which can negatively impact the habitat of local endangered species. BARWC is a partnership of San Francisco Bay Area water recycling agencies. It is proactively pursuing highly leveraged, locally managed projects that will help ensure the security of water supplies in the Bay-Delta region. To date, projects completed by coalition members have resulted in more than 22,000 acre-feet of recycled water being supplied to Bay Area communities and businesses - equal to the annual water used by 66,000 single family homes. Once completed, the Yountville water recycling system will yield an estimated 115 acre-feet of recycled water for vineyards in the heart of the Napa Valley. HR 3910, the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program Expansion Act of 2011, was introduced on February 6, 2012 and has been referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

02.08.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), John Garamendi (CA-10) and Lynn Woolsey (CA-6) today introduced H.R. 5545, the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Conservation Area Act. The legislation would designate the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area (NCA). Under this designation, all currently owned federal lands within the NCA boundary would be united under one management plan, allowing the region to be managed according to the site-specific needs. The region would also be permanently protected under a NCA designation, ensuring continued recreational opportunities while safeguarding the region's natural beauty, wildlife, rare plants, and waters - which include important sources of drinking water and irrigation for nearby communities.“The Berryessa Snow Mountain Region is a unique national treasure and we have a responsibility to preserve it for our kids and grandkids,” said Thompson. “Designating the region as a National Conservation Area will preserve the land, help our local economies, and protect a wide variety of plants and animals. This is the right way forward for the region and our communities.” “Designating the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a National Conservation Area allows for the coordination of federal land management for the benefit of the public,” said Garamendi, a Member of the Natural Resources Committee and former Deputy Secretary of the Interior Department. “This legislation will help preserve the region's natural beauty, increase tourism and outdoor recreation, spur business growth, and create jobs in Northern California. By protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region, this commonsense bill gives visitors the ability to appreciate its splendor while providing economic opportunity for local communities.” “The Beryessa Snow Mountain region is a natural wonder that unquestionably deserves the protection that this designation would provide,” said Woolsey. “For our wildlife who call this area home; for the cleanliness of local drinking water; for the recreational opportunities it will provide for residents and visitors alike, Congress should pass this bill.” The Berryessa Snow Mountain region stretches more than 100 miles from the lowlands of Putah Creek below Lake Berryessa, across remote stretches of Cache Creek, and up to the peak of Snow Mountain. It encompasses more than 319,000 acres across Napa, Mendocino, Lake and Yolo Counties. The area is rich in biodiversity, including bald and golden eagles, black bears, mountain lions, tule elk, and rare plants found nowhere else on Earth. Establishment of a NCA will improve coordination between federal agencies; protect essential migratory corridors for wildlife adapting their ranges to a changing climate; keep water clean; and provide additional federal funding opportunities for conservation protection, invasive plant eradication, recreation management, and a coordinated multi-agency fire management plan. “We're pleased that Congressman Thompson has recognized the natural wonders and recreational opportunities offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain regionâ€”and the strong desire by community members to protect this scenic treasure so that it can be enjoyed by future generations,” said Sara Husby, Executive Director of Tuleyome. “His National Conservation Area proposal is a win-win for everyone.” The white water rapids of Cache Creek, Lake Berryessa's bass fishery, and hiking and horseback riding opportunities make the Berryessa Snow Mountain region a major outdoor recreation destination. Permanent protection for the region would improve management of recreational trails and campsites. It would also increase user education and help draw visitors to the area. “Protecting this area will help the waterways that so many people already love and use,” said Steve Karr, Chairman of the Board for Putah Creek Trout. “A National Conservation Area goes hand in hand with our ongoing efforts to improve the wild trout fishery in Putah Creek and will help foster better outdoor experiences for visitors and residents alike.” Outdoor recreation and protected lands help the local economy. Recent studies by Headwaters Economics, a non-partisan, independent, nonprofit research group, have found that jobs and real personal income rose in local communities after nearby areas were permanently protected. That same potential is offered by the Berryessa Snow Mountain region. “Permanently protecting the Berryessa Snow Mountain region makes good business sense,” said Denise Rushing, a Lake County supervisor. “Gateway communities - including many here in Lake County - will benefit from the increased tourism and job creation that a National Conservation Area will bring.” "Proponents of this project have worked hard to bring our community together. It will be good for the public having the federal agencies work together," said Napa County Board of Supervisor Chair Keith Caldwell. "Lake County is a great place to visit. The National Conservation Area will be good for the environment and for our local economy," said Rob Brown, Chair of the Lake County Board of Supervisors. “We are excited to know that the National Conservation Ares is moving forward and that it will protect the federal public lands near our Lake Berryessa ranch for future generations,” said first generation cattle ranchers John and Judy Ahmann. Judy is the former president of the California Cattlewomen's Association. The NCA designation only applies to lands managed by the federal government. Current access to and uses of private land will not be changed. No legally-open roads or motorized vehicle trails will be closed as a result of the NCA designation. Federal agencies will retain their existing authority to open new roads and trails or to temporarily close them when necessary, such as during major storms or emergencies. Hunting and fishing will still be allowed in the NCA and the California Department of Fish and Game will retain its authority over these forms of recreation. The NCA designation would not impose any new regulations on hunting, fishing, or firearm use. Existing laws and policies regarding firefighting will not be changed by the establishment of the NCA. Federal agencies can continue to reduce fuels before fires start by thinning trees, establishing fuel breaks, and by using controlled-burns and other appropriate tools. Lake County, Napa County, the Winters City Council, the David City Council, the Clearlake City Council and the Calistoga City Council all passed unanimous resolutions of support in favor of designating the Berryessa Snow Mountain region as a NCA. Also in support of the designation are: - 52 elected officials including former Congressman Pete McCloskey, co-author of the Endangered Species Act. - 148 Businesses representing all four involved counties - 29 landowners and farmers - 28 Conservation and Recreation groups including the Blue Ribbon Coalition, California Waterfowl Association and the Yolo Audubon Society The legislation was referred to the House Committee on Natural Resources.

02.02.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today led a bipartisan group of Representatives in calling on President Obama to protect local clean energy royalties from harmful budget cuts. The letter urges the President to not repeal the sharing of geothermal royalty payments with counties. Because of the high burdens that geothermal production places on the counties where it is developed, counties currently share in the revenue of the federal receipts. Revenue sharing has been a target of cuts in the past. “The geothermal energy produced in California's counties is good for our environment, reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps our economy by spurring green job creation,” said Thompson. “Repealing geothermal royalty payments to counties is a short sighted plan that will do nothing to reduce our deficit. Also, it is not fiscally responsible. It will kill jobs, cripple future green job growth and slow our economic recovery - all of which will only make our deficit larger. If a community invests in developing geothermal energy they deserve to get their fair share in returns.” "Geothermal energy brings jobs and growth to Nevada with 20 plants in operation providing clean, reliable electrical capacity to the grid and significant additional capacity under development," said Congressman Amodei (NV-2). "Given the important role of the counties in the development of this domestic energy source, it's only proper that they should share in the revenue of the federal receipts."“By generating geothermal energy, my home county of Sonoma is making an important contribution to an environmentally sustainable future,” said Congresswoman Woolsey (CA-6). “The royalties Sonoma earns from that production pay for the services our people expect and deserve from their local government, at a time when our county is facing a fiscal crunch. This very modest federal investment yields a significant return - these royalties must not be eliminated in the President's budget.” “In his State of the Union address, President Obama called on America to double down on our clean energy investments. I agree, and that's why I support preserving incentives for geothermal development, which help us produce affordable American-made renewable energy and strengthen our energy independence,” Congressman Garamendi (CA-10) said. “This revenue is essential to many rural communities, especially in Northern California. Cutting geothermal royalties would be shortsighted, devastating vital public services while doing virtually nothing to address the deficit. I urge the President to maintain his commitment to clean energy by preserving geothermal royalties for local communities.”“Geothermal development comes at a cost,” Thompson continued. “Our counties spend money on public safety, road maintenance and law enforcement in and around areas where geothermal is produced.” Revenue sharing was first started through the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005. Geothermal revenue sharing accounts for less than one half of one percent of the total federal deficit. Ending this sharing would negatively impact counties. Currently, counties use geothermal revenues to pay for governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. Many of the counties receiving revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing uncertain budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. Last year, Lake County received $800,000 a year in geothermal royalties. Last year, Sonoma County received $1.1 million in geothermal royalties. The full text of the letter is below. February 1, 2012 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama, As you draft your Fiscal Year 2013 Budget proposal, we urge you not to include a repeal of the sharing of geothermal royalty payments to counties. We understand the need to propose a fiscally prudent budget, but repealing geothermal royalty payments to counties is a short sighted method that does nearly nothing to solve our fiscal problems. In the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where geothermal development is located, these counties should share in the revenue of the federal receipts. In turn, counties have used these revenues to pay for critical governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. This revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners, and ultimately champions, in the continued development of geothermal energyâ€”a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source that provides jobs in rural areas. Ending the geothermal revenue sharing plan would have a significant negative impact on our districts, while the overall effect on our nation's fiscal well-being would be minisculeâ€”less than $7 million a year. Many of the counties that receive revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing precarious budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. As such, we urge you not to include the repeal of geothermal revenue sharing with counties in your Fiscal Year 2013 Budget proposal. We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to working with you as you prepare your budget.

02.01.2012	Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional Rural Health Coalition, introduced H.R. 3859, the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity (R-HOPE) Act of 2012 today. This bipartisan bill would help rural communities meet the challenge of providing access to high-quality, affordable health care. “The quality of health care you receive should not depend on whether you're from a big city or small town,” said Thompson. “Ensuring everyone has access to high quality, affordable health care isn't a Republican priority or Democrat priority - it is a national priority. That is why I am proud to be working across the aisle with Congresswoman McMorris Rodgers to make sure that rural America has access to health care.” “As someone who grew up on a family farm, I know that rural communities in Eastern Washington have unique needs - particularly when it comes to accessing quality health care,” said McMorris Rodgers. “The numbers speak for themselves: There are 75 million Americans who live in rural areas (about 25 percent of the population), but only 10 percent of physicians practice there. In fact, one county in Eastern Washington doesn't have a single primary care physician. Furthermore, when it comes to federal policies, rural communities are often left out of the decision-making process. That's why I'm proud to join Rep. Thompson in introducing this bipartisan bill which will protect access to rural health care and ensure that rural communities are fairly represented in the government's health care policies.” "We commend Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers and Congressman Mike Thompson for the introduction of the Rural Hospital and Provider Equity Act of 2012,” said Alan Morgan, CEO for National Rural Health Association. “This legislation will go far in ensuring that rural providers have the necessary tools to provide quality care for all rural Americans. We encourage the passage of this vital legislation." The R-HOPE Act of 2012 would bring parity to rural communities by: Increasing payments to rural hospitals which take a disproportionate share (DSH) of Medicare and Medicaid patients to the levels that urban DSH receive to better reflect the actual costs of providing care Improve payments for lab services in rural hospitals Continue geographic reclassification for certain hospitals in sparsely populated states Ensure adequate rural representation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) Raise Rural Health Clinic reimbursements to more appropriately cover costs Extend several expiring Medicare incentive payments for rural practitioners including physicians practicing in physician scarcity areas, rural ambulance providers, and specific classes of rural hospitals. If these extension are not passed, many providers would have a harder time providing the same level of care they currently provide. Approximately one fourth of all Americans live in rural areas that rely on local community hospitals, clinics and independent practices for their health care. Many of these facilities face significant challenges that this assistance could help them overcome such as remote geographic location, small size, workforce scarcity, physician shortages, and constrained financial resources. In addition to the health benefits provided by these facilities, they also provide jobs to hard hit rural communities. The average Critical Access Hospital directly employs more than 100 people and provides more than $4 million in direct salary, wages and benefits. An independent physician in a rural area supports more than 20 jobs and provides $1 million in economic benefit to their communities.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

02.01.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that an agreement has been reached between House and Senate leaders to pass the Air Passenger Bill of Rights. The Air Passenger Bill of Rights will make sure airlines meet their responsibility to passengers by ensuring that passengers are given the option to deplane after excessive delays, and requiring that fliers are provided with basic necessities, including access to food and water, comfortable cabin temperatures, and adequate restroom facilities. “Passengers have rights - and because of this legislation those rights are now protected by law,” said Thompson. “While I am disappointed that excessive delay was not defined as being three hours or more, I am confident that we can build on these new protections to make sure passengers are treated with dignity and respect when they fly.” On Tuesday night, House and Senate leaders announced that they have reached an agreement on long-term Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) legislation to improve the nation's aviation infrastructure, modernize our air traffic control system, and reform FAA programs. The Passenger Bill of Rights is included in this legislation and will become law when it is voted on by Congress and then signed by the President. Currently, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has rules in place saying that passengers must be given the opportunity to deplane after excessive delays and are provided with basic necessities. However, these rules can be rescinded now, or at any time in the future under a current or future administration. The DOT rules also do not require the airports themselves to have emergency contingency plans for meeting these rules. Now with the Air Passenger Bill of Rights written in law, as Thompson has fought for, it ensures that consumers are guaranteed these protections now and in the future.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.30.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today called on the House Members of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Conference Committee to include his Airline Passenger Bill of Rights in the long-term FAA authorization bill. The Airline Passenger Bill of Rights would ensure that passengers are given the option to deplane after three hours. In addition it would require that fliers are provided with basic necessities, including access to food and water, comfortable cabin temperatures, and adequate restroom facilities.“The Senate has acted and put consumers first by including the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights in their FAA bill - now it is time for the House to agree to do the same,” said Thompson. “Air carriers have a responsibility to provide basic services and accommodations to their passengers, and the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights would ensure they meet this responsibility.” The Passenger Bill of Rights was included in the Senate version of the FAA Authorization bill, S. 223. The House version of the FAA Authorization bill, H.R. 658, did not include specific language ensuring passengers could deplane after three hours on the tarmac. House and Senate members are expected to meet in conference committee on Tuesday, January 31st to discuss the final language of the legislation, including the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights protections. Negotiations between the House and Senate conferees are expected to be completed by February 17th when the current FAA bill expires. Currently, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has rules in place saying that passengers must be given the opportunity to deplane after three hours and are provided with basic necessities. However, these rules can be rescinded now, or at any time in the future under a current or future administration. The DOT rules also do not require the airports themselves to have emergency contingency plans for meeting these rules. Having the language written in law, as Thompson is calling for, would ensure that consumers are guaranteed these protections now and in the future.

01.27.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Lee Terry (NE-2) yesterday introduced bipartisan legislation increasing rural communities' access to high quality health care. The bipartisan “Medicare Hospice Access Care Act,” allows physician assistants to care for Medicare hospice patients. “No matter who you are or where you live, everyone deserves access to high quality health care,” said Thompson. “This legislation will allow Medicare patients to continue seeing the health care provider they know, are comfortable with, and that understands their health history. Entering hospice should not mean losing the health care provider a patient has come to depend on.” “This is a common sense step for American health care. Medicare patients in rural parts of our great country should have the same freedom of choice as Medicare patients in America's cities. Our legislation ensures this, guaranteeing uninterrupted hospice benefits to seniors in medically underserved communities,” said Terry. Often, physician assistants are the only health care professionals in rural areas. In 2010 alone, nearly 307 million patient visits were made to physician assistants. While Medicare coverage was originally extended to physician assistants through the 1977 Rural Health Clinic Services Act, the program was never updated to allow physician assistants to deliver hospice care. Under current law, physician assistants may provide care to Medicare patients - until hospice care is needed. At this point, Medicare patients must then find an alternative provider, disrupting the continuity of their care. With this legislation, individuals and families who rely on physician assistants as their primary health care professional would be ensured continuity of quality medical care when patients move from the hospital to hospice care. “I commend Representatives Lee Terry and Mike Thompson for introducing the Medicare Hospice Access Care Act,” said AAPA President Robert Wooten. “The bill will increase access to quality hospice care for those relying on Medicare. Currently, physician assistants cannot provide hospice care for their terminally ill Medicare patients, and an undue burden falls on the patient and family to find alternative care. We cannot deny patients access to their â€˜medical home' at a time when they are the most vulnerable.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.25.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), joined by Democratic Members of the California Congressional Delegation, today welcomed the President's proposal from the State of the Union to provide responsible homeowners with the opportunity to refinance at historically low rates, but said this is only half of the equation. “Last night in the State of the Union, the President proposed giving responsible homeowners the opportunity to refinance their mortgages at historically low rates - a proposal I have supported for a long time,” said Thompson. “This simple refinancing would on average put $3,000 back in the pockets of middle class Americans, which by some estimates could be a $50 billion a year economic stimulus, something that our economy could certainly use. However, this is only half of the equation. The Administration and FHFA needs to join our push for a significant principal reduction plan for underwater homeowners. The largest asset most middle class families have is their home, and our economy will continue to suffer and consumer confidence will never return if we do not help these hard working families navigate through this mortgage nightmare.” At a press conference today, Thompson and the other members requested a meeting with the President to discuss policies that would reduce foreclosures and provide relief to homeowners. In California, more than 34 percent of homeowners with mortgages are considered “underwater” because they owe more on their homes than their homes are worth.

01.24.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement on the Interior Department's Draft Overview Report on Klamath Dam Removal Studies. Thompson is the sponsor of the H.R. 3398, the Klamath Basin Economic Restoration Act. “The synthesis of studies released today scientifically confirms that the agreements in place represent the best way forward for the Klamath River Basin and its communities,” said Thompson. “Years of scientific and technical studies have concluded that the dam removals will not only benefit our river basin by restoring fish and wildlife habitats, it will strengthen our economy by creating thousands of jobs. The time for Congress to act is now.” The comprehensive draft report, entitled Klamath Dam Removal Overview Report for the Secretary of the Interior: an Assessment of Science and Technical Information (Overview Report), and each individual study conducted on the environmental and economic impacts of the potential dam removal, is available at www.KlamathRestoration.gov. Some key findings of the report include: Economic Impact and JobsDam removal and ecosystem restoration would create a number of jobs. The one-year dam removal project is estimated to result in 1,400 jobs during the year of construction. Implementation of restoration programs of the KBRA is estimated to result in 4,600 jobs over its 15 years of implementation. An estimated 453 Commercial fishing jobs will be created Employment stemming from increased gross farm income during the modeled drought years is estimated to range from 70 to 695 average annual jobs. Fish and Fisheries and RecreationChinook salmon: Removal of the dams, combined with restoration of aquatic habitats as anticipated in the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA), is expected to increase the average annual production of adult Chinook salmon by 83 percent. The average Chinook salmon ocean commercial and sport harvests is forecasted to increase by 50 percent, while the median tribal harvest would increase by 59 percent and the in-river recreational fishery would increase by 9 percent. Steelhead/Redband Rainbow trout: Steelhead trout would also be able to migrate to historical habitat. Distribution in the watershed is expected to expand to a greater degree than that of any other anadromous salmonid species under dam removal. Access to approximately 420 miles of historical habitat is estimated to again be available for steelhead upstream of the lowest dam. Steelhead are the most prized game fish in the Klamath River; providing recreational fishing opportunities would expand well into the Upper Basin in Oregon. Dam removal and the implementation of KBRA would also expand the total distribution of trophy redband rainbow trout in the fishery throughout the current hydroelectric reach -including areas into Northern California - and would provide a more natural flow and temperature regime for trout and reintroduced salmon and steelhead. Coho salmon: Coho salmon from the Upper Klamath River population would be expected to reclaim 68 miles of habitat, including approximately 45 miles in the mainstem Klamath River and tributaries as well as an additional 23 miles currently inundated by the reservoirs. Increased access to historical habitat, combined with the restoration actions of KBRA, are expected to advance the recovery of federally listed coho salmon. Salmon disease: Dam removal would likely alleviate many of the conditions conducive to disease outbreaks that currently occur downstream of Iron Gate Dam. Refuge recreation: Under the proposed action, Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuges would receive additional water. This water supply could improve hunting and wildlife viewing, which could attract more visitors to the refuges along the Oregon-California border. There would be an estimated additional 193,830 fall waterfowl and 3,634 hunting trips per year over the 50-year period of analysis used in the study. CostsThe most probable estimate of the cost of full dam removal, and associated mitigation actions, is $291.6 million (in 2020 dollars since this is when the dams would be removed). This is significantly less than the $450 million state cost cap identified in the KHSA. If some structures are left in place, but still allow a free-flowing river at all four dam sites, the most probable estimate for dam removal and associated mitigations is $247 million (in 2020 dollars). Examples of structures that could be left in place include powerhouses and selected abutment structures. This estimate includes costs to maintain the structures not removed.

01.24.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement in response to the President's State of the Union address: “Tonight the President talked about how we must stand up for our middle class, and those fighting to get into the middle class. Hard working families across our District are looking for a fair shake. They want to know that if they work hard and play by the rules, then they will be able to put food on the table and gas in their car, make their mortgage payment, send their kids to college and save for retirement. “It's time to put partisan politics aside and work across the aisle to make that fair shake a reality. We need to invest in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure, putting people back to work fixing our roads, schools and bridges. We need to invest in new economic engines like renewable energy that will create jobs, lessen our dependence on foreign oil and put America in control of our own energy sources. We need to invest in education so that our nation continues to have the world's best entrepreneurs and innovators to compete in the global economy. And we can do this while addressing a long-term solution to our national debt. “This is the fair shake I am fighting for in Washington. It's what our families, children and grandchildren deserve. And it's what made America great. In the past, folks knew that making this fair shake a reality meant committing to shared responsibility - if we shared in the responsibility of building a great nation then we would share in the success of a great nation. We must make that commitment again. That is how we build a sustainable American future.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.23.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that new regulations to help ensure airline passengers are treated fairly will go into effect this week. The new protections, put in place by the Department of Transportation (DOT), require that airlines and ticket agents include all mandatory taxes and fees in published airfares and that they disclose baggage fees to consumers buying tickets.“Starting this week, there will be more transparency when it comes to the cost of flying,” said Thompson. “Passengers have rights, and now because of the new DOT regulations airlines will no longer be able to hide costs and fees from consumers.” Specifically, the new rules will make it easier for passengers to determine the full price they will have to pay for air transportation prior to travel. Currently, airlines and ticket agents are allowed to publish ads that list government-imposed taxes and fees separately from the advertised fare, as long as these taxes and fees are assessed on a per-passenger basis. However, sometimes the notice of these taxes and fees is not obvious to consumers. Under the new requirements, all mandatory taxes and fees must be included together in the advertised fare. In addition, airlines and ticket agents will be required to disclose baggage fees to consumers when they book a flight online. The first screen containing a fare quotation for a specific itinerary must show if there will be additional baggage fees, and inform consumers where they can go to see these fees. Information on baggage fees also must be included on all e-ticket confirmations, and for most trips the same baggage allowances and fees must apply throughout a passenger's journey. These consumer protections build on rules announced in August that expanded the existing ban on lengthy tarmac delays to cover foreign airlines' operation at U.S. airports and established a four hour time limit on tarmac delays for international flights. Under the regulations, carriers must ensure that passengers stuck on the tarmac are provided adequate food and water after two hours, as well as working restrooms. Exceptions to the four hour rule will only be allowed for safety, security, or air traffic control reasons. These same protections are included in the Air Passenger Bill of Rights Act (H.R. 729), a bill Thompson introduced in February. Also beginning this week, passengers will be able to hold a reservation without payment, or cancel a booking without penalty, for 24 hours after the reservation is made, if they make the reservation one week or more prior to a flight's departure date. In addition, airlines will be required to promptly notify passengers of flight delays of over 30 minutes, as well as flight cancellations and diversions, and they will generally be prohibited from increasing the price of passengers' ticket after it is bought.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.19.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), Zoe Lofgren (CA-16) and Anna Eshoo (CA-14) led a group of 27 California Members of Congress in calling on President Obama to take immediate action to address the nation's foreclosure crisis. The Members have requested a meeting with the President to discuss policies that would reduce foreclosures and provide relief to homeowners. “Our economy will continue to suffer and consumer confidence will never return if we do not help hard working families navigate through this housing nightmare,” said Thompson. “Nothing the Administration has tried is working and Californians are the ones suffering, living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to keep roofs over their heads. That is why we are calling on the President to meet with us so we can work together and fix this housing mess.” “For over a year-and-a-half, we've corresponded with the President and met with Secretaries Donovan and Geithner and FHFA Acting Director DeMarco, urging swift and immediate action to help our constituents. There still seems to be no bold or effective action taken by the Administration. We have asked to meet with the President as soon as possible to discuss ways to advance meaningful relief and effective solutions for the housing market,” said Lofgren. "The California Democratic Congressional Delegation has spent the last year meeting with one Administration official after another to present our legislative ideas, and the actions the Executive Branch can take to mitigate the foreclosure crisis", said Eshoo. "The time has come for the delegation to speak directly to the President on behalf of our constituents whose lives have been upended, and present to him our bold and workable proposals to address this crisis." In California, more than 34% of homeowners with mortgages are considered “underwater” because they owe more on their homes than their homes are worth. In a letter to President Obama, Thompson, Lofgren, Eshoo and other California Members of Congress wrote, “We have also offered several specific recommendations to reduce preventable foreclosures and provide relief to aggrieved homeowners, including a principal paydown plan to reduce negative home equity which is necessary as the remedy for the housing woes in America. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that efforts by both the government and the private sector have not addressed our nation's foreclosure crisis with sufficient urgency. We therefore request a meeting with you at the earliest opportunity to discuss additional actions your Administration can take to tackle the foreclosure crisis that is hurting so many of our constituents and slowing our economic recovery.”The full text of the letter is below. Dear President Obama: As Members of Congress from California, a center of the nation's foreclosure catastrophe, we've written to you and your Administration regularly for a year-and-a-half, requesting more aggressive action to prevent foreclosures and resuscitate the ailing housing market. We have repeatedly met with Secretaries Donovan and Geithner during this time and have presented numerous constituent cases to them demonstrating the questionable, possibly fraudulent, and irresponsible practices of the mortgage servicing industry. We have also offered several specific recommendations to reduce preventable foreclosures and provide relief to aggrieved homeowners, including a principal paydown plan to reduce negative home equity which is necessary as the remedy for the housing woes in America. Despite our efforts, we have concluded that efforts by both the government and the private sector have not addressed our nation's foreclosure crisis with sufficient urgency. We therefore request a meeting with you at the earliest opportunity to discuss additional actions your Administration can take to tackle the foreclosure crisis that is hurting so many of our constituents and slowing our economic recovery. As of the end of the third quarter in 2011, 10.7 million homeowners nationwide owed more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. In California alone, more than 34% of homeowners with mortgages faced negative equity or were very close to being underwater. These homeowners confront the highest risk of foreclosure, and could most benefit from meaningful mortgage principal reductions. Though the Administration has adopted the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) as its signature housing initiative, the overwhelming feedback from our constituents is that HAMP has not helped them. We believe additional and more effective approaches are necessary. One idea we proposed in previous correspondence to you is a temporary reduction in the interest rates of certain homeowners who file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, so that the entirety of their monthly payments would be dedicated to paying down their principal balances for five years. We discussed this proposal with Secretaries Donovan and Geithner, and also with Ed DeMarco, the Acting Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, all of whom expressed an interest in the idea. However, we have yet to receive a decision from your Administration. Why not? Our constituents and the health of our economy are dependent on swift and immediate action on ideas like this to prevent more foreclosures. We, as Members of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation, look forward to meeting with you so we can discuss ways to advance meaningful and effective solutions to address a foreclosure crisis that is ravaging communities and hurting families. We stand ready to work with you to help the people we serve.

01.18.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement in opposition to the Stop Online Piracy (SOPA) Act, H.R. 3261, and in support of the bipartisan Online Protection & Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act, H.R. 3782. Thompson is an original co-sponsor of the OPEN Act, which was introduced today.“Today, thousands of Internet sites such as Wikipedia and WorldPress have gone dark, giving us a glimpse of what it could be like if the overly broad SOPA legislation became law. SOPA would stifle innovation, resulting in fewer new businesses, fewer new investments and fewer new jobs. From 2004-2009, 15 percent of our country's GDP growth came from the Internet industry. “Under the rules SOPA would impose, our innovation driven economy would take an enormous blow. Startups wouldn't be able to handle the costs that come with defending their sites against a barrage of alleged violations. Domestic companies could be held liable for unknowingly linking to rogue website content. And people won't invest in Internet startups for fear their money will be tied up in litigation, not innovation. The next Facebook or Google could never get off the ground. “While online piracy is something we must continually fight, SOPA is the wrong way to do it. That is why I am working with global leaders like Google and Twitter, to instead enact the OPEN Act, which still combats piracy but does so in a way that doesn't let broad government oversight stifle the innovation and creativity that has been a driving force behind the Internet industry's economic success.” The Open Act, H.R. 3782, would enable holders of intellectual property to petition the International Trade Commissions (ITC) to launch an investigation into whether a foreign website's only purpose is to engage in infringement of U.S. copyrights and trademarks. While complex and difficult issues would take time to resolve, investigations into simple and obvious cases, like the worst foreign rogue websites, could be handled in a matter of days. In either case, the process would create a transparent system in which all parties would have a chance to be heard. If the ITC investigation finds that a foreign registered website is primarily and willfully infringing on the intellectual property rights of a U.S. rights holder, the commission would issue a cease and desist order that would compel payment processors, like Visa and PayPal, and online advertising providers to cease doing business with the foreign site in question. This would cut off financial incentives for this illegal activity and deter these imports from reaching the U.S. market. The OPEN Act takes a much narrower and more targeted approach to combating online infringement than other proposed legislation such as SOPA by only targeting sites “primarily and willfully” engaging in infringement. By employing a clear and targeted definition of infringement, the OPEN Act will ensure that only legitimate cases are pursued. Other pieces of legislation such as SOPA employ broader standards that would require many website operators to employ lawyers to argue that it is not engaging in intellectual property infringement. Such broad definitions could be used to discourage innovation and quash free speech. While SOPA would employ a one-sided process in which judges would only hear from rights holders, by putting the ITC in charge of intellectual property investigations, the OPEN Act would ensure a fair and transparent process in which all parties have an opportunity to be heard. Unlike SOPA, the OPEN Act does not go after sites or search engines that simply link to websites that host infringing content. Rather the OPEN Act would combat online infringement by cutting off a foreign site's ability to profit from the sale of fake merchandise or content they don't own.

01.11.2012	Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), Zoe Lofgren (CA-16) and Anna Eshoo (CA-14) led a group of 25 California Members of Congress in calling on President Barack Obama to address the housing crisis and appoint a Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). The FHFA, which oversees mortgage backers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, has been without a permanent director for two and a half years.“For far too long, partisan politics in the Senate have prevented the FHFA from having a permanent Director who can effectively address our nation's housing crisis,” said Thompson. “Families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep roofs over their heads. Doing nothing is not an option. We need an FHFA Director who is willing to help Americans get out of this housing nightmare.” Representative Lofgren said, “Republicans in the Senate have been playing games with the American people by blocking the Federal Housing Financial Authority from having a proper leader. These are difficult times and we need to be doing everything we can to prevent foreclosures and keep families in their homes. I urge President Obama to take immediate action and appoint a permanent director." "Our national economy cannot fully rebound unless and until housing is addressed. The current situation of foreclosures is unacceptable,” said Eshoo. "That's why President Obama should appoint a permanent Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency immediately." In California, more than 2 million homeowners are considered “underwater” because they owe more on their homes than their homes are worth, which equals 30 percent of all California homes with mortgages. In a letter to President Obama, Thompson, Lofgren, Eshoo and other California Members of Congress wrote, “The FHFA regulates and oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together hold 70 percent of mortgages in the US. The current economic crisis began in the housing market and our economic recovery is dependent on the important work pending before the FHFA. It is time to move forward and put in place a permanent FHFA Director.” The full text of the letter is below. The President The White House Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama: We urge you to act on behalf of the American people and immediately make an appointment for the Director of the Federal Housing Financial Agency (FHFA). For two and a half years, Senate Republicans have been blocking the appointment of this position, causing there to be no permanent Director. The FHFA regulates and oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which together hold 70% of mortgages in the US. The current economic crisis began in the housing market and our economic recovery is dependent on the important work pending before the FHFA. It is time to move forward and put in place a permanent FHFA Director. According to RealtyTrac, 224,394 U.S. properties had foreclosure filings in November, 2011. This means that 1 in every 579 housing units received a foreclosure filing nationwide. In California, 1 in every 211 housing units received a foreclosure filing. And there are fears that a new set of foreclosure waves may come in the next few months. According to RealtyTrac cofounder, James Saccacio, “November's numbers suggest a new set of incoming foreclosure waves, many of which may roll into the market as REOs or short sales sometime early next yearâ€¦some bellwether states such as California, Arizona and Massachusetts actually posted year-over-year increases in foreclosure activity in November.” It is clear that we must take immediate steps to prevent more foreclosures. As part of the FHFA's ability to promote policies that will prevent foreclosures, they have the authority to establish rules over residential mortgages that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government enterprises are able to underwrite. FHFA has consistently and erroneously interpreted its mandate far too narrowly and as such has failed to take adequate action to help homeowners and has brought an end to successful, local initiativesâ€”such as the PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) program. The PACE program allows property owners to finance energy efficiency measures and renewable energy projects for their homes and commercial buildings, thereby reducing their energy costs and making them better able to make mortgage payments. It has been successful in many of our districts, however, in July of 2009 FHFA issued a decision that essentially put an end to PACE programs across this country. As the fiduciary of government-backed entities, there are steps that the FHFA can take to help prevent future foreclosures while also protecting taxpayers. Installing a permanent Director of the FHFA will allow the FHFA to move forward to make key decisions that will help keep families in their homes and improve our economy. We appreciate your recent appointment of Richard Cordray as the new Director of the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over similar Republican opposition and we urge that you take the same action to put in place a permanent Director to the FHFA.

01.10.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced more than $5.5 million for homeless programs across California's First Congressional District. The funding comes through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and will ensure these housing and service programs remain operating in 2012 in an effort to reduce and end homelessness. “These grants will help our homeless shelters keep their doors open, and will keep programs that reduce homelessness in operation,” said Thompson. “I am proud to support these funds so that folks can continue to get the help they need to get back on their feet.” HUD recently announced that approximately 3,000 cities and counties reported 636,000 homeless persons on a single night in January of 2011, a 2.1 percent decline from the year before. This reduction in homelessness was noticed among all population groups including individuals, families, and those experiencing long-term or chronic homeless. In addition, HUD estimates a 12 percent reduction in homelessness among veterans. The grants announced by HUD provide permanent and transitional housing to homeless persons as well as services including job training, health care, mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment and child care. The grants are awarded competitively to local programs to meet the needs of their homeless clients. “Community based programs to intervene on homelessness have been in high demand and very successful in Napa County,” said Randy Snowden, Director, Napa County Health & Human Services Agency. “However, there is no steady funding source for these services. We're very lucky to have heavy hitters like Congressman Thompson working so hard to support local homeless services. These grants make the core programs possible -- you could call them the foundation for local homeless services.” “In an economy that has produced an increased number of homeless families, many of whom would never have imagined themselves in a position without housing, HUD funding for homeless services is more necessary than ever,” said Leona Jull, Executive Director Yolo Wayfarer Center. “Yolo County received $415,000 to assist homeless individuals and families to exchange homelessness for a full and productive lifestyle. Yolo Wayfarer Center will utilize its award of $177,343 to house 40 families including 68 children and 42 single individuals in its transitional housing programs during 2012. HUD funding and coordinated efforts with other service providers including; Broderick Christian Center, Davis Community Meals and Yolo Community Care Continuum will provide the support services necessary to assist homeless families and individuals in escaping homelessness and accessing and sustaining permanent supported housing.” “Mendocino County became the first Rural Continuum of Care in the United States in 1995,” said MaryLou Leonard, Deputy Director for Adult and Aging Services, Mendocino County Health and Services Agency. “The 2012 Continuum of Care Award marks the 17th year Mendocino County has received this HUD funding. Mendocino County has a well established consortium of local agencies that provide a wide variety of services to assist the homeless in attaining self-sufficiency. The HUD funds support resource centers that guide individuals and families into community services, 30 beds of transitional housing, and 134 units of permanent supportive housing.” “The grant is an absolute, essential anchor for our MAC operations,” RCAA Director of Family Services Simone Taylor said. “The money will help these groups and the HHHC in general to continue to provide vital services and support to homeless people in our community throughout the coming year,” said Barbara LaHaie, Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) assistant director of programs and co-chair of the Humboldt Housing and Homeless Coalition (HHHC). “This funding helps us work toward no interruption in services for those in need.” Napa County programs that received grants include: - Napa Supportive Housing 2011 - $164,490 - 2006 Shelter Plus Care - Renewal - $24,144 - Supportive Housing Program - Good News - $13,715 - HMIS Expansion 2011 - $13,500 - HMIS 2011 - $19,950 - Good News Too! 2011 - $53,436 - 2011 Shelter Plus Care - $60,360 - TRAIN 2011 - $125,794 Yolo County programs that received grants include: - Solutions Life Skills Classes - $46,527 to Broderick Christian Center in West Sacramento - Supported Housing - $84,423 to Yolo Community Care Continuum - Transitional Housing 2011 - $177,343 to Yolo Wayfarer Center - Transitional Housing Program for Homeless Single Men and Women - $106,752 to Davis Community Meals Mendocino County programs that received grants include: - Supportive Opportunities in Permanent Housing - $73,816 - Sponsor-based Rental Assistance- $46,608 - 2011 Transitional Housing - $130,736 - 2011 Seamless Transition Empowerment Program (funding for homeless resource centers) - $200,412 - Tenant Based Rental Assistance Renewal - $1,391,700 Humboldt County programs that received grants include: - Crossroads Women - $109,727 - Multiple Assistance Center - $118,074 - Launch Pad 2 - $38,359 - Apartments First! - $234,726 - Humboldt County HMIS - $82,353 Sonoma County programs that received grants include: - Work Right Transitional Housing & Supportive Services - $75,000 - Shelter Plus Care Renewal - Youth with Disabilities - $82,800 - Slater @ Meadow Lane SHPR $61,134 - Soroptimist House - $24,780 - Stony Point Commons - $40,842 - The Family Connection - $16,000 - Vet House - $44,536 - Yulupa Supportive Services - $40,000 - Shelter Plus Care Renewal - Persons with Mental Illness - $67,176 - Rent Right - $29,744 - Transitional Housing for Homeless Families - $78,359 - Rent Up - $40,624 - Housing Options - $74,963 - Homeless Management Information System (HMIS) - $135,329 - Homeless Intervention Partnership - $52,500 - Community Turning Point - $80,424 - Caring Communities - $107,000 - Buckelew SHP (Sonoma) - $170,040 - Buckelew Samaritan Initiative - Sonoma - $66,659 - Shelter Plus Care Renewal - Persons with HIV/AIDS - $723,648 - Shelter Plus Care Renewal - Persons with Disabilities - $196,776Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.04.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced more than $634,000 in federal grants for the Hopland Fire Protection District, Fort Bragg Fire Protection Authority and Eureka Fire Department. The grants were awarded through The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). “These grants are a win for the public and our local fire departments,” said Thompson. “They will help our firefighters protect the health and safety of the public by improving their ability to respond to fire and fire-related emergencies. I am proud to support these grants and thank our firefighters and first responders for their service to our communities.” “This grant will provide protection for our personnel and our critical public safety facilities, apparatus and equipment so these resources can continue to be available to provide services to the community,” Assistant Fire Chief Rusty Goodlive said. “The Hopland Fire Protection District would like to thank Congressman Thompson and his staff for their support in obtaining the 2012 Assistance to Firefighters Grant,” said John Bartlett Chief of the Hopland Fire Protection District. “This grant will allow us to purchase a much needed new fire engine. Having a new reliable fire engine will allow the Hopland Fire Protection District to better serve the community of Hopland and surrounding area.” “This award will allow us to replace all of our breathing apparatus, 30 units, along with spare cylinders for each pack. Over the years, the FBFD has taken steps to try and be compliant with the most current safety regulations. We have sent air packs off to be reconditioned, we bought a few newer units in the late nineties, but the bottom line was that we were far behind today's standards, with limited funding to do anything about it. We, as well as most departments, take the safety of our volunteers very seriously. Sending our people into any hazardous atmosphere without the best protection available was something we have been having to deal with for the past several years. This grant award will change that,” said Steve Orsi, Chief of the Fort Bragg Fire Protection Authority. “This award will guarantee that our responders will be protected much as possible as they risk their health and lives to provide a service for our community. The FBFD would like to thank Congressman Mike Thompson for his continued support over the years, we are going to be missing him as our representative.” The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to fire departments and EMS organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $5 billion in grants to first-responder organizations to obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training. During fiscal year (FY) 2011, the AFG will award another $380 million to first-responder organizations that need support to improve their capability to respond to fires and emergencies of all types.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

01.03.2012	Congressman Mike Thompson's (D-CA) provisions to H.R. 1892, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 were signed into law today by President Barack Obama. The legislation included two bipartisan provisions authored by Thompson, a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The first provision requires the Intelligence Community to compile a threat assessment of foreign drug traffickers that are increasingly turning to public lands in the United States to further their operations. This assessment will examine the ability of law enforcement and the intelligence community to gather, process, and share critical intelligence information regarding the presence of foreign drug traffickers on federal public lands. “Foreign drug traffickers and their illegal grow sites are threatening lives and destroying our public lands,” said Thompson. “Our law enforcement and intelligence community's response to this threat must be coordinated and unified in order to take our public lands back from these illegal activities, and that's what my provision in this bill requires.” “Having required threat assessments helps to identify resource allocations to enhanced law enforcement's ability to disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations' lucrative businesses in narcotics production and distribution,” said Tommy Lanier, Director of the National Marijuana Initiative. “For many years, drug trafficking organizations have invaded our national icons for the purpose of producing marijuana which poses a threat to the public and employees. Threat assessments will help to support public lands agencies in developing strategies to disrupt and dismantle these drug trafficking organizations thus supporting the mission in combating illegal drug production, distribution and demand.” Should this threat assessment identify any gaps or inefficiencies in the sharing of this information, this provision will require that these issues be corrected. Importantly, this provision does not authorize the use of any of the intelligence community's resources or assets to spy on U.S. citizens. The second provision to H.R. 1892 authored by Thompson requires the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to provide Congress with a full and classified report on the events surrounding the May 2011 Osama bin Laden raid. The report will include a description of the events leading up to the discovery of the location of Osama bin Laden, the planning and execution of the raid, and the results of the intelligence gained from the raid for the purposes of establishing a permanent account of this historic operation. A final copy of this report, including intelligence information and assessments used to generate this report will then be housed at the Center for the Study of Intelligence, based at the CIA. Thompson authored this provision with the help of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-14). “It is necessary that we know and never forget what actually happened in the bin Laden raid,” said Thompson. “We must recognize the amazing contributions of our intelligence community to this historic success, and that is why we need to document and preserve all that went into this operation, so that in the future, our history books will be accurate and complete.” H.R. 1892 was agreed to by unanimous consent by the United States Senate on December 14, 2011, and was later passed by a vote of 396-23 by the United States House of Representatives on December 16, 2011.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

12.21.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (FL-18) yesterday introduced H.R. 3761, The Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and their Families Act. The bi-partisan legislation cosponsored by 11 other members of Congress allows active duty soldiers and veterans who serve honorably to expedite the citizenship of their family members. “This legislation will help fix our broken immigration system that unnecessarily burdens active-duty service members and veterans who honorably serve our nation, and their families,” said Thompson. “The brave men and women who serve in our armed forces are willing to fight and die for our nation - the last thing they should have to worry about is their family's immigration status while they are on the battlefield.” “I am proud to cosponsor this piece of legislation. This bill will help veterans, who have served honorably, attain U.S. citizenship,” said Ros-Lehtinen. “It will also help reunite active-duty servicemen and women with their families. Our veterans and active-duty personnel are selfless patriots who have put their lives on the line so that we can enjoy the freedoms this country has to offer. This bill honors our brave men and women while helping promote family unity.” The Congressional Research Service reports that more than 45,000 non-citizens are serving in the United States Armed Forces (Air Force, Army, Marines, Navy, National Guard, Reserves). In addition, many U.S. citizens serving in the military have close non-citizen family members. Such individuals represent a significant portion of U.S. Armed Forces, and they often face daunting and complex immigration law and procedure. The Support and Defend Our Military Personnel and their Families Act addresses these immigration concerns of America's military personnel, our veterans, and their family members back home by: Helping Veterans Who Have Served Honorably Become U.S. Citizens: The legislation allows soldiers who serve honorably during times of war to become U.S. citizens expeditiously. Reuniting Lawful Permanent Residents Serving in Active-Duty with Family Members: The bill exempts immigrant petitions filed for the spouses and children of military personnel from numerical caps that limit the number of immigration petitions that can be granted each year. Preserving Family Unity of Military Personnel: The bill permits immediate family members of military personnel to apply for lawful immigration status, subject to all necessary criminal and security background checks; and codifies existing guidelines for placing active-duty soldiers or veterans into removal proceedings. H.R. 3761 has since been referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on Armed Services where it awaits further action.Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

12.19.2011	California Members of Congress who have led the effort to make the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) a more transparent and accountable process reacted today to the statement by Governor Brown and U.S. Interior Secretary Salazar. U.S. Representatives Mike Thompson (CA-1), George Miller (CA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-5), Jerry McNerney (CA-11) and John Garamendi (CA-10) wrote to Salazar in October, calling for the rescission of a signed MOA that was developed behind closed doors. In response, the process was opened up to brief public comment. The lawmakers submitted several public comments, as did hundreds of other individuals and local, state, and national organizations. The lawmakers released the following statements after today's announcement: “Today's announced agreement by Governor Brown and Secretary Salazar is nothing more than lipstick on a pig,” said Thompson. “This backroom deal creates a flawed process for moving forward that is not based on science and puts the interests of South-of-Delta water contractors before our farmers and fisherman. If this moves forward, families and small businesses that depend on the Delta would have their livelihood stripped away and the Delta's diverse wildlife would be destroyed. We need a BDCP plan that is transparent and based on sound science so that our Delta communities, businesses, wildlife and environment are not harmed.” “While the Secretary and the Governor are right that the Bay Delta Conservation Plan must be more open and transparent than it has been to date, they still haven't addressed the plan's fatal flaw: at the end of the day, this planning process is tainted as long as it's beholden to the special interests who are funding it,” said Miller. “Sanding off some of the rough edges won't cut it. That's a real problem for California, and for the hundreds of people and organizations who wrote in to request further changes - including water and wastewater utilities, local officials, hundreds of conservation organizations, commercial and recreational fishermen, the League of Women Voters, and other stakeholders across California. A new plan for the Bay-Delta won't work if the water exporters in the Central Valley and Southern California maintain their undue influence over what must be a public process. Today's announcement is just one small step in what must be a serious effort to improve the BDCP. It's going to take real leadership from the federal and state governments to truly re-balance this process.” “Unfortunately, the revisions made to the MOA do not address the potential detrimental consequences of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan to Northern California,” said Matsui. “Northern California, and the Sacramento region in particular, continue to be left out of the real decision making process. I am particularly concerned about impacts of the BDCP to the Sacramento region's flood protection. Without a study of the impacts of the proposed changes in the Yolo Bypass there is no way to determine how our flood system will change. Additionally, the plan calls for five water intakes to be constructed in Sacramento County, but no study has been done of these intakes that will forever change our landscape and river flow. Further, the indirect impact of guaranteeing water for South of Delta exporters, the beneficiaries of the BDCP, could have a tremendous impact on Northern Californians who do not stand to benefit from the BDCP. I am not satisfied that the BDCP has been properly vetted, or that its consequences for Sacramento and the entire Northern California region thoroughly examined.” “I am disappointed and upset that the Department of the Interior has decided to move forward with this Memorandum of Agreement,” said McNerney. “Despite a few changes, the MOA remains deeply flawed and is an affront to the people of the Delta communities. From its inception, the Bay Delta Plan has been crafted by, and for, water exporters from Southern California. They have used their economic power to influence the state and federal governments, and the Delta communities will suffer as a result. Make no mistake, the Delta communities and I will never accept a Bay Delta Plan that includes a peripheral canal that was conceived without our input. I will continue to stand with the families, farmers, and small business owners of the San Joaquin Delta whose livelihoods would be destroyed by a peripheral canal.” “The Bay Delta Conservation Plan process remains deeply flawed, and the voices of Northern California communities, farmers, fishermen, and recreation enthusiasts are being shut out from the conversation,” Garamendi said. “I will continue to raise concerns about this process so long as it continues to be controlled by well-connected water receivers who are more interested in draining the Sacramento River and Delta and less interested in smart, comprehensive water policies.”# # #
12.16.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) and Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-5) today lead a bi-partisan group of 19 members of Congress in sending a letter to the House leadership calling on them to extend Medicare health benefits to rural communities. The benefits include assistance for rural facilities and health providers to recruit and retain skilled practitioners, provide quality outpatient care and mental health services and respond to emergency health events. “Every person deserves access to high quality health care regardless of if they live in a big city, small town, or rural community,” said Thompson. “Congress must act to extend these benefits, like it has done many times before, to help ensure that the people living in rural areas can continue to receive the same level of health care services.” “Access to quality health care is a rapidly-growing challenge in Eastern Washington's rural communities,” said McMorris Rodgers. “To deal with that challenge, Congress has on previous occasions wisely enacted a number of programs to help rural health facilities and those they serve. It's critical that those programs be protected to ensure the health and well-being of the 1 in 4 Americans who live in our country's rural communities.” Approximately one fourth of all Americans live in rural areas that rely on local community hospitals, clinics and independent practices for their health care. Many of these facilities face significant challenges that these benefits help them overcome such as remote geographic location, small size, workforce scarcity, physician shortages, and constrained financial resources. In addition to the health benefits provided by these facilities, they also provide jobs to hard hit rural communities. The average Critical Access Hospital directly employs more than 100 people and provides more than $4 million in direct salary, wages and benefits. An independent physician in a rural area supports more than 20 jobs and provides $1 million in economic benefit to their communities. “These Medicare “extenders” are vital to ensuring rural health care facilities remain open. We commend Representatives McMorris Rodgers and Thompson for recognizing these challenges and working to extend these vital programs,” said Maggie Elehwany, Vice President of Government Affairs for the National Rural Health Association. “The Medicare “extender” provisions are vital to ensuring that rural hospitals, doctors and other health care professionals can provide needed emergency and primary care,” stressed Gail Nickerson, President California State Rural Health Association. “The expiration of Medicare extenders will inhibit the ability of hospitals and providers to recruit and retain professionals, negatively impact patient access, and will have a devastating impact on the economies of our rural communities, because health care is a major employer and business in most rural areas.” Below is the full text of the letter. December 15, 2011 The Honorable John A. Boehner Speaker of the House H-232, U.S. Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Eric Cantor House Majority Leader H-329, U.S. Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable Nancy Pelosi House Minority Leader H-204, U.S. Capitol Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Steny Hoyer House Minority Whip H-148, U.S. Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, Leader Cantor, and Whip Hoyer, Approximately one fourth of all Americans live in rural areas across our country-areas that take up around ninety percent of the country's total land mass. These areas rely on local community hospitals, clinics and independent practices as vital access points to critical health care. These facilities also provide critical jobs in hard hit rural areas. In fact, the average Critical Access Hospital (CAH) directly employs over 100 people and provides over $4 million in direct salary, wages and benefits. An independent physician in a rural area supports over 20 jobs and provides $1 million in economic benefit to their communities. Despite their intrinsic and vital nature to the rural delivery system and rural economy, many of these facilities face significant challenges- remote geographic location, small size, workforce scarcity, physician shortages, constrained financial resources among others. Because of these challenges, Congress has enacted a number of programs that help these facilities and other rural providers recruit and retain skilled practitioners, provide quality outpatient care and respond to emergency health events. These programs, which were extended in PL 111-309, have long received bipartisan support. Across the country, these programs have helped sustain fragile health care delivery systems and ensure that these facilities remain open. Because of the vital nature of these facilities and the fragile nature of the delivery system in rural areas, we urge you to extend these vital provisions as part of any current legislation.

12.14.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today released the following statement on House Majority's passage of their tax extension bill: “Congress has important work to do before we break for the holidays. We need to extend a payroll tax cut that will put about $1,000 into the pockets of the typical middle class family, we need to extend unemployment benefits for folks who are out of work through no fault of their own, and we must fix the Medicare physician payment rate so that our seniors' health care will not be disrupted. These extensions will cost money, and they should be paid for in a fiscally responsible and fair way. “However, the bill passed last night by the House Majority represents the wrong way forward for American families. The plan increases Medicare costs for millions of seniors, cuts unemployment insurance benefits for more than 500,000 Californians, increases taxes on working families by forcing large, end-of-the-year health care payments, reduces access to medical care in rural communities - and it does all of this while refusing to ask the wealthiest Americans to pay their fair share. “I voted against this approach because it hurts middle class families, those fighting to get into the middle class, and our seniors. I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come up with a fair and balanced plan that strengthens the middle class, protects our seniors, helps our economy grow and asks those who have benefited the most in the new economy to pay their fair share.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

12.14.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement in response to news yesterday that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is delaying the potential closure or consolidation of more than 3,700 local post offices and 252 mail processing facilities until at least mid-May, 2012. “The decision by the USPS to delay the possible closing of so many rural and economically important post offices and processing facilities shows that more input is needed before decisions are made,” said Thompson. “Closing these post offices would slow service, forcing seniors to wait longer for prescription drugs and Social Security checks, while isolating rural communities who would no longer have complete access to postal services. Consolidating processing facilities would put the jobs of hundreds of hard working men, women and their families on the chopping block, and in this economy losing those jobs in our community is something we can't afford.” The U.S. Postal Service agreed yesterday to delay the closing or consolidation of any Post Office or mail processing facility until May 15, 2012. The Postal Service will continue all necessary steps required for the review of these facilities during the interim period, including public input meetings.

12.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced a $2.5 million grant provided through the Department of Transportation's TIGER III grant program to the Smith River Rancheria to make roadway safety improvements along the heavily traveled U.S. Highway 101. Thompson worked with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood to secure these funds.“This grant will improve our road safety and strengthen our economy by putting people back to work renovating out-of-date infrastructure,” said Thompson. “Anyone who has driven along Highway 101 through the Rancheria knows these improvements are long overdue, and I will keep fighting for these smart investments that rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, create jobs, and most important, keeps people safe.” U.S. Highway 101 runs through the heart of the Rancheria. It is heavily traveled by thousands of California residents because of its proximity to the Tribe's medical clinic, Head Start building, cultural center, and various other heavily visited areas. This grant for the Smith River Rancheria will reduce traffic fatalities and injuries by improving walking and bicycling safety facilities along 1.3 miles of U.S. Highway 101 within Smith River Rancheria's ancestral lands. The facility features will include unique stamped shoulder treatments, new signage, and lighting to help calm traffic and enhance the community's identity. It will also make multi-state improvements to a nationally-significant highway, and increase economic opportunity in the region through “destination place-making” and expanded travel choice mobility. “We are so happy and excited about this announcement,” said Smith River Tribal Chairwoman Kara Brundin-Miller. “We view the tribe as a key part of this community and we believe this grant will help make this highway safer for everyone. We express our thanks to Congressman Thompson for his tireless efforts on behalf of this project.” This project was developed through a year-long regional planning process lead by the Smith River Rancheria. The Tribe worked with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), and the Del Norte Local Transportation Commission to develop and plan this needed improvement. This collaboration was the first of its kind by a Native American tribe with a Regional Transportation Planning Agency, FHWA, and state DOT. The Rancheria has already received funding assistance from Caltrans' and with this TIGER III grant will be ready to start construction on this project in the coming months. The Smith River Rancheria was originally established in 1908 in northwestern California. After losing much of its land during termination, the Rancheria has grown to over 500 acres today. Today, many of its 1200 members live in southern Oregon and northern California.

12.07.2011	Today 88 members of the U.S. House of Representatives called for an extension of the successful 1603 Treasury Grant Program supporting renewable energy projects, urging in a letter to House leaders that such an extension will continue a proven track record of job creation and promote further growth in domestic clean energy industries. Created in 2009, the 1603 program has provided essential financing for clean energy projects via grants in lieu of investment tax credits, and has created tens of thousands of jobs by leveraging more than $22.8 billion in private financing to support 22,000 renewable energy projects in all 50 states. Signatories of the letter - led by Reps. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Rush Holt (D-NJ), Paul Tonko (D-NY), Mike Thompson (D-CA), and backed by the House Sustainable Energy & Environment Coalition (SEEC) - argue that a failure to extend the 1603 program beyond its current December 31 expiration date would have significant adverse effects on American clean energy industries; shrinking the total financing available for renewable energy projects by 52 percent in 2012, and eliminating tens of thousands of jobs.“The 1603 Treasury Grant Program is a job creator and economic stimulator,” said Rep. Thompson. “It has created tens of thousands of jobs across the clean energy sector and pumped nearly 23 billion private sector dollars into the economy. Nearly 12,000 projects in my state of California have benefited. Congress must act to renew this program - it is good for our environment, good for our economy and helps reduce our dependence on foreign oil.” “It is absolutely essential that we extend the 1603 clean energy program to ensure that these job-creating projects continue to have access to financing and that we continue to lead the world in clean energy innovation,” said Rep. Blumenauer. “My office has received a flood of encouragement for continuing this program from businesses that are creating good jobs in Oregon, the urban and rural communities that these projects support, and from consumers interested in purchasing clean energy across America. With countries like China and Germany deploying renewables like solar and wind at a faster rate than the United States, we need to support the entrepreneurs and workers who are launching clean energy projects here in America.” “Congress must support innovation and job creation by extending the 1603 program,” said Rep. Holt. “At a time when our economy is already fragile, abandoning investment in the sustainable energy sector would cause the U.S. to lose even more high-tech jobs to our foreign competitors, and it would undermine the progress of much-needed new energy technologies.” “In the global race on clean energy and innovation, we must make certain that America finishes first,” said Rep. Tonko. “A critical step in remaining competitive is the extension of the 1603 Treasury program, which provides the necessary financing and investment to enable American ideas, American intellect and American know-how to develop the ideas and products of the future. This bold investment has helped create jobs, rebuild the economy and support small and large businesses nationwide - that's why it must be extended.” Last month over 750 small businesses, companies, and trade organizations wrote to Congress urging an extension of the highly successful 1603 program.Below is the text of the letter sent by the members of Congress: Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, Leader Cantor, and Whip Hoyer: We write to urge extension of the highly successful grant program for specified energy property in lieu of tax credits (the “1603 Treasury Grant Program”) before it expires on December 31, 2011. Since enactment, this program has leveraged more than $22.8 billion in private sector investment for 22,000 projects across the clean energy industry, including solar, wind, biomass, fuel cells, combined heat-and-power, and hydro, in all 50 states. Extension of this successful and effective program will create jobs, spur economic growth, and promote private sector development of clean energy technologies. Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, clean energy project developers primarily relied on tax equity partnerships with investors to utilize clean energy tax incentives. Since 2008, however, the availability of tax equity declined dramatically. According to a report issued by the Bipartisan Policy Center in March 2011, the number of tax equity investors shrunk by nearly half, with associated tax equity financing tumbling over 80 percent from $6.1 billion in 2007 to $1.2 billion in 2009. This decline severely limited the financing available for energy projects. Congress enacted the 1603 Treasury Grant Program to restore the availability of financing for renewable energy projects and to create domestic jobs in a hard hit sector of the economy. Under the program, developers receive a federal grant in lieu of the tax creditâ€”changing the timing of when the energy incentive can be claimed. This change in timing, however, provides the liquidity and funding needed to develop domestic energy projects. As a result, the program underpinned strong growth in the renewable energy sector during the current economic downturn. Despite some improvement, the tax equity market is still unable to support the clean energy industry adequately. In July 2011, the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance surveyed tax equity investors and found that expiration of the program would shrink the total financing available for renewable energy projects by 52 percent in 2012. Allowing the 1603 Treasury Grant Program to lapse would eliminate tens of thousands of jobs across all clean energy industries. Given the program's importance, as well as its proven record of success, we urge you to include its extension in any year-end legislation considered by the House.

11.21.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today released the following statement on the Deficit Reduction Super Committee's failure to reach an agreement to cut the national deficit:“The Super Committee's failure is yet another example of politics getting in the way of what's best for our country. The only reason we had a Super Committee in the first place was because some new Members of Congress were willing to take our economy over a cliff and we had to avoid an economic catastrophe. “Now that the Super Committee has failed, Congress has to do the job we were elected to do. We need to put partisan politics aside and take the steps necessary to get our fiscal house in order through an approach that is fair and balanced. That means creating jobs, cutting spending and putting responsible revenue policies in place. “There is a lot that can be done between the extremes to solve our fiscal crisis and I will continue to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to get our nation on a fiscally sustainable path.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

11.17.2011	Today, six Members of Congress sent a bipartisan letter authored by Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena, CA) and John Garamendi (D-Fairfield, CA) to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, commonly referred to as the “Super Committee,” urging them to “maintain the current revenue sharing for counties as it pertains to geothermal receipts.”“The geothermal energy produced in California's counties is not only good for our environment, it reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps our economy by spurring green job creation,” said Thompson. “The best way to reduce the deficit is by creating jobs because more jobs means greater revenues and less need for government assistance. If a community invests in developing geothermal energy they deserve to get their fair share in returns. I am strongly against cutting counties' share of geothermal revenue because that means cutting jobs, crippling future green job growth, and stifling our economic recovery - all of which will only make our deficit larger.” Members joining in the call to preserve geothermal energy revenue sharing include Representatives Mark Amodei (R-Carson City, NV), Lynn Woolsey (D-Petaluma, CA), Shelley Berkley (D-Las Vegas, NV), and Bob Filner (D-San Diego, CA). The Representatives joined in the call to promote energy independence and preserve this vital source of revenue for the counties that produce geothermal energy. “Geothermal energy is a crucial clean resource for creating jobs and securing our energy independence,” said Garamendi. “It is in our economic and national security interests to make our energy in America, which is why it's critical for the federal government to continue cultivating an environment for geothermal development.” Garamendi continued, “Communities that bear the burden of geothermal development deserve a fair share of its revenue. I strongly oppose any attempt to deprive these counties of funds for essential local services, including education and public safety.” "Geothermal royalties are extremely important to Lake County and it is absolutely essential that the federal government continue allocating a portion of these revenues to counties in order to help mitigate the local impacts of geothermal development,” said Kelly Cox, Lake County Administrative Officer. “Congressman Thompson's leadership on this issue has been outstanding. He and Congressman Garamendi completely understand why it would be wrong to take these revenues away from counties. Their continuing efforts to protect our community's interests are very much appreciated.” "Geothermal energy brings jobs and growth to Nevada with 20 plants in operation providing clean, reliable electrical capacity to the grid and significant additional capacity under development," said Congressman Amodei. "Given the important role of the counties in the development of this domestic energy source, it's only proper that they should share in the revenue of the federal receipts." “These geothermal receipts provide an important source of income for Imperial County, in my district. By promoting geothermal development and investing in renewable energy, we can create jobs for Americans!” said Congressman Filner. “Geothermal not only provides vital clean energy to power homes and businesses, it also creates good jobs in Nevada and I strongly support the continued expansion of this industry. At a time when counties in my home State are struggling to fund schools, public safety and other essential services for families, we must protect revenues from geothermal production that are now shared with local communities. Repealing the provision that provides these critical local dollars from geothermal royalties will only hurt county governments -- whether in Nevada or other states -- by limiting the resources they have available for economic development to create more jobs and to provide for the needs of those who call the towns and cities in these areas home,” said Congresswoman Shelley Berkley. “Geothermal energy is exactly the kind of renewable resource we should be investing in to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and point the way toward a sustainable future,” Congresswoman Woolsey said. “I join my colleagues in urging the Super Committee to preserve these subsidies, which support green jobs and help localities continue delivering vital services.” Please find the full text of the letter below. November 16, 2011 The Honorable Patty Murray Co-Chair, Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction 448 Russell Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Jeb Hensarling Co-Chair, Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction 129 Cannon House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 Dear Chairwoman Murray and Chairman Hensarling: We are writing to request that the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction maintain the current revenue sharing for counties as it pertains to geothermal receipts. In the bipartisan Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress decided that because of the high burdens geothermal production places on the counties where geothermal development is located, these counties should share in the revenue of the federal receipts. In turn, counties have used these revenues to pay for critical governmental services, such as road maintenance, public safety and law enforcement, and conservation easements. This revenue sharing has also made counties vested partners, and ultimately champions, in the continued development of geothermal energyâ€”a clean, renewable, and domestic energy source. There have been numerous proposals to discontinue geothermal revenue sharing for counties, including a provision in the President's Plan for Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction. We are strongly opposed to this provision. Ending the geothermal revenue sharing plan would have a significant negative impact on our districts, while the overall effect on our nation's fiscal well-being would be miniscule. Many of the counties that receive revenue from geothermal receipts are small, rural counties facing precarious budget situations. The loss of such revenue for these counties could result in the elimination or reduction of essential services. As such, we urge you not to include the repeal of geothermal revenue sharing with counties in any final agreement you may reach. We appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to working with you as you prepare your deficit reduction plan. Sincerely,Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

11.16.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today applauded passage of legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to rename the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office the “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building.” Congressman Thompson introduced this legislation, which passed today by voice vote, to honor Alejandro R. Ruiz Sr., a Medal of Honor winner who spent his career in the U.S. Army and served in World War II. After retirement, Ruiz lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, located in Napa County, California, until he passed away in 2009 at the age 85. “Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Sr. served his country with honor and distinction,” said Thompson. “During the Battle of Okinawa in World War II, he twice single-handedly stormed a Japanese machine gun bunker, and against all odds he silenced the bunker and saved the lives of fellow soldiers. It is my honor to lead the effort to rename the Yountville Veterans Home Post Office after one of its residents and heroes.” On April 28, 1945, Private First Class Ruiz was deployed to Okinawa. While patrolling in a ravine, his unit was ambushed by heavy and camouflaged machine gun fire. Every soldier except Ruiz and his squad leader was killed or injured. With his entire unit pinned down, Ruiz grabbed an automatic rifle and started his solo charge on the bunker. When he reached the bunker his rifle misfired. After beating back enemy soldiers he quickly ran back to where his unit was pinned down to retrieve another weapon. On his second charge towards the bunker he was shot in the leg by enemy fire. By himself he eliminated 12 enemy soldiers and saved the lives of the platoon members. The bill, H.R. 3004, to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 260 California Drive in Yountville, California, as the "Private First Class Alejandro R. Ruiz Post Office Building" was introduced on September 21, 2011. It was voted out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on November 3rd by unanimous consent. It is cosponsored by all 52 members of the California Congressional Delegation. Ruiz was born in Loving, New Mexico to Mexican immigrants. Of the 3,400 Medals of Honor that Presidents of the United States have awarded, only 44 have been awarded to someone of Hispanic descent. Of the 55,000 residents to have lived at the Yountville Veterans Home, only five have been awarded the Medal of Honor. Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep.

11.10.2011	Senator Jeff Merkley (OR) and Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today jointly introduced the Klamath Basin Economic Restoration Act in the Senate and House. The legislation would implement a comprehensive plan, developed through a multi-year collaborative effort among farmers, ranchers, fishermen, Tribal leaders, and conservationists, to settle one of the nation's most volatile water wars. According to an analysis released by the U.S. Department of the Interior, the removal of four dams on the Klamath River would create more than 4,600 jobs in the basin, including hundreds of jobs in fishing and agriculture, while restoring historical habitat for salmon, steelhead and other fish and wildlife.“The agreements that are in place represent the best way forward for the Klamath River Basin and its communities - now it is time for Congress to put these agreements into action,” said Thompson. “The dam removals will not only benefit our river basin by restoring fish and wildlife habitats, it will strengthen our economy by creating more than 4,600 jobs.”“This legislation is proof that through collaboration and hard work we can move beyond the disputes of the past and create a stronger foundation for economic growth,” said Senator Jeff Merkley. “This legislation will provide a brighter future for the Klamath Basin - putting people to work and improving the economy for farmers and fishermen alike.” The Klamath Basin Economic Restoration Act authorizes the implementation of the Klamath Basin Restoration Agreement (KBRA) and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement (KHSA). The two agreements jointly envision a collaborative approach to natural resource management and economic and environmental restoration. In addition, they settle decades of water rights disputes and other litigation over natural resources in the region. Specifically, the legislation: Approves both agreements and authorizes the U.S. Department of Interior to sign and implement the KBRA, implement the KHSA and take the necessary steps to move the agreement forward. Changes or establishes federal policy to assist implementation of the agreements Establishes a process to plan for and implement dam removal. Scientific analysis cited by Interior anticipates significant benefits to commercial salmon fishermen. With removal of the dams, Coho would reclaim 68 miles of historical habitat, steelhead - the Klamath River's most popular sport fish - would regain 420 miles of historical habitat, and commercially harvested Chinook salmon production would increase by more than 80 percent. All together, eleven coastal counties in Oregon and California would gain more than 400 jobs as a result of improved fishing conditions. Studies done by the Department of Interior estimate that the reliability of the water supply that would be gained through the legislation would boost gross farm income and add between 70 and 695 jobs annually to the agricultural economy. Glen Spain, Northwest Director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations emphasized, “Our rural communities simply can't afford to do nothing. That's a recipe for another round of catastrophes like the fish kill and irrigation shut-off. We desperately need Congress to act now.” “This legislation represents a significant step forward to resolving the conflict in the Klamath Region and we are extremely grateful for efforts of Congressman Thompson and look forward to working with him to get legislation signed into law,” said Thomas O'Rourke, Chairman of the Yurok Tribe. “The Yurok Tribe has worked hard to forge relationships and come to agreements that are in the mutual interest of all parties involved. Now, Congress needs to act so we can begin restoring the Klamath River Basin.” “When disaster hit and litigation got drawn out, we were challenged by elected officials to develop our own solutions to the water crises that have devastated our communities,” said Steve Kandra, one of 1,400 family farmers on Bureau of Reclamations' Klamath project. “Together we did it and we're part of a strong and growing constituency that expects our elected officials to seize this opportunity to end the Klamath Crisis.” The total cost of removing the dams and embarking on the environmental restoration called for in this legislation is estimated to be $536 million in Federal funds, which will be matched by $550 million in non-Federal funds.###
11.02.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced more than $24,000 in Rural Development funds for Yokayo Biofuels, Inc. in Ukiah. The funds are used to provide payments to producers to support an expanding production of advanced biofuel. Yokayo Biofuels, Inc. uses waste vegetable oil as feedstock to produce biodiesel. “Yokayo Biofuels is a model of how green businesses can grow our economy,” said Thompson. “Not only are biofuels good for our environment, growing the biofuel industry will lessen our dependence on foreign oil and spur green job creation.” The funding is being provided through USDA's Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels. Under this program, payments are made to eligible producers to support and ensure an expanding production of advanced biofuels. Payments are based on the amount of biofuels a recipient produces from renewable biomass. Eligible examples include biofuels derived from cellulose; crop residue; animal, food and yard waste material; biogas (landfill and sewage waste treatment gas); vegetable oil, and animal fat. "2010 was a rough year for biodiesel, but thanks to increased funding from government agencies this year, including this grant from the USDA, Yokayo Biofuels has been able to increase its staff from ten to eighteen employees, and is well-positioned to continue growing." said Kumar Plocher, CEO and founder of Yokayo Biofuels, Inc. This grant is in addition to an $110,000 grant awarded by the USDA last month to Yokayo Biofuels for Biodiesel Trans Esterification - the process of transforming grease into fuel. Thompson supports the USDA's investment in local companies like Yokayo to build a biofuels industry that grows our green economy and reduces our dependence on foreign oil. Through this program the USDA is supporting the research, investment and infrastructure necessary to build a biofuels industry that creates jobs and conserves natural resources across America.

10.31.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today honored the â€˜Ladies of the Lake Quilt Guild' at a reception hosted in their honor for their years of hand-making quilts for the Wounded Warriors Project. “These hand-made quilts are truly a labor of love,” said Thompson. “The Ladies of the Lake Quilt Guild work hard to make certain that the men and women from our county who have served our nation and have been injured receive a hand-made quilt. It is an honor to present these 22 individuals with official Congressional Certificates of recognition.” The national Wounded Warrior Project, which the â€˜Ladies of the Lake Quilt Guild' locally participate in, began when several veterans and friends, moved by stories of the first wounded service members returning home from Afghanistan and Iraq, took action to help others in need. What started as a program to provide comfort items to wounded service members has grown into a complete rehabilitative effort to assist warriors as they recover and transition back to civilian life. “Making sure our veterans are cared for and shown appreciation when they return home is what the Ladies of the Lake Quilt Guild is all about,” continued Thompson. “They dedicate hours of time and work into making quilts as a token of appreciation from our community to those who put their lives on the line to help keep us free.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.28.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today applauded the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) vote to help expand broadband to millions of underserved Americans. The FCC reforms, approved yesterday, will pave the way for robust broadband coverage across rural America, ensuring the nearly 18 million people without broadband access have affordable and reliable service. “Yesterday's vote will help expand broadband to rural America and means more jobs and greater access to high-speed internet for our schools, hospitals, libraries and community centers,” said Thompson. “The â€˜Connect America Fund' will create rural anchor institutions throughout our district, allowing folks access to more educational opportunities, better job training and advanced telemedicine. In our digital world access to high-speed internet is essential to everything from running a business, to operating a health center or teaching in a 21st century classroom and yesterdays' announcement will help increase these possibilities in rural communities.” In a significant step toward expanding access for Americans to high-speed Internet, wherever they live, the FCC voted unanimously to comprehensively reform its Universal Service Fund. Previously created to ensure every home in America has a telephone line, this system has been widely viewed as broken, and long overdue for reform. Efforts to expand high-speed Internet to rural America over the next six years will increase economic growth by $50 billion over that period, the FCC estimates. These reforms create a new Connect America Fund with an annual budget of no more than $4.5 billion, which will extend broadband infrastructure to the millions of Americans who currently have no access to broadband. As a result, yesterday's action has the potential to be one of the biggest job creators in rural America in decades. The FCC estimates that approximately 500,000 jobs will be created over the next six years by expanding high-speed Internet access to over 7 million Americans living in rural areas. And by increasing the overall size of the U.S. marketplace, small Main Street businesses across the country will benefit from the opportunity to sell to new customers. "Access Humboldt applauds the FCC action yesterday to establish the Connect America Fund which will help to support broadband communications access in remote rural places, such as the North Coast of California, that have not been well served by legacy providers and universal service mechanisms,” said Sean McLaughlin, Executive Director of Access Humboldt. “We particularly appreciate the constructive efforts of our Congressman Mike Thompson to support community broadband developments, such as recently funded projects of the Yurok and Karuk Tribes, which will help our local communities to develop appropriate local solutions to meet local needs." "The Broadband Alliance of Mendocino County is grateful to the FCC for their significant action to connect all Americans, especially in rural areas, to high-speed Internet. Without the government's monetary support, it cannot happen. Broadband access is as important as being connected to the electrical grid," said Jim Moorehead, Steering Committee Chair of the Mendocino Broadband Alliance. "We trust that the FCC will truly make this UNIVERSAL to make sure ALL residences and businesses are connected with the minimum downloads specified in the National Broadband Plan. It is an imperative to offer this equality of access for all no matter where they are since so much communication with government and most businesses in being required to be done online. Choosing a rural lifestyle should not penalize areas like Mendocino County where currently only approximately 50% have access to true high-speed Internet. BAMC is doing its part and we appreciate being supported in this work by the FCC."Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.28.2011	Today, the Department of the Interior announced a brief window for public comment on a controversial Memorandum of Agreement relating to the Bay Delta Conservation Plan. This announcement follows the ongoing efforts of five Northern California Members of Congress who have repeatedly called on the Interior Department to rescind the document, noting that it was developed behind closed doors and that it gives water export agencies south of the Delta and in Southern California unprecedented influence over an important public process concerning California's precious fresh water supplies. U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-1), George Miller (CA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-5), Jerry McNerney (CA-11) and John Garamendi (CA-10) responded today that although a public comment period on the flawed agreement is an important step, it is insufficient to fix the problem. The Members reiterated that Interior must retract its support for the document and allow a minimum of 45 days for public comment, and that the process be opened up to include other key stakeholders left out of the discussions, including Bay Area, Delta and coastal communities, farmers, businesses, and fishermen. In addition, the members encouraged their constituents to participate in the limited public comment period. Under today's announcement, comments may be submitted by e-mail to BDO@usbr.gov or by mail to the Bureau of Reclamation, Bay-Delta Office, 801 I Street, Ste. 140, Sacramento, CA 95814. Comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on Wednesday, November 16, 2011. The lawmakers who sent the letter responded today to the announcement:“The Department of Interior has been pushing off the concerns of families and small businesses in the Bay Delta region for far too long. Its most recent response is completely unsatisfactory - giving these people just two weeks to weigh in on a project that is five years in the making,” said Rep. Thompson (CA-1). “I will continue to push the Department toward a contemplative, deliberate and open process that ensures that the Bay-Delta is restored and the needs of local communities are protected.” “This is an important step, but there's still have a lot of work to be done before we can be sure that this process is fair, equal and transparent, and that this plan is good for the Bay-Delta and our communities. The failure of the Secretary to withdraw the Department's endorsement of this flawed agreement leaves the special interests in the driver's seat and the public interest in the back seat,” said Rep. George Miller, (CA-7). “While I am pleased that the public will now be given an opportunity to give input on this MOA making the document more open and transparent, no one should have to ask for this type of disclosure on a project that will change our water system forever. The process must be transparent so that each region's needs are appropriately represented. In regards to the Sacramento region's needs in particular, we must ensure our flood protection needs are being met,” said Rep. Doris Matsui (CA-5). “As it stands, the Bay Delta Plan has been crafted without the input of the people who reside in the Delta region. While this short period for public comment is a step in the right direction, this announcement falls short of what is needed. More must be done to make it a truly fair process. I will continue to stand with the families, businesses and farmers who oppose any BDCP that includes a peripheral canal,” said Rep. McNerney (CA-11). “Agriculture is the lifeblood of the Delta region, and a canal would devastate the local economy, turn our farms into salty marshes, and cost our region millions of dollars and countless jobs.” “The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is critical to sustaining the life of communities across California and is an ecosystem of national significance,” said Congressman John Garamendi (CA-10). “I have worked for decades to protect this vital resource by building consensus and including all stakeholders. By contrast, the Bay Delta Conservation Plan has been an exclusionary closed-door operation on a recklessly short time table. The current Memorandum of Agreement must be rescinded and a new agreement forged, so that all interested parties have equal standing in the Bay Delta Conservation Plan process. I join my colleagues in calling for an open, inclusive and deliberative process that protects the ecology of the Delta for all Californians.” The lawmakers recently held a series of meetings with Interior Department and California officials to express their concerns about the Memorandum of Agreement that the Department signed with water export agencies, an agreement that was developed and signed without input from Bay-Delta stakeholders. The letter sent on Monday requested a written response from Secretary Salazar, and explained that the process as it currently stands has established an unrealistic timeline for the completion of the plan, and raises expectations of favorable outcomes for the water agencies that signed it. The full text of the Oct. 24th letter is below. _____ October 24, 2011 The Hon. Kenneth Salazar Secretary, Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, N.W. Washington DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar: We are writing to follow up our recent meetings with Interior officials and other participants in the Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) and to express our strong objections to the current direction of that plan. The constituents we represent have a great deal at stake in the future of the BDCP process and ultimate plan. Delta, Bay Area and coastal communities, residents of the floodplain, farmers, businesses, fishermen, and the rest of our constituents could be profoundly affected by the BDCP. But to date, the BDCP planning process has failed to treat these affected groups in a fair and transparent manner, and we do not believe that the emerging plan is reflecting Bay-Delta constituencies' concerns and interests. Specifically, it does not appear that the federal government is taking seriously the goal of restoring endangered salmon or that it intends to operate the Central Valley Project to meet the statutory mandate to protect, restore, and enhance fish, wildlife, and associated habitats. Furthermore, we cannot accept proposals - including ones under consideration by the BDCP - that would harm Delta communities and the regional economy by eroding water quality for drinking and agriculture. This is a critical moment, and we urge you to take concrete corrective actions now so that the BDCP process can succeed. Your Department recently signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) with certain state and federal water export agencies that excluded other stakeholders. That agreement offers the signatories unprecedented influence over the process, and it raises expectations of favorable outcomes. While we appreciate your outreach to the Delta counties and to the environmental NGOs since the signing of the agreement, the existence of this unfair agreement continues to taint the process and must be withdrawn. At a minimum, we believe that Interior should retract its approval of the MOA and allow for a public comment period of 45 days. The MOA creates a number of serious problems. For example, this agreement binds BDCP participants to an unrealistic timeline that has the serious potential to rush the many important decisions that have thus far been put off, avoid a full consideration of alternatives, and undermine the much-needed scientific analyses that remain to be done - analyses that many of the agreement's signatories have resisted. In addition, the MOA describes long-term guarantees of certainty to federal water contractors as “an essential element of a successful BDCP.” This is an unreasonable standard to establish, especially as no equivalent assertions have been offered to any other BDCP participants. We are additionally concerned that establishing certainty for the contractors as an “essential element” of the BDCP is in conflict with the many other federal responsibilities in play in the BDCP, such as doubling the populations of salmon and other anadromous fish as required by law, providing necessary water for wildlife refuges, preserving water quality and availability for Delta agriculture, and meeting the needs of other water users. The agreement further establishes an unequal process going forward: the MOA invites the water export contractors to collaborate with the federal agencies on the responses to public comments, allows the water export contractors early and exclusive access to draft consultant work product, and gives the water export contractors direct control over the consultants who are writing the documents. California's Legislative Analyst's Office recently testified before the State Assembly about additional provisions of this document that “may be seen as favorable to the contractors,” including the fact that a public NEPA document may not be issued without explicit authorization from the water export contractors. This raises very serious questions about whose process this is, ultimately; if the water export contractors' funding has given them control over the process, it would be to the detriment of the Bay-Delta and to the public interest. The above concerns â€” along with the many others we have raised in our recent meetings â€” share several worrying traits. These are positions sought by the same handful of state and federal water contractors that have long dominated the BDCP process. They have the potential to harm the Bay-Delta, fishing communities, local farmers, and our constituents more broadly. They compromise Interior's ability to exercise its mandates to restore the Bay-Delta ecosystem and California's fisheries, and to consider the interests of all stakeholder groups. And they were developed in closed-door negotiations with the water export contractors that excluded all other interests. Because we have not yet received a response to our request, we reiterate it here: Interior should immediately rescind this flawed MOA and work instead to establish a successful BDCP process that is transparent and based on parity, and that genuinely puts the restoration of the Bay-Delta and its fisheries, the needs of local communities, and the quality of local water resources on par with other water supply goals. That includes:Ensuring that all stakeholder involvement is fair, equal and transparent: all stakeholder groups should have equal access to BDCP draft documents and consultant products and equal ability to provide direction to BDCP consultants, and meetings involving the export contractors, state and federal agencies and the BDCP consultants should be open to all stakeholders. Establishing a realistic timeline that allows sufficient time to address the serious unanswered questions remaining before the BDCP, conduct the appropriate scientific reviews including of all alternatives, and comply with NEPA and other relevant statutes. Genuinely committing to the co-equal goals: any “certainty” under consideration for the water export contractors must be matched by equal, specific, and certain commitments to restoring the Bay-Delta to health as required by state and federal law. Maintaining state and federal agencies' ability to implement other statutory mandates including, but not limited to, the CVPIA's anadromous fish restoration program (including B2 water, the Restoration Fund, and other activities), the refuge water supply program, Trinity River restoration, and the requirement that beneficiaries must pay for the mitigation of any project. Ensuring that any final BDCP preserves water quality and water availability for farmers, families, and businesses in the Bay-Delta area, and preserves flood protection for communities in the region. We are disappointed that we find ourselves in the present situation, and that the interests of our constituents are still facing these hurdles at this stage of the BDCP process. The public interest and the stewardship of the Department require that transparency and equal participation must be reestablished for all stakeholders in the BDCP as soon as possible. To that end, we reiterate our request for corrective action as to this MOA, and as you consider the Department's next steps regarding the BDCP, we seek your commitment that you provide us with advance notice when making determinations that would affect our constituents. For all of the reasons detailed above, we request a written response to this request by October 31. Sincerely,Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.24.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) and four other Northern California Members of Congress are demanding answers on the current state of the Bay-Delta planning process and calling on the Interior Department today to rescind a “flawed” Memorandum of Agreement that was developed behind closed doors and that gives water export agencies south of the Delta and in Southern California unprecedented influence over an important public process concerning California's precious fresh water supplies. Thompson and U.S. Reps. George Miller (CA-7), Doris Matsui (CA-5), Jerry McNerney (CA-11) and John Garamendi (CA-10) wrote today to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar asking that the recent agreement between the Department and water agencies be rescinded and that the process be opened up to include other key stakeholders left out of the discussions, including Bay Area, Delta and coastal communities, farmers, businesses, and fishermen. “The Department of Interior should immediately take the necessary steps to repair this imbalanced and unfair agreement and I am confident that after reviewing the facts put forward in the letter that they will do just that,” said Thompson. “I am committed to making sure terms are reached where the Bay-Delta is restored and the needs of local communities are protected, and that is why I will keep working with Interior and the BDCP Management Committee to come up with a fair and balanced path forward.” The lawmakers recently held a series of meetings with Interior Department and California officials to express their concerns about the Memorandum of Agreement that the Department signed with water export agencies, an agreement that was developed and signed without input from Bay-Delta stakeholders. The Department had previously told the lawmakers to expect an answer to their inquiries early last week, but failed to meet that deadline. Today's letter from the lawmakers requests a written response from Secretary Salazar by the beginning of next week. Excerpt: “the BDCP planning process has failed to treat these affected groups in a fair and transparent manner, and we do not believe that the emerging plan is reflecting Bay-Delta constituencies' concerns and interests.The members wrote that the process as it currently stands has established an unrealistic timeline for the completion of the plan, and that it raises expectations of favorable outcomes for the water agencies that signed it.

10.24.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) last week hosted small business roundtable discussions in Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The roundtables provided an opportunity for small business leaders to participate in an open dialogue about ways the federal government can help small businesses get loans, grow and create jobs. “I'm here listening to the needs of small businesses because I know small businesses are America's job creators,” said Thompson. “Getting these small businesses going by making smart investments, reducing regulations and increasing access to credit is one way we'll get our economy going - and get folks working again.” Small businesses are central to job creation, employing roughly one-half of all Americans and accounting for about 60 percent of gross job creation. Among the top issues the small business leaders and Thompson discussed were smart investments to create jobs, the review and elimination of burdensome regulations, and easier access to lending opportunities. Thompson helped pass the Small Business Jobs Act which created a new lending fund for small businesses. Thompson is also a part of the Blue Dogs Task Force on Oversight and Regulatory Review, a group that reviews regulations to make sure Congressional intent is appropriately followed, and regulatory burdens and costs are reduced. During the roundtable discussions Thompson also discussed the need for Congress to take further action to help small businesses. “Small businesses have been hit hard by the recession, and Congress needs to do more to help them get back on their feet,” said Thompson. “That is why we need to start working across the aisle on common-sense solutions that help small businesses, and refocus our attention on what should have been the House Majority's top priority all along: creating jobs.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today joined 32 members of the California Democratic Congressional Delegation in sending a letter to President Obama urging him and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to act immediately to address our country's troubled housing market. More than 2 million homeowners in California owe more on their homes then their homes are worth, which equals 30 percent of all California homes with mortgages.“Our economy will continue to suffer and taxpayer confidence will never return if we do not help hard working families navigate through this mortgage nightmare,” said Thompson. “Nothing the FHFA or the Administration has done is working and Californians are the ones who are suffering. Families are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep roofs over their heads. Doing nothing is not an option. Today we are calling on the White House and the FHFA to step up and take immediate action to help our communities and hard working middle-class families who just want to keep their homes.”Specifically, the letter calls on President Obama to: Urge the Federal Housing Finance Agency to establish a plan to refinance all mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Push for a major principal reduction plan for underwater homeowners, such as modifications in coordination with Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. Institute a “Homeowner's Bill Of Rights” that would apply to Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), the Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA, The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and private servicer modification programs and include the following: Make the process homeowner-friendly: Ensure a single point of contact; require servicers to review documents within a timely fashion and disclose information; and ban “advanced fees.” Eliminate needless obstacles to effective modifications: Allow for flexibility in the debt to income ratio; end the requirement that homeowners be delinquent in order to be eligible for a loan modification; end dual tracking; and require that servicers not report adverse credit information while trial or permanent modification is underway; Ensure accountability and establish an appeals process: Create an Office of Consumer Advocate; conduct random audits of modifications; and establish an independent appeals process for homeowners who believe their modification has been improperly rejected or handled in violation of program rules Full text of letter below: October 11, 2011 The President The White House Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Obama: As Members of Congress from California, we are writing to express our continuing concerns about the ongoing housing market decline and the manner in which the financial institutions are handling delinquent mortgages, mortgage modifications, and foreclosures. We believe that these institutions are failing to act in good faith and that there are immediate steps your Administration should be taking to address the devastating problems facing homeowners. On October 4, 2010, we wrote to your Administration requesting help for struggling homeowners who were at the mercy of mortgage servicers. Our letter included dozens of cases from throughout California that highlighted systemic problems in the way financial institutions handle mortgages and the foreclosure process. Since then, we have held meetings with the Secretary of Treasury, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and others outlining the enormous obstacles facing our constituents who are trying to save their homes. Additionally, in March 2011, a group of Members requested a meeting with the Vice President to discuss ways the Administration can be helpful. We continue to hear from our constituents that servicers are uncooperative, misleading and even deliberately obstructive and we have not seen successful efforts from your Administration in response. In September 2011, RealtyTrac released data that showed that one in every 226 housing units in California had a foreclosure filing during the month of August alone - more than twice the national average. The data also showed that California had a staggering 55% increase in foreclosure notices in August, the second highest in the nation. Numerous reports indicate that our housing troubles are worsening. Each foreclosure represents a missed opportunity for a family to stay in its home. We cannot afford to allow this to continue. We therefore respectfully urge you to take the following actions:Urge the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to use its conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to allow all mortgages currently owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that meet basic criteria the opportunity to refinance at historically low market rate. This would allow homeowners to reduce their monthly mortgage payment by hundreds of dollarsâ€”reducing the number of defaults and preventing foreclosure. Secure a far greater number of meaningful principal reductions for underwater homeowners. One promising possibility would be a temporary reduction in the interest rates of certain homeowners who file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, so that the entirety of their monthly payments would go to paying down their principal balances for five years. Coordination with the bankruptcy process would make these reductions more likely to succeed than other types of loan modifications, while also limiting the program to those who truly need it and avoiding the administrative failures that have plagued many other initiatives. Such a plan could be implemented for mortgages held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as we believe that such a plan would be entirely consistent with FHFA's obligation to minimize taxpayer losses in the Enterprises. This plan could also be implemented as part of the nationwide settlement currently being negotiated by a group of state attorneys general. Institute a “Homeowner's Bill Of Rights” that would apply to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Veterans Affairs, Home Affordable Mortgage Program, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and private servicer modification programs and include the following: Make the process homeowner-friendly: Establish a single point of contact; require servicers to review documents within a timely fashion and disclose information about the process; and ban “advanced fees.” Eliminate needless obstacles to effective modifications: Allow for flexibility in the debt to income ratio; end the requirement that homeowners be delinquent in order to be eligible for a loan modification; cease dual tracking; and prohibit servicers from reporting adverse credit information while trial or permanent modification is underway. Ensure accountability and establish an appeals process: Create an Office of Consumer Advocate; conduct random audits of modifications; and establish an independent appeals process for homeowners who believe their modifications have been improperly rejected or handled in violation of program rules. These are actions that can be taken immediately by your Administration to help address the overwhelming problems facing our constituents. We understand that these are not the only actions that must be taken, and we will continue to work in Congress on behalf of struggling homeowners to encourage recovery in the housing market and to prevent similar problems in the future. Our current economic crisis began in the housing market. Until the housing market is stabilized, our economy will not be able to fully recover. We hope you will act in the best interest of the American people who are facing extreme hardships to keep homeowners in their homes and stabilize the economy.

10.07.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement on the ten year anniversary of the war in Afghanistan: “Today marks the ten year anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, the longest running war in our nation's history. It is important we honor and recognize the sacrifices our military, intelligence communities and their families have made. However, I strongly believe we must immediately withdraw our young men and women from this war. “Our military's counter-insurgency campaign in Afghanistan has not shown the results that our military leaders expected and that the American people demand. Over the last 10 years, we have lost more than 1,800 young men and women and our country has spent close to $450 billion fighting this war, while our partner in the Afghan government remains mired in corruption. Meanwhile, the threat posed by Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations like it continues to spread across the globe. “Instead of fighting this never-ending war in Afghanistan, we need a counterterrorism strategy that targets al Qaeda wherever they operate - whether that be in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Europe and even right here in the United States. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on eliminating al Qaeda around the world.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.06.2011	U.S. Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-1), Doris Matsui (CA-5), George Miller (CA-7) and Anna G. Eshoo (CA-14) today issued the following statements after meeting with the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Acting Director Edward DeMarco: “Our economy will continue to suffer and taxpayer confidence will never return if we do not help hard working families navigate through this mortgage nightmare,” said Thompson. “Taxpayers watched as the big banks and bankers were bailed out and now they are losing their homes as their government and the FHFA watches. Nothing the FHFA or the Administration has done has worked. This is unacceptable. I call on Acting Director DeMarco and the Administration to take action to help our families that are living paycheck to paycheck, struggling to keep roofs over their heads. Our mortgage crisis is a shared crisis, hurting not only those taxpayers caught in the housing disaster, but also their families, friends and our communities.” “Communities like my hometown of Sacramento continue to reel as a result of the financial meltdown the big banks caused, yet these same banks continue to stand by and do almost nothing to help those who are struggling,” said Matsui. “Meanwhile, refinancing plans have not been effective enough for Sacramento families. It is critical that lending institutions step up now and work with responsible homeowners seeking affordable loan modifications to keep their families in their homes. Today Acting Director DeMarco heard very clearly from members of the Housing Stabilization Task Force - including myself - that the FHFA must do more to stabilize our nation's housing market. Current programs are not doing enough for families in my district - and that must start changing immediately.” “My constituents are being chewed up and tossed out by the largest companies in this country - and so far, we haven't seen enough done to help them out of this mess,” said Miller after the meeting. “Today's meeting was about one thing - sending a message in the strongest possible terms that the Obama Administration must take the concerns of our homeowners seriously. Our constituents must be heard, and the Administration should focus their efforts on helping homeowners, not big banks.” "There has been a complete failure on the part of the Obama Administration to address the catastrophic wave of home foreclosures across the country, leaving families in despair and wreaking havoc in countless communities,” said Eshoo. “In order for our economy to expand, an effective policy must be put into place to turn this devastation of housing around. The Administration's weak responses have barely touched 'the tip of the iceberg,' and today's meeting with FHFA Acting Director Edward Demarco was a deeply disappointing one, with few answers and fewer solutions. My constituents deserve so much better than this."

10.06.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement on the Willits Bypass Mitigation Plan after being informed it was complete and available for public review: “Bringing the Willits Bypass to completion is a top priority,” said Thompson. “I appreciate the time and effort that the Army Corps of Engineers in San Francisco and Caltrans have put into creating the Willits Bypass and what I hope will be a model mitigation plan for our area. I will continue to work with all stakeholders while also ensuring that this project meets all of the necessary federal and state regulations.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

10.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today presented Judge Raymond Guadagni with the Angels in Adoption Pin and Certificate for his outstanding advocacy of adoption and foster care. The Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI), which orchestrates the Angels in Adoption program, honored more than 190 Angels at their annual gala. The Angels in Adoption program is CCAI's signature public awareness campaign and provides an opportunity for Members of Congress to honor the good work of their constituents who have enriched the lives of foster children and orphans in the United States and abroad.“Judge Raymond Guadagni has been instrumental in enriching so many families in Napa County though his work on the bench approving adoptions,” said Thompson. “He is part of the families he brings together, baking a cake for every adoption he finalizes. I still remember when my family was given a cake from Justice Guadagni when my niece was adopted into our family. There is no one more deserving of the Angels in Adoption award, and I am honored to have the opportunity to present him with it.” Ray Guadagni was a Napa County Commissioner from 1995 - 2001. During that time, he was overseeing dependency court. It was during this time that he demonstrated his care regarding foster youth. He started a number of programs to assist in their reunification with family and, if that didn't work, he terminated parental rights and granted adoptions. He started Peer Court, Juvenile Drug Court, SARMS (a substance abuse court program for parents in the dependency process), and attended all the foster care Christmas parties, dressing up as Santa Claus to give out presents to all the children. In 2001, he became a Superior Court Judge; however, this didn't stop his interest in working with foster youth. He started a book club at Chamberlain High School, a probation high school, and communicated with the youth through emails to discuss books. He attended many of their functions. But Ray really demonstrated his care through each adoption. Ray turned each one into a special event for the family, baking a cake for the after-court festivities and giving each adoptee a teddy bear. In addition, he created a "sibling agreement,” suitable for framing, whereby the sibling promises to love and care for the newest member of the family. Even though Ray no longer sits on the juvenile calendar, he still shows an interest in youth and continues to preside over most of the adoptions, cake and teddy bears included. Most recently, he started a program for foster youth as they are ready to leave the system. It is a program that gives youth information about college and vocational programs, and helps them see that it is possible to continue their education. He brought together child welfare services, probation, Napa Valley College, VOICES and education to make this possible. It is now in its third year.

10.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) again today voiced his concerns with a plan that would take water away from the Delta region. Joined by Representatives George Miller, Doris Matsui, Jerry McNerney, John Garamendi, Thompson met with Jerry Meral, the Deputy Secretary of the California Natural Resource Agency to express his grave concern over any Bay Delta Conservation Plan (BDCP) that could adversely affect the Delta Region. Meral is the senior state official who oversees the BDCP.“Needlessly rushing the scientific review of the Bay Delta Conservation Plan is simply irresponsible, and that is what I told the Bay Delta Conservation Plan officials today," said Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-01). "We know all-too-well the consequences of bad water policy combined with impractical deadlines. In Humboldt and Del Norte Counties, expedited review of the Klamath River project resulted in the death of 68,000 Chinook Salmon. Are we really considering walking down the same road again? We need sound, science-based solutions that don't harm our wildlife or environment." 2009 saw the lowest return of Sacramento fall-run Chinook on record - less than 40,000 adult fish, a decline of over 90 percent from the historical average of 450,000. Low returns have resulted in the closure of the salmon fishery and the loss of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in the fishing industry. Beyond its importance for fish, keeping enough water flowing through the Delta is also essential to maintain habitat used by millions of migratory birds along the Pacific Flyway and the associated economies which generate billions of dollars for the state each year. This excessive water diversion harms the wildlife and ecology of Delta and the economies that it drives. “I will continue to be a strong advocate for the people of the entire Delta region to ensure that the water resources we need remain in place,” said Congressman McNerney. “Steps must be taken now to ensure that the BDCP serves the best interests of our region, and insisted that the voice of the Delta be heard.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.30.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement regarding the death of Anwar al-Awlaki:"Today our nation delivered a huge blow to Al-Qaeda with the elimination of Anwar al-Awlaki,” said Rep. Thompson. “Operationally, Anwar al-Awlaki was as significant as Osama Bin Laden, as he was an extremely dangerous and charismatic leader who conspired to murder innocent Americans. Al-Awlaki was behind several high-profile attacks including the failed attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound plane on Christmas Day in 2009 and his death is yet another blow to Al-Qaeda's crumbling leadership. I applaud the intelligence community who work tirelessly, around the clock and around the world to keep us safe. This operation was yet another example why they deserve our praise.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

09.30.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today helped “flip the switch” on Sonoma Mountain Village's new solar system buildings. In a solar industry "first," this system was financed by $1.6 million from private capital made available by Clean Fund to the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program (SCEIP). The funds were provided to Sonoma Mountain Village through SCEIP and their Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program. Rep. Thompson has been a leading advocate of PACE programs, sponsoring legislation in Congress. “PACE is one of the most creative and successful solutions to our nation's energy crisis - and it is a common sense way to create good, green jobs,” said Rep. Thompson. “Because of PACE, and the hard work of community leaders and businesses, Sonoma Mountain Village will be a 100 percent solar powered, zero-waste community.” Thompson's PACE legislation allows communities to establish PACE programs so property owners can finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects for their homes and commercial buildings, all without any government subsidies or taxes. Sonoma Mountain Village, developed by Codding Enterprises, is a 200 acre mixed-use, solar-powered, zero-waste community under development. The solar arrays, provided by Stellar Energy, are comprised of 4,928 solar panel modules, generating 1.158 megawatts that when combined with the existing on-site solar, will allow Sonoma Mountain Village to cover 100 percent of its electric needs from on-site renewable power. This newest solar power system adds to an existing 1.14 megawatt array allowing the entire business campus to provide enough power for 2,000 homes. Sonoma Mountain Village now boasts over 181,000 square feet, or almost four acres, of rooftop solar panels.“PACE is a win for everyone,” Rep. Thompson continued. “Homeowners' and businesses' utility costs are lowered, people are put to work, and our nation gets the benefit of reduced energy use, increased energy independence and a cleaner environment.” “With this solar power installation, Sonoma Mountain Village is showing once again that it is a dynamic force for job-creation in our community and a responsible corporate citizen,” said Representative Lynn Woolsey (CA-6). “Working with Sonoma County and taking advantage of its innovative PACE program, SMV is proving that green jobs are our future - that we can have both economic growth and environmental sustainability. I am proud to represent SMV in Congress and excited about continuing our partnership.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.28.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that The Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC) in West Sacramento was awarded $4.3 million through the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). The SBLF, which was established as part the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that Rep. Thompson supported, encourages community banks to increase their lending to small businesses, helping those companies expand their operations and create new jobs. “Small businesses are the engines that drive our economy,” said Rep. Thompson. “As I talk with small businesses across Northern California communities, they tell me getting access to credit is their number one challenge. Because of these funds, the Rural Community Assistance Corporation will have more capital to help our area's small businesses get the credit they need to grow, hire workers and fuel our economy.” Small businesses play a critical role in the U.S. economy and are central to growth and job creation. Small businesses employ roughly one-half of all Americans and account for about 60 percent of gross job creation. But small business owners faced disproportionate challenges in the aftermath of the recession and credit crisis, including difficulty accessing capital. The SBLF helps small businesses meet this challenge by providing capital to community banks that hold under $10 billion in assets. The dividend rate a community bank pays on SBLF funding is reduced as that bank increases its lending to small businesses - providing a concrete incentive for new lending to small businesses.“Recently the RCAC Board of Directors made a decision to begin using our loan fund for small business lending to help create new employment opportunities in rural America,” said Stan Keasling, CEO of the RCAC. “This $4.3 million low interest investment in our loan fund will jump start that program and provides needed resources for businesses in our region.” “Creating jobs is my number one priority,” continued Thompson. “By opening credit it is easier for small business to get loans, pay bills, make investments and hire workers - and that means more jobs.”Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.21.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today commended the American Legion for their stance against closing a veterans home post office in Yountville, California. During a Joint House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing today, American Legion Chairman Michael Helm voiced his opposition to the potential closing of the post office. Thompson, who represents the Yountville veterans home, has helped lead the effort against its closure. “The thought of closing the Yountville veterans home post office is a slap in the face to every veteran who has served our nation,” said Rep. Thompson. “The closing of this post office would impose an extraordinary inconvenience on many veterans' lives. Access to this post office is imperative to these veterans, many of whom are aged and disabled, not only to pick up mail and packages, but also to pick up their needed prescription medicine.” “The American Legion opposes closing the Yountville veterans home post office based on the impact it would have on these veterans,” said Chairman Helm. “To get to the next nearest post office, the veterans in the Yountville home would have to cross railroad tracks and under a state highway. We should not be asking our nations veterans, some with dementia and in wheelchairs, to shoulder such enormous burden just to have access their post office.” Earlier this year, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) released a list of approximately 3,700 post offices that would be considered for closure. Among them is the post office at the Yountville Veterans Home located in Yountville, CA. This is the only post office on the potential closure list that is located in a veterans Home. The postal service estimates that the closure of the Yountville Veterans Home post office would only save approximately $1,000 per year. “I am very disappointed to hear the Post Office at the Yountville Veterans Home is on the list for possible closure,” said Secretary Peter Gravett, California Department of Veterans Affairs (CDVA). “The residents at Yountville depend on this service and many of them receive their prescriptions by mail through the Post Office at the Home because they have no other means of transportation or are disabled. I strongly urge the Postmaster General to reconsider closing this location. The veterans at Yountville have fought and risked their lives for this country and the United States Postal Service needs to take that into further consideration. CDVA is committed to working with the elected officials and the Postmaster General to ensure this Post Office is removed from the potential closure list.” The Yountville veterans home is one of the oldest in the nation and currently houses over 1,000 veterans. The veterans represent every era of warrior from World War II to the present conflicts. The residents range from those who are in the final stages of their life to those who are trying to adjust from Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from Iraq and Afghanistan. Thompson wrote to Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe urging that he reconsider closing the post office. He has also requested that the USPS conducts an analysis of the costs and benefits that would result from closing the veterans home post office, as well as an analysis of how veterans would be affected by the closure. The Napa County Board of Supervisors has also sent a letter to the Postmaster General opposing the closing of the post office. “I recognize that the Postal Service faces difficult decisions, but I am distressed by the proposal to close the post office located at the Yountville Veterans Home,” said Rep. Jerry McNerney (CA-11) a senior member on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs. “More than 1,000 veterans live at this facility, and I am pleased to work with Congressman Thompson and the American Legion on their behalf. Ensuring that our veterans have access to simple, yet critical, resources such as mail service is essential.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.21.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today applauded the positive findings in a Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) released by the Department of Interior, and comments made earlier this week by Interior Secretary Salazar. The Secretary will use this DEIS to make his final determination in March of 2012 as to whether or not removal of four Klamath River dams in accordance with the Klamath Restoration Agreements are in the public interest.“I am pleased to see the dam removal project moving forward and I was happy to hear Secretary Salazar reemphasize his support for the monumental agreements to restore the Klamath River basin and its salmon fisheries,” said Rep. Thompson. “My support has been unwavering to see agreements in place that represent the best way forward for all of our river basin communities. Under the agreements, where dams along the river are removed, we will strengthen our river basin and our economy - not only will we restore salmon habitats, we will create more than 4,600 jobs.” In a review comparing the impacts of river restoration to current conditions, the DEIS shows that implementation of the Agreements would provide significant economic, environmental, social and cultural benefits to Northern California and Southern Oregon. One of the key findings stakeholders applauded is that the projected cost of removing four dams on the Klamath River falls well within the range of the budget agreed to by Tribes, irrigators, fishermen, and dam owner PacifiCorp. Portions of the Agreements include reintroducing salmon to more than 400 miles of historic habitat, increasing water storage and flood control by expanding Upper Klamath Lake, and improved water security for 1,400 farm families on the Klamath Irrigation Project. The DEIS makes several key findings that proponents of the Agreements hope will prompt Congress to pass the legislation necessary for implementation. Stakeholders emphasize the economic and health benefits, cost savings, and jobs creation that the restoration plan includes. Combined, the Settlement Agreements invest more than $700 million in the Klamath Basin over the next 15 years. The restoration plan also protects and enhances a regional natural resource that is worth over $750 million a year to the local economy when healthy.

09.20.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement on the official repeal of the military's “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy: “Today the Department of Defense officially closes the door on the discriminatory and harmful “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy,” said Rep. Thompson. “Sexual orientation should not be a factor for deciding who is able to serve and defend our country. As a combat veteran myself, I am proud to have cosponsored and voted for the legislation that now ends “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” once and for all.” For more information, please visit the Department of Defense webpage on the repeal of “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” here: https://www.defense.gov/home/features/2010/0610_dadt/ Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes the Counties of Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Sonoma, Napa, and Yolo.

09.16.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the Yurok Tribe in Humboldt County has been awarded a $3.3 million grant for the establishment of the Yurok Tribe Veterans Cemetery. The project will provide services to more than 2,500 underserved Native Veterans and their families. “The veterans of our local Tribes have served this nation with bravery and honor,” said Rep. Thompson. “They and their families have earned the right to visit the final resting place of these heroes without the hardship of having to travel hundreds of miles to do so. This new cemetery will be a distinguished memorial site for these Native American Veterans and their families.” “The Tribe is very honored and privileged to play such a substantial role in providing local native veterans with a final resting place, worthy of the valuable service they have given to our nation,” said Yurok Councilmember Richard Myers, who served in the Navy's Submarine Unit from 1962-1966. This grant will fund the construction of a main entrance, roads, an assembly area, a committal shelter, full casketed gravesites, cremains gravesites, landscaping, a memorial walkway and supporting infrastructure. The project will be developed on approximately five acres and will include 171 standard burial gravesites and 161 cremains gravesites. Currently, the closest national cemetery is VA's Eagle Point National Cemetery in Eagle Point, Oregon, which is 175 miles away. The closest State Veterans Cemetery is the Northern California Veterans Cemetery in Igo, California, which is 125 miles away. Approximately 90 percent of Yurok men of appropriate age served in World Wars I and II. A great number of Yurok women served too. Large portions of the population also served in Vietnam and are currently serving in Afghanistan and Iraq. According to the Department of Defense, more Native Americans serve in the United States military service per capita than any other ethnic group.

09.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today called on the House Majority to pass long-term reauthorizations for both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and national highway and transit programs in order to put Americans back to work and to modernize our nation's crumbling transportation infrastructure. Instead, the House passed today its 23nd short-term FAA extension and its 8th short-term surface transportation programs extension since the last long-term authorization of these programs expired. “It is time for the House Majority to stop playing political games in Washington,” said Rep. Thompson. “Passing clean, long-term reauthorizations of the FAA and highway and transit programs are common sense ways to get construction projects moving and put folks back to work right away.” In July, Congress's failure to pass a long-term FAA reauthorization unnecessarily forced a shutdown of most FAA programs, resulting in more than $250 million in lost revenue for needed airport improvements, furloughed more than 4,000 FAA employees, and put tens of thousands additional Americans out of work. A long-term FAA reauthorization would ensure that critical FAA funding would not lapse in the near future, and aviation construction projects across the country could finally begin. A long-term reauthorization of surface transportation programs will allow California and states across the county, to put people to work repairing roads, and bridges, and updating out of date infrastructure. Since the last surface transportation authorization expired in September, 2009, Congress has been unable to set long term transportation funding levels which has removed the stability States' need for transportation project planning. “For too long, our country's aging infrastructure has gone without the critical upgrades and support that it needs,” Rep. Thompson continued. “We can no longer afford to kick this can down the road. Now is the time to invest in our country's infrastructure while putting American workers back on the job. Not January 2012, Not March 2012, but right now.” Tuesday's legislation, H.R. 2887, will temporarily extend FAA funding through January 31, 2012 and surface transportation funding through March, 31, 2012. This bill is expected to be taken up by the Senate later this week before being sent to the President for his signature to prevent additional program shutdowns.

09.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced an office exhibit of art by Woodland High School graduate Nick Christen. Nick is the California First District winner of the annual Congressional Artistic Discovery competition. A print of Nick's striking black and white photograph of the flooded Yolo Bypass that is currently on display in the U.S. Capitol can be viewed in Congressman Thompson's Woodland district office. “I am always impressed by the artwork submitted by students in my district and Nick is no exception,” said Thompson. “He has an eye for composition and color and his dramatic execution calls our attention to major environmental concerns of our day.” In addition to the winning photograph, drawings in ink, chalk pastel and spray paint express Christen's imaginative vision of our world. Nick has a fascination for elements of weather and often incorporates these into his artwork. Global Warming and Tornado are executed in chalk pastel. Lightening uses spray paint and India ink. Other drawings feature agricultural produce and one is a spray-paint portrait of rock musician Steven Morrissey. Christen studied art with Dawn Abbott at Woodland High School for four years, including two years in Advance Placement Art classes. He is a college freshman attending San Francisco State University where he plans a major in atmospheric science. Nick's artwork may be viewed in Congressman Thompson's office located in the rear courtyard at 712 Main Street, Suite 101, during business hours Monday-Friday through October.

08.29.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued a statement on the tragic murder of former mayor and current councilmember of the City of Fort Bragg, Jere Melo: “Words cannot begin to express the magnitude of the tragic loss of Jere Melo to our community. Over the 20 years I have represented the Mendocino Coast, I don't think there was ever an event I attended where I didn't see Jere - more often than not he was working - making our region a better place to live. “Jere was part of the fabric of the Fort Bragg community and the glue that kept all sides working together. He was a dedicated public servant and a dear friend. My heart and thoughts go out to Jere's wife, Madeleine, and his family during this time of irreplaceable loss.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

08.23.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today applauded U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and the Department of Transportation (DOT) for enacting tough new airline passenger protections, including a rigorous ban on lengthy tarmac delays for international flights and increasing the compensation a passenger can receive if bumped from an oversold flight. Many of the protections beginning today are included in the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2011 (H.R. 729), a bill Rep. Thompson introduced in February. “I am pleased that the Department of Transportation continues to strengthen the protections given to airline passengers when they travel,” said Rep. Thompson. “For years, airlines have resisted offering passengers the option to deplane during excessive delays, or providing basic necessities like food, water, or even access to working toilets. For the first time, today's new rules will ensure the comfort and safety of the flying public regardless if they are traveling domestically or internationally.” “Since 2009, the DOT has shown great initiative by taking action to stop the airline industry's worst abuses, but there's still more work to be done,” Rep. Thompson continued. “Because these rules aren't written into law, they can be rescinded at any time. My bill, the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2011, would strengthen the protections announced by Secretary LaHood through an act of Congress and ensure that passengers can rely on them for years to come. That's why I will continue fighting to get this legislation signed into law or included in a long overdue FAA Reauthorization.” Specifically, the DOT's new rule expands the existing ban on lengthy tarmac delays to cover foreign airlines' operation at U.S. airports and establishes a four hour time limit on tarmac delays for international flights. Carriers must also ensure that passengers stuck on the tarmac are provided adequate food and water after two hours, as well as working restrooms. Exceptions to the four hour rule will only be allowed for safety, security, or air traffic control reasons. In addition to the four hour rule for international flights, the DOT will also require airlines to reimburse bag fees if luggage is lost and compensate individuals who are bumped off flights. Air carriers will also be required to clearly disclose the fees charged for checked baggage, meals, canceling or changing reservations, and advanced or upgraded seating. The DOT's new rules were initially announced in April of this year.
08.22.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is awarding two grants totaling $1.08 million in federal funding to assist the Yurok Tribe of Del Norte County to build a visitor center to highlight its culture as part of a Yurok Scenic Byways management plan. The funds will go toward building a 2,500 square foot visitor center and developing its Yurok Scenic Byways Corridor Management Plan. “The Yurok Scenic Byways Management Plan and Visitor Center will allow the Yurok Tribe a public way to showcase the cultural, natural, scenic and recreational quality of the region,” said Rep. Thompson. “In many ways, the stories of local tribes have yet to be fully presented to visitors to the Klamath River area, stories which will be told through this visitor center.” The Yurok Scenic Byways Corridor Management Plan will identify scenic corridors in the region, lay out byway management practices and plan improvements for routes throughout the scenic byways system. It will also provide new economic development opportunities for both tribal and non-tribal entities. “For the first time, we will have our own venue to share our rich heritage with the world,” said Yurok Chairman Thomas O'Rourke Sr. “We will be able to tell our story in our own words. The Scenic Byway Plan and Yurok Visitor Center are part of a larger plan to provide opportunities for visitors to learn about the tribe in a cultural, historical and contemporary context. The plan also employs a number of creative tools to teach people about our unique connection with our traditional homeland.”
08.22.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is awarding $50,000 in federal funding to help construct a combination library and senior center in Middletown, CA. The funding is part of a nationwide, $3.4 million Economic Impact Initiative Grant through the Rural Development division of USDA. “By constructing this needed county library and senior center, the project will create jobs and improve the quality of life in Middletown,” said Rep. Thompson. “Once complete, the new center will bring critical services to our local community like access to high speed internet, community meeting rooms, and other needed tools to keep our community a great place to live.” Construction on the 12,377 square foot facility will likely begin within the next month. In addition to a brand new library with up-to-date technology and a full-service senior center, the new center will also include a space for community meetings and events. The project has been planned for years and has the support of the full community. “The budget for this project is very tight and the $50,000 being provided by the USDA will be of great help in furnishing the new building with bookshelves, tables, chairs and other essential equipment,” said Kelly Cox, the County Administrator of Lake County. “We are very appreciative of Congressman Thompson's support of this project and assistance in securing the USDA grant. It's also important to remember that without his extraordinary efforts to restore geothermal royalty revenues to local government, this much needed project would not be happening.”
08.17.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is awarding more than $1.4 million in federal funding to assist the Elk Valley Rancheria of Del Norte County to complete the Humboldt Road Safety Improvement Project. This project will address serious safety concerns at the intersection of Humboldt Road that enters and exits Redwood National Park and the Elk Valley reservation. “The Humboldt Road Safety Improvement Project is a high priority for the region to provide transportation safety while strengthening the local economy,” said Rep. Thompson. “Once completed, this project will allow people to finally move in and around a critical intersection of Redwood National Park and the Elk Valley Reservation. These improvements are necessary and long overdue.” This funding will be used to make safety improvements to a road intersection just outside Redwood National Park that has a high accident rate. Pedestrians, bicyclists and equestrians, many of whom are entering and leaving Redwood National Park and the Elk Valley reservation, are not able to find safe passage through this intersection and along Humboldt Road. The U.S. Department of Transportation awarded this grant through the Public Lands Highways Discretionary Program Fund (PHDP). The PLHD Program provides federal funding for highways, roads, parkways, and transit facilities that are within, adjacent to, or provide access to Indian reservations and Federal public lands, including national parks, refuges, forests, recreation areas, and grasslands. “Receipt of the Public Lands Highway Discretionary funds will improve the safety of Humboldt Road for all members of the community, especially those traveling to the Elk Valley Rancheria” said Elk Valley Chairman Dale Miller. “It is vital that we use every tool at our disposal to ensure the safety of all community members and I am very proud that the Elk Valley Rancheria, California successfully utilized various Tribal and federal resources to accomplish this goal of community wide importance.” Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties. He is a senior member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Rep. Thompson is also a member of the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition and Co-Chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Wine Caucus.
08.12.2011	Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that Crescent City Harbor will receive $6,099,201 in federal funding to help rebuild a boat basin embankment severely damaged by tsunami waves in March. The funds, made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Public Assistance Program, will be used to restore the boat basin's protective rock layer and remove dangerous debris that poses a significant risk to boats and boaters. “I am pleased that FEMA will provide much-needed assistance to help rebuild Crescent City's Harbor, which faced significant damage from the tsunami earlier this year,” said Senator Boxer. “Crescent City's fishing economy depends on the city's harbor and this aid will ensure repairs are made to keep it open and operating.” “The March tsunami caused damage unlike anything seen in the area for decades,” said Senator Feinstein. “The FEMA funding will provide much-needed assistance to Crescent City Harbor so that boaters and fishermen along California's North Coast can begin to recover from this disaster.” "I am pleased that the Crescent City community will be receiving much-needed federal funding for the restoration of its harbor," said Rep. Thompson. "This assistance will help ensure the backbone of our fishing economy remains strong, now and in the future." Crescent City Harbor's embankment - a long, linear artificial mound of rock and earthen fill - was built to shelter the boat basin from coastal waves and maintain safe docking and servicing conditions for private and commercial boats. On March 11, a series of tsunami waves stripped the embankment of its protective rock layer and exposed moored boats to rough waters, creating extremely hazardous conditions for boaters. Full restoration of the embankment will require the placement of 63,847 tons of rock weighing four tons each and 31,400 tons of rock at 500 pounds each. The harbor district requested federal funding to complete the repair of the embankment in time for the start of the Fall 2011 crab season. As a result of joint letters and appeals by Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, and Representative Thompson, FEMA will cover at least 75 percent of the cost of debris removal and restoration of the disaster-damaged boat basin. The Public Assistance Program grant funding will also help protect the harbor from future disasters by providing assistance for hazard mitigation measures during the recovery process.
08.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee and Ways and Means, today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is awarding over $2.5 million in federal funding to help complete the Solano Avenue segment of the Napa Vine Trail. When completed, the Napa Vine Trail will be one of the premier transportation systems in the country, connecting the entire Napa Valley from the Vallejo Ferry Terminal to Calistoga. The trail will generate significant economic, recreational, and environmental benefits, as well as increase the Napa community's transportation capacity. “The Napa Valley Vine Trail is exactly the kind of smart, targeted investment that will strengthen our economy while improving the quality of life in our local communities,” said Rep. Thompson. “Thanks to the generosity of the Department of Transportation and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, we're one step closer to making this forward-thinking transportation project a reality.” “This grant provides the pivotal funding to connect 60% of Napa County's population together between Yountville and the City of Napa on a safe walking and biking trail separated from Highway 29,” said Chuck McMinn, Founder and Executive Director of the Napa Valley Vine Trail Coalition. “We are extremely excited to receive it and gratified that our project was recognized for funding from among the many projects submitted from across the United States.” Today's funding announcement comes less than three months after Congressman Thompson brought Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to the First Congressional District to see firsthand how transportation investment has increased Northern California's economic competitiveness. During the trip, Secretary LaHood had the opportunity to visit the Napa Valley Vine Trail, where he delivered remarks on the importance of bike and pedestrian trail funding and took a walking tour of the “Yountville Mile” - the Vine Trail's first completed portion.
08.10.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that Anderson Valley Health Center in Boonville has received $541,667 in federal funding to expand access to quality health care. These funds, made available by the Affordable Care Act, will establish Anderson Valley Health Center as a federally-recognized health service delivery site (or, “access point”), allowing the Health Center to apply for annual federal funding and increased reimbursement. “The Anderson Valley Health Center has been an outstanding provider of quality, affordable health care for over thirty-five years, and the access point designation recognizes that legacy,” said Rep. Thompson. “Many dedicated individuals were involved in the fight for this designation, and I want to thank the Center's health care professionals, administrators, and the surrounding community for their relentless support.” Specifically, the new “access point” designation will allow the Anderson Valley Health Center to restore across-the-board salary cuts as well as hire new health care professionals. The federal funding will also expand nursing services in rural schools, particularly programs related to the prevention and treatment of childhood obesity. The designation will allow the Health Center to better provide comprehensive primary and preventative health care services to the Mendocino County community. "On behalf of the Anderson Valley Health Center Board of Directors, I want to express how absolutely thrilled we are with this Federally Qualified Health Center designation and what it means for the continuing â€˜health' of our community,” said Sandy Parker, Chair of the Anderson Valley Health Center Board of Directors. “We have been working diligently to keep health care services viable in our community and this news is tremendous and most appreciated!” “Everyone connected with Anderson Valley Health Center is ecstatic about receiving the new Access Point grant and becoming a federally-recognized grantee,” added Judith Dolan, former Executive Director of the Anderson Valley Health Center. “This grant makes it possible for us to survive and thrive, add new services, and to continue to provide excellent and affordable care in our local community. I am grateful for all of the support from the Board of Directors, the AVHC staff, and the community.” Community health centers work to improve the health of the nation's underserved communities and vulnerable populations by ensuring access to comprehensive, quality primary health care services. By maximizing the availability, access, and continuity of primary care services to the nation's neediest populations, these sites will play a critical role in improving the health care status of medically underserved and vulnerable populations and decreasing health disparities throughout the United States.
08.10.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today released the following statement regarding the importance of job creation: “After bringing our nation back from the brink of default, it's time for Congress to refocus on what should have been its top priority all along: jobs. In fact, the most effective way to reduce our deficit is to put people back to work. More jobs mean fewer Americans depending on unemployment insurance or food stamps. More jobs mean more money in people's pockets and more investment in businesses, both big and small. More jobs mean more opportunities - for our community, for our state, and for our nation. “To create jobs, we need to make smart investments in education, infrastructure, and green energy. These investments, combined with targeted cuts to wasteful and inefficient spending, are the keys to America's long-term economic growth and prosperity. This is the balanced, fiscally responsible approach that will allow government to live within its means while preserving the opportunities that are essential to the American people.”
08.05.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that the Town of Yountville has been awarded $80,700 in federal funding to help develop new opportunities for wastewater reclamation and reuse. This funding, which is allocated through the U.S. Department of the Interior's WaterSMART Program, is instrumental to helping communities like Yountville achieve a sustainable strategy to meet local water needs. “I am pleased that the Town of Yountville has received federal funding to help improve water conservation and encourage increasingly responsible water use in our community,” said Rep. Thompson. “Yountville is a proven leader in water recycling, and this funding will only further help the Town achieve its goals of minimizing discharges and the use of groundwater.” "I'd like to thank Congressman Thompson for his continued support of the Town of Yountville's innovative recycled water project,” said Yountville Mayor John Dunbar. “Yountville has made our recycled water program a priority and this funding will allow us to evaluate the best ways we can expand our service to agricultural users and reduce discharge into the Napa River. This grant also helps us meet our state water quality requirements, while protecting our critical groundwater aquifers. Without this kind of support, a small community like ours finds it extremely difficult to afford such a commitment." Specifically, the Town of Yountville will use the WaterSMART Program funds to help assess the feasibility of expanding its current recycled water distribution system to serve recycled water to urban and agricultural uses. The project could include additional distribution pipeline, seasonal storage ponds, and pumping and control facilities. The study will also assess the feasibility of decreasing discharges to the Napa River, which flows through the Napa-Sonoma March and Mare Island Strait to San Pablo Bay and San Francisco Bay.
08.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that Redwood Capital Bancorp in Eureka has received $7.3 million through the Small Business Lending Fund (SBLF). The SBLF, which was established as part the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 that Rep. Thompson supported, encourages community banks to increase their lending to small businesses, helping those companies expand their operations and create new jobs. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and Redwood Capital will be providing the capital they need to grow and thrive,” said Rep. Thompson. “In the process, they'll be helping create good-paying jobs and laying the foundation for private-sector job growth. I'm thrilled by today's announcement.” Small businesses play a critical role in the U.S. economy and are central to growth and job creation. Yet, small business owners have faced disproportionate challenges in the aftermath of the recession and credit crisis, including difficulty accessing capital. The SBLF helps small businesses meet this challenge by providing capital to community banks that hold under $10 billion in assets. The dividend rate a community bank pays on SBLF funding is reduced as that bank increases its lending to small businesses - providing a concrete incentive for new lending to small businesses. “We appreciate the U.S. Department of the Treasury for including Redwood Capital in the Small Business Lending Fund program,” said John Dalby, President and Chief Executive Officer of Redwood Capital Bancorp and Redwood Capital Bank, respectively. “This allows community banks and small businesses to work together to help create jobs and promote economic growth in rural communities across the nation. Redwood Capital will use the SBLF proceeds to expand our local investment in small business loans with the goal of continued growth for the economy of Humboldt County.” In total, 43 community banks across the country have received a total of $590 million in SBLF funding. Additional SBLF funding announcements will be made on a rolling basis in the weeks ahead. “We are excited to hear that two of the banks slated to receive new funding are in Northern California. Our region's entrepreneurs need a shot in the arm, and nearly $20 million dollars in capital will bring a lot of new opportunities with it,” said Kristin Johnson, regional director of the Northern California Small Business Development Center Network hosted by Humboldt State University. In 2010, California Small Business Development Centers provided free business advising and low-cost workshops to more than 50,000 businesses throughout the state. Access to capital is the number one stated need from SBDC clients, Johnson said.
08.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, issued the following statement today after Senate leaders announced an agreement on a short-term extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): “I am pleased that House and Senate leadership, working with the White House, have come to a solution that addresses Congress' inaction on the FAA reauthorization,” said Rep. Thompson. “This announcement puts 90,000 Americans back to work, resumes construction on critical airport improvements, and ensures that our local communities are not affected by a disruption in their air service.” On July 22, 2011, the last short term extension of FAA programs expired. Since that time, nearly 4,000 FAA employees have been furloughed indefinitely and nearly 90,000 American workers ready to go to work on aviation related construction projects have been sent home. Additionally, the Aviation Trust Fund has lost an estimated $200 million each week in revenue. Earlier this week, Rep. Thompson sent a letter to the Congressional leadership, imploring them to take immediate action on this issue. Thompson was a co-sponsor of H.R. 2644, legislation to extend all FAA programs through September 20, 2011, allowing Congress more time to finish a long term FAA extension.
08.03.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging the House of Representatives to immediately consider a short-term extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The current FAA funding authorization expired on July 22, 2011, causing a shutdown of most of the FAA's operations and aviation construction projects. So far, the shutdown has cost the government more than $250 million in revenue due to expired ticket taxes and put tens of thousands of jobs at risk during a critical period of our economic recovery. “It's time for the House of Representatives to do what it has done dozens of times before - pass a clean extension of the FAA funding bill,” said Rep. Thompson. “Following this needless delay, we have already forfeited more than $250 million in lost revenue for critical airport improvements and put tens of thousands of American out of work. Meanwhile, airlines continue to take full advantage of this shutdown by artificially inflating the cost of plane tickets. It's time for Congress to take action to end the insanity.” Also today, Congressman Thompson became a co-sponsor of H.R. 2644, the Aviation Jobs and Safety Act of 2011. This legislation would extend all FAA programs through September 20, 2011, allowing Congress more time to finish a long term FAA extension. As a result of the lapse in FAA funding, nearly 4,000 employees have been furloughed and nearly 90,000 Americans ready to go to work on aviation-related construction projects have been sent home. Additionally, the Aviation Trust Fund is losing an estimated $200 million each week in lost revenue. A copy of Rep. Thompson's letter to Congressional leaders to available below: “Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi, “I urge that the House of Representatives immediately consider a short term extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to end this unnecessary agency shut down during a critical period of our economic recovery. “As you know, on July 22, 2011 the last short term extension of FAA programs expired. Since that time, nearly 4,000 FAA employees have been furloughed indefinitely; revenue has stopped coming into the Aviation Trust Fund; and nearly 90,000 American workers ready to go to work on aviation related construction projects have been sent home. Should this shutdown of the FAA continue into mid September, as some press reports have suggested, the Aviation Trust Fund stands to lose over $1 billion in revenue needed for critical aviation improvements. Meanwhile, airlines will take full advantage of this shutdown by forcing every day American consumers to pay more for their airfare by replacing expired aviation taxes with unnecessarily more expensive plane tickets. “While disagreements exist as to what a long term FAA Reauthorization should look like, those policy differences should not prevent a short term extension of these necessary programs. There is no reason a simple, clean short term extension of the FAA cannot brought up under a unanimous consent agreement as early as today. “Much has been said about crafting legislation to spur job growth later this year. It is therefore incomprehensible to me and to the American public that our failure to bring up a simple FAA short term extension has put so many Americans out work. That is why Congress must consider and pass a clean short term FAA extension as soon as possible. “Thank you in advance for your immediate consideration of this very time sensitive request.”
08.02.2011	The nonpartisan council appointed by eighteen Western governors to advise on Western water issues today told the Natural Resources Committee that it opposes legislation that would threaten the delicate balance achieved in one of California's most important water systems and preempt state's rights and federal law. The Western States Water Council, in a letter sent to members of the Natural Resources Committee, joined a growing list of stakeholders who oppose the legislation proposed by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.). “On behalf of the Western States Water Council and our eighteen member states, I am writing to express our strong opposition to H.R. 1837 as an unwarranted intrusion on the rights of the states to allocate and administer rights to the use of state water resources,” writes the council in a letter sent to Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) and Grace Napolitano (D-Calif.), the top members on the Subcommittee on Water and Power. “Moreover, it is inconsistent with evolving principles of successful management of our water resources to achieve a sustainable balance between important economic and environmental goals.” Democratic members of the Natural Resources Committee agreed with the assessment of the council. “The support for this anti-water bill is as solid as a sieve,” said Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), the Ranking Member of the Natural Resources Committee. “This bill gives water to corporate interests and takes authority away from the states, and is a bridge too far in the ongoing Republican war on water.” “This bill has faced strong opposition in California, and now the alarm has been heard in the other states that could be threatened if this bill were to pass,” said Rep. Napolitano. “By usurping California's state water rights, rolling back environmental protections, and delivering special flows of water to privileged groups, this piece of federal legislation sets a dangerous precedent that could disrupt already scarce water supplies across the western states. The majority of water users continue to unite to protect their water rights, and I urge my Republican colleagues to abandon their support for this misguided and destructive bill.” “The same House Republicans whose recklessness just brought the United States to the brink of default are pushing to do the same damage to California's water laws,” said Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.). “The Western States Water Council has made it very clear that preempting decades of state and federal precedents - as the Water Uncertainty Act would do -- is the wrong way to make policy. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reject this extreme and dangerous bill.” “The Western States Water Council makes it clear that the Nunes bill sets a destructive precedent that would destroy a century of Western water law by giving one water district the opportunity to jump ahead of senior water rights holders and grab their water,” said Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.). “This should be a warning to Representative Nunes and supporters of the bill to stop this water grab.” “I'm not surprised that the Western States Water Council has joined a growing group of stakeholders in condemning H.R. 1837,” said Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.). “This legislation would gut restrictions on the pumping of Northern California water, putting not only our environmental resources at risk, but the livelihoods of thousands of North State farmers and fishermen. We should be looking for new ways to reduce reliance on the Delta's water - not restarting our state's water wars.” The Western States Water Council adopted this official position in opposition of H.R. 1837, the San Joaquin Water Reliability Act, at last week's annual summer meeting. The growing list of those opposed to the legislation also includes the Department of the Interior, the California Natural Resources Agency, as well as many elected state and federal officials. The legislation, otherwise known as the “Water Uncertainty Act” would overturn nearly 20 years of environmental protection, repeal the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement that has been litigated and negotiated for over two decades and lock up water contracts in perpetuity. The Water Uncertainty Act would also preempt state law and disrupt or make impossible a number of ongoing negotiations by Californians to improve their water supply, including the Bay Delta Conservation Plan and the 2009 bipartisan water bill passed by the California legislature. House Republicans have been taking aim at water quality and rights, protecting mining, coal and other corporate interests from clean water laws, and cutting funding to states to protect drinking water.
08.01.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today issued the following statement after voting for legislation to avoid a default on our nation's financial obligations: “I voted for the compromise legislation to avoid defaulting on our nation's debt. Given that our nation was hours away from defaulting on its obligations, I felt a responsibility to vote yes.”
07.30.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today urged domestic air carriers to stop charging passengers for the cost of federal aviation taxes on their tickets in a bipartisan letter to the Air Transport Association. These taxes expired last week after Congress failed to pass a funding extension for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), but some airlines have continued to include the cost of the tax in their ticket prices. “The bottom line is consumers are being taken advantage of by some of the airlines,” said Rep. Thompson. “Air carriers are including the cost of an expired tax in their ticket prices, rather than passing the savings on to consumers. Airlines shouldn't be increasing their prices and their profits at the expense of everyday Americans.” Rep. Thompson also expressed concern about passengers who already paid federal taxes for travel during the FAA shutdown, or were forced to pay more for their base airfare after the shutdown began. The Internal Revenue Service has requested airlines' assistance in facilitating these refunds, but so far they have declined to do so. “Passengers are entitled to a refund for the federal taxes paid when they purchased their ticket,” Rep. Thompson continued. “In these extraordinary times when so many Americans are out of work or simply trying to make ends meet, airlines should not be using the FAA shutdown as an excuse to pad their pockets.” Yesterday afternoon, Rep. Thompson circulated a copy of his letter on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. In less than an hour, he secured over 86 signatures from his colleagues. The letter has 91 total co-signers. The full text of the letter, which is addressed to Richard Anderson, CEO of Delta Air Lines and Chair of the Air Transport Association, is available below: “Like you, we are discouraged that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been shut down. As a result of this shut down, vital aviation improvements are being put off, thousands of FAA employees have been furloughed, and the Aviation Trust Fund, the fund needed to maintain our aviation system, has effectively been shuttered. “Given these dramatic turn of events, we are dismayed by public reports that some airlines are taking advantage of everyday Americans. Specifically, we understand that some airlines are continuing to charge passengers for the cost of federal aviation taxes on their tickets even though these taxes have expired, and keeping the money for themselves. “Consumers quite frankly are being taken advantage of by these airlines. Instead of taking advantage of the FAA shut down, airlines should be passing these immediate savings on to the consumers now. However, it appears that most airlines have taken the alternative route by increasing prices and their profits at the expense of everyday Americans. “In addition, we are concerned about those consumers who purchased their tickets and paid the applicable excise taxes prior to the FAA shut down. These passengers, who are traveling during this shut down, are entitled to a refund for these federal taxes paid when they purchased their ticket. The Internal Revenue Service has requested airlines assistance in facilitating these refunds. Airlines are best suited to do so because they already have the purchaser information and can streamline refunds. However, so far airlines have declined to do so. “Therefore, we urge the Air Transport Association (ATA) and all of your member airlines to charge the same price for airfare that you did immediately before the FAA shutdown. In addition, for those passengers who already paid federal excise taxes for travel scheduled during the FAA shutdown or who were forced to pay more for their base airfare because of their profiteering tactics after the FAA shutdown took effect, they should immediately be given a refund of those cost overruns. “In these extraordinary times when so many Americans are out of work or simply trying to make ends meet, airlines should not be taking advantage of things like an FAA shutdown to increase their profits. We look forward to hearing from the ATA regarding this important issue.”
07.29.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson today issued the following statement following House passage of Speaker John Boehner's deficit bill: “Today, Speaker Boehner brought forward his proposal to address our nation's impending debt-limit crisis. Unfortunately, this short-term deal would ensure we face another crisis in six months. Rather than appealing to the most radical wing of the conservative element of the majority party, we should be finding a bipartisan, balanced solution to our current impasse. That's why I voted against this misguided legislation.”
07.27.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) successfully offered an amendment to H.R. 2584, the Interior-Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2012, that will preserve essential federal protections for America's endangered and threatened species. Specifically, Rep. Thompson's amendment removed language - known as the Extinction Rider - that would have prevented the Fish and Wildlife Service from spending any funding to list new plants and animals under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). “We've been trying to get more species off the endangered species list for years, and the majority party is leading the way,” said Rep. Thompson. “Unfortunately, their strategy is to prevent endangered species from being listed as endangered in the first place. The Extinction Rider is so ridiculous that it would be comical, but for the dangerous effect it would have on imperiled species that are struggling to survive.” “It is our responsibility to be good stewards of this earth and prevent the extinction of wildlife, plants, and fish,” Rep. Thompson added. “The sad truth is that once we lose a species we will never get it back. That is why we need to allow for science-based policies and recovery plans for imperiled species instead of allowing politics to drive listing decisions and activities.” Congressman Thompson co-authored his amendment to remove the Extinction Rider from H.R. 2584 with Reps. Norm Dicks (D-WA), Michael Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Colleen Hanabusa (D-HI). 37 Republicans joined Congressman Thompson and over 180 of his Democratic colleagues in supporting the amendment, which was approved by the House in a 224-202 vote. “I applaud my colleagues, particularly the Republicans, for joining me to fight this misguided legislation,” Rep. Thompson said. “Many of my colleagues are truly invested in saving our natural resources, and I was impressed by their impassioned remarks in support of my amendment. Their efforts will ensure that our endangered and threatened species are protected for the future.” If the Extinction Rider had been in effect 44 years ago, the American bald eagle, our national bird, would be extinct. In the 1960s, there were less than 450 nesting pairs of bald eagles. But thanks to the Endangered Species Act, this national symbol was removed from the endangered species list in 2007 and now there are nearly 10,000 nesting pairs of bald eagles. A more local example of the ESA's positive impact is the Aleutian goose. In 1967, there were no more than a few hundred of these birds left in the wild. ESA protections allowed the Aleutian goose population to rebound, to a population of more than 100,000 birds in 2008. In fact, the ESA recovery effort was so successful that the Aleutian goose was delisted in 2001 and is today being hunted in Humboldt and Del Norte counties. In addition to the Extinction Rider, H.R. 2584 contains nearly 40 other anti-environment policy riders, including provisions that would: Block protections for more than 1 million acres of land around the Grand Canyon, leaving them open to toxic uranium mining. Prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from implementing the just-finalized Cross-State Pollution Rule, which protects communities from dangerous pollution from power plants upwind of them. Indefinitely stop long-overdue standards to control toxic mercury air pollution from power plants, endangering pregnant women, infants, and children. Block EPA from moving forward with standards for new vehicles after 2016 that would reduce our foreign oil imports and cut pollution. Allow oil companies to pollute more when drilling offshore by weakening the Clean Air Act and exempting polluting support vessels from regulation.
07.26.2011	Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) have joined Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA), Wally Herger (R-CA), and 26 other House members in a bipartisan letter urging the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to reverse its denial of a major disaster declaration for numerous California counties hit by a severe storm system earlier this year. The bipartisan letter comes less than two weeks after Governor Jerry Brown formally appealed FEMA's decision to deny federal assistance for affected communities. In their letter, the Members of Congress highlighted the significant and costly damages caused by the storm system, which swept through Alameda, Amador, Butte, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Sierra, Stanislaus, Sutter, Trinity, and Tuolumne counties in March. Current estimates of the damage now exceed $51 million, causing significant financial strain to the state and impacted local communities In total, 30 California Delegation Members who represent communities affected by the March storm system signed on to the bipartisan Congressional Delegation letter, including: Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), Rep. Wally Herger (R-CA), Rep. Lois Capps (D-CA), Rep. Sam Farr (D-CA), Rep. Laura Richardson (D-CA), Rep. Dan Lungren (R-CA), Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA), Rep. David Dreier (R-CA), Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), Rep. George Miller (D-CA), Rep. Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Rep. Linda SÃ¡nchez (D-CA), Rep. John Garamendi (D-CA), Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), Rep. Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Rep. Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), Rep. Mike Honda (D-CA), Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-CA), Rep. Gary Miller (R-CA), Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA), Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA), Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA), Rep. Jim Costa (D-CA), Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), and Rep. Janice Hahn (D-CA). A copy of their letter to FEMA and President Obama is available below: “Dear Mr. President: “We write to you in strong support of the State of California's appeal regarding the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) decision to deny a major disaster declaration and provide federal assistance to address the damages sustained from the severe storm system that struck California in March 2011. “Between March 15 and 27, 2011, a severe storm system struck California bringing heavy rain and snow, high winds and flooding, destroying and damaging property throughout the state. Seventeen counties in our state were hit hard by this storm system including Alameda, Amador, Butte, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Sierra, Stanislaus, Sutter, Trinity, and Tuolumne. “We understand that a Stafford Act major disaster declaration for a storm event is limited to (1) a single storm, or (2) a series of storms that are deemed to be part of the same storm system that impact the same geographical areas, such that the impacts from the separate storms are indistinguishable, and are separated by three days or less. According to the National Weather Service and the California Department of Water Resources, the damages sustained were from a single low pressure storm system which set up over the region for two weeks shifting from north to south and back again across the state. This is consistent with the second category for a qualifying storm event. Furthermore, these conditions are similar to other weather-related federal disasters declaration in 1986, 1997, 1998, 2004/2005 and 2010. “Current estimates of the damage caused by the storm system now exceed $51 million, causing significant financial impacts to the state and the affected local jurisdictions that are beyond their capabilities. Many of us have had the opportunity to view the damage in our communities first-hand, and it is clear that a major disaster declaration is critical to helping our state recover from this devastating storm system. “Therefore, we strongly support the State of California's appeal regarding a major disaster declaration and federal disaster assistance related to the March 2011 storm system. We appreciate your consideration of this request, and we stand ready to assist you in expediting support and resources to the impacted communities throughout California.”
07.26.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement regarding ongoing negotiations to raise our nation's debt ceiling: “Most Americans agree that we must address our nation's debt crisis and put our fiscal house in order - and soon. As a matter of fact, just today, former Reagan Treasury deputy assistant secretary Bruce Bartlett testified at a Ways and Means Committee hearing that failing to raise the debt ceiling would cause a chain of events â€˜much worse' than the 2008 financial crisis. The situation before us is serious and we have a responsibility to solve it - but it must be solved in a responsible way. “Make no mistake - I'm not afraid to cut spending where it's deserved. In fact, I've voted to cut more than $100 billion in spending this year alone and am prepared to vote for more reductions. But I'm not willing to vote to balance the budget on the backs of seniors, the poor, or the middle-class. We can't afford a plan that ruins Medicare or Social Security for hardworking Americans. “What we need is a balanced approach with shared sacrifice by all Americans. This is the commonsense, fiscally responsible approach that will allow government to live within its means while preserving the opportunities that are essential to the American people.”
07.20.2011	Today a bipartisan group of members - Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), Nan Hayworth, M.D. (R-NY), and Dan Lungren (R-CA) - introduced the PACE Protection Act of 2011. The Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) program - currently available in 27 states and the District of Columbia - allows property owners to finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects for their homes and commercial buildings - without any government subsidies or taxes. More important, it will means lower utility bills for property owners and job creation in the hard hit construction industry. "PACE promotes energy efficiency in ways that are good for our country, our economy, and our environment,” said Rep. Thompson. “It saves property owners money by lowering energy costs and, perhaps more important, creates jobs without taxes or government subsidies. Congresswoman Hayworth, Congressman Lungren, and I are committed to protecting PACE for the future, which is why we introduced legislation to continue to allow property owners to finance innovative energy projects through these innovative, affordable, and responsible programs.” The PACE Protection Act addresses adverse action taken by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and their regulators at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) which has prevented communities nationwide from harnessing PACE benefits. The PACE Protection Act of 2011 is meant to protect PACE programs from federal overreach by the FHFA and allow them to continue reducing energy consumption, boosting our economy, and creating jobs, without mandates from the government or taxpayer funds. “PACE programs in our states have allowed homeowners to make energy-saving modifications on their houses through a voluntary assessment on their own property, at no cost to local taxpayers,” stated Rep. Hayworth. “PACE programs create jobs and help Americans to conserve energy, saving on those costs and protecting our environment. Unfortunately, interference by the Federal Home Finance Administration (FHFA) has prevented states from enabling all of their homeowners to take advantage of PACE. Our bill addresses the concerns of FHFA and facilitates participation by homeowners in every state with a PACE program, which will in turn promote conservation, energy savings, and job creation.” With unemployment hovering around 9%, legislation that focuses on creating jobs at the local level all across America is paramount. Independent studies have shown the benefits of PACE to be substantial to homeowners, the economy, the environment, and federal, state, and local governments. “My colleagues and I are fighting for a common sense program that would both increase the value of homes involved and help create jobs in our region. The time is now, more than ever to pass legislation that will accomplish this goal,” Rep. Lungren concluded.
07.20.2011	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Gene Green (D-TX) today issued the following joint statement regarding the release of the Obama Administration's “National Strategy for Electronics Stewardship,” which outlines an action plan to promote the responsible use, reuse, and recycling of U.S. electronic waste: “We are pleased that the Obama Administration is committed to addressing the growing issue of electronics waste, which now represents the fastest growing waste stream in the United States. Furthermore, we applaud the President for working not only with government agencies, but also the private sector to identify potential challenges and solutions to our e-waste problem. Private industry's perspective will be invaluable as we continue to develop workable and responsible e-waste policies. “But while today's announcement is an important first step in the fight against electronic waste, there is still more to be done. Currently, the administration has limited authority to prevent the shipment of hazardous or sensitive e-waste to developing nations. That's why Congress must supplement the President's proposal with legislation to carefully regulate the export of e-waste, particularly when it poses a significant environmental, health, and national security threat.” In response to growing concern about the proper disposal of an increasing number of discarded consumer electronic products, Congressmen Thompson and Green recently introduced H.R. 2284, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act of 2011, bipartisan legislation to prohibit the exportation of some electronics whose improper disposal may create environmental, health, or national security risks. In addition to promoting the responsible recycling of e-waste, the bill also promotes the domestic recycling industry by bringing well-paying recycling jobs back to the U.S. Companion legislation, S. 1270, has also been introduced in the Senate by Senators Whitehouse, Brown, and Murkowski.
07.19.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today issued the following statement on House passage of the “Cut, Cap, and Balance Act”: “Don't let the name of the â€˜Cut, Cap, and Balance Act' fool you. This misguided legislation may slash spending, but it's nowhere near fiscally responsible. It requires immediate and deep spending cuts that will put more Americans out of work and jeopardize our nation's ongoing economic recovery. Even worse, the bill holds an increase on the debt limit hostage to passage of a radical constitutional amendment that, if enacted, would actually make it more difficult to achieve balanced budgets. “I'm not afraid to cut spending where it's deserved, and I've voted that way. However, this bill would completely devastate funding for crucial programs, including Medicare and Social Security. Cuts of this magnitude will undoubtedly harm our country's fragile economic recovery and result in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs. The â€˜Cut, Cap, and Balance Act' is not about balancing the budget - it is merely cover for the most radical Members of Congress to look like they're doing something.”
07.15.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that his district offices in Eureka and Woodland will participate in the third annual “Feds Feed Families” food drive to benefit local food banks. Food banks are most in need of donations during the summer months, when other donations are traditionally lower. Local communities may drop-off their food and other non-perishable goods donations at any of the Congressman's district offices through August 31. “Local food banks continue to face severe shortages of non-perishable goods even while our economy continues to recover,” said Rep. Thompson. “This food drive will help ensure families in our community never have to go hungry.” North Coast residents who are interested in participating in the Feds feed Families food drive may drop-off their food and non-perishable goods donations at their nearest district office: Humboldt District Office 317 3rd Street, Suite 1 Eureka, CA 95501 Yolo District Office 712 Main Street, Suite 101 Woodland, CA 95695 Feds Feed Families is a government-wide effort led by the Chief Human Capital Officers Council, in partnership with the Office of Personnel Management, the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Last year, Feds Feed Families raised 1.7 million pounds of food during the summer, shattering the program's original 1.2 million pound goal.
07.15.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson has been honored with a Friend of the National Parks award from the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his contribution to protecting and enhancing America's national parks. The award, presented to 236 members of Congress on July 13th recognized members with pro-park voting records during the 111th Congress. “America's National Parks are living classrooms that teach us valuable lessons about our shared heritage, and Congressman Thompson's support is essential to the preservation of our national treasures,” said Ron Sundergill, Senior Regional Director for the National Parks Conservation Association. “We look forward to working with him to ensure the protection of our parks in the future.” “One of my top priorities is protecting the North Coast's incredible natural resources for future generations, and national parks play a key role in the preservation process,” said Rep. Thompson. “Working with the National Parks Conservation Association and other groups, I will continue to fight for our forests, our rivers, and our wildlife.” NPCA's Friend of the National Parks award was established in 1999 to track and publicize congressional members' votes on significant park issues. For the 111th Congress, NPCA examined 12 key House votes and six key Senate votes. Senators who voted pro-park four out of six times received the award as did House members who supported parks on at least seven out of twelve votes. A complete list of the 57 senators and 179 representatives who received NPCA's award is available online at https://www.npca.org/park_policy/friend-award.html. Since 1919, the nonpartisan National Parks Conservation Association has been the leading voice of the American people in protecting and enhancing our National Park System. NPCA, its 600,000 members and supporters, and many partners work together to protect the park system and preserve our nation's natural, historical, and cultural heritage for our children and grandchildren.

07.08.2011	During the rest of the month of July, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) will feature art selected from the recent National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)-Yolo Sunflower Art Competition at his district office in Woodland. The primary goal of the popular annual exhibit, which is sponsored by NAMI's Yolo Chapter, is to educate the community about mental illness and reduce its stigma. Several hundred entries from adult artists, both amateur and professional, and youth of all ages comprised the show at the Davis Art Center. “I'm pleased to support the important work that the National Alliance on Mental Illness does in Yolo County,” said Rep. Thompson. “Art is a terrific way to involve the public and spread the message of hope that is so important to people living with mental illness.” Art from the Grand Prize and People's Choice award winners will be featured at the Congressman's Woodland office. Three impressionistic watercolors by youth artists will also be displayed. Local residents and reporters interested in viewing the artwork may visit Congressman Thompson's Woodland office, located in the rear courtyard at 712 Main Street, Suite 101, in Woodland. For additional information, including office hours, please contact Elly Fairclough at (530) 662-5272.
07.08.2011	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Kevin Brady (R-TX) today introduced bipartisan legislation that will help protect small businesses and ensure better compliance with complex federal employment tax responsibilities. H.R. 2466, the Small Business Efficiency Act of 2011, would provide clear rules for Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) that are voluntarily certified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect and pay federal employment taxes for their small business clients. The legislation will provide certainty for small businesses that use certified PEO services and allow employers to focus on their core business, not government paperwork. “Congressman Brady and I introduced the Small Business Efficiency Act to remove the regulatory burdens that stand in the way of small business success,” said Rep. Thompson, a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee. “By providing clear rules for Professional Employer Organizations to collect and pay federal taxes on behalf of their small business clients, our bill will allow small businesses to focus on innovating, growing, and creating good-paying jobs. These are the kinds of smart, targeted policies that will keep our small businesses - and our economy - on the path to prosperity.” “America's economic recovery depends upon our small businesses being able to create jobs and this bill helps get Washington out of their way," said Rep. Brady, the top Republican on the Joint Economic Committee. "Our legislation provides small business owners the flexibility to do what they do best - deliver quality products and services to their customers and expand their businesses, instead of worrying about reams of government paperwork.” PEOs provide human resources services to their small business clients, including access to retirement plans, health insurance, life insurance, and other benefits that many small businesses would not otherwise be able to afford. One of the most important tasks that PEOs can perform for small businesses is the collection and payment of employment taxes. The Small Business Efficiency Act would create a voluntary IRS certification process to strengthen the ability of PEOs to accept liability for filing payroll taxes of their clients' employees and, in the process, reduce the amount of burdensome paperwork for small businesses. “Our top priority is producing great wine, not running a HR department,” said George Ling, the General Manager of X Winery in Napa. “The regulatory and administrative complexities of managing the HR component of our business, while necessary, limit the resources we have to focus on areas that grow our business - sourcing, making, marketing, and selling wine. The primary benefit of working with a PEO is that they remove some of these complexities and provide a more cost efficient alternative to managing HR and providing the benefits our employees deserve.” To become a certified PEO (CPEO) under Congressmen Thompson and Brady's legislation, a PEO must meet certain basic financial conditions, satisfy reporting obligations, and maintain ongoing certification with the IRS. After meeting certification requirements, the CPEO would assume full and sole responsibility and liability for employment taxes due as long as they are certified.
07.06.2011	The California Association of Health Facilities (CAHF) today praised Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa) for his support of the bipartisan letter to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as the federal health agency considers a proposal that would cut Medicare reimbursement to skilled nursing facilities immediately by 12.8 percent for fiscal year 2012. Thompson was one of eight Californians who were among 152 representatives to sign onto the letter to CMS, which urges the agency to consider all of the appropriate data before adopting deep Medicare payment cuts to skilled-nursing facilities. “Rep. Thompson continues to carry our voice in Washington to ensure the growing needs of our state's most vulnerable, frail, and elderly and disabled are protected,” said CAHF CEO/President James Gomez. “His recognition of the potential devastation this proposal could inflict on California's nursing facilities, the quality of care they provide and the number of jobs they contribute could make the difference in finding a more measured approach to their Medicare payment system.” In an unprecedented move in late April, CMS proposed a drastic, immediate cut of more than $4 billion to the nation's skilled-nursing facilities. The agency's proposal is based on less than one year of data, while, historically, CMS bases decisions on a full year of data. If the proposal were adopted, nursing facilities would be forced to make significant operational changes, putting more than 100,000 jobs in multiple professions at risk. Additionally, Medi-Cal payments to skilled nursing facilities were cut by 10 percent in the recently-enacted state budget. CAHF and its national affiliate, the American Health Care Association (AHCA), are advocating that CMS slow down the process and follow its traditional practices of examining the entire data before implementing a reduction to nursing facilities. The associations aim to help CMS reach its goal of budget neutrality within the Medicare payment system, but through a more measured, targeted approach by dispersing the reduction over multiple years. The bipartisan letter sent to CMS Administrator Donald Berwick was co-signed by California Reps. Howard Berman (D-Van Nuys), John Campbell (R-Newport Beach), Lois Capps (D-Santa Barbara), Dennis Cardoza (D-Modesto), Darrell Issa (R-San Diego), Barbara Lee (D-Oakland) and Grace Napolitano (D-Santa Fe Springs). The letter states: “Financial stability is critical to ensuring sustainable, quality long-term care for Medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities. The men and women who work in these facilities, approximately 3.1 million Americans, are responsible for serving some of the frailest members of our society. We must ensure that the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries are preserved. “On behalf of our constituents who receive care in SNFs, we request the agency take a more measured approach and delay any proposed cuts pending a review of data from a full year. If, after reviewing additional data, CMS ultimately determines that comprehensive information supports the need to adjust payments to SNFs, then it should follow its common practice of implementing the reduction over a period of two or three years in order to reduce the potential impact on nursing facility services.”
06.30.2011	Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced that the interest rate on subsidized student loans will be cut to 3.4% on July 1st - the last of four steps to cut this interest rate in half over four years under the 2007 College Cost Reduction and Access Act. Due to these cuts, the typical student borrower who started college in 2008 will have saved $2,570 over the life of their loan. Under this legislation, the interest rate on subsidized student loans has been cut as follows:On July 1, 2008, the interest rate was cut from 6.8% to 6.0%; On July 1, 2009, the interest rate was cut from 6.0% to 5.6%; On July 1, 2010, the interest rate was cut from 5.6% to 4.5%; and On July 1, 2011, the interest rate will be cut from 4.5% to 3.4%. Also on July 1, new college affordability information will become available to young people and their families on the Department of Education website. This information will help prospective college students and their families shop for the best value - based on their individual circumstances - for a college education. Students and their families will be provided with early estimates of their expected college costs, and allowed to estimate the annual and total cost of a college education at the individual colleges or universities they are interested in. The site will also provide information on incentives for attendance that individual colleges and universities may be offering, such as need-based aid. In addition to cutting interest rates in half and requiring new online college affordability information, Congressman Thompson and his colleagues have taken numerous other steps to make college more affordable, including: Increasing the Maximum Pell Grant. Between 2007 and 2010, Congress increased the maximum Pell Grant from $4,050 to $5,550. Currently, there are about 9 million students receiving a Pell Grant to help pay for the costs of college. In California's First Congressional District alone, over 18,400 students have received more than $68 million in estimated available aid. Implementing an Income-Based Repayment Program. Starting on July 1, 2009, Congress established the Income-Based Repayment Program to make student loan payments more manageable for student borrowers. The program guarantees that borrowers will not have to pay more than 15 percent of their discretionary income in loan repayments. Establishing Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Congress also established the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which allows graduates who enter into public service careers - as teachers, public defenders, firefighters, nurses, non-profit workers, and more - to be eligible for complete loan forgiveness after 10 years of qualifying public service and loan repayments. The program has been in effect since October 1, 2007.
06.24.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today introduced H.R. 2286, the Renewable Energy Parity Act of 2011, bipartisan legislation that would ensure all renewable energy sources are able to compete in the growing market for renewable and alternative energy fuels. Under current tax law, some renewable energy technologies are only eligible for part of an existing federal tax credit for the development of alternative energy sources. The Congressman's bill would level the playing field by extending the full tax credit amount to qualifying renewable energy technologies. “Not all alternative energy technologies are treated equally under current tax law, and it's hurting American consumers,” said Rep. Thompson. “If our country is going to be a leader in the emerging green economy, alternative energy technologies need to receive comparable tax credits for the energy they produce. That way, energy producers will have the necessary incentives to bring the best renewable energy technologies to the marketplace.” Currently, companies that engage in the production and sale of electricity through the use of renewable energy technologies may qualify for a federal production tax credit under Section 45 of the U.S. tax code. However, only energy from wind, geothermal, and closed-loop biomass facilities qualify for the full tax credit amount of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour. Other renewable energy technologies such as land-fill gas recovery and wave and tidal energy receive only half of that amount - 1.1 cents per kilowatt hour. By extending the full tax credit amount to eligible alternative energy sources, Rep. Thompson's legislation will give producers additional incentives to invest in cutting-edge energy technologies and bring more choices to the energy marketplace. In California's First Congressional District, beneficiaries of the bill would include open-loop biomass power plants in Eureka, Scotia, Woodland, and Blue Lake. Open-loop systems, which burn waste wood to generate electrical power, are one of the renewable energy technologies that receive only a partial tax credit under current law. "Congressman Thompson's leadership in supporting investment in biomass facilities, and advancements in technology, increase the opportunity to tap into potential domestic energy resources that are currently under utilized, or treated as waste," said Stephen Sorrentino, Vice President of DTE Energy Services, which operates a biomass power plant in Woodland. "And in addition to its environmental benefits, biomass power is good for the economy. America's biopower industry provides some 14,000 quality jobs and generates about $1 billion a year for the nation's economy. Each biomass power plant contributes about $8 to $14 million annually to the local communities where they operate in payroll, purchases, and property tax revenue.” Biomass power is an important source of green energy and jobs in California. Biomass facilities provide approximately 1.5 percent of California's overall power and over 17 percent of the state's renewable power. The biomass industry employs about 750 direct jobs at the state's 33 biomass facilities and 1,200 to 1,500 dedicated indirect jobs in the fuel supply infrastructure. Most of these jobs are in rural areas of the state, including parts of Northern California. “At the Fairhaven facility in Humboldt County, our 22 permanent employees and more than 40 indirect supplier positions provide substantial economic benefits to the local economy, all while the facility produces more renewable energy than a wind or solar facility of perhaps three to four times its size,” said John Wood, Executive Vice President EWP Renewable Corporation. “Keeping these plants productive through Congressman Thompson's proposal is critical to sustaining these renewable energy benefits and jobs in Humboldt County.” Hugh Smith, President of Greenleaf Power, a California-based company that operates a biomass power plant in Scotia, added, "We applaud Congressman Mike Thompson for being supportive of the biomass industry. The Congressman understands that thousands of Americans rely on the biomass industry for their livelihood. While other forms of renewable energy receive greater publicity, biomass is a safe, reliable and renewable form of sustainable energy that promotes environmental stewardship."
06.23.2011	In response to growing concern about the proper disposal of an increasing number of discarded consumer electronic products, Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-01) and Gene Green (TX-29) introduced H.R. 2284, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act of 2011, to prohibit the exportation of some electronics whose improper disposal may create environmental, health, or national security risks. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office reported that many of the developing nations that receive e-waste from the United States do not have the capacity or facilities to safely recycle and dispose of these used electronics. H.R. 2284 would address this growing problem. “Each year, millions of tons of electronics equipment are discarded in the U.S. and shipped to developing nations for unsafe salvage and recovery,” said Rep. Thompson. “By carefully regulating the export of e-waste, this bipartisan legislation takes concrete steps to address a growing environmental and health crisis while creating good-paying recycling jobs here in the U.S.” “E-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in the United States, and it can pose a serious problem in that most e-waste contains toxic chemicals which present environmental and health concerns when not properly handled,” said Rep. Green. “As the Ranking Member on the House Energy and Commerce Environment and Economy Subcommittee, I look forward to working with the majority in the House to pass this bill, which successfully addresses this growing issue. I also want to thank Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) for introducing the companion bill in the Senate.” Specifically, H.R. 2284 creates a new section of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act that prohibits the export of “restricted electronic equipment” from the U.S. to developing nations. In defining restricted electronic equipment, the bill lists several toxic materials, the presence of which would cause covered equipment to be considered restricted waste. The bill calls for the EPA to set de minimis levels for these toxic substances and clarifies that material streams such as plastics, metals, and glass that do not contain hazardous chemicals above the de minimis levels may be exported. Under H.R. 2284, tested and working equipment can still be exported to promote reuse, along with products discarded for warranty repair or due to recall. Importing countries must give their consent to accept exempted exports. This legislative approach is consistent with the e-waste policies adopted by most other developed nations via international treaties, such as the Basel Convention and Basel Ban Amendment. “As an industry leader in product lifecycle improvements, HP does not allow the export of e-waste from developed countries to developing countries. We support the work of Rep. Gene Green and Rep. Mike Thompson to pass the Responsible Electronics Recycling Act, and we encourage other companies to join the effort and promote responsible recycling,” said Ashley Watson, Vice President and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer for HP. In addition to promoting the responsible recycling of e-waste, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act of 2011 will also create good-paying jobs in America. While there are domestic recyclers that currently process e-waste, they have a hard time competing with overseas recycling facilities that have few, if any, labor and environmental standards and are thus able to offer cheaper services. By promoting the domestic recycling industry, H.R. 2284 will bring recycling jobs back to the U.S. “This is the most important step our federal government can take to solve the e-waste problem - to close the door on e-waste dumping on developing countries,” said Barbara Kyle, National Coordinator of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, a national environmental coalition which promotes responsible recycling of e-waste. “It will bring recycling jobs back to the U.S.” Dewayne Burns, CEO of eSCO Processing and Recycling, added, “Not only is this bill good for the environment, but it gives a boost to small business recyclers and creates more green jobs. This is what both the industry and our customers want.” H.R. 2284 also creates a research program at the Department of Energy to help assess the recycling and recovery of Rare Earth Metals from electronics. This provision will help ensure the proper collection and recycling of precious and strategic metals. H.R. 2284 has garnered bipartisan support with original Republican co-sponsors Rep. Steven LaTourette (OH-14) and Rep. Lee Terry (NE-2). The legislation also enjoys broad industry support, with officially endorsements from Hewlett Packard, Dell, Apple, Samsung, Best Buy, The Electronics TakeBack Coalition, and 29 recyclers representing 74 recycling operations in 34 states.
06.20.2011	On Friday, June 17, Rep. Mike Thompson delivered the commencement address for graduates of Kelseyville High School in Kelseyville, California. The full text of the Congressman's remarks as prepared are available below: "Thank you Kelseyville High School administrators, teachers, parents, and - most important - students for inviting me to speak on this most special day: your high school graduation. Congratulations! Years of hard work have brought you to this moment. You've worked hard, done well, and deserve to be proud of your success. "During my public service as a Member of Congress and a State Senator, I have had the honor of giving commencement addresses at community colleges, state universities, and the University of California. But today marks my first high school commencement address. And I couldn't be prouder that it's here at Kelseyville High School! So again, thank you for this honor. "I was a little nervous about my first high school commencement, so I asked some of my colleagues what advice they had for tonight's graduates. During my remarks, I'll share with you some of what they offered. "You are fortunate to live in this incredible community, where you can enjoy beautiful Clear Lake; the flowering pear trees on Main Street; picturesque vineyards; and the commanding presence of Mt. Konocti with its majestic Black Forest. But you're also surrounded by something even more special and important - a community of friends, family, and neighbors who are proud of you and are rooting for your continued success. "Your achievements are impressive. Some of you are going to four year universities, community colleges, and trade schools; others are preparing to serve our country in the military; and others are jumping straight into the workforce. Wherever you go, and whatever you do, Kelseyville will always be home. Kelseyville is your community. "And an important part of being a member of a community is working to improve it - to give back to the folks who provided the foundation for your success, and to strengthen that foundation for those who will follow you. Former House Speaker, now Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi asked that I tell you that the best way to do that is to 'be ready' - to 'develop your skills so that you are ready for the opportunities that come your way.' "Being ready is not a spectator sport. You have to work for it, strive for it, and sacrifice for it. You have to commit yourself to being a lifelong learner - to continually seek knowledge and self-improvement. "I have few tips that I hope will be helpful to you 'being ready.' "First, find your passion. Passion is what gives your life meaning and purpose - it's what drives all of us to do our part to make our world a better place. To find your passion, you have to ask yourself some tough questions - not just now, but over and over again throughout your life: “'What is it I am good at?' Have you always been a good writer, speaker, organizer, builder, teacher, friend? Do you come up with good ideas, connect people, or inspire others? 'What excites me?' It may be something at work - a part of your job that gets your juices flowing. It could be something you do outside of work - a hobby, something you do as a volunteer, as a student, or as a friend. And finally, 'What do I dream of doing?' We all have a dream job - to be a novelist, an astronaut, a fashion designer, a doctor, or the next Mark Zuckerberg. What attracts you to this career? "You may have the answers to these questions right now. I sure didn't when I was 17, 18, 19, or even 20. Let's just say it took me years to realize that my passion is public service. But no matter how long it takes, all I ask is that eventually you know and live your passion. Take the time to discover what you want, and then go after it. "Second, know your stuff. Make sure you have a strong foundation in whatever it is you pursue. For some of you, that foundation will come through additional formal education. For others, it will come through life lessons learned at work or in the military. Different forms of education, all very valuable. "My colleague and presidential hopeful Michele Bachmann asked that I remind you that 'there is one thing no one can ever take away from you - your education.' That's important advice - you can't be certain of everything in life, but you can always depend on yourself. "On your journey as lifelong learners, take any and all opportunities to absorb the wisdom of others. Listen to your teachers, to your bosses, to your family - to anyone who knows something you don't. You can always learn something, no matter how old you get or who you are. Let their knowledge work for you! "Third, work hard and if you make a mistake, learn from it. You already have a head start on this lesson - it's taken all of you years to earn this diploma! "Talent and genius alone aren't enough to get you through life. You have to invest yourself in your goals - put in the â€˜blood, sweat, and tears' that will ultimately make you the best at what you do. All of you are naturally gifted, but that alone won't ensure your success. To reach your full potential, heed the advice of House Speaker John Boehner, whose words to you are: 'Go out and work for it!' "Sometimes, even with hard work, there will be mistakes and bad choices. How many of you have watched or heard of the show, 'Are You Smarter than a Fifth Grader?' Well, here's a news flash for you: you are smarter than your Congressman was at your age. That's because you are graduating from high school tonight! "I thought I knew more than my parents, my teachers, and most other adults. So, I dropped out of high school. Bad choice, big mistake! It wasn't until I was in the Army and Vietnam-bound that I realized those adults were one heck of a lot smarter than I thought. I eventually made my way back to school, and may be the only person you know to get a GED, Bachelor's degree, high school diploma, and Master's degree - in that order! "Dropping out of high school was a mistake, but I recognized my error and learned from it. You'll make mistakes in your life. Bad choices are a part of the human experience - they're one way we learn, grow, and ultimately, succeed. "Finally, and most important, never give up. There are going to be times when it seems like there are too many barriers blocking the path to your success. When you find yourself in this situation, just remember that any goal worth having is worth working for. "One of the most inspirational Members of Congress is John Lewis from Georgia. He was beaten and jailed while marching and working with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during the Civil Rights Movement. His advice for you is actually a reminder: that the greatest misconception facing our country is that there are no more hard battles to be fought - that we've reached a place in our democracy where we can finally sit down. But that's not true. "Congressman Lewis says to 'get off the sidelines and get in the game. We have to get our fingernails dirty, dig in, and make sure that our nation does what is right, what is fair, and what is just.' He's a good reminder that change doesn't always come easy. Throughout our history, disenfranchised groups were constantly told to give up their fight against injustice. But they didn't stop. And eventually, they won the rights they deserved. "So when confronted with a challenge, don't let it stop you. Remember the courage and persistence of the leaders who came before you - who worked hard and fought for what they believed in.

06.16.2011	The State of California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) has awarded the City of West Sacramento $2,488,625 in federal Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding to provide public infrastructure in support of a new metals recycling facility proposed for the Port of West Sacramento. Mayor Christopher Cabaldon applauds the grant and explains its significance to the community, “the project represents a $25 million private investment that will provide employment for local contractors and vendors during the construction period and, when operational, will provide jobs for 65 local residents in administrative, operating and maintenance positions.” Grant funds will be used to construct a new Port entrance and intersection on Harbor Boulevard, in addition to a road for access to the facility. “The Port of West Sacramento is quickly becoming one of the west coast's most environmentally responsible ports” notes Congressman Mike Thompson. “Its ongoing renaissance depends on a combination of private investment and public support. This grant funding will be a huge boon to the people of West Sacramento, who will benefit not only from good-paying jobs, but a dramatic increase in the volume of goods coming through the port. These are the kinds of smart, targeted investments that will make our community a leader in the emerging green economy.” For every ton of steel that is recycled, more than 4,000 pounds of raw materials are conserved. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, using recycled iron and steel saves 74% of the energy that would be needed if virgin materials are used to make new steel. Nationwide, that is enough energy to provide electricity to 20 million households for an entire year. David Gigerich, president and CEO of West Coast Recycling Group, LLC notes that his company is committed to making the project a reality, “We are moving forward with our investment in the West Sacramento community to construct our new state-of-the-art metal recycling facility at the Port of West Sacramento.” The West Coast Recycling project will be presented to the West Sacramento Planning Commission at 6:00 p.m. on June 16, 2011.
06.08.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) is being honored for his continuing efforts to expand access and improve the quality and safety of patient care by the California Hospital Association (CHA). Rep. Thompson is the recipient of CHA's Health Care Champion Award, presented to select elected officials who demonstrate exceptional leadership on behalf of California's hospitals and the patients they serve. The award was presented during a special ceremony hosted by members of the Hospital Council of Northern and Central California on Wednesday. “Congressman Thompson has been a relentless advocate for both patients and health care providers throughout his career,” said CHA President and CEO C. Duane Dauner. “As a state legislator and a Member of Congress, he has always fought to ensure patients have access to high-quality, affordable care. We appreciate the Congressman's efforts on behalf of California families and look forward to continuing to work with him on the important health care issues facing our state and our nation.” “Rep. Thompson was actively engaged in the health care reform debate at all stages of its consideration and deliberation,” said Terry Burns, CEO and President of Ukiah Valley Medical Center. “From the very beginning of the debate, it was clear that improving access to high quality, affordable care was his number one priority. The Congressman stood with rural hospitals like ours every step of the way.” In accepting the CHA award, Rep. Thompson noted that providing access to quality health care has been a hallmark of his career. “Strengthening our health care system has never been a solo effort,” said Rep. Thompson. “That's why I've always been proud to work with groups like the CHA that share my commitment to providing California families with high quality, affordable care. Working together, we can continue to provide Californians with the resources they need to take charge of their health.” As one of the largest health care trade associations in our nation, CHA represents more than 400 hospitals and health systems in California. The association provides its members with public policy development, issues management, and legislative advocacy services at the state and federal levels. CHA has offices in Sacramento and Washington, D.C.
06.02.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today released the following statement regarding H.R. 1837, a bill introduced by Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA): “The San Joaquin Valley Water Reliability Act is nothing more than an attempt by powerful water districts south of the Sacramento River Delta to take water they aren't entitled to from farms to the north. H.R. 1837 looks to throw out long-standing state water law, gut the restoration of the San Joaquin River, and take water desperately needed for fisheries that are vital to coastal communities. “This bill is a blatant move to siphon water from Northern California to irrigation districts that do not hold first rights to that water. It would do this at the expense of both farms and fish that generate billions of dollars in economic activity and thousands of jobs. “H.R. 1837 would discard decades of cooperation to solve the delta's water problems, undermine California's sovereignty and devastate water law principles. The coordination among state and federal agencies and stakeholders in the region built up during the Bay-Delta Conservation Plan would be undone by this bill, and the reliability of the state's water system would be compromised. “Rep. Nunes' bill ignores current water law that ensures a fair and equitable distribution of water in Northern California and threatens to restart the water wars of the past. Instead, we should be working together to solidify the alliances that have been built to address the health of the delta, its farms and its fisheries.”
05.26.2011	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Jim Gerlach (R-PA) today introduced the Conservation Easement Incentive Act, landmark legislation that would provide family farmers, ranchers, and other moderate-income landowners with a permanent incentive to donate development rights to their land. By providing tax benefits to landowners who choose conservation, the bill would help preserve our nation's cherished farm lands and open spaces for future generations. The bill has received broad bipartisan support in the House of Representatives, with 251 original co-sponsors. Under Congressmen Thompson and Gerlach's bill, landowners who donate a conservation easement would maintain ownership and management of the land, but forgo their rights to develop the land in the future. The Conservation Easement Incentive Act would make permanent a tax incentive for donating development rights that will otherwise expire at the end of 2011. Eliminating this ever-changing deadline will give more farmers, ranchers, and forest owners the assurance they need to choose land conservation over development. “Tax incentives can be a powerful tool to help green our economy and protect our natural resources,” said Rep. Thompson. “Conservation easements have been particularly effective, encouraging landowners to conserve millions of acres of farm lands and scenic open spaces. By making this important conservation tool permanent, my bill would help preserve even more land for future generations.” “It is not at all uncommon that putting together a conservation easement can take several years, and the uncertainty created by one or two year extensions makes it difficult for landowners to know what the tax consequences will be at the end of the process," said Mendocino Land Trust Board President Winston Bowen. "I have been working on one project to permanently protect over 450 acres of oak woodlands that has taken two and one-half years so far, and could take another year. Taxpayers need the consistency in the law that Congressman Thompson's bill will provide." "Congressman Mike Thompson is a national champion for land protection and the preservation of our natural resources,” said Joel Tranmer, CEO of the Land Trust of Napa County. “His tireless efforts to make conservation tax incentives permanent have been critical to the conservation movement in this country. These benefits are helping the Land Trust of Napa County to permanently protect vineyard lands, family farms and scenic open space." “The Northcoast Regional Land Trust is thankful that Congressman Thompson is leading the charge to save this important conservation tool,” said Lindsay Magnuson, Executive Director of the Northcoast Regional Land Trust. “We have seen firsthand the dramatic impact that the incentive has had in helping landowners voluntarily and permanently conserve farmlands, wildlife habitat and open space in Northern California and across the nation.” “Conservation easements are an essential, cost-effective tool in achieving our mission of protecting the scenic, natural, agricultural and open landscapes of Sonoma County â€” particularly working landscapes,” said Sonoma Land Trust Executive Director Ralph Benson. “We appreciate Congressman Mike Thompson's leadership in private land conservation not only here at home, but also throughout the nation.” “Yolo Land Trust applauds the leadership of Congressman Thompson in the effort to make this important conservation tool permanent," said Michele Clark, Executive Director of the Yolo Land Trust. “This tax incentive will help landowners permanently conserve farmland, wildlife habitat, and open space in Yolo County." Specifically, the Conservation Easement Incentive Act would help landowners of modest means choose conservation by: Raising the maximum deduction a donor can take for donating a conservation easement from 30% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) in any year to 50%; Allowing qualified farmers and ranchers to deduct up to 100% of their AGI; and Increasing the number of years over which a donor can take deductions from 6 to 16 years. The Conservation Easement Incentive Act has been endorsed by the Land Trust Alliance, Ducks Unlimited, National Wildlife Federation, National Cattleman's Beef Association, American Forest Foundation, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, and over fifty other groups.
05.25.2011	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Dave Reichert (R-WA) today introduced the bipartisan Community Forestry Conservation Act (H.R. 1982), which would enable non-profit conservation organizations to use bonds to purchase private, working forests for long-term environmental and economic sustainability management. A broad coalition of conservationists, private landowners, and the timber industry endorsed the legislation for its pragmatic approach to balancing conservation and business interests. “Working forests are an important source of jobs and income in Northern California,” said Rep. Thompson. “Our economy depends on healthy forests, and forest conservation bonds provide an important tool to preserve these resources. By encouraging sustainable management practices, this bill will save jobs and our nation's forests for future generations.” “This important bill fosters needed public-private partnerships to meet the dual needs of conserving open spaces for future generations and sustaining the forest products jobs that depend on managing working forests,” said Congressman Reichert. “I'm proud to carry forward my predecessor Jennifer Dunn's legacy in sponsoring this pragmatic legislation that unites such diverse interests behind shared goals.” “Community Forestry Bonds will help the Foundation keep our community forestry efforts moving forward", said Art Harwood, Executive Director of the Redwood Forest Foundation, a non-profit organization of diverse interests that acquire and manage forestlands in an equitable fashion. "Local control of the forest resources empowers local citizens to take control of their future.” “We have long needed a mechanism that would make possible the re-engagement of communities with their productive lands,” said David Simpson, Co-Founder of the Mattole Restoration Council, one of North America's oldest community-led watershed restoration organizations. “Community Forestry Bonds provide a great mechanism for providing social and ecological stability that communities need with an increasing urgency.” "Community Forestry Bonds are a great way to help acquire unique forest properties for conservation," said Jerry Brodie of The Campbell Group, one of the largest timberland investment managers with over 3 million acres in the United States. “Together businesses such as ours and the conservation community can use these bonds to support working forests that provide environmental benefits, living-wage jobs and a continued supply of forest products.” “Forest conservation bonds are an innovative tool that enables the forest conservation and timber industry communities to join together to purchase working forests, prevent their development, and increase the level of environmental protection. It's a win-win for jobs and conservation at no significant cost to taxpayers,” said Athan Manuel, Director of the Lands Protection Program for the Sierra Club. The US Forest Service estimates that over one million acres of America's private forests are lost each year to land conversion and development. H.R. 1982 modifies the tax code to allow municipal revenue bonds to be issued for the acquisition of forestland by a qualified buyer. The low-cost bonds would be backed by the revenue stream generated by the sustainable management of the land. This new tool will provide a mechanism for acquisition of lands that are at a high risk of parcelization and for other lands that may be difficult for long-term commercial management. Such acquisition protects the land from development and fragmentation while allowing jobs that depend on harvesting to continue. The bill could conserve an estimated 2.2 million acres of working forests throughout the country.
05.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today sent a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood expressing his support for the administration's pilot trucking program that could ease Mexico's punitive tariffs on California fruit and other U.S. goods. In California's First District, fruit growers have seen a deep decline in sales and market share as a result of these tariffs. Implementing the trucking program could give Mexico a concrete incentive to eliminate its harmful trade policies. “The Department of Transportation has the power to ease the impact of harmful tariffs on California fruit growers and set the stage for their future prosperity,” said Rep. Thompson. “By approving this transportation program, the agency would not only provide a clear path toward the elimination of Mexico's tariffs, but the possible normalization of trade between our two countries. The program would also ensure that cross-border trucks adhere to our country's rigorous environmental and safety standards. I strongly support the implementation of this program and thank Secretary LaHood for his leadership on this issue.” Background: In 2007, the Department of Transportation launched a pilot program that would allow commercial Mexican vehicles to operate across the U.S.-Mexico border. When the pilot program was terminated in 2009, the Mexican government retaliated by imposing tariffs on 99 U.S. products. In California's First District, fruit growers who had spent millions of dollars developing a market in Mexico and investing in shipping strategies have seen a deep decline in sales and market share. Implementation of the cross-border long-haul trucking pilot program would provide Mexico with a concrete incentive to eliminate these punitive tariffs and put California farmers on a path toward success. The program would also include important protections to ensure trucks crossing the border are operating safely on our roadways and under our environmental standards. A copy of Rep. Thompson's letter to Secretary LaHood is available below: “Dear Mr. Secretary, “I am writing to you in support of the proposed United States-Mexico cross-border long-haul trucking pilot program published in the Federal Register on April 13, 2011. For more than two years, U.S. exporters have faced steep retaliatory tariffs imposed by the Mexican government on a wide range of products, putting farmers in my district at a strong disadvantage to foreign competitors. “As you know, under international obligations, the U.S. granted Mexican commercial trucks full access to U.S. roadways. However, concerns about ensuring that those trucks operated safely and did not undermine our environmental protections led to a longstanding trade dispute between the two countries. “In 2007, after many years of discussions about the specific terms and conditions of the program, the Department of Transportation launched a pilot program that would allow commercial Mexican vehicles to operate across the U.S.-Mexico border. When that program was terminated in 2009, the Mexican government retaliated by imposing tariffs on 99 U.S. products with a total export value of $2.6 billion. “In California's First District, farmers have been disproportionately affected by these steep tariffs. Specifically, fruit growers who have spent millions of dollars developing a market in Mexico and have invested in innovative ways of shipping their products have seen a deep decline in sales and market share. These growers now face intense competition from South American competitors and an uphill battle in reclaiming market share and rebuilding their export volume. At a time when many of the rural communities where these growers operate face high unemployment, we must ensure they are not being put at a further disadvantage, hindering job creation potential and the financial viability of staying in business. Additionally, these tariffs are currently causing a great deal of uncertainty as we approach annual peak harvest for many California crops. We must ensure our producers can plan appropriately for the demand from the Mexican market. “The proposal the Administration crafted includes important protections to ensure trucks crossing the border are operating safely on our roadways and under our environmental standards, allowing us to monitor and inspect vehicles before they are approved for cross-border trucking operations. I believe implementation of this revised pilot program provides a clear path toward the elimination of these harmful retaliatory tariffs and the normalization of trade between our two countries, while also ensuring the integrity of our roadways. “Again, I express my support for this proposal and thank you for your leadership on this issue.”
05.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Human Analysis, and Counterintelligence, today voted to strengthen U.S. intelligence efforts by increasing the number of counterterrorism positions at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). H.R. 754, the FY 2011 Intelligence Authorization Act, would add several thousand civilian positions in intelligence, increasing the number of analysts who work tirelessly to keep our country safe. The bill passed the House with broad bipartisan support. “Hiring more counterterrorism analysts will make our country safer and more secure,” said Rep. Thompson. “It was these very counterterrorism analysts that located Osama Bin Laden and are now tracking senior al Qaeda leadership across the globe. By providing more resources for this critical effort, our intelligence community will be able to confront, head on, the threat posed by al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations throughout the world.” Hiring additional counterterrorism analysts will give our military the tools it needs to continue the transition from a flawed counterinsurgency strategy to a more effective counterterrorism strategy. This tactical change would significantly reduce our military footprint in countries around the world, while allowing our military and intelligence communities to confront terrorism threats wherever they develop. A counterterrorism strategy would also allow for a responsible redeployment of our troops out of Afghanistan. “The Afghanistan war is now the longest running war in United States history,” Rep. Thompson continued. “It's time to get our troops out of the region and shift to a counterterrorism strategy to fight the war on terror. That's where the future of our fight against al Qaeda and terrorism lies.” On Thursday, Congressman Thompson delivered a floor speech in support of H.R. 754. A full copy of his remarks is available below: “As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence, I'm pleased we are able to work through our differences to bring a stronger and now bipartisan Intelligence Authorization bill to the floor today. H.R. 754 will support critical U.S. intelligence capabilities by increasing resources for our country's counterterrorism efforts, while also providing needed flexibility to the Central Intelligence Agency to hire the analysts that it needs. “Last year, under the leadership of then Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Reyes, President Obama signed the first signed the first intelligence authorization act in 6 years. That bill included a number of long overdue provisions that supported critical U.S. intelligence capabilities, significantly enhanced Congressional oversight, and improved accountability across the entire Intelligence Community. Today's bill builds on that effort and represents an important step forward towards enacting an Intelligence Authorization bill for the second year in a row. “Unfortunately, the process used to produce this bill was badly flawed, and there weren't proper hearings to get to where we are now, and that's evidenced by the amendments that we're able to get into this bill to bring it up to the position that it's in. However, with the changes made to the classified annex, I believe this authorization will strengthen our national security and is in the best interest of our Intelligence Community. “Specifically, the additional funds authorized by this bill to hire more counterterrorism analysts will make our country safer and more secure. It was, after all, counterterrorism analysts that located Osama bin Laden after he had disappeared for nearly ten years; and that are now tracking senior al-Qaeda leadership around the globe. By providing more resources to this critical effort, our Intelligence Community will be able to confront head on the threat posed by al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations throughout the world. “In fact, given the recent success of our counterterrorism effort, this is the strategy we should pursue over our counter-insurgency campaign in Afghanistan, which has not shown the results that Congress expected or that the American people demand. This tactical change would significantly reduce our military footprint in countries around the world, while allowing our military and intelligence assets to confront terrorism threats wherever they're developed. “Mr. Speaker, our Intelligence Community must be prepared for any and all threats, making it all the more critical for Congress to pass an Intelligence Authorization that furthers our national security. This legislation is necessary, will enhance the capabilities of the intelligence community, specifically our counterterrorism efforts, and will make our nations safer. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and thank the members of our intelligence community and their families for their great work and their sacrifice.”
05.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that Nick Christen from Woodland High School is the winner of the 2011 Congressional Art Competition. Nick's artwork, a photograph titled “Yolo Bypass,” will represent California's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where it will be displayed for one year. Nick and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony in June. “I am always impressed with the talent and creativity of the students who participate in this competition,” said Rep. Thompson. “Nick is an extremely talented artist with a bright future, and I am honored to feature his artwork in the U.S. Capitol. Our entire community should be proud of his achievement.” Nick was one of six regional winners chosen by Rep. Thompson's district staff. The five other finalists were:Mira Weidman from Northcoast Preparatory and Performing Arts Academy in Arcata Katelynn Meade-Malley from Lower Lake High School in Lower Lake Joshua Lobue from Fort Bragg High School in Fort Bragg Nilla Marie Mercado from American Canyon High School in American Canyon Erika Quezada from Cloverdale High School in Cloverdale The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 to provide an opportunity for members of Congress to encourage and recognize the artistic talents of their young constituents. Since then, over 650,000 high school students have been involved with the nation-wide competition.
05.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today announced that the U.S. Department of Labor is awarding $6,498,100 in National Emergency Grant (NEG) funding to create temporary jobs in communities that were affected by the March tsunami waves. About 270 local residents will be employed on projects to assist with clean-up, demolition, repair, renovation, and reconstruction in Del Norte and Santa Cruz counties. “Months after tsunami waves battered the North Coast, many communities are still recovering from the aftermath,” said Rep. Thompson. “The National Emergency Grant funding will help speed up the clean-up process at our ports and coastal areas and create temporary jobs in the process. I appreciate the support of the Department of Labor and hope this assistance will enable us to move forward as a community.” Immediately following the tsunami, Rep. Thompson initiated a letter to President Obama urging him to provide California with federal disaster assistance. On April 18, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) declared Del Norte and Santa Cruz counties in California as eligible for FEMA's Public Assistance Program. These two counties were targeted to receive assistance under the NEG program, which provides funding assistance in response to large, unexpected economic events which cause significant job losses. NEGs generally provide resources to states and local workforce investment boards to quickly reemploy laid-off workers by offering training to increase occupational skills.
05.12.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today voted against legislation that would mandate the most sweeping expansion of offshore drilling in our nation's history. H.R. 1231, “Reversing President Obama's Offshore Moratorium Act,” would automatically open the Southern California coast, the entire Atlantic coast, the Arctic Ocean, and Alaska's Bristol Bay for leasing. The bill could also potentially open up California's North Coast to drilling - even if our state objects to offshore drilling in the region. “There may be enough oil off the North Coast to make oil companies billions of dollars in profits, but there is nowhere near enough to change the reality of our national energy challenges or outweigh the serious risks to North Coast communities,” said Rep. Thompson. “H.R. 1231 is beyond misguided - it is a disaster in the making. I voted against this bill because I refuse to let what happened in the Gulf of Mexico be a possibility on the coast of California.” Specifically, H.R. 1231 mandates that the Secretary of the Interior offer up half of the unleased areas off the Pacific and Atlantic Coasts and offshore Alaska for drilling. Proponents of the bill, including Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-WA), have stated that no North Coast drilling will occur because the region does not contain at least 2.5 billion barrels of oil or 7.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. As illustrated in this map, the only portion of California that meets these criteria is the Southern California planning area, estimated to contain nearly 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil. In a decision to “trust but verify,” Rep. Thompson introduced an amendment clarifying that the North Coast may not be opened for drilling under H.R. 1231. Given the Natural Resources Committee's previous assertions that H.R. 1231 would not open up the entire California coastline to drilling, Rep. Thompson's amendment should have received broad bipartisan support. Instead, the majority party strongly opposed the amendment, setting the stage for future North Coast drilling. “If this bill's only targets are areas containing the greatest known amount of oil and natural gas, there should be no objection to prohibiting drilling on the North Coast,” said Rep. Thompson. “The fact that my amendment was defeated because of strong Republican opposition suggests there's still a desire to tap our reserves, no matter the potential cost.” Proponents of H.R. 1231 have tried to advertise the bill as a solution to rising gas prices. But according to a 2009 Energy Information Administration report, opening up waters that are currently closed to drilling would only yield an extra 500,000 barrels of oil a day - an amount that sounds significant but would reduce gas prices by no more than 3 cents a gallonâ€¦ in 2030. In Northern California, the potential economic impact of the region's oil supply is even smaller: if all the recoverable reserves of Northern California's Outer Continental Shelf were tapped, they would provide enough oil to fuel the U.S. for only 100 days. “Drilling is not the simple answer to rising gas prices,” Rep. Thompson continued. “We have to invest in American clean energy like solar and wind, as well as green vehicles and efficient cars. These are the actions that will bring about long-term energy independence, create good paying jobs here at home, and bring down gas prices for good.” Rep. Thompson has been a longtime opponent of efforts to open drilling off the coast of Northern California. In January, the Congressman reintroduced legislation to ban drilling off the coast of Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino Counties. He has also co-sponsored legislation that would prohibit drilling along the entire California coast. The full text of Rep. Thompson's floor speech in support of his amendment to H.R. 1231, which would prohibit drilling off California's Northern Coast, is available below: “My amendment would clarify that H.R. 1231 would not open drilling along the Northern California coast under this bill. “The amendment makes clear the intent of this bill. According to the bill's drafters this legislation would not require leasing permits in the Northern California Planning Area, which is the coastline of my district. “Drilling on the North Coast of California is a disastrous idea and the legislation must be clear-- that it is not applicable to the North Coast. “Because this amendment is a clarification of the legislation's intent, there is no cost associated with it. “Just about three weeks ago we marked the one year anniversary of the nation's worst oil spill. I will not let what happened to the Gulf of Mexico happen to the north coast of California. “I have introduced separate standalone legislation which would permanently ban drilling off the coast of my district. “It is important to me and to my constituents that H.R. 1231 clearly notates that drilling will not occur in the Northern California Planning Areaâ€”along the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte counties. “The coastal area of my district is one of only four major upwelling regions in the world's ocean. An upwelling is where cold, nutrient-rich waters are brought from the ocean depths to the surface. “Upwelling regions promote seaweed and growth which, in turn, supply energy for some of the most productive ecosystems in the world - including many of the world's fisheries. “North Coast ecosystems also sustain some of the largest salmon populations in the lower 49 states and provide essential habitat for Dungeness crab, rockfish, sole and urchin. The 2006 and 2008 commercial fishery disasters that virtually eliminated salmon fishing in California were economically disastrous for my district, our states and our nation. “If an oil spill were to occur off the coast of my district, the environmental and economic costs would be staggering. Drilling for oil or gas off of California's North Coast could cause serious harm to the unique and productive ecosystem and abundant marine life found off the coast. “My district is economically dependent on the rich natural resources we are blessed to have, but also subject to significant seismic risks and earthquakes. As one of my counties said, â€˜The modest amount of oil available, in terms of our nation's daily demand, does not justify jeopardizing our fisheries, our environment and our economic livelihoods.' (Letter from Mendocino Board of Supervisors) “This amendment will protect the North Coast of California and will simply clarify that this bill does not require drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt or Del Norte counties. “I urge a â€˜yes' vote on this amendment.”
05.08.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) is encouraging residents of California's First Congressional District to support California's flower growers this Mother's Day, which is Sunday, May 8. Over 75 percent of domestically grown flowers are grown in California, accounting for 20 percent of all flowers sold in the U.S. and directly supporting more than 10,000 jobs in the state. Many of these jobs are located on the North Coast, where local growers produce Irises, Lilies, Tulips, and other bulb flowers. In fact, the largest cut flower farm in the entire country is located in Arcata. “California flower growers produce the finest flowers in the world, but they're being squeezed out of the market by producers in foreign countries,” said Rep. Thompson. “Although local growers are working aggressively to remain competitive, we can all do more to promote our state's flower industry. On Mother's Day, support your local flower growers by buying fresh cut California flowers for your loved ones.” Although California is one of our country's premier flower producers, the number of local flower farms is shrinking rapidly due to competition from global competitors like Colombia, which receive millions of dollars in subsidies from their government. Last week, Rep. Thompson and 40 other members of the California Congressional Delegation sent a letter to President Obama urging him to address the flower trade inequity as his Administration works on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement. “We are fortunate to have Congressman Thompson representing the concerns of California's flower farms,” said Lane DeVries, CEO of Sun Valley Floral Farms and Vice Chair of the California Cut Flower Commission (CCFC). "Flower growers in California employ tens of thousands of Californians and contribute millions of dollars to the economy. But to remain competitive against foreign growers, we need the full support of our local communities. Please do your part by buying local flowers this Mother's Day." California growers are also doing their part to remain competitive through innovation. Working with the CCFC, they have offered higher end products produced in an increasingly environmentally sustainable manner. They use the latest in horticultural science to increase yields and develop new varieties for the market, while also meeting California labor and environmental standards that are much higher than their foreign competitors. They are also in the final phase of developing a new transportation, logistics, and shipping system and center that would reduce their shipping costs by 30 to 40 percent.
05.06.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today held a reception at his Napa District Office for the six high school finalists in this year's Congressional Art Competition. The winner of the competition will represent California's 1st Congressional District in the U.S. Capitol, where his or her artwork will be displayed for one year. The winner and a guest will be flown to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony in June. “These six young men and women are extremely talented artists with bright futures,” said Rep. Thompson. “I think it's important to recognize and encourage young artists. The Congressional Art Competition gives our community the opportunity to do that.” To honor the achievement of this year's finalists, Rep. Thompson invited the students, their families, and local artists and residents to attend a reception at his district office in Napa. The finalists include: Â· Mira Weidman from Northcoast Preparatory and Performing Arts Academy in Arcata Â· Katelynn Meade-Malley from Lower Lake High School in Lower Lake Â· Joshua Lobue from Fort Bragg High School in Fort Bragg Â· Nilla Marie Mercado from American Canyon High School in American Canyon Â· Erika Quezada from Cloverdale High School in Cloverdale Â· Nick Christen from Woodland High School in Woodland Since 1982, the Congressional Art Competition has given Members of Congress the opportunity to encourage the artistic talents of their young constituents. The annual competition showcases the artistic talents and abilities of students in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.
05.06.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) issued the following statement today regarding the National Academy of Sciences review of the draft Bay Delta Conservation Plan. The National Academy of Sciences report released this week, found that serious scientific gaps exist in the Bay Delta Conservation Plan as proposed. The report found fundamental flaws regarding the goals of the plan and a lack of scientific analysis on how the project would affect the enormously valuable fisheries and farms of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta: “The National Academy of Sciences report confirms what we already knew -- the plan is so murky that it's unclear whether the project is simply to restore the troubled delta, or build a pipeline to south-of-delta water interests. Such failings run counter to good water policy, and run against the science-based planning I have supported for years. “At a Congressional summit I attended last week, farmers and fishermen came together to call for science-based solutions to guide the Delta's restoration process. The message was clear -- weak science will not restore the delta, but instead unfairly favors powerful south-of-delta water interests and harms family farmers and fishermen. “We cannot move forward with the ongoing push by the House Majority to defund science in the Delta, and this report backs that assertion. Efforts to divert more Northern California water to the south must be heavily scientifically scrutinized with an eye toward protecting these water resources for present and future generations - not just for a few powerful corporate water interests today.”
05.05.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today issued the following statement on Cinco de Mayo, the annual celebration marking the historic triumph of the Mexican people over the French Army in the battle of Puebla in 1862: “Cinco de Mayo is an important celebration of the rich cultural contributions of Mexican Americans here in the United States. Their music, art, language, and traditions have made communities across our nation stronger and more vibrant. I am proud to join millions of Americans in celebrating this important day, and will continue to fight to help all families achieve the American Dream."
05.05.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Congressman Wally Herger (R-CA) today led a bipartisan letter to President Obama urging him to provide federal disaster assistance for California communities battered by the recent March storms. Between March 15 and 27, a series of storms swept across Northern California, causing significant damage in Del Norte, Humboldt, and Mendocino counties. Damages are estimated to be more than $44.5 million statewide. “The March storms brought a lot of devastation to communities across California,” said Rep. Thompson. “Heavy rain, snow, wind, and flooding battered local homes and infrastructure, causing significant and costly damage. I urge the President to quickly approve federal disaster assistance for our state to help give local communities the resources they need to get back on their feet.” In total, 25 California Delegation Members who represent communities affected by the March storms signed on to Congressman Thompson's letter, including: Wally Herger (R-CA), Lois Capps (D-CA), Sam Farr (D-CA), Laura Richardson (D-CA), Dan Lungren (D-CA), Jeff Denham (R-CA), David Dreier (R-CA), Barbara Lee (D-CA), George Miller (D-CA), Jerry McNerney (D-CA), Dennis Cardoza (D-CA), Jerry Lewis (R-CA), Linda SÃ¡nchez (D-CA), John Garamendi (D-CA), Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), Grace Napolitano (D-CA), Lynn Woolsey (D-CA), Mike Honda (D-CA), Brian Bilbray (D-CA), Gary Miller (D-CA), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Bob Filner (D-CA), Susan Davis (D-CA), and Pete Stark (D-CA). A copy of their letter to President Obama is available below: “Dear Mr. President, “We write to you in strong support of the State of California's request for a major disaster declaration in order to provide much-needed assistance to our state for damages resulting from the recent March storms. “Between March 15 and 27, 2011, severe storms occurred throughout our state. These series of storms brought heavy rain and snow, high winds and flooding, destroying and damaging property throughout the state. Seventeen counties in our state were hit hard by these storms including Alameda, Amador, Butte, Contra Costa, Del Norte, Humboldt, Madera, Mariposa, Mendocino, Monterey, Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, Sierra, Stanislaus, Sutter, Trinity, and Tuolumne. Statewide Preliminary Damage Assessment findings estimate economic damages to be $44,547,342. “Many of us have had the opportunity to view the damage in our districts first-hand, and it is clear that a major disaster declaration is critical to helping our state recover from these devastating storms. “Therefore, we strongly support the State of California's request for a major disaster declaration. We appreciate your consideration of this request, and we stand ready to assist you in expediting support and resources to the impacted communities throughout California.”
05.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Congressman Geoff Davis (R-KY) today introduced H.R. 1706, the Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2011. This bipartisan legislation would provide owners of commercial trucks, buses, and commercial motor vehicle fleets with a tax credit to make proven advanced safety technologies affordable for purchase. “Each year, there are over 384,000 crashes involving trucks, buses, and other heavy vehicles,” Congressman Thompson said. “Many of these accidents could have been prevented if advanced safety technologies had been in place. I was proud to work with Congressman Davis to introduce this legislation, which would make safety systems more affordable for the folks who need them.” “In addition to the great safety benefits of this bill and the many lives that can be saved, these targeted and capped tax credits will help jump start the supply chain for advanced safety systems and create jobs,” Congressman Davis said. “I want to thank Congressman Thompson for his work on this bill and for sponsoring it in the previous Congress. I look forward to continuing to work with him to see this bill enacted.” "MGM Brakes strongly supports the Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2011," said Ron Parker, Chairman, President and CEO of MGM Brakes, "MGM Brakes' history is strongly rooted in a tradition of safety and this long-time commitment is reflected in our support for this legislation. By making advanced safety technologies such as Brake Stroke Monitoring Systems more affordable for purchase, H.R. 1706 has the potential to significantly assist in reducing the number of truck and motorcoach-related crashes on the Nation's roads as well as preventing injuries and fatalities." The Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2009 was introduced by Congressmen Thompson and Davis in the 111th Congress as H.R. 2024. The bill would limit the proposed tax credit annually so vehicle owners can claim no more than $1,500 per safety system, and $3,500 per vehicle. The credit would be made available immediately upon passage, but would expire after five years of implementation. Eligible devices for the tax credit have been identified by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance as holding great potential to provide significant safety benefits, but are not yet mandated by the federal government. Many of these technologies were assessed in an April 2010 Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study, which found they have "the potential to prevent or mitigate more than 1 of every 4 large truck crashes, 1 of every 3 injury crashes, and about 1 of 5 fatal crashes."
05.02.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement regarding the death of Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden: "Tonight, President Obama confirmed that Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda and mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, was killed by U.S. forces in Pakistan. The search for the world's most wanted terrorist has finally ended, nearly a decade after the deadliest terrorist attack on U.S. soil. "The impact of Bin Laden's death cannot be overstated. For over two decades, Bin Laden and his terrorist network have brought death and destruction to communities around the world. This is a defining moment in our nation's history and, I hope, a turning point in the ongoing war on terrorism. "I would like to thank the intelligence community and our Armed Forces for their hard work bringing Bin Laden to justice. While our fight against terror is far from over, I am hopeful that Bin Laden's death will bring us one step closer to peace."
04.22.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement on Earth Day: "On Earth Day, we celebrate America's commitment to preserving our environment for future generations. In Northern California, we are fortunate to enjoy some of the most beautiful natural landscapes in the country. But our rivers, forests, open lands, and coastline are more than just picturesque - they are the economic and cultural cornerstone of our community. “Our continued economic recovery will depend on smart investments in America's emerging green economy. In Congress, I've been a strong supporter of bipartisan PACE legislation that would help property owners finance energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in their homes and commercial buildings. Nationally, the program has reduced homeowners' energy bills and greenhouse gas emissions and increased property values. More important, it has created good-paying jobs and injected tens of millions of dollars into local communities like Sonoma. “I'm also fighting to protect local industries that are dependent on the health of our natural resources. In January, I introduced a bill to ban drilling off the coast of Del Norte, Humboldt and Mendocino counties, and am committed to developing smart water policies that protect our salmon and marine habitats. I also plan to introduce legislation to protect our district's expansive agricultural lands and open spaces. These policies will not only preserve the environment for years to come, but help launch a green economy right here in our district.”
04.20.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today applauded U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and the Department of Transportation (DOT) for introducing tough new airline passenger protections, including a rigorous ban on lengthy tarmac delays. In the event of a delay, airlines would be required to provide passengers with adequate food and water, and working restrooms. These same protections are included in the Air Passenger Bill of Rights Act (H.R. 729), a bill Rep. Thompson introduced in February. “I am pleased that the Department of Transportation has recognized the need for stronger airline passenger protections,” said Rep. Thompson. “Many airlines have resisted offering passengers the option to deplane during excessive delays, or providing basic necessities like food, water, and access to working toilets. The DOT's commonsense rules will help ensure the comfort and safety of the flying public.” “The DOT has shown great initiative by taking action to stop the airline industry's worst abuses, but there's still more work to be done,” Rep. Thompson continued. “Because these rules aren't codified as law, they can be rescinded at any time. My bill, the Air Passenger Bill of Rights Act, would strengthen the protections announced by Secretary LaHood through an act of Congress. That's why I will continue fighting to get this legislation signed into law.” Specifically, the DOT's new rule expands the existing ban on lengthy tarmac delays to cover foreign airlines' operation at U.S. airports and establishes a four hour time limit on tarmac delays for international flights. Carriers must also ensure that passengers stuck on the tarmac are provided adequate food and water after two hours, as well as working restrooms. Exceptions to the four hour rule will only be allowed for safety, security, or air traffic control reasons. In addition to the four hour rule for international flights, the DOT will also require airlines to reimburse bag fees if luggage is lost and compensate individuals who are bumped off flights. Air carriers will also be required to clearly disclose the fees charged for checked baggage, meals, canceling or changing reservations, and advanced or upgraded seating. The DOT's new rules will take effect Aug. 23.
04.18.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that President Obama has approved federal disaster assistance for Del Norte and Santa Cruz counties following last month's devastating tsunami. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is still reviewing Governor Brown's requests for other affected communities. After receiving news of the federal disaster declaration, Rep. Thompson released the following statement: “Last month's tsunami caused significant damage to infrastructure up and down California's coast. I am pleased that the president recognized the devastation in Del Norte and Santa Cruz counties and approved a federal disaster declaration for both areas. However, there are still other coastal communities that need assistance. That's why I'm urging President Obama to issue disaster declarations for all affected areas so they can continue the process of rebuilding.”
04.15.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement in advance of “Tax Day,” which marks the date that individual income tax returns are due to the federal government. This year, the filing deadline was extended from April 15 to April 18: “Although no one likes paying taxes, we recognize they are necessary to educate our students, pave our roads, and support our military and law enforcement. Taxes are also used to provide services to our most vulnerable citizens, including women, children, and seniors. “I continue to work toward reforming our country's tax code. There's no doubt that changes are needed. Tax provisions are too complex and too confusing. This complexity adds to the belief by some that Americans are overtaxed even though tax rates are at their lowest level since the Truman Administration. “As a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, I am working to simplify our tax code and ensure it is fair and equitable. We must also continue to invest wisely in healthcare, education, energy, transportation, and other proven sources of job creation and innovation. These are the smart investments that will drive our country's economic recovery and set us on a path toward long-term fiscal success.”
04.15.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today issued the following statement on House passage of the majority party's budget proposal: “Earlier this week, I supported a bipartisan bill to fund the government through Fiscal Year 2011 in an effort to avert a government shutdown, which would have seriously hurt our country's ongoing economic recovery. The spending plan wasn't perfect, but it reduced spending and protected the programs that are important to families in our district, including Medicare. This bipartisan legislation stands in stark contrast to the partisan fiscal plan passed today. “With only Republican votes, the majority party passed a budget that guts the Medicare and Medicaid systems and cuts Social Security benefits. Their proposed budget plan would end the Medicare guarantee for seniors and replace it with a voucher system that would more than double their health care costs by 2020. “Thankfully, the debate over our 2012 spending plan is far from over. As written, the majority's proposal will almost certainly fail to become law. But I think it says a lot about the majority party's priorities and thoughts about the direction our country should take. Moving forward, both sides of the aisle must come together to support a budget that cuts spending while preserving the programs and investments that are an important part of our great country. That's how we'll reach a fiscally responsible solution to our debt crisis.”
04.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today applauded the Consumer Electronics Association, Best Buy, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, and other consumer electronics industry leaders for launching a new electronics recycling program to minimize e-waste. The “Billion Pound Challenge” initiative will significantly increase responsible electronics recycling nationwide by requiring the electronics industry to recycle one billion pounds of e-waste in the next year. “I am pleased that major leaders in the consumer electronics industry are taking concrete action to address the e-waste crisis,” said Rep. Thompson. “While there's been progress in the recycling of old electronics equipment, much more work needs to be done. The â€˜Billion Pound Challenge' will help accomplish our goals by making the electronics industry part of the solution to e-waste. This isn't just smart environmental policy - it's corporate responsibility and accountability at its finest. I'm proud to be involved with this initiative and encourage other consumer electronics groups to participate in the challenge.” Each year, millions of tons of electronics equipment are discarded in the U.S. These products frequently end up in landfills, where they release toxic chemicals such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and flame retardants into the environment. Of the small percentage of e-waste that is collected for recycling or reuse, the majority is exported to developing nations such as China, Ghana, India, Nigeria, and Thailand for unsafe salvage and metals recovery. Congressman Thompson has been a longtime advocate in the fight against e-waste. In the 109th Congress, Rep. Thompson formed the bipartisan E-Waste Working Group to develop a nationwide approach for the responsible disposal and recycling of e-waste. In 2009, Rep. Thompson hosted the first-ever Congressional e-waste recycling event to highlight the impact of e-waste on the environment. And in 2010, he introduced legislation to limit the export of electronic waste to foreign countries and plans to reintroduce similar legislation this year. Moving forward, Rep. Thompson will continue to work with his colleagues to highlight the impact of e-waste and the importance of responsible electronics recycling.
04.13.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), the Ranking Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's Subcommittee on Terrorism, HUMINT, Analysis, and Counterintelligence, today delivered the following opening statement at an open hearing regarding political and religious groups in the Middle East, including the Muslim Brotherhood: “Thank you, Madame Chair. “Welcome to all of the witnesses and thank you for taking the time to inform this subcommittee about your research and experiences with the Muslim Brotherhood. “Intelligence oversight committees have an important and legitimate need to understand key organizations and individuals who influence events in countries that are important to the US, such as Egypt. The Muslim Brotherhood is involved to some degree in reshaping the Egyptian government. “For that reason, this hearing can be productive if it provides a fact-based examination of the Brotherhood's activities, objectives and potential to affect US foreign policy. “However, just as important, there are limits to what this hearing can - or should - accomplish: “First and foremost, this hearing must not become a witch hunt. This hearing is not about the vast majority of Egyptian citizens who protested peacefully in Tahrir Square. Nor is this hearing about the millions of law-abiding Muslim-Americans who contribute to American society. “Intelligence oversight has absolutely nothing to do with the Constitutional activities of Americans to practice religion, attract others to their religion, participate in the political process or influence US policy, which in Washington, state legislatures, and city halls across our country, we call lobbying. “Second, this hearing should not promote guilt by association. Every organization has bad apples, so we should not judge an organization by only a few of its members. My understanding is that, since the Muslim Brotherhood has a large written record, anyone can select statements to make a case for or against it. Our experts can help us analyze those statements and provide their assessments of the Brotherhood's true intentions. “Third, today's hearing is not about terrorism. As a member of the Intelligence Committee, I certainly take very seriously our duty to protect our nation and counter terrorism. But, let's be clear: the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood is not a State Department-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and according to the written testimony, it renounced violence years ago. “Fourth, this hearing is not an investigation into criminal activity. No one here speaks for US law enforcement or is a law enforcement officer. While we may need a follow-up closed hearing to find out if there are any Muslim Brotherhood-related violations of US law, today's open hearing is not that forum. “Finally, I strongly believe that this hearing must not become yet another recruitment tool for extremists. Experts in the field note that, even in a free society, individuals can be driven to violence if they feel victimized. My hope is that nothing is said today that can be interpreted as targeting or victimizing anyone. “Madame Chair, I know that you have also expressed the desire to have a serious discussion that does not offend any law-abiding citizen of this country. I'm eager to work together to reach that goal by keeping this session within firm parameters connected to our intelligence oversight duties. “Thank you, Madame Chair, I yield back.”
04.09.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, today issued the following statement after President Obama, Majority Leader Reid, and Speaker Boehner announced an agreement to keep the government open: “I am pleased that Congressional leaders and the president were able to avoid a government shutdown. I look forward to reviewing the final funding bill to ensure it's the best public policy for the people of our district and our country.”
04.08.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today sent a letter urging the U.S. Postal Service to add the City of Ukiah's main post office to the National Register of Historic Places. Listing in the National Register would provide formal recognition of the post office's historical and architectural significance based on national standards used by every state. The designation would allow the Ukiah community to apply for preservation grants, tax credits, and other benefits to help maintain the building. “I strongly support the Ukiah community's efforts to list this historic post office,” said Rep. Thompson. “The building's stunning architectural details, including its beautiful WPA murals, should be preserved and enjoyed for future generations. I can't think of a more deserving property to list in the National Register of Historic Places.” “At a time when the U.S. Postal Service and other agencies are facing significant funding cuts, it's more important than ever to fight for a post office presence in Ukiah,” Rep. Thompson continued. “The main post office is important to downtown businesses and provides vital mail services to the people of our community. We can't afford to lose this historic building.” The National Park Service's National Register of Historic Places is part of a national program to coordinate and support public and private efforts to identify, evaluate, and protect America's historic and archeological resources. To list a local property in the National Register, communities must submit an official nomination and application. The application is then reviewed by the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) of the state where the property is located. The SHPO can take one of several options: reject the property; ask for more information; list the property with the state only; or send the forms to the National Park Service for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. Once the National Park Service receives the forms, it conducts a similar review process. A copy of Rep. Thompson's letter to the Federal Preservation Office is available below: Dallan C. Wordekemper, CCIM Federal Preservation Officer United States Postal Service 475 L'Enfant Plaza SW, Room 6670 Washington DC 20260-1862 Dear Mr. Wordekemper: Please find the enclosed Ukiah Main Post Office nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Included are thoroughly researched historical facts and documentation including photographs of many of the historical features of this grand old building. I support the community's efforts on behalf of the significance of the Ukiah post office. Of particular importance are the Works Progress Administration (WPA) murals that adorn one wall. These national treasures as well as many architectural details and historical references substantiate the importance of this building. Thank you for your consideration and evaluation of this worthy nomination. I look forward to working with you on the progress of this application. Sincerely, Mike Thompson, Member of Congress Cc: Dr. Knox Mellon, California State Historic Preservation Officer
04.06.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today sent a letter urging President Obama to provide California with federal disaster assistance following last month's devastating tsunami, which destroyed the harbor in Crescent City, significantly damaged the harbor in Fort Bragg, and caused over $48 million in estimated damages statewide. Earlier today, Governor Jerry Brown officially requested a federal disaster declaration to provide emergency assistance to the state. The funding would be used to repair and rebuild harbors and other damaged infrastructure, and to safeguard coastal communities from future losses. “Last month's tsunami caused significant damage to infrastructure up and down California's coast,” said Rep. Thompson. “Without assistance, I am extremely concerned that recovery efforts in affected communities, including those I represent, will languish. That's why my colleagues and I are strongly urging the president to support Governor Brown's request for a federal disaster declaration to help get local communities back on their feet.” Signers of Congressman Thompson's letter include Reps. Sam Farr (CA-17), Anna Eshoo (CA-14), Lois Capps (CA-23), Laura Richardson (CA-37), George Miller (CA-7), Joe Baca (CA-43), Zoe Lofgren (CA-16), Jackie Speier (CA-12), John Garamendi (CA-10), Doris Matsui (CA-5), Jerry McNerney (CA-11), Susan Davis (CA-53), Michael Honda (CA-15), Pete Stark (CA-13), Barbara Lee (CA-9), Karen Bass (CA-33), Lucille Roybal-Allard (CA-34), Adam Schiff (CA-29), Lynn Woolsey (CA-6), Grace Napolitano (CA-38), Judy Chu (CA-32), and Bob Filner (CA-51). The full text of the letter is available below: “Dear Mr. President, “We write to you today in strong support of the State of California's request for a disaster declaration in order to provide much-needed assistance to our state for damages resulting from the recent tsunami. “On March 11, 2011, California was struck by a tsunami generated by a massive earthquake off the coast of Japan. The tsunami's heavy surge and wave activity overwhelmed California's coastal areas, causing significant destruction. The harbors in both Santa Cruz and Crescent City have been destroyed, with additional damages in the counties of San Luis Obispo, San Mateo, Mendocino, and Humboldt. Statewide Preliminary Damage Assessment findings estimate economic damages to be $48,147,938. Over 150 vessels have been damaged, and over 30 vessels have sunk. Additionally, oil sheens have been reported, and the sunken vessels continue to pose the threat of substantial hazardous releases, as well as navigational dangers, that would exacerbate the economic devastation. “California state authorities are working with local governments and the United States Coast Guard and have taken a proactive and timely response. Efforts to secure loose vessels, remove debris and sunken vessels, assess damages, and monitor coastal areas for oil sheens are fully underway. However, additional federal assistance is necessary to repair and rebuild harbors and other damaged infrastructure, as well as to safeguard our communities from future losses. “On March 11, 2011, the Governor declared a State of Emergency for Del Norte, Humboldt, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz counties, and this was followed by a State of Emergency declaration for Mendocino and San Luis Obispo counties on March 16, 2011. Many of us have had the opportunity to view the damage in our districts first-hand, and it is clear that a federal disaster declaration is vital to helping our state recover from the tsunami damage. “Therefore, we strongly support the State of California's request for federal disaster assistance. We appreciate your consideration of this request, and we stand ready to assist you in expediting support and resources to the impacted communities throughout California.”
04.05.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means and the Blue Dog Coalition, today issued the following statement regarding the release of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's budget plan, which calls for more than $6 trillion in spending cuts at the expense of American families: “Our debt crisis is a serious problem. If our country is going to remain financially solvent, we need to take concrete action to decrease spending, increase saving, and balance the budget. But it's important that we accomplish these goals in the right way. Unfortunately, the majority's budget would hurt working families, seniors, children, and our middle class. This isn't a workable approach if we're going to achieve the broad bipartisan agreement necessary to enact a responsible budget. “Put simply, the majority's plan slashes some of the most important investments and programs relied on by American families. The proposed budget would privatize Medicare, forcing seniors into the private health insurance market to shop for coverage with a government voucher. It would also mandate a block grant of federal Medicaid spending, severely undercutting California and other states' ability to provide health care to our most vulnerable citizens. Additionally, the budget would establish an unprecedented fast track process to force Congress to cut Social Security benefits, jeopardizing the program for future generations. “In any budget discussion, all options should be on the table to start. But if the final plan hurts more Americans than it helps, then it's time to reassess these options. I'm not afraid to cut spending where it's deserved, but I won't support a budget that decreases smart investments, increases bad ones, and threatens our country's fragile economic recovery. Moving forward, I hope the majority is willing to take a step back, reassess its priorities, and work across the political aisle to develop a viable alternative that puts America and the American people on a path toward long-term fiscal success.”
03.31.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the Arcata Fire Protection District will receive $483,236 in grant funding to help recruit new volunteer firefighters in the Arcata, McKinleyville, Bayside, Manila, and Jacoby Creek communities. The funds, which are provided through the Department of Homeland Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, will preserve public safety and create good-paying jobs. “During these tough economic times, one of the things we can't afford to cut is funding for our firefighters and first responders,” said Rep. Thompson. “This grant will help ensure local fire departments have the personnel they need to keep our community safe. We can't choose when the next fire or natural disaster will strike, but we can take steps to make sure our fire departments are as prepared as possible.” “We're thrilled to have received this crucial funding,” said Arcata Fire Chief John McFarland. “The SAFER grant will allow us to support and enhance the volunteer firefighters who protect our community by providing them with disability insurance, educational assistance, and a modest pay-by-call system to lessen the impact that volunteering has on their families. This will be a huge benefit to our community as well as our department.” Nationwide, the SAFER program provides competitive grants to fire departments and volunteer firefighter support groups. The objective of the program is to help these departments increase the number of trained, frontline firefighters available in their communities. Grant funds may be used to recruit and retain new firefighters, or to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy.
03.30.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) introduced a resolution to help increase tsunami awareness and preparedness in at-risk coastal communities. Earlier this month, tsunami waves generated by an 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Japan caused significant damage in Crescent City, Fort Bragg, Santa Cruz, and other parts of Northern California. The California Emergency Management Agency has tentatively estimated damages to be in excess of $40 million. “Over 7 million Americans live or vacation in coastal communities that are at-risk of experiencing a tsunami,” said Rep. Thompson. “While relatively rare, these natural disasters can literally wipe out entire communities and cause significant loss of life. In the wake of the recent disaster in Japan, it's important to encourage at-risk communities to plan and prepare for a potential tsunami. We don't get to pick the next disaster, so it's important to be informed about the threats and hazards we face.” Tsunamis are a series of large ocean waves generated by major unÂ­dersea disturbances, including earthquakes, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. All U.S. ocean coasts can be impacted by tsunamis, although some areas are at much greater risk than others. Since 1812, California has experienced 14 tsunamis with wave heights higher than three feet. Of these, six caused significant destruction, including the devastating 1964 tsunami that killed 11 people in Crescent City. The full text of H. Res 185 is available below: “Whereas a tsunami is a series of ocean or sea waves caused by a sudden, large displacement of water most often caused by earthquakes, but also by landslides, volcanic eruptions, and comet or meteorite impacts in the ocean; “Whereas a tsunami is like a fast rising flood tide, storm surge, or an advancing wall of water and strikes with devastating force; “Whereas a tsunami will continue for many hours; “Whereas the first wave is often not the largest nor the most dangerous, and surges may arrive 24 hours or more after the initial wave; “Whereas all U.S. ocean coasts can be impacted by tsunamis, though based on proximity to tsunami sources and sea floor configurations, some areas are at much greater risk than others; “Whereas destructive and deadly tsunamis have struck Hawaii, Alaska, California, Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands within the last 150 years; “Whereas 7,000,000 people currently live in U.S. coastal communities at risk from a destructive tsunami; “Whereas homes, businesses, public buildings, and infrastructure may be damaged by tsunami surges and strong currents during a tsunami; “Whereas damage from a destructive tsunami is usually substantial as debris and tsunami surges can wash away homes, roads, and bridges in areas where the tsunami floods; “Whereas the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (or NOAA) National Weather Service operates two tsunami warning centers, in Palmer, Alaska, and Ewa Beach, Hawaii, which are staffed 24/7, and issue tsunami alerts (warnings, advisories, watches, and information statements) as early as two minutes after an earthquake; “Whereas upon receipt of tsunami alerts, State and local emergency management agencies determine the appropriate response, including whether to clear the beaches, sound sirens, or evacuate people; “Whereas experts at NOAA's Tsunami Warning Centers and the National Weather Service agree that it is critical for all people to know if they live or are visiting an area at risk to tsunamis to determine the tsunami history and flooding of the area, know tsunami inundation zones, and to develop a written family disaster plan based on this knowledge;

03.18.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the South Coast Fire Protection District will receive $98,317 in grant funding to help local first responders obtain emergency response equipment, personal protective equipment, firefighting and emergency vehicles, and training. The funds, which are provided through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, will ensure local fire departments have the resources they need to protect the health and safety of our community. “Last week, our community saw firsthand how destructive a natural disaster can be,” said Rep. Thompson. “Times may be tough, but we simply can't afford to cut funding for our firefighters and first responders. This grant will help ensure that the volunteer fire departments in Redwood Coast, South Coast, Sea Ranch, and Timber Cove have the resources they need to stay prepared and keep our communities safe.” "South Coast Volunteer Fire is thrilled to have received this grant funding, which will be used to purchase new breathing apparatuses for our departments," said Leighton Nelsen, Fire Chief. "This equipment will help ensure the safety of our volunteers as they enter burning buildings to rescue members of the public. Our top priorities are public safety and the safety of our wonderful volunteers." The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is an important component of a larger, coordinated effort to strengthen our nation's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and related hazards. Nationwide, this competitive grant program will award approximately $390 million to first-responder organizations that need support to improve their response capabilities.
03.18.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement strongly opposing the reintroduction of H.R. 1161, the Community Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness (CARE) Act of 2011: “The federal government has no business picking winners and losers in the wine, beer, and distilled spirits industry. Yet the Community Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness Act would do just that by banning the direct shipment of wine and other forms of alcohol in the U.S. The impact of this bill would be devastating for brewers, vintners, distillers, importers, and consumers across our country. “Specifically, this bill would allow states to replace federal standards with their own, making it harder for out-of-state producers in California and elsewhere to comply with other states' laws. Wholesaler interest groups, the CARE Act's biggest supporters, are lobbying aggressively to unravel the existing regulatory structure. If successful, they stand to monopolize the alcohol market at the expense of other industry members and American consumers. “I will not allow this discriminatory bill to go unchallenged. Existing state and federal regulations have created a fair and competitive marketplace for wine and other alcoholic beverages. Nothing has changed. That's why I am prepared to fight to protect our wineries, our businesses, our local economy, and our consumers' right to purchase these beverages.”
03.11.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement regarding the ongoing tsunami threat to North Coast families: “I have been in constant communication with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration regarding the tsunami threat in Northern California. Until the situation stabilizes, local communities should remain vigilant and heed all warnings and instructions from emergency personnel. Please take every possible precaution to ensure your safety. “I am currently en route to Crescent City, which is reporting significant damage to piers, boats, and docks in the harbor. My thoughts and prayers are with the entire community, including the man who was swept out to sea near the mouth of the Klamath River. We are all praying for his safe return. “Moving forward, officials from federal, state, and local agencies are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to help our community rebuild. Tomorrow, I will visit Crescent City Harbor to survey the damage with other officials. The cleanup will undoubtedly take time and effort, but I know we will recover from this disaster.”
03.10.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that the South Lake County Fire Protection District in Middletown will receive $724,909 in grant funding to help hire firefighters. The funds, which are provided through the Department of Homeland Security's Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) program, will preserve public safety and create good-paying jobs in the Lake County community. “The economic downturn has created significant burdens for fire departments in Northern California and across the country,” said Rep. Thompson. “Many communities have had no choice but to lay off firefighters and other emergency personnel, despite the threat to public safety. The generous funding provided through the SAFER program will not only improve the South Lake County Fire Protection District's ability to respond to fire hazards, but also improve our community's overall level of preparedness.” “Congressman Thompson's efforts in helping to secure these grant funds underscore his commitment to public safety,” said Jim Wright, Assistant Chief of the South Lake County Fire Protection District. “This SAFER grant will help protect the health and safety of the citizens in our district. Nationwide, the SAFER program provides approximately $420 million in competitive grants to fire departments and volunteer firefighter support groups. The objective of the program is to help these departments increase the number of trained, frontline firefighters available in their communities. Grant funds may be used to recruit and retain new firefighters, or to rehire firefighters who were laid-off due to the economy.
03.10.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, today joined other committee Democrats to introduce H.R. 992, the Building American Jobs Act of 2011. The Building American Jobs Act would extend eight bond, tax credit, and loan guarantee programs for states and municipalities, including the extremely successful Build America Bonds program. By giving state and local governments the resources they need to rebuild aging infrastructure, the bill will help our communities compete in a 21st century economy. “The Building American Jobs Act is an extremely important job creation tool,” said Rep. Thompson. “We already know that Build America Bonds spur private-sector investment by helping state and local governments build hospitals, schools, and transportation and water systems. This bill makes the market accessible to those who need it most - a smart strategy that will play a key role in America's long-term economic success." In Congressman Thompson's district, Build America Bonds have a proven track record of creating jobs and improving local communities. In 2009, the Napa County school system used Build America Bonds to renovate classrooms, expand campuses, and improve the overall learning environment in local schools. The University of California, Davis also benefitted from Build America Bonds, using proceeds from the sale of the bonds to complete deferred maintenance projects and the construction of student housing, classrooms, and research buildings. Finally, Sacramento International Airport - located right outside California's First Congressional District - used bonding authority for new construction and renovation projects, creating over 1,200 jobs in the process. Thanks to the low cost of Build America Bonds, these and other crucial projects were extremely cost-effective for taxpayers. The programs extended by the Building American Jobs Act were created for state and local governments by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but expired on December 31. The Building American Jobs Act of 2011 includes: Build America Bonds. The bill would extend the Build America Bonds program through 2012, with a 32 percent subsidy rate in 2011, and 31 percent subsidy rate in 2012. Build America Bonds spur job creation and unleash private-sector investments by helping state and local governments finance infrastructure projects - building schools, hospitals, transit systems, and water systems. Recovery Zone Bonds. The Building American Jobs Act makes an additional allocation of Recovery Zone bonds to ensure that each local municipality receives a minimum allocation equal to at least its share of national unemployment in December 2009. The bill would also extend the authorization for issuing Recovery Zone bonds through 2011. Water and Sewer Bonds. The bill would exempt water and sewer projects from private activity bond caps and exclude bonds financing facilities that furnish water and sewage facilities from state volume caps. The bill would also exclude bonds financing facilities that furnish water and sewage facilities from certain limitations on tribal government issuances. Alternative Minimum Tax/Private Activity Bonds. The Building American Jobs Act would extend both provisions for one year (i.e., exempt from AMT tax-exempt private activity bonds issued in 2011 and current refunding of private activity bonds issued after 2003 and refunded during 2011). New Markets Tax Credit. The bill would allow the New Market Tax Credit to be claimed against the AMT with respect to qualified investments made between March 15, 2010 and January 1, 2012. Federal Home Loan Bank Bond Guarantees. The Building American Jobs Act would extend the ability of Federal Home Loan Banks to guarantee tax-exempt bonds through 2011. Small Issuer Exception for Bank-Qualified Bonds. The bill would extend the ability of financial institutions to purchase tax-exempt bonds of up to $30 million per issuer (from $10 million) through 2011. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Exchange Program. The Building American Jobs Act would extend the ability of states to receive a portion of their LIHTC allocation as a direct payment through 2011.
03.09.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), Co-Chair of the Military Veterans Caucus, today sent a bipartisan letter urging House Speaker John Boehner to allow Frank Buckles, the last surviving American veteran of World War I, to lie in honor in the Rotunda of the United States Capitol. Although public viewings in the Rotunda have largely been limited to elected officials and distinguished military figures, Rep. Thompson and his colleagues, Congressmen Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) and Collin Peterson (D-MN), support making an exception for Buckles. “It's important to let Mr. Buckles lie in honor not only because of who he was, but what he represents,” said Rep. Thompson. “Mr. Buckles was a living link between America's past and present - an important reminder of the service and sacrifice of nearly 5 million American World War I veterans. Allowing Mr. Buckles to lie in honor would be a fitting tribute to an entire generation of American war heroes and their families.” In November 2008, students and teachers from St. Helena High School traveled to West Virginia, Buckles' home state, to interview the World War I veteran. The interview was filmed, transcribed, and is now featured in the high school's World War I History Museum. The Library of Congress has also featured the interview in its Veterans History Project collection. In his letter, Rep. Thompson asks Speaker Boehner to support one of two pieces of legislation that would allow Mr. Buckles to lie in honor in the Capitol: H. Con. Res. 20 or H. Con. Res. 23. Neither bill has been scheduled for a vote on the House floor. A full copy of Rep. Thompson's letter to Speaker Boehner is available below: Dear Mr. Speaker: As the Co-Chairs of the bipartisan Military Veterans Caucus, we urge you to bring H. Con. Res. 20 or H. Con. Res. 23 to the floor for an immediate vote. These important pieces of legislation would authorize the use of the Rotunda of the Capitol to honor Corporal Frank Woodruff Buckles, the last surviving United States veteran of the First World War, who died at the age of 110 on February 27th, 2011. The recognition sought by these House Resolutions is reserved for very select American patriots. Only 30 times since 1852, have prominent Americans have been honored in this way. The Unknown Soldier from World War I was among those recognized by lying in honor in the Rotunda of the Capital, and it is our opinion that the nearly 5 million brave Americans who served in World War 1 deserve the same recognition. This is our last chance to properly thank all these brave Americans and their families for their sacrifices, by allowing Frank Buckles, the last living American doughboy, to lie in each of their honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Mr. Speaker, as Co-Chairs of the Military Veterans Caucus we urge you to bring up H. Con. Res. 20 or H. Con. Res. 23 for an immediate vote. Sincerely, Mike Thompson, Member of Congress Gus Bilirakis, Member of Congress Collin Peterson, Member of Congress
03.08.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) urged high school students in California's 1st Congressional District to enter their artwork in the 2011 Congressional Art Competition. The annual competition showcases the artistic talents and abilities of students in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. “At a time when tight budgets are forcing many of our schools to scale back art and music programs, I think it's important to recognize and encourage young artists,” said Rep. Thompson. “The Congressional Art Competition gives our community the opportunity to do that. I encourage all eligible students in our district to apply and look forward to reviewing this year's submissions.” Since 1982, the Congressional Art Competition has given Members of Congress the opportunity to encourage the artistic talents of their young constituents. Each Member of Congress hosts a competition among high school students in his or her district. The winning artwork from each district is then displayed in the United States Capitol for one year. In addition, the grand prize winner will be flown with a guest to Washington, D.C. to attend an awards ceremony in June. A panel of judges will select the winning entries and their decision will be announced at a special ceremony and exhibit (details TBD). All artwork is due by Monday, April 25, and can be submitted at any of Congressman Thompson's district offices: Humboldt: 317 3rd St., Suite 1, Eureka, CA 95501 Mendocino: 430 North Franklin St., PO Box 2208, Fort Bragg, CA 95437 Napa: 1040 Main St., Suite 101, Napa, CA 94559 Yolo: 712 Main St., Suite 101, Woodland, CA 95695 Please note: Students from communities in Lake and Del Norte may submit their artwork to Rep.

03.03.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), was selected to serve as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence (THACI). As the top-ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, Rep. Thompson will help oversee the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), National Security Agency (NSA), and other intelligence agencies and departments. Specifically, Rep. Thompson will provide oversight for key intelligence activities, including: identifying and counteracting security threats posed by espionage or terrorism; analyzing and assessing intelligence related to nuclear proliferation, narcotics smuggling, human trafficking, and other potential threats; and acquiring sensitive information from human sources, either covertly or by debriefing. “I am honored to have been selected to serve as the top Democrat on this extremely important subcommittee,” said Rep. Thompson. “Strong, viable intelligence is the most effective way to keep America safe. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure our intelligence community has the resources it needs. Nothing could be more important to the security of our country and our people.” In addition to serving as the Ranking Member of THACI, Rep. Thompson will also be a member of the Subcommittee on Oversight, which conducts studies and investigations across the jurisdiction of HPSCI. These include inquiries into allegations of waste, fraud, abuse, and other wrongdoings and inefficiencies within the intelligence community. Rep. Thompson was first selected to serve on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2007. The Committee has jurisdiction over the intelligence community and intelligence-related activities by the CIA, DIA, NSA, and other agencies of the Department of Defense and the Departments of State, Justice, and Treasury.
03.01.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, today voted for a short-term Continuing Resolution to keep the federal government operating until a compromise can be reached on a year-long funding bill. The bill, which passed by a 335-91 vote margin, would prevent a looming government-wide shutdown and gives the House, Senate, and White House more time to reach an agreement on a long-term funding bill. “Unless Congress and the president come together to pass a short-term spending bill, crucial services and programs the American people rely on will come to a halt,” said Rep. Thompson. “Given the potential impact on working families in my community and across our country, a shutdown is simply not an acceptable option. This legislation gives both sides more time to hash out their differences and come up with a longer-term solution that's thoughtful and fiscally responsible.” The Continuing Resolution contains funding to allow government agencies and programs to continue operating through March 18 and reduces spending by $4 billion.
02.19.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, today voted against House passage of H.R. 1, the continuing resolution that would fund the federal government through the end of Fiscal Year 2011. While the continuing resolution does include some meaningful cuts to wasteful spending, it also includes irresponsible cuts that would hurt working families in Northern California and across our country. Non-security discretionary cuts of the magnitude authorized in the bill would likely result in over 800,000 lost jobs in both the public and private sector. “Like the American people, the federal government has a responsibility to operate within its means,” said Rep. Thompson. “That includes increasing saving and decreasing spending, particularly on programs that have proven to be inefficient or ineffective. This is the very definition of fiscal responsibility and the foundation of a strong economy. “The continuing resolution may slash spending, but it's not fiscally responsible,” Thompson continued. “I'm not afraid to cut spending where it's deserved - in fact, I voted for tens of billions in cuts to wasteful programs over the course of this budget debate. However, this bill completely devastates funding for crucial health care programs, transportation and infrastructure projects, education, and other smart investments that the American people rely on. Cuts of this magnitude will undoubtedly harm our country's fragile economic recovery and result in hundreds of thousands of lost jobs.” There are several cuts that are particularly concerning to Rep. Thompson, given their impact on Northern California and the rest of our state. As written, the continuing resolution would: Defund federal protections for salmon. The continuing resolution would strip funding for important state water initiatives, including the biological opinions protecting salmon. The economic impact in California's 1st District would be catastrophic: thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity could potentially be lost. Strip $1.7 billion from the Social Security Administration (SSA). H.R. 1 would cut over a billion dollars from SSA for the remainder of the year, a cut so drastic that SSA would need to impose significant furloughs. An agency shut down would force over half a million new retirees, disabled workers and survivors into a backlog before they could receive the benefits they earned. Slash $1.3 billion in funding for Community Health Centers, including $32 million for clinics in California. The continuing resolution would cause nearly half a million patients to lose access to cost-effective care and over 750 health care workers to lose their jobs statewide. In Northern California, over 38,500 local patients would have reduced access to health care services and over 30 full-time staff could lose their jobs. Decreased access to community health centers would result in more Californians going to emergency rooms, driving up the cost of care. H.R. 1 would also reverse steps taken to properly fund physician reimbursement for primary care doctors and doctors in rural areas. Taken together, these provisions will increase the cost of health care all Americans. Reduces the Pell Grant scholarship maximum award. H.R. 1 would reduce access to higher education for hundreds of California students. By decreasing the Pell Grant scholarship award, many grant recipients in our community would be forced to take out more loans to afford their college tuition and fees. Since higher education prepares our students to compete in a 21st century economy, the continuing resolution is a direct threat to America's ongoing economic recovery and global competitiveness. Eliminates Title X, the nation's family planning program, and federal funding for Planned Parenthood. The continuing resolution eliminates the Title X program and prohibits all federal funding for Planned Parenthood, one of the largest women's health providers. Millions of women in California and across our country will lose access to basic primary and preventive health care, including lifesaving cancer screenings, family planning, contraception, STI testing and treatment, and annual exams. Both President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid have stated they will not support the House bill as written, leaving the House and Senate very little time to come up with a compromise before the current continuing resolution expires and government is forced to shut down on March 4th. “Unreasonable efforts like this one just bring us closer to a government shutdown,” Thompson continued. “Closing our government would mean seniors wouldn't receive their Social Security checks, airport security operations would come to a halt, and veterans' benefits would be stopped. These are real consequences for real Americans, including families in our district.”
02.18.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today announced that veteran Times-Standard natural resources reporter and columnist John Driscoll is joining his Eureka-based staff as a district representative for Humboldt and Del Norte counties. Driscoll will join the staff in March to take over for longtime District Representative Liz Murguia, who is retiring at the end of March. “I'm thrilled to welcome John to my staff,” said Rep. Thompson. “As a member of the North Coast community, he knows what's important to the families in this district. My staff and I are always striving to better serve the people of Northern California, and John will be an important part of our team.” “I'm honored to be joining Congressman Thompson's team and am excited to continue working for the North Coast community,” said Driscoll. For 11 years, Driscoll covered resource issues on the North Coast, including the Klamath and Trinity rivers, timber, commercial fishing, conservation, restoration and ranching as well as politics, education, health care and crime. He won numerous awards for his coverage. Driscoll also wrote for Pacific Fishing magazine, co-produced video pieces for Assignment Earth and assisted in the production of the newly released book on ranching, “Humboldt Heartland.” Originally from Massachusetts, Driscoll graduated with an agriculture degree from the University of Massachusetts. He was a correspondent for the Daily Hampshire Gazette in Northampton, Mass. with a focus on wildlife and conservation. Driscoll lives in McKinleyville with his wife Angela and their two children.
02.18.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, today honored former Eureka Mayor Sam Sacco by calling in to a post office dedication in his name. Rep. Thompson had planned to attend the Eureka event in person, but was unable to do so due to ongoing votes in Washington, D.C. Last year, Rep. Thompson introduced legislation to rename the United States Postal Service located at 337 West Clark Street in Eureka, California, as the “Sam Sacco Post Office Building.” The bill was unanimously approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. “Sam Sacco was an outstanding public servant and greatly admired in Eureka,” said Rep. Thompson. “Sam wasn't just the Mayor of Eureka - he was a veteran, successful business owner, family man, and community advocate. It was an honor to help the Eureka community dedicate its main post office in his memory.” Sam Sacco served as Mayor of the City of Eureka from 1975-1979. He owned and operated an insurance agency in Eureka, where he served the community for 30 years. Sacco was an ardent advocate for working families and fought vigorously to make sure their interests were protected. His life's mission was to put an end to injustice and help those less fortunate. Sacco is survived by his wife, Mary Beth; sons, Jim and Sam; and daughter, Lisa.
02.16.2011	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways & Means, today condemned the impact of the House Republican continuing resolution on Northern California's economy and water resources. If passed, H.R. 1 would strip funding for important state water initiatives, including the federal regulations protecting salmon. The economic impact in California's 1st District would be catastrophic: thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in economic activity could potentially be lost. “The majority party's continuing resolution contains reckless language that could potentially destroy the recreational and commercial salmon fishing industry in my district,” said Rep. Thompson. “By defunding the biological opinions protecting salmon, this bill threatens not only local stocks, but thousands of fishing families across our district, the rest of the state, and Oregon.” “We know that with the right tools and careful water management, we can meet our water needs in a cost-effective way and restore salmon runs and coastal economies,” Rep. Thompson continued. “We need to continue reaching for balanced solutions to California's water challenges. This bill undermines that effort.” Earlier this week, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), Chair of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, publicly condemned the House's continuing resolution for potentially exacerbating California's water problems. During a floor speech earlier this afternoon, Rep. Thompson joined Senator Feinstein in urging House Republicans to rethink cuts to key water initiatives in California, particularly those affecting commercial salmon fisheries. A copy of the Congressman's full remarks is available below: “Mister Chairman, I rise in strong opposition of H.R. 1, the Fiscal Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY2011. “There is bipartisan agreement that Congress needs to create jobs, grow our economy and live within its means. The bill before us today goes too far with irresponsible and arbitrary cuts that will threaten the economy and cost more than 800,000 private and public jobs. “Included in today's bill is reckless language that will cost thousands of jobs in coastal communities in my district and Oregon by destroying the recreational and commercial salmon fishery. “Over the years, my district has been hit hard by ill-informed water management decisions that have resulted in dramatic declines in salmon stock. For example, in the Central Valley we witnessed a peak of 768,000 Fall Run Salmon in 2002, followed by a collapse to an historic low of only 39,500 fish in 2009. These declines have lead to an estimated $1.4 billion in lost economic activity in both 2008 and 2009 and 23,000 lost jobs. “In these two years, the commercial fishery was completely shutdown. Last year only 14,500 salmon were caught by the California salmon fishery, which is about 20 percent as many as were caught during the 2006 disaster. This only exacerbates the economic crisis facing fishing families and communities in my district. These fishing families have been put out of work in my district and up through and into Oregon. They have lost their homes, their savings, and their livelihoods. “Water management decisions in the collapsing Bay-Delta ecosystem need to be based on science - not politics. In 2002, the science on minimum flows in the Klamath was ignored resulting in the death of 80,000 salmon and loss of countless fishing jobs. Today's bill does the same thing, by waiving federal protections which put at risk fishing industry jobs. And, by defunding the biological opinions, this bill also threatens water supplies for Southern California farmers and cities by placing the burden to comply with the California Endangered Species Act solely on the State Water Project. “We know that with the right tools and careful water management, we can meet our water needs in a cost-effective way and restore salmon runs and coastal economies. We need to continue the ongoing negotiations aimed at reaching balanced solutions for California water challenges. This bill undermines that effort. “For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this reckless piece of legislation that hurts jobs, hurts the economy and hurts my district. Thank you and I yield back the balance of my time.”
02.15.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1) today issued the following statement after introducing the Air Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2011. The bill would require air carriers to provide adequate food, water, temperature controls, ventilation, and working toilets during excessive delays, and offer passengers the option to deplane after three or more hours on the ground. “Air carriers have a responsibility to provide basic services and accommodations to their passengers. Yet we continue to hear stories from Americans who have been stranded on planes without adequate food, water, ventilation, or working toilets. Despite reassurances from the airlines, these kinds of horror stories aren't going away. In fact, nearly 3,500 flights sat on tarmacs for at least two hours before takeoff in 2010 alone. “Many airlines have shown that they can't or won't put the needs of their passengers first. That's why I'm introducing the Air Passenger Bill of Rights of 2011, which would take concrete action to protect fliers from the airline industry's worst abuses. In addition to offering passengers the option to deplane in the event of excessive delays, my bill would provide fliers with basic necessities, including access to food and water, comfortable cabin temperatures, and adequate restroom facilities. Unbelievably, these commonsense accommodations are outside the scope of the Department of Transportation's current passenger protection guidelines. “Yesterday marked the fourth anniversary of the infamous Valentine's Day ice storm, which stranded 9 Jet Blue airplanes full of passengers on the tarmacs at JFK Airport. Some planes held passengers between 5 to 11.5 hours. By working together with a long list of consumer protection groups and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers, I hope we can put an end to these kinds of horror stories once and for all.”
02.09.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Committee on Ways and Means, sent a letter to key members of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure urging them to decrease the amount of funding that small and rural communities are required to contribute for improvements to local airports. Currently, small, public-use airports must match 10 percent of the grant funding provided for their planning and development. If adopted, the provision would decrease the match requirement to 5 percent, thereby easing the financial burden placed on small and rural communities in California and across the country. The proposed match rate is supported by both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, including several members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “Many small and rural communities are facing unique economic challenges that affect their ability to pay the 10 percent match requirement,” said Rep. Thompson. “During these tough economic times, we should be easing the financial burden of these communities, not increasing it. I think a 5 percent match is a workable compromise that gets local airports the funding they need and avoids busting small-town budgets.” Rep. Thompson's letter, which was sent to Committee Chairman John Mica (R-FL), Committee Ranking Member Nick Rahall, II (D-WV), Subcommittee on Aviation Chairman Thomas Petri (R-WI), and Subcommittee Ranking Member Jerry Costello (D-IL), asked that a match fund adjustment be included in the House Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill. The Committee could consider the legislation as early as next week. A full copy of the letter is available below: Dear Chairmen Mica and Petri and Ranking Members Rahall and Costello; As you take what many of us hope are the final steps towards crafting a long term extension of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), I wanted to emphasize my support for two provisions that were considered in last year's House-passed bill and urge that they be included in your updated legislation. Essential Air Service Program I urge that you include Section 134 of last year's House-passed FAA reauthorization bill which required economically depressed communities to provide a 5% local match for Airport Improvement Program funds instead of the 10% match that is currently required for small airports. In general, I believe that we need to strengthen the Essential Air Service program to ensure that small and rural communities are able to participate in our nation's aviation system. Requiring only a 5 percent local match, instead of 10 percent, ensures that rural areas of the country, like the one I represent, are not disadvantaged by their size or economy when trying to support the airports their citizens rely on. Though I would prefer that airports in economically distressed communities be exempted from matching grant obligations under the Airport Improvement Program altogether, I believe that the 5 percent match compromise language still goes a long way towards helping communities like mine. Air Passenger Service Improvements I urge you to include Section 401 of last year's Senate-passed FAA reauthorization bill which required among other provisions, that air carriers and airport operators provide passengers an option to deplane and return to the terminal if 3 hours have elapsed since door closure or landing. Section 401 of the Senate-passed bill mirrored language that I introduced last Congress, known as the “Air Passenger Bill of Rights Act of 2009 (H.R. 624). As we have all become too well aware, thousands of travelers continue to be crammed inside planes that are stranded on tarmacs and that are ill equipped to handle such conditions. It has been documented that some passengers have been stranded in such circumstances for upwards of 10 hours at a time. Airlines have promised to address these concerns but have made little or no progress. Section 401 of the Senate-passed FAA reauthorization bill is necessary to address the serious passenger delay problems plaguing the industry but which the airlines are reluctant to correct. While the House-passed version of this legislation included language in Section 407 that assured some rights are afforded to airline passengers and that contingency plans are in place in the event of excessive delays, they must go further. The Senate's language is stronger and more preferable in this regard and should be adopted. Should you have any questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to have your office contact my staff. I thank you in advance for your time and consideration. Sincerely, Mike Thompson Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

02.08.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), Co-Chair of the Bipartisan Rural Health Care Coalition, today joined Reps. Greg Walden (R-Ore.), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), Mike Ross (D-Ark.), and Jim Matheson (D-Utah) in introducing legislation to give rural Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries equal representation on the boards that set policy for the public programs. Currently, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission (MACPAC) establish policy and provide recommendations for improving Medicare and Medicaid. Both boards have been instructed by Congress to balance the unique needs of urban and rural beneficiaries. But in practice, rural representation on the boards lags far behind the actual number of rural enrollees in Medicare and Medicaid: About 26 percent of Medicare recipients are from rural America, yet according to the National Rural Health Association (NRHA) just 3 of the 17 MedPAC board members have significant experience delivering health care in rural America and can adequately represent the interests of rural patients. About 20 percent of Medicaid recipients are from rural America. The MACPAC board also has 17 members. In response to this disparity, Rep. Thompson and a bipartisan group of lawmakers have introduced the Rural Representation and Accountability Act, which would ensure the proportion of members on MedPAC and MACPAC representing rural beneficiaries is no less than the proportion of the total number of Medicare and Medicaid patients residing in rural areas: With about 26 percent of Medicare recipients from rural America, this legislation would require that at least 5 of MedPAC's 17 board members adequately represent rural patients. With about 20 percent of Medicaid recipients from rural America, this legislation would require that at least 4 of MACPAC's 17 board members adequately represent rural patients. Mike Thompson: “Rural Americans deserve advocates who know the needs of rural patients. Unfortunately, many of MedPAC and MACPAC's board members do not have experience delivering health care in rural areas. It's time to take action to ensure rural families in California and across the country have a voice at the table to ensure their unique health care challenges are being addressed.” Rep. Walden: “Rural America continues to confront challenges posed by shortages of health care providers and barriers to health care access. Because of these unique challenges, rural Americans and rural Oregonians deserve a voice on the boards empowered with making the major policy decisions that affect how they get health care.” Rep. McMorris Rodgers: “Rural Communities in Eastern Washington are faced with unique needs, particularly as it relates to accessing quality health care. Too often, rural communities have been left out of the decisions that impact them. The bill that we are introducing today would ensure that rural communities are represented in the health care debate and their needs addressed.” Rep. Ross: “We're facing a major crisis in rural health care as small town hospitals and rural doctors are closing their doors across America,” said Ross. “Rural Americans are having to travel farther and pay more for health care and we deserve advocates on these advisories boards who understand the complexities and challenges of rural health care, particularly in the areas of access and affordability.Â This commonsense bill ensures that the membership of these boards is proportionate to the people they serve.” Rep. Matheson: “For far too long, the voices of rural Utahns have been missing from the discussions that decide federal health care policy. Rural residents face different issues with respect to accessing affordable, quality care and this bill seeks to bring their perspective to the decision-making process.” Alan Morgan, NRHA CEO: “You would certainly expect to see rural representation on any national health care advisory body. We are concerned that the current composition of the MACPAC does not have adequate rural representation. All federal health care advisory bodies should ensure that the rural voice is represented.” In addition to providing rural beneficiaries with proportionate representation, the Rural Representation and Transparency Act would also create greater transparency in how MedPAC and MACPAC operate. The bill would require both boards to: Provide full and timely public disclosure of its proceedings on the Internet Post either audio or video coverage of its proceedings online Post transcripts of its proceedings online Congressman Mike Thompson is proud to represent California's 1st Congressional District, which includes Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, Napa, and portions of Sonoma and Yolo counties.

02.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today announced that the City of West Sacramento Fire Department will receive over $1.1 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Department of Homeland Security through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program. The funding will help the fire department obtain much-needed emergency response equipment, including 543 portable radios for local agencies throughout the Yolo and Sacramento region. In addition to the City of West Sacramento Fire Department, seven other fire departments have been identified as grant recipients: the City of Sacramento Fire Department, the Consumnes Fire District, the City of Woodland Fire Department, the Wilton Fire Department, the Courtland Fire Department, the Courtland Fire Department, the South Placer Fire District, and the Clarksburg Fire District. This grant award is the largest single grant ever issued for the AFG Program. “At a time when state budget shortfalls and staff cuts have stretched resources for local fire departments, these grants have been a real lifeline for Northern California,” said Rep. Thompson. “This funding will help ensure the City of West Sacramento has the resources it needs to mount an aggressive defense against and response to fire and other hazards. Nothing could be more important to the health, safety, and well-being of our community.” “We are grateful for Congressman Thompson's advocacy that led to West Sacramento's receipt of these important funds,” said Christopher Cabaldon, Mayor of West Sacramento. “The City, with its Port, has some unique homeland security needs. These funds for radio equipment will help to ensure that we and our neighboring public safety agencies have superior communication.” “I am excited about receiving this Assistance to Firefighters Grant Award,” said Fire Chief Al Terrell of the West Sacramento Fire Department. “Our department looks forward to improving interoperability among the eight agencies in both Yolo and Sacramento counties.” The purpose of the AFG is to award grants directly to eligible fire departments and Emergency Management Services (EMS) organizations to enhance their ability to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as that of first-responder personnel. The grant program is an important component of the larger, coordinated effort to strengthen America's overall level of preparedness and ability to respond to fire and related hazards. Since 2001, the AFG has provided approximately $4.6 billion in grants to fire departments and first responders in California and across the country.

02.04.2011	Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-1), a senior member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, today issued the following statement condemning the attack on UC Davis Professor Noha Radwan in Cairo and urging Egypt's people to undertake a peaceful transition to democratic government: “On February 2, University of California, Davis Professor Noha Radwan was attacked by an angry mob in Cairo after appearing on the television show Democracy Now. Thankfully, Professor Radwan's injuries were relatively minor. However, given the increasingly unpredictable situation in Egypt, my staff and I are working closely with the State Department to ensure her safe return to the U.S. “The violence Professor Radwan experienced is not only unacceptable, but antithetical to the principles of free and open government. I am especially concerned by the treatment of journalists and human rights advocates, many of whom are directly threatened by the turmoil permeating Egypt. Action must be taken to ensure these brave men and women are able to continue their important work. “Ultimately, violence and intimidation will not address the grievances of the Egyptian people, nor can they form the foundation of a truly democratic government. I urge President Mubarak to quickly and peacefully begin the transition to an interim government and, ultimately, democratic elections. Only then can the Egyptian people experience the social, political, and economic renewal that they so greatly deserve."

01.25.2011	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) issued the following statement today upon the announcement of being selected to serve on the House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. “I am honored to again be selected to serve on the House Select Committee on Intelligence,” said Congressman Thompson. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to guarantee that the intelligence community has all the resources necessary to ensure our nation's security and preserve the strength of our intelligence capabilities.” Thompson was first selected to serve on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 2007, most recently serving as the chairman of the House Intelligence subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence. It is expected that Thompson will again be named the top Democrat on an Intelligence subcommittee in the coming weeks. The House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has jurisdiction over the intelligence community and intelligence related activities by the Central Intelligence Agency, Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, and other agencies of the Department of Defense, and the Departments of State, Justice, and Treasury.
01.25.2011	Tonight, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement regarding President Obama's State of the Union Address: “Tonight, the President spoke about the importance of increasing our country's competitiveness and investing in innovation. China, who recently passed the United States as the world's leading energy user, is investing double the amount of money in clean energy than we are. We need to make similar investments in clean technology, so we can create good, 21st century jobs here in the U.S. “Just as important, reconstruction and infrastructure projects, especially in a rural district such as ours, are vitally important to creating jobs today while preparing our country for prosperity in the future. As our country continues to recover, it is important that we here in Washington continue to fund vital programs such as infrastructure and clean energy, but that we remember to trim the fat where ever possible. “I agree that our country is at a turning point and we must decide now to work together. We, as a government and a people, need to respect one another and cooperate to create a future where our children can get a first-rate education, acquire an adequate job, and continue the cycle of prosperity and innovation for generations to come,” said Congressman Thompson.
01.20.2011	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) issued the following statement upon the announcement of being selected to serve on the Health and Select Revenue Measures Subcommittees of the powerful Ways and Means Committee. “I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee to green the tax code, protect family farms, and preserve American jobs,” said Congressman Thompson. “And, I am committed to increasing access to quality, affordable health care in rural areas and keeping Medicare strong for our seniors. Our nation faces great challenges, but I am determined to work with my Ways and Means colleagues from both sides of the aisle to create the best solutions for our district and our great country. ” The Ways and Means Health Subcommittee has jurisdiction over matters related to Medicare and tax policies concerning health insurance premiums and health care costs.

01.20.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) reintroduced legislation that would bring tax relief to the owners of family farms and open spaces. The “Family Farm Preservation and Conservation Estate Tax” bill would defer the payment of the estate tax for families as long as the land remains in agriculture or open space. “The current estate tax unfairly burdens family farmers who are typically land-rich but cash-poor. The estate tax forces these families to sell off their land to pay the tax”, said Congressman Mike Thompson. “The breakup of family farms in many places means selling to developers, which causes a loss of key agricultural land and open space. By easing this tax burden on families they can keep their livelihoods.” Congressman Thompson has introduced similar estate tax legislation in previous Congresses to aid family farms. The estate tax was reinstated at the end of last year and applies to estates in excess of $5 million. In 2013, the estate tax will apply to estates over $1 million, meaning even more family farms will be forced to sell their farms to pay the estate tax. The legislation introduced by Congressman Thompson would allow owners of a family farm to defer payment of any estate tax as long as the property remains in farming. If the heir decides to take the property out of agriculture, they will pay the estate tax at the current appraised value of the land. “I'm happy to hear that Congressman Thompson is re-introducing his estate tax proposal, which is extremely important to helping farmers and ranchers maintain ownership of their farms, which are often times owned or operated by several generations of family members,” said Paul Wenger, president of the California Farm Bureau. “This proposal will help producers who make their livelihood from farming and ranching to pass the ownership of the farm to the next generation without the onerous, costly and complicated challenges of the estate tax.” Congressman Thompson is a senior member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over federal tax matters, including estate tax policy. During a Ways and Means Committee hearing today on fundamental tax reform, Congressman Thompson spoke of the need to find a way to enact his legislation and provide a permanent estate tax solution to protect family farmers in his district and throughout the country.
01.19.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted against the repeal of the historic health care legislation signed into law just last year. The repeal would roll back important improvements put in place by the health care reform law such as discounted prescription medication for seniors and tax breaks for small businesses. The Patient's Rights Repeal Act (HR 2) passed the House of Representatives by a 245-189 vote. “Today I voted against the repeal of the health care law because it would hurt small businesses, families, and seniors in our district,” said Congressman Thompson. “In addition, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office determined that the repeal would add $230 billion to our national deficit. And, Medicare's Chief Actuary stated that the repeal would shorten the life of Medicare by twelve years.” If the health care reform law is repealed over ten thousand seniors in California's First District would fall back in the Medicare Part D donut hole, and roughly 4,200 young adults would be forced off their parent's health insurance plan. Approximately 8,000 children in the First District will be denied coverage due to a preexisting condition. This repeal would also end the tax breaks and premium assistance that helps millions of families and small businesses pay for health care. Additionally, insurance companies will once again be able to drop people's coverage when they get sick The Patient's Rights Repeal Act is now headed to the Senate for consideration.
01.11.2011	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-North Coast) reintroduced legislation that would permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The Northern California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act protects the unique and dynamic marine environment along the Northern Coast of California's outer continental shelf (OCS) from off shore drilling. Congressman Thompson also introduced this legislation in the 111th Congress. “It is critical that we permanently protect our coast and its vital marine life from the environmental hazards of off-shore drilling,” said Congressman Thompson. “In past Congresses, this important issue has become a political dispute rather than a debate on legitimate policy. This legislation will steer the debate back to sensible, science based policy, and ensure the wellbeing of our oceans for future generations.” During the 110th Congress the ban on OCS drilling expired, which leaves the North Coast susceptible to drilling. The moratorium on OCS drilling had been a bipartisan agreement in Congress since 1982, but came under regular attack, and was not renewed in 2008. “One of the four most crucial upwellings in the world's oceans is located off of California's North Coast and sustains 20 percent of the ocean's fish,” said Congressman Thompson. “Regardless of who is in charge in Washington in the future, we need to ensure now that our coast is permanently protected from needless and harmful offshore drilling.” The coastal areas that support extremely abundant and productive marine life are known as upwelling regions. This is because an upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters from the ocean depths that, when combined with sunlight, enhance seaweed and phytoplankton growth. The seaweed and phytoplankton supply energy for some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, including the North Coast fisheries and many of the world's most important fisheries. Drilling for oil off of California's North Coast could cause serious harm to the unique and productive ecosystem and abundant marine life found off the coast, including the fish many local North Coast economies depend on.
01.05.2011	WASHINGTON- Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D- St. Helena) announced that the water reclamation plant in the Hidden Valley Lake Community Services District will receive a grant of just over one million dollars and a loan of approximately $600,000 allocated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. This funding will be used to construct a solar array system to allow for a more efficient use of energy for the plant. “This solar array system will meet all the energy needs for the water reclamation plant, reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and cut their green house emissions,” said Congressman Thompson. “These kinds of projects are a win-win situation; not only is it supporting green technology and jobs, but benefitting our environment.” The Hidden Valley Lake Community Services District (District) provides water, sewer and reclaimed water to approximately 7,000 residents in southern Lake County. The District's water reclamation plant is the largest source of energy demand in the area, requiring approximately 423,000 kilo-watt hours which produces 123 metric tons greenhouse gas emissions annually. The solar array system will ensure sustainable energy costs, cuts to greenhouse emissions and provide reliable sustainable service as the Hidden Valley Lake service area builds out. “The District Board and staff have worked long and hard to make this solar project a reality for the Hidden Valley Lake community; but it would not have become a reality without the continued support and advocacy of Congressman Thompson,” said Linda Herndon, President of the Board of Directors of the Hidden Valley Lake Community Services District. “His advocacy for rural and less affluent communities has been consistent over the years and provided the critical opportunity for us to be heard in an arena where it really counts. As a result this project has been made possible.”
01.05.2011	Today, the new Republican Majority picked up the reigns in Congress. I look forward to working with you and my Congressional colleagues to address the issues facing our district and nation over the next two years. The first item of business today was adopting the rules by which we will run the 112th Congress. While the Republican Leadership has introduced some new, positive procedures that will enhance transparency in Congress, some of their proposals will hurt our district and add to our deficit. To bring more transparency to Congress, all bills will now be required to be posted online for three days before a final vote can be conducted and all House Committees will webcast their hearings for public viewing. I strongly support these provisions. However, that's where we part company because the other rules the new leadership are pushing hurt our district. These include cutting transportation and infrastructure funding which jeopardizes vital projects to rural districts like ours. In addition, the new Republican leadership will not require tax cuts to be paid for, resulting in an even larger national deficit. I also believe eliminating the select intelligence oversight panel within the Appropriations Committee is a mistake and weakens our oversight of the intel community. These proposals are not good for our district or our country, and I voted against them on the House floor today.
12.23.2010	I am proud to have cast my last vote of this Congress for the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. September 11th was an attack on our country just like the attack on Pearl Harbor. The brave first responders and volunteers who came to the World Trade Center stayed day after day to clean up, with no regard to their own safety. These heroes deserve nothing but the best medical care. So far, 31,000 9/11 responders and volunteers have received medical treatment since 2006. These heroic Americans, who helped out in our time of need, are from every state in the nation including from our own congressional district. In passing this bill, Congress will finally provide the funding needed to treat the responders and community residents from across the country for health conditions brought about because of their service to the county following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
12.22.2010	This morning, President Obama signed legislation that will, once and for all, repeal the “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” policy of the Department of Defense. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill to repeal this discriminatory policy (H.R. 1283), and to have voted last week to repeal “Don't Ask, Don't Tell.” President Obama has committed to fully implementing this new policy within months, bringing this discriminatory era of our armed forces to its rightful end. As I have said time and again, sexual orientation should not be a factor for deciding who should be able to serve and defend our country, and I am proud, as a combat veteran myself, to have been part of this important effort to end “Don't Ask, Don't Tell” once and for all.ï»¿
12.22.2010	Washington, DC- President Obama signed into law the Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which when implemented will prevent television advertisements from playing a volume noticeable higher than the programs during which they air. “For decades, viewers have been inconvenienced by the wildly fluctuating volumes played during the commercials of their favorite television programs,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D - St. Helena). “The CALM Act is a long overdue fix to this problem faced by millions of television watchers. I am proud to have been the first coauthor of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo's legislation, which has now been signed into law.” This new law will require the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to limit the volume of audio on commercials transmitted by television broadcast stations, cable operators, and other multichannel video programming distributors. The FCC must begin enforcing these new rules within one year. “With the President signing the CALM Act into law, the top consumer complaint to the Federal Communications Commission for over a half century is now addressed,” said Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (D - Menlo Park). “Consumers will no longer need to dive for the â€˜mute' button during commercial breaks. This would not have been possible without Congressman Mike Thompson's critical support. He was the first Member of Congress to become an original cosponsor of the legislation. This is a commonsense solution to a national nuisance and without Congressman Mike Thompson it simply would not have been possible.” S. 2847, the CALM Act passed the United States Senate unanimously on September 29, 2010 and passed the United States House of Representatives by a voice vote on December 2, 2010. The original House companion of the bill, H.R. 1084, was authored by Congresswoman Eshoo, and cosponsored by Congressman Thompson, on February 13, 2009.
12.17.2010	I voted against the tax cut "deal" last night. It takes money from Social Security putting at risk the future of a federal program that most every American relies upon. It increases taxes on the working poor and puts $1 trillion dollars on the nation's credit card, adding to our national debt. I thought long and hard before casting my vote because there are a number of good provisions that benefit the nation and our district, including an extension of unemployment benefits, an extension for renewable energy grants, and an extension of incentives that encourage landowners to put their land into a conservation easements, but all the good parts of this bill don't outweigh the $1 trillion addition to our national debt.
12.08.2010	WASHINGTON- Today, the House of Representatives passed the Continuing Resolution which includes the necessary provision to restore geothermal royalties to local counties. Geothermal production requires counties to provide increased public services, such as police patrols, and requires increased maintenance of public goods, such as roads. Geothermal revenue sharing provides a funding stream to allow local governments to support these necessary community services. “During these tough economic times, it is important that we allow our local communities to collect the essential funds to defer the high cost that geothermal energy production puts on county budgets,” said Congressman Thompson. “These funds should never have been taken away and I am glad that our local governments can now use these payments to benefit our community.” This month, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Department of the Interior (DOI) decided that under current funding legislation, local counties would be denied their share of geothermal royalties. The 2010 Interior Appropriations legislation had a provision that had stripped counties of the geothermal energy revenue sharing; however, Congressman Thompson fought to have those royalties restored and succeeded in including the restoration of the royalties in the Supplemental Appropriations Act passed. The Continuing Resolution, passed today, overturns OMB's and DOI's decision that counties cannot receive geothermal royalty payments and ensures that counties will continue getting royalty payments for fiscal year 2011.
12.03.2010	WASHINGTON - Last night, the Senate unanimously passed legislation authored by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) to rename the Eureka post office. This bill, H.R. 6387, designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 337 West Clark Street in Eureka as the "Sam Sacco Post Office Building". The bill was first passed by the House of Representatives on November 16th. This bill will now go to the President to be signed into law. “Sam Sacco was an outstanding citizen of Eureka who left a larger than life legacy of generosity and justice,” said Congressman Thompson. “He cared deeply about Eureka and I am honored to arrange the dedication of the Eureka Main Post Office to the memory of this former Mayor and widely respected individual.” Sam Sacco served as Mayor of the City of Eureka from 1975 to 1979. He owned and operated an insurance agency in Eureka, where he served the community for 30 years, helping many local families. Sacco was an ardent advocate for working families and fought vigorously to make sure their interests were protected. His life's mission was to put an end to injustice and help those less fortunate. Sacco is survived by his wife, Mary Beth; sons, Jim and Sam; and daughter, Lisa; five grand-children and one great-grandchild. “Sam was a great friend of the North Coast. He was a personal friend to me and my family and encouraged me to run for public office,” said former Eureka City Councilman Tom McMurray. “Sam was a giant of a man with a big heart, a generous spirit and champion of working families.”
12.03.2010	WASHINGTON- Last night, the Senate unanimously passed legislation authored by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) to rename the downtown Napa post office. This bill, H.R. 6237, designates the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1351 2nd Street in Napa as the "Tom Kongsgaard Post Office Building." The bill was first passed by the House of Representatives on November 16th. This bill will now go to the President to be signed into law. “Tom Kongsgaard was an important leader in our community, a role model to many, a mentor to me, and my friend.” said Thompson. “I am honored to arrange the dedication of our post office to such a revered individual.” Judge Kongsgaard attended Georgetown University before enlisting in the Navy during World War II. He was a Naval officer in the Pacific Theater and was stationed at Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo by the end of the conflict. He returned to school and studied at U.C. Berkeley, and he then received a law degree from Stanford. Judge Kongsgaard was a Napa County Superior Court Judge from 1958 to 1984. He served two terms on the California Judicial Council, was a member and chairman of the Judicial Performance Commission, and was a member of the Board of Directors of the California Judges' Association. He is survived by his two daughters, Mary Williams and Martha Goldman; his son, John; seven grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. “Judge Kongsgaard was ubiquitous of all things good for Napa Valley,” said Brad Wagenknecht, Napa County Supervisor. “He was the person known for doing great things for Napa. Judge Kongsguaard was a rare individual in our valley.”
11.11.2010	Today we honor and celebrate the tremendous sacrifices our veterans made for our great country. I hope you will join me by taking some time today to think about the veterans in your community and thank them for their service. As citizens, it is one of our most important responsibilities to ensure our veterans are welcomed home with the full benefits and services they earned. As a combat Vietnam veteran and Co-Chair of the Congressional Veterans Caucus, I believe we must maintain our strong commitment to providing our service members access to quality health care and economic opportunities. Since January 2007, Congress added over $23 billion for veterans' health care and services. Just this year, Congress passed the largest veterans health care funding increase in the 77 year history of the Veterans Administration (VA). This essential funding has helped improve health care treatment and access for hundreds of thousands of our nation's veterans. It means more medical services, better care and shorter waiting times for doctors' appointments. It provides an additional 15,000 VA health care workers, including 1,705 new doctors and 6,468 new nurses. Congress has also provided additional funding to increase the number of Community Based Outpatient Clinics for the more than 3.2 million veterans living in rural areas who do not have ready access to VA hospitals. We can also do more to remember the stories and sacrifices of individual veterans in our lives. This year, I am urging our local veterans and students to participate in the Veterans History Project of the Library of Congress American Folklife Center. In this program, young people interview and record the stories of war veterans. Their stories will become part of our national archives and be kept in the Library of Congress. To date, the program comprises more than 68,000 individual collections, which include audio- and video-recorded interviews, original photographs, letters and other historical documents from veterans of every war and conflict since World War I. Any interested students, teachers and veterans, and anyone who would like to serve may contact any of my district offices. You may also visit my website for more information. Again, I want to personally thank those men and women who have served or continue to serve in our armed services. Also, in acknowledgement of November as Military Families month, I also want to give my thanks to the families of those who serve. Our country deeply appreciates all that you do. Sincerely, Congressman Mike Thompson In addition, if you or someone you know are having an issue with the VA or another federal agency, please visit my website here.
10.15.2010	WASHINGTON--- Today Congressman Mike Thompson announced that the Rural Community Assistance Corporation will receive $2 million as part of the CDFI's Capital Magnet Fund Program through the Treasury Department. These funds will allow the Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC) to support local single and multifamily affordable housing projects in rural areas. “By securing these funds for our district's most vulnerable communities, we can offer some much-needed assistance for those having trouble keeping a roof over their head,” said Congressman Thompson. “Projects like these will help stimulate the economy by creating jobs and affordable housing opportunities.” The Rural Community Assistance Corporation (RCAC) assists rural communities through technical assistance, training, and financing. The RCAC targets distressed areas that have been hit the hardest by foreclosures and provides loans to nonprofit lenders for the development of affordable housing. “We are thrilled to receive this award from the brand new Capital Magnet Fund. RCAC will leverage the funding with private capital to provide financing for badly needed affordable housing and community facilities in rural communities,” said Stan Keasling, CEO of RCAC. In addition, a quarter of the funds will be used for community facilities, such as charter schools, clinics, and child care centers, to serve these affordable housing communities. These projects are part of the RCAC's comprehensive community revitalization scheme.
10.06.2010	The commercial cultivation of genetically-engineered (GE) Atlantic “AquAdvantage” salmon could decimate our domestic salmon fishing industry. Though the current application involves land-based hatching and rearing, FDA approval will almost certainly lead to expanded rearing of these and other GE fish in open ocean net-pens. This poses a significant threat to wild fish and ecosystems. Up to 5% of the GE eggs would not be sterile and could escape into the wild. Because these GE salmon grow much more rapidly than normal salmon, they would outcompete and eat Pacific salmon and other native species - many of which are listed under the federal Endangered Species Act. FDA's move to approve GE salmon without serious consideration of their impact on wild native salmon, and consultation with the other federal agencies responsible for managing federally listed Endangered Species, threatens fishing families across the country as well as the millions of federal and state dollars invested to restore wild native salmon. In addition, the health risks of currently farm raised salmon are well documented. We already know that the toxins in farmed salmon can accumulate to potentially harmful levels. The toxins include mercury and PCB's (polychlorinated biphenyls) - both of which get more toxic as they move up the food chain, and are nearly impossible to remove from the natural environment. GE salmon would have the same toxins in them. Unfortunately, the FDA appears to have done no analysis on this. This critical concern should at least be evaluated, especially considering the health dangers posed by mercury to women of child bearing age, developing fetuses, infants, and children. Given the current lack of information and analysis of important potential impacts on human health, native fish and ecosystems, and the inadequate opportunity provided for public input, I don't believe it is prudent for the FDA to approve GE salmon.
09.30.2010	Rep. Gene Green (TX-29) and Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-01) introduced H.R. 6252, The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act to provide the United States with the regulatory framework to monitor the export of used electronics. Although e-waste (consumer electronics such as TVs, cell phones and computers) is the fastest growing waste stream in the country, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently has no framework to monitor the removal, disposal, and export to developing nations. Over 3 million tons of e-waste was generated by the United States in 2007. “As technology advances at a rapid pace, explosive sales patterns emerge in consumer consumption and old electronics are discarded as a result,” Rep. Green stated. “Many of these electronics are sent to developing nations for reuse or recycling.” E-waste can contain toxic chemicals which present environmental and health concerns when not properly handled. In 2008, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that many of the developing nations who receive e-waste from the United States do not have the capacity or facilities to safely recycle and dispose of these used electronics. “Every year, we scrap 400 million units of electronics in the U.S.,” said Rep. Thompson. “Each piece of e-waste can be incredibly harmful to our environment. Congressional action to stop the free flow of these dangerous materials is long overdue and we must act now before it is too late.” The Responsible Electronics Recycling Act will create a new section of 1976's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RICRA) to prohibit the export of restricted e-waste to developing nations. While tested and working equipment can still be exported to promote reuse, other consumer electronic equipment, parts, and material derived from them that contain toxic chemicals could not be exported to developing nations. “Dell bans the export of e-waste to developing countries as part of our global disposition policy, and the ever-growing e-waste challenge makes it necessary for all recyclers to do the same,” said Mark Newton, director of sustainable business at Dell. “The introduction of this bill is a great first step in giving consumers confidence that the systems they drop off for recycling will be handled responsibly.” Non-hazardous or tested and working electronic products or parts are not restricted. Other exemptions from the restrictions are: - products under warranty being returned to the manufacturing facility that made them; - products or parts being recalled; and - crushed cathode ray tube (CRT) glass cullet that is cleaned and fully prepared as feedstock into CRT glass manufacturing facilities “The marketplace has rejected the practice of dumping e-waste on developing countries, but exporting instead of recycling is still common in our industry,” said Robert Houghton, President of Redemtech, Inc., an Ohio based asset recovery company and certified e-Stewards serving Global 1000 companies in North America and Europe. “Such so-called recyclers are virtually defrauding customers who count on them for responsible recycling, at the same time they are helping to poison workers in recycling sweat shops overseas. By ending the toxic trade in e-waste, this bill does the right thing, and will create thousands more jobs in recycling and refurbishment here in the U.S.” This legislation will prevent the export of hazardous waste to developing nations and prevent detrimental impact to the environment and public health. It will also create jobs in America to process these products in a safe manner. The regulatory framework is consistent with policies most other developed nations have adopted through international treaties. “This e-waste export bill will stem the tide of the toxic techno-trash sent from the U.S. to developing countries around the world,” said Barbara Kyle, National Coordinator of the Electronics TakeBack Coalition, a national environmental coalition which promotes responsible recycling of e-waste. “Right now, consumers can't tell whether their local recycler will actually recycle their old products or dump them on the developing countries - and this bill will solve that problem, as well as create new recycling jobs here in the U.S.” The legislation has received support from Dell, Apple, Samsung, The Electronics TakeBack Coalition, and The Natural Resources Defense Council.
09.29.2010	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA01) testified before the House Judiciary Committee on the harmful effects H.R. 5034, the "Comprehensive Alcohol Regulatory Effectiveness (CARE) Act of 2010,” would have on the wine industry. Below are his remarks as prepared for delivery: Good afternoon Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, Members of the Committee and colleagues. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. A few months ago, I testified before the Courts and Competition Policy Subcommittee that the wholesalers' legislative proposal would seriously harm thousands of American businesses that make wine, beer and spirits. Since the bill - H.R. 5034 - was introduced, these businesses, joined by more than a hundred major organizations like the American Farm Bureau, the National Association of Manufactures, the American Bar Association's Antitrust Section, Progressive Policy Institute, and FreedomWorks, joined in opposition against it because it would discriminate against producers and limit the choices for American consumers. Today, we are back discussing a rewritten version of this bill, which I can tell you unequivocally is just as damaging as the original version. This bill is still opposed by wine, beer and spirits producers, including all the major organizations that represent them. It still allows states to discriminate against producers in ways that promote economic protectionism. It would still seriously harm American businesses and take choice away from American consumers. You'll hear today from legal scholars and industry experts who can tell you the broad, negative implications of this bill. But I am here to tell you how if passed into law this bill would hurt the lives and livelihoods of people across our nation. I can tell you about the family-run winery that's only in business because of the following they've developed through online sales. The small vineyard that wouldn't be in business - and the ag land that would probably be lost - if wineries couldn't sell directly to retailers and restaurants. The rural consumer who can't get her favorite spirit unless she can buy it online. The brewery that can't get the wholesalers to pay attention to their microbrew, but is in business because of a cult following nationwide. These are the people this bill hurts. Those entrepreneurs and farmers are scared that Congress is going to irreparably harm their businesses by passing this bill. Small businesses are struggling in every one of our districts. Times are equally tough for the wineries in my district, but they are finding innovative new ways to reach customers. Many of these wineries are small, with a very limited production, and they have to be innovative because many wholesalers won't give them the time of day! This bill, if passed into law, would keep them from selling an American product to American consumers, and as a result, would threaten thousands of good jobs. Is this bill needed to solve a problem? Absolutely not. Is the current system broken? No. State-based three-tiered alcohol distribution systems are working extremely well. Are states being treated unfairly? No. A state's right to pass alcohol laws is fully protected by the Constitution. In fact, there are over 4,000 state alcohol laws on the books. And there is no avalanche of litigation to suggest otherwise. Are wholesalers being treated unfairly? No. In California, our wineries can distribute to anyone - consumers, restaurants, even Costco, and our wholesalers are thriving! According to a recent study, the top two wine and spirits wholesalers in California brought in over $10.5 billion in 2009 sales revenues, and are estimated to bring in $10.7 billion in 2010, a more than $200 million increase in the middle of a recession! In the U.S. wine business, the top 10 wholesalers control over 60 percent of the market - clearly they are doing well. This bill is at best a solution looking for a problem. But if passed, it would be the problem for U.S. businesses and consumers. The Commerce Clause - from which the alcohol industry would be exempt were this bill to become law - was designed to ensure a fair national marketplace. A state can pass their own laws, they just can't discriminate against out-of-state producers and products. Congress and the Supreme Court have upheld this principle. Why would Congress want to turn back these decisions and deprive family businesses of their constitutional right? Mr. Chairman and Members, this bill is not needed and would unfairly discriminate against producers and retailers and limit the choices of consumers purely to give a competitive advantage to wholesalers. I urge you to oppose this bill. Thank you.
09.29.2010	The House of Representatives unanimously passed Congressman Mike Thompson's resolution recognizing the service of the military medical and air crews in helping our wounded soldiers make the trip home. The Air Force's Aeromedical Evacuation (AE) flights help guarantee our wounded service men and women are quickly reunited with their families and given the best medical care. “These men and women put their lives on the line on a regular basis to protect their fellow Americans,” said Congressman Thompson (D-CA). “When it comes to getting wounded military personnel off the battlefield, the Air Force crews do not hesitate to go into dangerous situations to evacuate our troops. These flights have increased the survival rate to 98%, the highest survival rate of any war in U.S. history. This wouldn't be the case without the brave Airmen who carry out our Aeromedical Evacuation flights.” Since September 11, 2001, AE flights have been responsible for transporting over 74,000 patients from Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Today, a soldier injured on the battlefield in Afghanistan or Iraq will be back in an American hospital in an average of three days. This is over seven days faster than during Operation Desert Storm and over 40 days quicker than during the conflict in Vietnam. Operated by some of our county's most dedicated nurses, medical technicians, physicians, pilots and support crews, AE is a Total Force effort - which includes members from Air Force Active Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard - operating at over 30 Air Force Bases in the U.S. and abroad. Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, CA is home to 349th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron.
09.23.2010	Congressman Mike Thompson announced that several important consumer protection features of health reform are set to go into effect today, six months after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law. These provisions seek to end insurance company abuses, and put consumers and their doctors back in control of their health care. “When I voted for this health care legislation, it was to make sure that all Americans had access to quality affordable health care,” said Congressman Thompson. “As of today, young Californians will be able to stay on their parents' insurance until their 26th birthday. This is very important, because young people are the biggest group of uninsured Americans. And, people will no longer be subject to lifetime caps on what health insurance will pay, or risk losing their coverage when they get sick. This will also make a big difference, because over 60 percent of people who declared bankruptcy in 2007 did so because of medical costs.” As of today all privately-insured Americans will have the following protections: - Health coverage cannot be arbitrarily cancelled if you become sick. - Children cannot be denied coverage due to a pre-existing condition. - Children up to age 26 can stay on their parents' health plan. - Health insurance giants cannot put a lifetime limit on health coverage. Beginning today, consumers purchasing new plans will have the following additional protections: - Preventive services will be available without deductable or co-payments. - Patients have the right to both an internal and external appeal of insurers' coverage decisions. - Patients have the right to access out-of-network emergency room care at in-network cost-sharing rates. Congressman Thompson also sent a letter to the California Insurance Commissioner today, asking him to look into ways to recoup money for insurance clients who may have been overcharged. In North Carolina, Insurance Commissioner Wayne Goodwin was able to return nearly $156 million to more than 215,000 Blue Cross Blue Shield policyholders. That's equivalent to more than 1.5 months of premiums.
09.23.2010	Today, Congressman Thompson voted in favor of the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (H.R. 5297) which passed the House of Representatives by a 237- 187 vote. This bill will expand much needed lending to millions of small businesses across the country and offers tax incentives to help small businesses. “I've heard from many small business owners in our district that need access to loans to hire additional employees or expand their business, and that is exactly what this bill does,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “Small businesses have been responsible for a majority of the new jobs created over the past decade and we should give them access to the resources they need to continue hiring.” Small Business Lending Fund Act gives small businesses access to $12 billion in tax cuts and expands their access to private capital to finance an expansion and hire new workers. It also creates a $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund to provide community banks with additional capital to increase their lending to small businesses. The Small Business Lending Fund Act is fully paid for and will not add to the national deficit. This bill is supported by National Small Business Association, Small Business Majority, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant Association, Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Independent Community Bankers of America, American Bankers Association, Financial Services Roundtable, Business & Professional Women's Foundation, International Franchise Association, Motor & Equipment Manufacturers, and the National Association for the Self-Employed. Last week, the Senate passed this bill by a 61-38 vote. It will now be sent to President Obama to be signed into law.
09.16.2010	WASHINGTON DC- Yesterday, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted to boost the American manufacturing industry and create new jobs by requiring Congress and the Department of Homeland Security to purchase products that are made in the United States. The two bills, the Congressional Made in America Promise Act and the Berry Amendment Extension Act, are part of a national manufacturing plan to create the high-skill, high-wage jobs of the futureâ€”promoting American competitiveness, innovation, and exports. “In these tough economic times, it is important that we bring the jobs back to the United States and support our own industry by buying American made products,” said Congressman Thompson. “My colleagues and I will continue to work to create more jobs and ease the current economic burden on American families and businesses.” The Congressional Made in America Promise Act requires Congress to purchase goods and services made by American workers for the first time since “Buy American” rules were instituted for federal agencies under President Roosevelt in 1933. This includes tighter Buy American requirements for items with the seal of Congress, the House, or Senate. The Berry Amendment Extension Act bars the Department of Homeland Security from buying clothing, tents and other products that are not “grown, reprocessed, reused or produced” in America. For the last 60 years, the Berry Amendment has served our nation well requiring the Defense Department and the Coast Guard to buy a range of domestically produced or grown items with 100% U.S. content, and yesterday Congress voted to include the Department of Homeland Security.
08.10.2010	Today the U.S. House of Representatives passed two important bills which will strengthen our economy and improve our border security. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) returned from California to DC in order to vote for both bills during a special session of Congress. The Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act will save and create almost 320,000 jobs nationwide, including 160,000 teaching jobs. California will receive over $1.2 billion in funding for education, which will help prevent 16,500 teacher layoffs. “Saving a teaching job does more than just keep one more person off the unemployment rolls,” said Congressman Thompson. “Each teaching job that we can save will help improve the education of our children, and strengthen the future of our country. Our past successes have been built on the strong educational foundation our country has always provided, and we cannot let these tough economic times weaken that foundation. Our district is expected to be able to save 243 teaching jobs as a result of this legislation. And our firefighters and cops are the men and women who keep our families and homes safe.” The bill includes $10 billion in funding to save teacher jobs; and $16.1 billion in health assistance to the states that will help keep police officers and firefighters on the job. According to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute, the Medicaid funds will save and create 158,000 jobs, including preventing the layoff of police officers and firefighters. More than half these jobs will be in the private sector. The bill is completely paid for. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the bill actually reduces the deficit by $1.4 billion over 10 years by cutting $17.7 billion in spending and closing $9.8 billion worth of corporate tax loopholes. The bill now goes to the President for his signature. Congress also passed H.R. 6080, the 2010 Emergency Border Security Supplemental Appropriations Bill. It provides a total of $600 million to help address the threat of increased violence along the Southwest Border by strengthening border security and enforcement efforts, and it is fully paid for. The cost is met by increasing, over five years, the cost for two visas which permit foreign workers to come and work in the United States. The Border Security bill must now be approved by the Senate before it can be signed into law by the President. ###
07.21.2010	On the evening of July 28th, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) will host a live town hall meeting via telephone and he is inviting every resident of the 1st Congressional District to join him. Participants are encouraged to ask him questions about the issues that are important to them. “Our country is facing many challenges right now and I want to make sure that people from across our district can discuss what's on their mind,” said Congressman Thompson. “It's extremely important to me to hear from constituents, and this telephone town hall will be a great chance to talk about the challenges facing our country. Please take this opportunity to call in and make your voice heard.” More information: What: A toll-free telephone town hall with Congressman Mike Thompson When: Wednesday, July 28 from 7:10 PM to 8:10 PM Pacific Time How to join: When the call starts, dial (877) 229-8493 and enter the passcode 13293
07.15.2010	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) was joined by 29 other members of Congress in introducing legislation to protect clean energy initiatives that are important to homeowners in California and the rest of the country. The “PACE Assessment Protection Act of 2010” would order lenders to adopt standards that support Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) programs, rather than stymie green energy efforts. “PACE programs are an important part of the push to create a green economy and reduce our reliance on foreign oil,” said Congressman Thompson. “They create jobs, and are an exciting way for homeowners to reduce their energy bills while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is especially important in California, which has already taken significant steps to ensure that PACE programs are available to 70% of Californians by the end of 2010. And our district has been a national leader in getting these programs up and running - lending institutions should not interfere with these great green energy programs.” “I join Congressman Thompson in introducing legislation that will allow Sonoma and other counties around the country to continue to allow homeowners to finance innovative energy-efficiency and renewable-energy projects in an affordable and responsible way,” said Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey (D-CA). “Projects like the Sonoma County Energy Independence Program can promote the development of local renewable energy projects that will decrease our consumption of fossil fuels, reduce our impact on the environment, and create good-paying green jobs in our communities.” “Where enacted, the PACE program has proved to be a very successful resource for homeowners wanting to reduce their energy consumption. It has also created jobs, increased clean energy investments, and has the potential to further our goal of making the Sacramento region a leader in the clean energy economy,” said Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-CA). “However, I am deeply concerned by the recent decision by the FHFA to effectively shut down the PACE program. That's why I am pleased to join Rep. Thompson in introducing legislation that will allow PACE financing programs to continue while ensuring that both the taxpayer and private mortgage investments are protected. And we will continue to fight to ensure this program is restored.” “My congressional district on Long Island is home to a successful home retrofit program and is set to expand PACE programs to several more communities. Now our programs are at risk of shutting down. PACE programs are helping homeowners save money on their energy bills, making energy efficiency affordable and helping expand our green technology economy. I'm proud to be working with Congressman Thompson to support PACE programs,” said Rep. Steve Israel (D-NY). “Our PACE program is yielding real positive results for our community - hundreds of good paying local jobs, reduction in energy and water use and cost savings for consumers,” said Sonoma County Supervisor Valerie Brown. “Congressman Thompson's legislation will protect these outstanding efforts and we thank him for his support of all of our efforts.” PACE financing is an innovative means to create jobs, reduce energy bills and dramatically cut greenhouse gas emissions. It is estimated that capturing just 10% of potential greenhouse gas reductions through PACE could result in a 220 megaton cut in CO2 emissions annually. Even modest implementation of PACE programs could create 160,000 green jobs in the United States. And because PACE-financed energy efficiency measures would cut consumers' utility bills, they would generate average homeowner savings of $5,000-$14,000 over the lifetime of the benefits. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have asserted that homeowners are in default of their mortgages if they finance energy improvements with PACE. The Pace Programs have the strong support of the Department of Energy and the White House, which issued its White House PACE Policy Framework on October 18, 2009. California PACE programs are currently operational in the City and County of San Francisco, Sonoma County, Placer County, Palm Desert and Yucaipa. Programs are set to launch in 2010 in the following jurisdictions: Los Angeles County, San Diego City, Alameda County, Fresno County, Kern County, Monterey County, Sacramento County, San Diego County, San Benito County, San Luis Obispo County, San Mateo County, Santa Barbara County, Santa Clara County, Santa Cruz County, Solano County, Ventura County.
06.04.2010	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley), issued the following statement in response to President Obama's speech in Cairo. Congressman Thompson is a senior member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, and chairs the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence “Today President Obama made an historic address in Cairo. While words alone can't fix the problems that face our globe, President Obama deserves praise for talking openly and honestly about the relationship between Muslim countries and our own. Words can lay the foundation for peace building, and today's speech put that groundwork in place.” “His message of hope and peace, and his condemnation of violent extremism are important issues to be discussed. While we might differ from our Muslim neighbors, we also share a common humanity as the President highlighted. By ensuring people around the world have a chance to raise their families in peace, with access to good jobs, freedom to practice their own religion, and to determine their own form of government, the need for armed conflict and war will diminish. I applaud the President for his important address today.”
06.03.2010	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced legislation that would bring tax relief to family farmers, ranchers, and open space landholders. His bill would allow family farms and ranches to pass down their land and farms and preserve California's strong agricultural heritage. “The estate tax as it is currently written unfairly burdens our family farmers,” said Congressman Thompson. “When farms pass from generation to generation, too often families have to sell the farm to developers in order to pay the estate taxes. We need to preserve our agricultural land and open space, which is why I introduced this legislation to fix the tax code.” Nearly three quarters of the land in the lower 48 states of the U.S. is in private ownership, with the vast majority owned by farmers, ranchers and forest landowners. These lands are vital to both healthy ecosystems and vibrant rural communities. They contribute to clean water, climate benefits, food and fiber production, and wildlife habitat. “This bill helps prevent estate taxes from forcing the sale and development of the family farms, ranches and forests that are so important for clean water, wildlife, and our rural heritage,” said Land Trust Alliance President Rand Wentworth. “We're particularly pleased that Congressman Thompson included an estate tax exclusion for lands protected by conservation easementsâ€”so families that generously protect the conservation values of their land for future generations will not be forced to sell.” “Agriculture faces special problems since it's hard to sell off a portion of the farm to settle the inheritance tax without destroying the farm's economic viability. California has a rich history of family farms spanning multiple generations. Mike Thompson's legislation will help protect that proud heritage, while keeping land in agriculture and in the hands of family farms,” said Doug Mosebar, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation. The legislation has many supporters in the First Congressional district including the California Farm Bureau Environmental Defense Fund, Land Trust Alliance, California Wine Grape Growers, California Farm Bureau, Western Growers, and United Fruit and Vegetable Growers. ###
04.14.2010	Tomorrow is known as tax day, and this year taxpayers can take advantage of more than 25 different tax cuts worth more than $800 billion passed by this Congress designed to help working families and small businesses. “We have focused on cutting taxes for ordinary Americans,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “And it's worked. According to IRS figures, the average tax refund this year is $3,000, which is nearly 9.4% larger than last year's average. The Recovery Act was the largest tax cut in history, and it's making a difference for working families.” A report released this week by the Citizens for Tax Justice shows that since January 2009, 98% of American families have seen their taxes cut. These tax cuts saved working families and individuals an average of $1,158 on their tax returns. Bruce Bartlett, President Reagan's domestic policy advisor, noted that “federal taxes are very considerably lower by every measure since Obama became president.” Congressman Thompson highlighted several tax cuts he thought were making a particularly important impact on our communities: The Making Work Pay tax credit - Ninety-five percent of working families received the Recovery Act's Making Work Pay tax credit of $400 for an individual or $800 for married couples filing jointly in their 2009 paychecks - and will continue to see these benefits in 2010. In our district, 249,000 families are benefiting from the Making Work Pay tax credit. Tax credits for college expenses - More than four million additional students will be able to attend college thanks to this tax credit, which provides eligible families and students with up to $2,500 in tax savings. Tax credits for energy efficient renovations - Taxpayers are eligible for up to $1,500 in tax credits for making energy-efficient improvements to their homes, such as adding insulation and installing energy efficient windows. Alternative Minimum Tax - 26 million middle-class families are protected from the alternative minimum tax, including 45,000 tax filers in the 1st Congressional District. The tax was originally designed to affect the very wealthy, but has not been adjusted to reflect inflation since it was originally written. Congress also provided important tax breaks to businesses, including expanded small business expensing, bonus depreciation, small business loss carrybacks, and increased incentives to invest in small businesses. And, the Recovery Act provides over $20 billion in tax credits over ten years to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency incentives, including Congressman Thompson's provisions that make it easier for homeowners and small businesses to access solar technology. Thompson has been a leading champion in Congress for tax cuts that promote sustainability and conservation of natural resources. These include a deduction for land placed in conservation easements and tax breaks for solar manufacturers.

03.21.2010	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) joined 218 of his colleagues and voted to pass historic health care legislation. The bill will benefit small businesses and individuals, is paid for and according to the Congressional Budget Office, will reduce the deficit by $130 billion over 10 years, and $1.3 trillion over 20 years. “The bill passed today by the House will have many important benefits for folks in our district,” said Congressman Thompson. “It will immediately forbid insurance companies from dropping your coverage if you get sick, and give small businesses that provide coverage to their employees a tax credit of up to 35% of premiums. Adults who are uninsured because of a pre-existing condition will be able to buy affordable coverage. Young people will be able to stay on their parents' insurance until their 26th birthday. And seniors on Medicare who are forced to pay out of pocket for their medications will get a rebate.” The bill will have a much broader impact once it's fully implemented in 2014. In California's First District alone, it will improve coverage for 395,000 residents who already have health insurance by prohibiting annual and lifetime limits on care, making sure insurance companies can't drop people from coverage if they get sick, ban coverage denials for pre-existing conditions, and reduce the cost of preventive care. To rein in soaring insurance costs, the reforms also limit the amount insurance companies can spend on administrative expenses, profits, and other overhead. The bill will also:Give tax credits up to 163,000 families and 15,700 small businesses to help them afford coverage in the First District. Extend coverage to 63,500 uninsured residents in our district. Guarantee that 13,100 residents with pre-existing conditions can obtain coverage. Protect 800 district families from bankruptcy by capping total health care expenditures. Allow 69,000 young adults to obtain coverage on their parents' insurance plans. Provide millions of dollars in new funding for 74 of our community health centers. Reduce the cost of uncompensated care for hospitals and other health care providers by $67 million annually in the First District. The bill will also make significant improvements to seniors' health care. Seniors will have access to free preventive and wellness care, improved primary and coordinated care, and enhanced nursing home care. The bill also closes the “donut hole,” which forces 10,300 seniors in the district each year to cover the full cost of their medications. It also increases new training programs to ensure that we have a greater number of primary care doctors, nurses, and public health professionals. The bill also incentivizes doctors to provide primary care in underserved areas, to increase access for rural areas. The bill is supported by California Medical Association, California Hospital Association and AARP.
03.10.2010	Nearly 12,000 people participated in Monday night's telephone town hall, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced today - breaking the previous record. The questions were on a wide variety of topics, ranging from health care to the federal debt to immigration. “Each time I hold one of these events, we have more and more participants,” said Congressman Thompson. “They are not a replacement for in-person town hall meetings, but they are a great way to hear from folks all across our district. Last night was a good chance for us to talk about important things like health care reform and jobs. It's important that we had a chance to share our thoughts. I wasn't able to get to everyone, but I'll be responding to all of the 131 voicemails that were left at the end of the call.” ###
02.24.2010	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted to help lower health insurance costs by ending health insurers' exemption from federal antitrust laws. The Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act, H.R. 4626, would subject health insurance companies to federal antitrust laws, holding them to the same standards as everyone else. “We need to bring down the cost of health care and make quality health care accessible to more people. By eliminating this exemption, it will make it more difficult for health insurance companies to avoid competition,” said Congressman Thompson. “And increased competition will benefit consumers. Recent rate hikes in California by Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield underscore the need for health insurance reform. It's absurd that consumers will face up to 39 percent increases in their rates, and we must do all we can to make sure that there is fair regulation of the health insurance market. This bill is a good step forward in the health reform process.” Since 1945 health insurance companies have been exempt from all federal antitrust laws. According to a recent study by the American Medical Association, there have been more than 400 mergers among health insurers in the past 14 years. As a result, in 94 percent of the metropolitan areas in the U.S., the health insurance markets are now “highly concentrated,” according to long-established antitrust standards, and lack meaningful competition. Under the bill, health insurers will no longer be shielded from legal accountability for price fixing, bid-rigging, unfair division of market territories, and other anti-competitive practices. This Act will also allow the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to investigate any suspicion of collusion and hold the insurance companies accountable. While this bill removes the antitrust exemption, it does not change any state-based systems of regulation or taxation. This legislation will hold health insurers subject to both federal antitrust law and state regulations, and will force insurance companies into increased competition with one another and move the United States toward a fair and affordable health insurance market. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration.
02.04.2010	Today Congress passed important legislation that mandates that Congress can't spend more than it can afford. The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act (H.J. Res. 45) requires Congress to offset all new policies that reduce revenues or expand entitlement spending. “This is a good first step towards restoring fiscal discipline to Washington. I've been working to pass Pay-As-You-Go legislation, also known as PAYGO, since I was elected to Congress and I carried the measure of the floor of the House during the 108th Congress,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “The federal government's budget shouldn't be any different than a family's budget: you don't spend more money than you can afford. And if you do make a big purchase, you have to cut back elsewhere.” The bill passed today is similar to the bipartisan PAYGO law in place in the 1990s, which helped reverse huge deficits, create budget surpluses, and produce an economic boom. In 2002 these budget rules were allowed to expire, contributing to the dramatic turnaround from a projected 10-year surplus of $5.6 trillion in 2000 to projected deficits of over $11 trillion in 2009. H.J. Res. 45 makes PAYGO law, so that future Administrations can't choose whether or not they want to follow pay-as-you-go principles. There are some protections in the rule, so that during an economic crisis Congress and the President can do what is needed to strengthen our economy. The bill now heads to President Obama's desk for signature.
12.21.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), the original sponsor of Passenger Bill of Rights legislation, released the following statement after Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced significant protections for airline passengers: "This is a big victory for airline passengers,” said Congressman Thompson. “Passengers will no longer have to give up their basic rights when they step on an airplane. I applaud Secretary LaHood for putting these long-overdue protections in place. Almost three years ago I introduced legislation to make these changes, and I'm very glad to see that they will be implemented. I look forward to working with Secretary LaHood to make sure this rule brings passengers the protections they deserve."
12.07.2009	On the evening of December 9th, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) will host a live town hall meeting via telephone and he is inviting every resident of the 1st Congressional District to join him. Participants can ask him questions about the issues that are important to them, and the Congressman will respond live for everyone to hear. “As the year comes to a close, it's important that we talk about the things that are important to our district,” said Congressman Thompson. “I look forward to responding to your questions and listening to your concerns. Please take this opportunity to make your voice heard by calling in to participate.” More information: What: A toll-free telephone town hall with Congressman Mike Thompson When: Wednesday, December 9th from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM Pacific Time How to join: Please email Thompson.townhall@mail.house.gov with your name and telephone phone number to be added to the list.
12.03.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced the Storage Technology of Renewable and Green Energy Act of 2009 (STORAGE Act). The STORAGE Act would provide a tax credit to individuals and businesses when they purchase energy storage systems. Energy storage systems allow consumers to keep excess energy generated by things like solar panels or wind turbines when energy is in low demand and then use it during periods of peak demand, reducing consumers' electricity bills and greatly enhancing the reliability of alternative energy sources. “We need to do more to create new green jobs and promote clean, renewable energy,” said Congressman Thompson. “These tax incentives will help save people money on their electricity bills while also helping our environment, which is a win-win. It will also spur innovation, because it incentivizes the development and use of new technologies.” Businesses and individuals would both be eligible for tax credits under the STORAGE Act. Businesses and factories that generate energy via large compressed air systems, flywheels, and large arrays of fuels cells and batteries would be eligible for a 20% tax credit. Households and businesses that purchase energy storage systems for their property would be eligible for a 30% tax credit. The tax credits would also help improve our alternative energy infrastructure. The current alternative energy electricity infrastructure is highly inefficient. Right now, alternative energy sources are often shut down if the energy cannot be used immediately. Energy storage systems can help fix this problem by storing energy temporarily and delivering it when it is needed. Energy storage systems also help cope with peak demand. By allowing consumers to store energy, rather than draw on the system during peak demand time, it can reduce the number of power plants that are needed. This bill will be assigned to the House Ways & Means Committee. Companion legislation has been introduced in the Senate by Senator Ron Wyden.
12.03.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) released this statement following the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau's (TTB) approval of Calistoga, California as an American Viticultural Area (AVA): “I am extremely pleased to announce that Calistoga has finally been designated as an American Viticultural Area, a long overdue and much deserved distinction. I look forward to celebrating this tremendous victory with the wine supporters here in the Napa Valley and across the globe who have worked tirelessly to recognize one of world's premier growing regions. “I especially thank the Calistoga growers and the Napa Valley Vintners for their leadership and determination over the past six years. It has been a long road, but like the incredible wines made in Calistoga, we will savor this wonderful news. This announcement is a testament to the decades of hard work Napa Valley grape growers and winemakers have put into making their wines the envy of the world. We should all raise a glass to the new Calistoga AVA.”
11.19.2009	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted to preserve seniors' access to their doctors by fixing the way Medicare pays physicians. The Medicare Physician Payment Reform Act, H.R. 3961, will permanently reform the Medicare payment system, repealing a 21% cut in payments to doctors scheduled to take place in January and replacing it with a stable system that protects seniors, preserves their relationship with their doctors and promotes primary care. “We've all heard from our constituents how important their relationship is with their doctor. We have a system that works- over 45 million people across the country depend on Medicare for that doctor-patient relationship,” said Congressman Thompson. “Yet every year this doctor patient relationship is threatened by excessive cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates. Every year we wait until the last minute to address it in Congress. Meanwhile, patients worry that they will lose access to their doctors. And doctors worry about how they will be able to continue to serve their patients.” “This bill will permanently fix the problem- so that we don't have to put patients and their doctors through this yearly ritual, and Medicare recipients will have continuous access to their doctors.” The bill has been endorsed by many groups including the American Medical Association, AARP, the Military Officers Association of America, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American College of Physicians, the American College of Surgeons, the Center for Medicare Advocacy, the Medicare Rights Center, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration.
11.18.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced legislation to boost solar panel manufacturing in the United States. H.R. 4085 will offer a significant tax credit to solar manufacturers, which will stimulate job creation here in the United States. Representatives Dave Camp (R-MI), Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) and Patrick Tiberi (R-OH) are original cosponsors of the bill. “Solar energy creates more jobs per megawatt of energy than any other source of energy. Currently, only 5 percent of solar products are produced within the United States,” said Congressman Thompson. “This bill would add incentives for companies to produce these products domestically and create good jobs. In these troubled economic times, we need to do all that we can to add jobs and move towards energy independence.” “The bill we have introduced today will help grow the solar industry and help create much needed jobs for the American people,” said Congressman Camp. “This is exactly the jobs-creating program we need to focus on, and with such high unemployment rates around the country, this sort of manufacturing is just what states like Michigan need.” “This bill would provide important incentives to American manufacturers,” said Congressman Tiberi. “I believe these incentives would help companies transition to the manufacturing of tomorrow, help bring good jobs to Ohio and across the entire country, and help make us a leader in the production of new technologies.” “In Texas especially, we have no shortage of sun. Boosting green energy grows green jobs here at home and makes clean energy affordable for more Americans,” said Congressman Doggett. Congressman Thompson successfully included provisions in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that provide for temporary tax credits for solar manufacturers through the end of 2010. This bill extends the provisions of ARRA so that manufactures have a dependable incentive to drive long-term job growth and investment.
11.07.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) spoke on the House floor in support of H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act. His speech can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/CongressmanMThompson#p/a/u/0/GW23HDggKSc. Below are his remarks: “For too long, too many Americans have not had access to quality, affordable health care. Because of this legislation, the millions of Americans who don't have health care or are struggling to pay their health care bills will be able to get the care they need when they need it. And families, small businesses, and individuals will save money. “There will be no co-pays or deductibles for preventive care services. If you change jobs, you can take your coverage with you. You will not be denied coverage for pre-existing conditions. And families won't be bankrupted by high medical bills. “The bill will also help inject competition into the marketplace to help bring down the rising costs of health insurance. The Medicare “donut hole” will be closed. And CBO estimates the bill reduces the deficit by at least $30 billion over 10 years. “Now, there's still a lot more work to be done and we're going to fix the doctor reimbursement issue to ensure the best access for our seniors in regard to getting health care. But today is an historic day for all Americans. It moves us one step closer to quality, affordable health care for all Americans.”
10.29.2009	Today House Democrats unveiled health care reform legislation that will provide access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. The House is expected to debate and vote on the legislation next week. “This is an historic day for our country,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), who joined his fellow Democrats at a press conference to announce the bill. “For too long, too many Americans have not had access to quality, affordable health care. This bill will ensure that the millions of Americans who don't have health care or are struggling to pay their health care bills will be able to get the care they need when they need it, without bankrupting them or adding to our national debt.” The Affordable Health Care for America Act (H.R. 3962) combines and updates the provisions of the three bills passed by the House committees of jurisdiction in July. The bill will slow the growth of out-of-control costs, introduce competition into the health care marketplace to keep coverage affordable, and protect people's choices of doctors and health plans. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of expanding coverage at $894 billion, which will be completely paid for. CBO estimates the bill reduces the deficit by at least $30 billion over 10 years. “We need to bring down the cost of health care so that our families, our small businesses, and our economy can survive,” said Congressman Thompson. “In order to do that, we need to pass the strongest bill possible that will inject competition into the marketplace and make insurance more affordable. I'm a strong supporter of the public option, which will allow individuals who aren't currently covered by their employer to have many choices about their health insurance plan.” The legislation also will ensure that Americans have portable, secure health care coverage - so that they won't lose care if their employer drops their plan or they lose their job. The bill will end increases in premiums or denials of care or coverage based on pre-existing conditions, race, or gender, and strictly limit age rating. The proposal will also eliminate co-pays for preventive care and cap out-of-pocket expenses to protect every American from bankruptcy. “No woman should be denied coverage because they have given birth or other ridiculous â€˜pre-existing conditions' that some insurance companies currently use to deny coverage to Americans,” said Congressman Thompson. “The average family currently pays over $1,000 per year to cover the costs of uninsured folks getting emergency care. By increasing the number of people who have health care, we'll actually bring down costs for everyone.” To view a copy of the Affordable Health Care for American Act, H.R. 3926, click here: https://docs.house.gov/rules/health/111_ahcaa.pdf To view a bill summary, detailed fact sheets and more information on what the health insurance reform will mean for America, click here: https://waysandmeans.house.gov/MoreInfo.asp?section=52
09.17.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) joined 252 of his colleagues in voting for the bipartisan Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA- H.R. 3221). The bill will expand access to an affordable college education for more American students, while saving taxpayers $87 billion dollars. “A bill that saves money today while better preparing our workforce for tomorrow just makes sense,” said Congressman Thompson. “More and more students are dropping out of college because they lack money. In these tough economic times, it's more important than ever that we make sure that all students who want to go to college have access to affordable loans. In our district alone, the number of students getting Pell Grants will nearly double as a result of this legislation, and our students will have access to more than $47 million in additional funds.” SAFRA will change the way the student loan system functions by originating new loans through the government's Direct Loan program, rather than subsidizing private lenders. The bill will redirect this savings back into the student loan program, expanding access to government grant and loan assistance. Pell Grants, already distributed to more than 7 million students, will increase to $6,900 by 2019 from $5,350 today. The bill also keeps interest rates low on government-subsidized loans, makes substantial investments in early childhood education, expands the Perkins low-cost loan program to every U.S. college, and simplifies the process of applying for student financial aid. The bill now heads to the Senate, where a similar version is being drafted by the Senate Health, Education and Labor Committee. The Senate is expected to act on this legislation before the end of the year. ###
08.27.2009	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena) announced the Lake Berryessa Resort Improvement District will receive $2.25 million in funding for the replacement of the drinking water treatment facility. These funds were allocated from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The current drinking water treatment facility has exceeded its useful life and is unable to effectively treat water for the community during storms. “Rural areas of our district need as much, if not more help from the stimulus act ,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “When I voted for recovery funding for our country, it was for projects like this that will invest in and improve our community, while creating jobs. This is a great day for Lake Berryessa residents.” “This is exactly the kind of community and situation of need on which the Recovery Funds should be spent. The Lake Berryessa Resort Improvement District, and the County of Napa are grateful to Congressman Thompson for his help to secure these funds. This project is one that will hopefully get this community that has been hit very hard from the economic downturn back on its feet,” said Napa County Supervisor Diane Dillon. The Lake Berryessa Resort Improvement District was established in 1965 and is home to over 500 residents. In 2007, the property owners in the District approved a 30-year bond to replace the water treatment facility. Unfortunately, the total cost to replace the facility exceeded the amount of the bond. The funding allocated from the Recovery Act will allow the entire facility to be replaced and save the District tax payers approximately $240 each per year over the next 30 years.
08.05.2009	There are a lot of questions about the health care bill in Congress. Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about the bill that passed the Ways and Means Committee. Question: Has Congressman Thompson read the bill? Answer: I have read and was involved in drafting the bill I voted on. For weeks before the introduction of H.R. 3200, members of the Ways and Means Committee, myself included, met daily to go through the bill line by line and section by section. As a group, we spent 86 hours going over this legislation. Question: Will health reform force all Americans out of their private insurance plans and into a one-size-fits-all government plan? Answer: No. H.R. 3200 builds on the current system of employer-based coverage, it doesn't replace it. If you are happy with your current plan, you can keep it. H.R. 3200 includes a public plan that individuals will have the option of purchasing, along with a variety of other private plans. This public plan will be required to be financially self-sustaining, as private plans are, covering its costs through premiums and co-pays. Question: Does page 16 of the bill require me to join the public plan if I lose my private insurance coverage? Answer: No one will be required to join the public plan. If you lose your insurance, you will be able to shop for a new plan at an online exchange that includes information on all insurance options. This exchange will bring together information that is currently scattered giving consumers the opportunity to quickly and effectively compare plans to make informed decisions about what coverage works best for them. The provision on page 16 merely requires individuals joining a private insurance plan after 2013 to do so through the exchange. Question: Are Members of Congress exempt from changes that are being proposed for the rest of the country? Answer: No. Members of Congress receive the same healthcare options as other federal employees, with a choice of plans from private insurers that vary by benefits, premiums and co-pays. This legislation would affect federal employees in the same ways that it affects everyone else who gets their health insurance through their employer. Question: Will proposed legislation provide free healthcare to illegal immigrants? Answer: No. Section 246 of H.R. 3200 explicitly prohibits the payment of affordability credits designed to help low and moderate incomes families purchase insurance to anyone who is not lawfully present in the United States. Question: Will all small businesses be forced to provide coverage to their employees? Answer: This bill exempts small businesses with a payroll of less than $250,000 from the requirement to provide health insurance for their workers. Businesses with payrolls above $250,000 that do not provide coverage will be charged a payroll tax that will gradually increase with the size of their payroll. The current version of the bill has this tax will start at 2% for payrolls above $250,000 and increase to a maximum of 8% for payrolls above $400,000, however, there are currently discussions to raise this exemption to $500,000. Proceeds from this tax will go to offset the cost of coverage for individuals purchasing insurance through the exchange. Small businesses that opt to offer insurance will receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance. Question: What does this bill do to stop fraud and abuse in Medicare? Answer: This bill strengthens existing compliance and enforcement tools for Medicare, increases funding to support these efforts and creates new, tougher penalties for individuals who submit false claims or applications to Medicare. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that for every $1 we invest in fighting waste fraud and abuse we will produce $1.75 in savings. Question: Can our nation afford healthcare reform? Answer: The truth is that the rising cost of healthcare for all Americans is a problem that will not fix itself and that we can't afford to not address. Today, our nation spends one out of every $6 we earn on healthcare. If we don't take action to slow the increase in costs, within a decade we will spend one out of every $5 on healthcare, and within 30 years this will rise to one in every $3. These facts make it clear, the longer we wait, the more it will cost to fix our broken healthcare system. Question: How much will this bill cost? Answer: There is no question that there will be significant costs to implement this legislation. The CBO's latest estimate puts the price tag at $1.042 trillion over ten years. Here is how we are going to pay for the bill. First, we are going to address inefficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and crack down on fraud, waste and abuse in these programs to save $465 billion over the next ten years. Second, we will need to raise $583 billion in revenues to cover the rest of the cost. The Ways and Means Committee proposes to do this through a surcharge on the wealthiest 1.2% of income earners, who have enjoyed a tremendous advantage for the last eight years because of the Bush tax cuts (the average reduction in federal taxes for the top 1% in these tax cuts was $44,622). The Senate is considering other ways to raise these funds, and it is unclear how this issue will be dealt with in the final bill. Question: Will this plan lead to rationing of healthcare? Will Congress be legislating what care my doctor can or must give me? Answer: No. I believe that medical decisions should be left between patients and their doctors. Section 1401 explicitly forbids any studies or research called for in H.R. 3200 from being used to either mandate or deny care to a patient in any public or private plan. This research will gather data about what procedures are most effective to give doctors more information to consider when treating patients, not to replace your doctor's judgment with that of a bureaucrat from a private insurer or the government. The bill protects the ability of doctors to do what they think is necessary to help their patients without having to constantly worry about whether they will be reimbursed by an insurance company, which is why this bill has earned the strong support of the American Medical Association. Question: Why is this bill being “rushed” through Congress? Answer: Universal healthcare was first proposed by Teddy Roosevelt in 1912. President Harry Truman called for it in 1945. Former Representative John Dingell Sr. introduced a bill to provide universal healthcare in 1947 and his son, Representative John Dingell Jr., has reintroduced a bill every Congress since 1955. So, this is not a new issue and it was supported by both President Obama and Senator McCain in the November presidential election. This particular legislation has been crafted, reviewed and revised repeatedly since the 111th Congress began, and it has been changed to reflect the considerable input from those in the healthcare community, members on both sides of the aisle and constituents. This bill is not being rushed - it is long overdue.

07.24.2009	Today, the U.S. House of Representatives unanimously approved the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act (H.R. 233). The bill, introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), designates more than 273,000 acres of northern California as wilderness and approximately 51,000 acres as a Recreation Management Area for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. If signed into law, it will be the largest wilderness designation in California in more than a decade. Click here to hear Congressman Thompson's floor speech. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who have been very instrumental in the bill's development, previously introduced this bill in the Senate. It was passed twice by the Senate prior to being revised in consultation with the House Resources Committee. The bill now moves to the Senate for consideration. “For more than five years, I have worked with my constituents and colleagues in Congress to protect the invaluable and extraordinary wilderness of northern California, and today we are much closer to reaching our goal,” said Thompson. “As anyone who has enjoyed the beauty of northern California's coasts and forests can attest, this land deserves the highest level of protection we can afford it.” This bill would protect public land in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino and Napa Counties as wilderness and designate the Black Butte River in Mendocino County as a wild and scenic river. In addition, it would maintain all existing roads, private lands and grazing rights, and it would designate a Recreation Management Area in Mendocino County for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. “Working in an unprecedented manner with conservationists, businesses and outdoor enthusiasts, I believe we have developed a carefully-crafted bill of the highest quality,” said Thompson. “Through this bill, we ensure that northern California's wilderness can be enjoyed in its natural state for generations to come.” This floor speech can be obtained using the following time codes: 07/24/06, Start time: 15:48:16, End Time: 15:53:20.
07.23.2009	The Community Forestry Conservation Act of 2009 was introduced last night by Congressman Mike Thompson and a bi-partisan group of Representatives and Senators, including Congressmen Dave Reichert (R-WA), Jim McDermott (D-WA) and Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and Ron Wyden (D-OR). Supported by a broad coalition of environmentalists, private landowners and the timber industry, this bill was introduced to protect private forestland from development while keeping intact private property rights, and the jobs and businesses that are tied to the land. “The current tax code makes it hard for conservation organizations to manage and restore our forests,” said Congressman Thompson. “This bill is important to the health of our forests and forest jobs.” “A massive forest ownership conversion has taken place with nearly 84% of America's industrial forests changing hands in the past 12 years,” said Tom Tuchmann, President of Portland, Oregon-based US Forest Capital. “Notwithstanding the economic downturn, transaction activity remains strong, creating opportunities for large-scale conservation purchases. With funding for such purchases being the limiting factor, tools such as these Community Forestry Bonds will be of benefit to all.” Fast action is needed. While deforestation has been balanced by reforestation of agriculture lands in recent decades, the U.S. Forest Service estimates that 23 million acres of forestland will be lost by 2050. There are multiple reasons for this trend, including the still significantly more lucrative residential and commercial real estate market, tax policy, global competition, loss of mill infrastructure and changing inter-generational demographics. “The Bible says we shall reap what we sow and this legislation will enable nonprofit organizations to sow forest lands with seeds of conservation and forest management that will protect and preserve forests for generations to come,” Rep. McDermott, a senior Member of the House Ways and Means Committee, said. California's Redwood Forest Foundation's recent acquisition of the Usal Redwood Forest was one community's response to these massive ownership changes. “The Foundation would like to thanks Congressman Thompson for his leadership on this important issue,” said Art Harwood, Executive Director of the Redwood Forest Foundation. “Community Forestry Bonds will provide RFFI and our communities with a funding tool that will keep our forests working for the economic, environmental and social attributes they provide”. The bill is supported by an unusual coalition among conservation, timber and financial interests and simply modifies the tax code to allow municipal revenue bonds to be issued on behalf of a organizations like RFFI to purchase tracts of land. Such acquisition protects the land from development and fragmentation while allowing jobs that depend on harvesting to continue. ###
07.22.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement upon the House's passage of PAYGO legislation: “Today we passed legislation that will establish in law the principle that our country should pay for what it buys. I've been an advocate for Pay-as-you-go legislation, also known as PAYGO, since I was elected to Congress. It just makes sense- we shouldn't spend more money than we have. “PAYGO has a long history of success- in the 1990s it helped generate record surpluses. However, when the Clinton Administration left office, PAYGO was allowed to expire by the new Administration. As a result, the record surpluses were wiped out. “We need to restore common sense to the federal government. While PAYGO is not a cure-all for deficits, it is a crucial first step toward reducing them. It puts our nation on the road back to fiscal responsibility and restoring our nation's fiscal health. “And, to make sure that future Administration's can't change the PAYGO policy midstream, today we voted to enact PAYGO into law.”
07.21.2009	Over 10,100 people participated in Monday night's telephone town hall, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced today. The majority of callers had questions about health care reform. The congressman also fielded questions on climate change, renewable energy, the peripheral canal, and the state of our economy. “It was great to hear from so many people and have a chance to talk about the issues facing our country,” said Congressman Thompson. “While I didn't have a chance to get to everyone's question, it was an important opportunity for me to hear from constituents about what's important to them. People are understandably concerned about their access to quality, affordable health care, and I'll continue to keep my constituent's feedback in mind as Congress fine-tunes its reform legislation.” Congressman Thompson will respond in writing to 565 voicemails left by participants after the call that were not able to ask their question during the hour long forum.
07.10.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) joined 265 of his colleagues in voting for the Agriculture Appropriations Act. This bill will help protect Americans' food safety, boost rural economies, protect Americans against price fluctuations for necessities and help feed struggling families. In this bill, Congressman Thompson secured $27 million in funding for several agricultural research projects that are important to our district. Included in the bill was $24.5 million to fight Pierce's disease, a major threat to California agriculture that has spread to other states. In the late 1990's, this disease was responsible for the complete destruction of more than 1,000 acres of grapevines in Temecula. This funding will be allocated to plant inspection programs and viticulture research institutions. “We cannot let up in the fight against Pierce's disease, and its vector, the glassy winged sharpshooter,” said Congressman Thompson. “Our local economy, from the tourist industry to the farming community, would be devastated if Pierce's disease spread throughout our district. And while we've made progress, recent events underscore the need for aggressive actions. Glassy winged sharp shooter eggs were found on plants shipped to Napa and Sonoma Counties. We can't rest in our fight against this disease.” “Pierce's Disease could be more devastating than Phyloxxera in that we have no cure much less an environmentally acceptable cure as we did with Phyloxxera. With Phyloxxera we could replace rootstocks. The only available remedy for Pierce's today is some chemical toxin,” said Andy Beckstoffer. “Pierce's disease is a game-ender,” said vintner Bill Bartolucci. “There are already areas that have been wiped out- there are areas down by the river in Napa where they can't grow vines because of this disease. If we don't nip it in the bud, there won't be a single vine left. And if that happens, the economic impact to our area will be devastating.” Richard Rominger, Yolo County farmer and former Deputy Secretary of the USDA also spoke out on the need to contain the disease. “We must stop Pierce's disease before it takes out every vine in our area,” said Rominger. “If we don't act now, the economic consequences of this disease could devastate our local economy. Grapes are an important part of our economy in California and in this district.” “I applaud Congress for passing this bill, because it's extremely important to our industry,” said Ron Bartolucci, of Bartolucci Vineyards. “The glassy winged sharpshooter infects grape vines with a very devastating disease, Pierce's disease, and the funding that will be available to control that insect, and provide necessary funding for research to resolve the problem will be very important to our industry, and our industry's future, because without it, it could devastate us.” The bill also contained $2.15 million in funding for Sudden Oak Death, Research and Control. Sudden Oak Death is a fungus-like pathogen that has decimated oak trees, and can even infect other plant species like our prized Redwood trees. This disease has stricken at least 12 of California's counties and has spread to the Pacific Northwest. This funding will be allocated to the research, eradication and control of this pathogen.
06.16.2009	Op-Ed by Congressman Mike Thompson Congress must act quickly to pass health care reform- the bottom line is- we can't wait any longer. Across our country, 14,000 Americans are losing their health care coverage every day, joining the 46 million who aren't covered by health insurance. I'm as worried as anyone about how we're going to pay for this overhaul. But the cost of doing nothing is even greater. We must address the lack of access, and the crippling cost of health care that is hurting our families and our economy. The United States now spends twice as much per capita on health care than almost any other nation, and our outcomes are worse. Spending on doctors, hospitals, drugs, and other health care costs now consumes more than one of every six dollars we earn- that's approaching 20 percent of our country's GDP. The growing costs to employers, estimated at 5 percent in 2008, have forced many businesses to cut back on benefits. It is even worse now during tough economic times. Before the economic downturn, 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies in 2007 were the result of unaffordable medical bills. What's astounding is that three-fourths of those debtors had health insurance. According to the numbers alone, our system is broken. But the health care issue is about much more than just numbers. I've heard from countless folks in our district who can't afford healthcare, or are struggling to come up with the money to pay their rising premiums. One constituent likened her health care bills to a second mortgage. Her middle class family has been paying nearly $15,000 a year for health coverage, which is not uncommon. She's had to cut back on paying for other things in order to afford to keep her family insured. Her story - and others across our district - underscore the need to act quickly to make sure that all families have affordable access to the care they need. There is widespread agreement that something must be done. But as is usually the case when making public policy, the devil is in the details. Changing our health care system will be very difficult, and much compromise will be necessary. No one will get everything they want and after it is done there will be more reform to do. The American people want healthcare reform, but at the same time are afraid of losing what they already have (if they already have healthcare coverage). They want access to quality healthcare but are most concerned with being able to afford it. Of those who have insurance, few are interested in shifting from an insurance industry bureaucracy to a government bureaucracy. We need to make sure that people who are happy with the coverage they have can keep it. We need to make sure that the American people will be able to keep their doctors, and have a say in their health care decisions. But we must expand the options, so that Americans who don't like their plan, or don't have health care coverage, have a choice. And we can't afford to wait for an arbitrary “trigger” to be pulled to put this reform into operation. If that is part of the bill, reform will likely never happen. A public plan that provides true competition will be an important part of this reform. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a widely respected non-profit health policy research foundation, nearly two thirds of Americans agree with me that we need to make sure that all Americans have access to affordable health care by providing an alternative to the private insurance options that are on the market. We must ensure that every American has health care coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and that we have adequate protections in place for the doctor-patient relationship. And we must also make sure that people can keep their coverage if they change jobs, get divorced, or their employer changes their options. By streamlining health care, reducing fraud and abuse, ending unnecessary testing, discouraging overutilization, investing in smart reforms, and emphasizing preventive health care, we can significantly bring down the cost of health care. In addition to working for these changes, I'll also push to expand access to telemedicine, which provides easier access to health care for people in underserved communities. We can also make significant cost savings by encouraging more collaboration and patient centered care by doctors. Rather than paying doctors for the volume of procedures they perform, we should reward them for keeping patients healthy. Reform won't be easy, but it is urgent that we act now to make sure that all Americans can access quality, affordable health care. For the families in our district, and families across the country who can't afford to go to the doctor, or can't afford the medicine they've been prescribed, it's more urgent than ever that we reform our broken health care system as quickly as possible.
05.06.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced legislation to protect our nation's children from preventable illnesses, which he believes will help save lives and reduce health care costs. The bill requires individual and group insurers, employee benefit plans, and health savings accounts to cover preventive benefits for children without copayments or deductibles. “My bill would ensure that all kids will be able to go to the doctor for the kinds of preventive check-ups that keep kids healthy and cut health care costs by reducing the need for extended hospitalization and more expensive treatments,” said Congressman Thompson. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends preventive care measures for children including immunizations, newborn and infant examinations, and early screening for medical conditions and illnesses. However, health plans do not uniformly cover such preventive services. For example, one in four Americans with employer-sponsored insurance do not have coverage for regular infant and toddler check-ups. Similarly, one in five employer health care plans do not cover childhood immunizations. “As families struggle to make ends meet in this deepening recession, the last thing they should have to worry about is whether they can afford to bring their children to the doctor for regular preventive-check ups,” said Ron Pollack, Executive Director of Families USA. “Every child deserves a healthy and safe start to life, and Congressman Thompson's bill would make this a reality by requiring health care plans to cover preventive care for children. This legislation would make it more affordable for families to bring their children to the doctor by eliminating copayments and deductibles for children's preventive care services.” While some states mandate coverage of certain preventive services, there is no national policy that guarantees children access to necessary preventive care. While in the California State Senate, Congressman Thompson successfully passed legislation that requires many health care plans to cover preventive care for children. Congressman Thompson's new bill would further extend and expand this benefit, and eliminate copayments and deductibles for this type of care.
04.24.2009	Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA), Bart Stupak (D-MI), Lee Terry (R-NE), and Sam Johnson (R-TX) introduced bipartisan legislation that would significantly increase the availability of telemedicine for all Americans. Currently about 80% of Americans do not have access to telemedicine facilities because of restrictions that limit funding for these types of facilities to rural areas. The “Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act,” (H.R. 2068), would expand Medicare reimbursement to urban and suburban areas and include more facilities. It will also allow doctors to monitor patients remotely. “As healthcare becomes more expensive, we need to use smart innovations such as telemedicine technology to help lower costs and expand access for all Americans,” said Congressman Thompson. “Allowing doctors to remotely monitor a patient who has congestive heart failure not only helps the patient stay healthy, it also reduces costly visits to the emergency room. The Obama Administration has indicated that telemedicine will be an important part of their health care reform agenda, and I look forward to working with them to expand access to this important technology.” Telemedicine can help provide better management of chronic diseases, reduce emergency room admissions, and lower healthcare costs. Telemedicine services can also play an important role in addressing the epidemic of physician shortages in rural America by bringing physician specialty services to remote and underserved communities. In addition, faster diagnoses enabled by telemedicine allow patients to get care more quickly. This technology is an important resource, but Medicare reimbursement for telemedicine services is currently limited to rural areas and specific types of health facilities. “Telemedicine is a critical piece to the future of health care,” said Congressman Terry. “By using telemedicine we can increase the efficiency of healthcare while keeping costs down especially to our rural areas of the country.” “Telemedicine has proven its ability to increase the quality of health care while reducing costs,” Congressman Stupak said. “The Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act will bring telemedicine into new settings and expand the pool of Medicare providers eligible to participate in the telehealth program. The demand for telemedicine is only going to increase and it is appropriate that our federal health programs lead the way in effectively and efficiently utilizing these technologies.” “Where you live shouldn't determine the quality of healthcare you receive. Technology has advanced to allow doctors to take care of patients in any location. It's time to modernize Medicare to make it even more accessible,” said Congressman Johnson. The legislation also provides $30 million in grant funding to help health facilities pay for the telehealth equipment and to expand telehealth support services. Last July, Congressman Thompson and Stupak's provisions to expand the types of facilities authorized to provide telehealth care were passed into law as part of the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act. This bill will further expand the type of facilities that are eligible.
04.23.2009	Congressman Denny Rehberg (R-MT-AL) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA-01) today introduced legislation in the U.S. House that would require every soldier to have a face-to-face mental health screening before they are deployed on a combat mission, upon their return, and every six months for two years following their return. The bill is the companion legislation to a measure introduced in the Senate by Senator Max Baucus (D-MT). “The psychological toll that combat takes on our soldiers is not a new phenomenon - it was known as Shell Shock in World War I and by various other names throughout history,” said Rehberg a member of the House Appropriations Committee. “Fortunately, modern medicine can identify and help treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder allowing the men and women who serve our country to put their lives back together. While on the Appropriations Committee, I have fought for PTSD treatment funding, but money can only solve part of the problem. Soldiers need in-person treatment to ensure that no one falls through the cracks.” “At least one in five new veterans are experiencing symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or major depression, but there isn't a system in place that can adequately address this crisis,” said Congressman Thompson. “This legislation will fill this void. It is a practical solution and has already been successfully tested in the field. We owe it to our brave men and women serving our country to make sure that they get the services they have earned, and I will do all I can do to get this bill passed into law.” The Post-Deployment Health Assessment Act of 2009 creates new requirements for identification of PTSD among soldiers. Prior to deployment, a soldier would be interviewed in order to establish a baseline against which a subsequent interview upon return from a combat theater could be measured. By requiring these interviews to be timely and personal, the likelihood of identifying PTSD in order to begin treatment is dramatically increased. “This legislation's intensive face-to-face screening program will provide the military with a powerful tool to help our injured heroes get help for their post-traumatic stress injuries,” said Matt Kuntz, Montana's executive director of The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). “Congressman Rehberg's leadership is critical because he is in position to build a bipartisan coalition to help stop our military's suicide epidemic.”
04.22.2009	Today, Representative Mike Thompson (D-North Coast) introduced bipartisan legislation to protect and restore the healthiest remaining wild Pacific salmon ecosystems in North America. A companion bill was introduced earlier this month by Senators Maria Cantwell (D-WA) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), with co-sponsorship from the entire West Coast Senate delegation. “Research shows that it's far more cost effective to preserve a species by supporting healthy ecosystems than by trying to intervene after the damage has already been done,” said Congressman Thompson. “Salmon have been an important part of our North Coast economy for a long time, and we need to use all available tools to help the fish population grow so that our environment will be restored and our fishing families can prosper.” The Pacific Salmon Stronghold Conservation Act will target healthy salmon ecosystems as a complement to traditional salmon recovery programs. The bill will authorize $15 million each to the National Marine Fisheries Service and Fish & Wildlife Service for the years 2009-2013 to fund projects that protect and restore critical spawning habitats. The bill currently has 7 cosponsors. “Through Congressman Thompson's leadership, the U.S. will have a more comprehensive and strategic approach to protecting wild salmon populations,” said Greg Block, Vice President for Conservation at the Wild Salmon Center. “This bill recognizes that while we must continue to invest in recovery, in the face of increasing development and climate change, it is also critical to ensure that we maintain watersheds that are currently functioning and productive.” In 2002, disastrous water decisions killed off over 80,000 adult salmon. Last year's salmon season in California was cancelled, and the Pacific Fishery Management Council has recommended that this year's season be closed as well. California Department of Fish and Game estimates that this could cost California's economy $279 million and almost 2,700 jobs. “Wild salmon and steelhead mean so much, to so many people, in so many parts of the West. Forging these partnerships for bold action is exactly what we need to do to provide a solid foundation for region-wide recovery as we progress in our efforts to restore degraded watersheds," said Chuck Bonham, California Director at Trout Unlimited. “It is good for land and water conservation and restoration; good for people and businesses; and, definitely good for wild salmon and steelhead." "This partnership will allow all the Pacific States to identify and protect the healthiest watersheds and salmon populations across the West Coast,” said Kevin Shaffer, Native Fishes Program Manager for the Fisheries Branch of California Department of Fish & Game. “California looks forward to contributing to this vital effort to conserve our salmon fisheries." "Protecting the last intact salmon habitats and their natural spawning populations is essential as we work to restore the historically high producing, but now damaged, salmon rivers in the Columbia/ Snake, Klamath/Trinity and Sacramento/San Joaquin systems," said Glen Spain, Northwest Director for the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations. "Preserving the strongholds is integral to rebuilding the Pacific Coast's great salmon runs and with them the jobs and food production these fish represent." Representative Mike Simpson (R-ID) is the lead Republican cosponsor.
04.21.2009	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA01) launched an interactive Google Map on his web site (https://mikethompson.house.gov/) to highlight the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 at work in our district. The map reflects funding that has been announced to date, and it will be updated continuously. “This is a great way to track where the stimulus money is making a difference in our communities,” said Congressman Thompson. “So far, we've learned of nearly $80 million that will go to important projects all across our district, and we'll continue to update our web site to keep everyone informed. By making the funding process as open and transparent as possible, we can all track how the American people's money is being spent to jumpstart our economy and put folks back to work.” Congressman Thompson has also created a guide to grants that are available from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for local government agencies and non-profits that is available on his website at: https://mikethompson.house.gov/issues/ARRA%20Guidebook%20Custom.pdf. This guide will also be continuously updated as more information becomes available. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act is a comprehensive economic recovery package designed to jumpstart the economy, provide tax benefits for families and small businesses, and invest in infrastructure and innovation. Developed with the Obama Administration, this package will create an estimated 3.5 million new jobs, give 95 percent of working families an immediate tax cut, shore up the nation's aging infrastructure and help our country shift to green energy technology. The stimulus measure is expected to provide $31-35 billion for California to build roads and bridges, and upgrade schools, and is expected to create or save nearly 400,000 jobs in our state, the most in the country, and 8,000 jobs in our district. Congressman Thompson helped draft key energy tax provisions of the bill and voted in favor of the legislation.
03.31.2009	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced a bill that will aid in the protection of thousands of acres of our nation's shrinking agricultural lands and open space. The bill will permanently allow landowners to get significant tax deductions if they place a conservation easement on their property. These conservation easements allow property owners to continue using the land, while protecting the land from future development. “We've seen a fifty percent increase in conservation easements since Congress passed my provisions to enhance these tax benefits on a temporary basis in 2006,” said Congressman Thompson. “If current development trends continue in California, another two million acres will be paved over by 2050. It's time we made these protections permanent. By making sure that landowners can count on this program, we'll take a big step forward in preserving our agricultural lands and open spaces.” When landowners donate a conservation easement, they maintain ownership and management of the land and can pass the land on to their heirs, while forgoing their rights to develop the land in the future. Conservation easements have historically been an effective tool for protecting farmland and open space, and Thompson anticipates this bill will enable more farmers and other property owners to conserve their land. The bill enjoys broad support from a grassroots coalition of farmers, and conservationists. The tax provisions allow property owners to get a deduction of up to100% of their adjusted gross income for fifteen years. These tax provisions have a long record of success. In August 2006, Congress passed provisions written by Congressman Thompson that enhanced the tax incentive for the donation of conservation easements by allowing landowners to deduct a larger share of their income over a longer period of time. With these enhanced tax provisions, 535,000 more acres were put into trusts in the last two years, according to a survey by the Land Trust Alliance. The first land protected by Congressman Thompson's provisions were in California's 1st District. Andy Beckstoffer of Beckstoffer Vineyards gave a conservation easement on 89 acres of the historic To Kalon vineyard in Oakville, California, just five days after the measure was signed into law. The new bill currently has 93 cosponsors. Congressman Thompson is a member of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over all tax measures in Congress.
03.30.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson is pleased to announce the annual Congressional Art Competition. He invites all high school students in the First Congressional District to submit their original artwork for consideration. The winner's artwork will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol Building for one year. In addition, the winner will be invited to a ceremony in Washington, D.C. this June and will receive three roundtrip airline tickets to Washington from either San Francisco or Oakland. “Every year I look forward to seeing the creativity and inspiration of the artwork that is submitted from our district,” said Thompson. “Our district's students are immensely talented, and I encourage all of our high-school aged artists to submit a piece of their work.” The competition is open to high school students only and each student is allowed a single entry in the competition. The categories for submission include painting, drawing, collage, prints, mixed media, computer-generated art and photography, and the pieces must be no larger than 30” by 30”, including the frame. Submissions must be delivered to Thompson's district offices. Before delivering a submission or to receive more information, students or teachers are encouraged to call their local district office. In Napa, Lake, and Sonoma County that number is: (707) 226-9898. In Del Norte and Humboldt County, the number is (707) 269-9595. In Mendocino County, the phone number is: (707) 962-0933, and in Yolo County, the number is (530) 662-5272. The deadline for submission is May 1, 2009. The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982, and since then more than 650,000 students have participated. Last year, Sarah Swanlund from Fortuna High in Humboldt won the 1st District's competition.
03.27.2009	After receiving the finalized data, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) reflected on the successful telephone town hall held Wednesday night. Over 9,100 constituents in the First District participated in the town hall. “While telephone town halls are no replacement for in-person events, it was a great opportunity to hear from our community,” said Congressman Thompson. “To see this many people who truly care about our district and our country is inspiring. We are facing some tough times, but the energy and involvement of our district is evidence that the American people will overcome these challenges. I look forward to continuing these discussions with in-person town halls throughout our district.” Due to the extremely high number of participants, Congressman Thompson will respond in writing to the 200 voicemails left by participants after the call that were not able to ask their question during the hour long forum. ###
03.23.2009	On the evening of March 25th, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) will host a live town hall meeting via telephone and he is inviting every resident of the 1st Congressional District to join him. Participants will be able to ask Congressman Thompson about issues that impact the 1st District and our nation and he will respond on-the-spot for all to hear. “In these challenging economic times, I want to make sure that people from across our district can discuss what's on their mind,” said Congressman Thompson. “It's extremely important to me to hear from constituents, and this telephone town hall will be a great chance to talk about the challenges facing our country and what Washington is doing to stabilize our economy and revitalize our communities. I hope everyone will join me on Wednesday night.” More information: What: A toll-free telephone town hall with Congressman Mike Thompson When: Wednesday, March 25th from 7:15 PM to 8:15 PM Pacific Time How to join: When the call starts, dial (877) 229-8493 and enter the passcode 13293. ###
03.19.2009	Today the House of Representatives passed legislation that would impose a stiff penalty on bonuses given by companies such as AIG that received government rescue funds. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) joined a bipartisan group of members voting for H.R. 1586, which passed the House by a vote of 328-93. “It's a slap in the face to tax paying Americans when failing companies spend taxpayer dollars on outrageous bonuses,” said Congressman Thompson. “By closing this loophole, we are fulfilling the promise made to taxpayers that their money wouldn't be spent on executive bonuses.” The legislation passed today by the House will tax bonuses from companies that received $5 billion or more in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds. The bill would impose a 90 percent tax on bonuses paid after December 31, 2008. The tax would also apply to bonuses paid by entities affiliated with these companies. The bill would not affect anyone receiving a bonus with adjusted gross income below $250,000 or employees of companies that have received $5 billion or less in TARP funds. This tax would not apply to any bonus that is returned to the company in the same taxable year that the bonus is paid. “As much as I dislike using the tax code for this purpose, the bonus debacle was an exception I'm willing to make,” said Congressman Thompson. The bill passed today by the House is very similar to legislation written by Congressman Thompson earlier this week. On Tuesday, Congressman Thompson introduced H.R. 1572, the “Taxpayer Protection Act,” which would subject any entity that received assistance under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to a bonus tax rate of 90 percent. Senate leaders have indicated that they will introduce and pass legislation to address this issue soon. ###
03.18.2009	Today the Ways and Means Committee introduced legislation to tax bonuses given by companies such as AIG that received government rescue funds. “It goes against the ideals of capitalism to reward the people that helped create this economic mess,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “It's even more outrageous that taxpayers are footing the bill. Congress should quickly pass this legislation that will effectively eliminate the bonuses being paid out by companies who received help from the government.” The legislation introduced today by the Ways and Means Committee will tax bonuses from companies that received $5 billion or more in TARP funds at 90% for individuals who earn over $250,000 per year. Currently, the IRS withholds 25 percent from bonuses less than $1 million and 35 percent for bonuses more than $1 million dollars. House leaders have indicated that passing legislation to address the bonuses will be a high priority for Congress this week. Yesterday, Congressman Thompson introduced H.R. 1572, the “Taxpayer Protection Act,” which would subject any entity that received assistance under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to a bonus tax rate of 90 percent, with no exemptions. Congressman Thompson is a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over all tax-related matters coming before Congress. ###
03.17.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) introduced the “Taxpayer Protection Act,” which would impose a 90 percent tax on all bonuses paid by businesses such as AIG that received rescue money from the government. “It's outrageous that some of the same bankers who helped create this economic mess are now going to be rewarded for their failures with taxpayer dollars,” said Congressman Thompson. “By taxing all bonuses paid out by companies that received money to help them stay afloat, we'll send a message to these folks that business as usual is no longer acceptable. I would prefer to tax these bonuses at 100% but that level is considered confiscatory and doesn't pass legal muster.” Currently, the IRS withholds 25 percent from bonuses less than $1 million and 35 percent for bonuses more than $1 million dollars. Under Congressman Thompson's legislation, any entity that received assistance under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 would be subject to a bonus tax rate of 90 percent. Congressman Thompson is a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over all tax-related matters coming before Congress.
03.17.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) warned homeowners to avoid scams that offer phony promises to pay off loans or charge high fees for non-essential services to homeowners looking to avoid foreclosure. The Congressman urged constituents to contact a free local government-approved housing counseling agency instead of companies that charge money for foreclosure assistance. “As more families struggle to pay their mortgages, predators are trying to take advantage of people who don't know where to turn for help,” said Congressman Thompson. “There are resources out there to help people stay in their homes, and I urge folks who are struggling to contact government-backed organizations for assistance.” Families facing foreclosure can get free assistance from agencies that have been approved by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Treasury. A list of these organizations can be found at: https://www.hud.gov/offices/hsg/sfh/hcc/hcs.cfm?webListAction=search&searchstate=CA or by calling toll free (800) 569-4287 on weekdays between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (6:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time) or call 1-800-CALL-FHA. Congressman Thompson also warned people that some scammers are using names and websites that use variations of HUD's name to mislead people, and urged constituents to call his district office if they are suspicious about an offer that seems too good to be true. He reminded homeowners that the only official HUD website is at www.hud.gov and sites that end in hud.us-gov or hud.com or hudgov.us or any of a number of other addresses are not official HUD websites. ###
02.25.2009	Today, the House of Representatives passed an omnibus spending bill that will provide continued funding for governmental programs through the end of fiscal year 2009. In this bill, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson secured $1.6 million for Crescent City Harbor Dredging. “Dredging the harbor must happen both to create economic opportunities and provide basic safety,” said Congressman Thompson. “Right now the federal channel is silted in and in a low-tide boats have difficulty going in and out of the Harbor. It impedes Coast Guard emergency response time and threatens access to fueling docks. Dredging the harbor is critical for Crescent City and is a boost to Del Norte County, and I'm proud this funding will finally get the job done.” “Congressman Thompson pledged to help us secure the funds that were necessary. We are thrilled that he has delivered, and by the opportunity this funding presents. Dredging the federal channel is vital for the fishing industry and our local economy,” said Crescent City Harbormaster, Richard Young. The federal channel in the Crescent City Harbor provides the only access from the harbor to the Pacific Ocean. Periodic maintenance dredging is required to keep the channel open. Every vessel entering Crescent City, including the local Coast Guard cutter, commercial fishing vessels, recreational boats, and transient vessels seeking safe harbor, depend on the federal channel for safe access to the harbor. The federal channel was last dredged in early 2000 and nearly one-third of the channel has since become filled with silt deposits. In 2007, a vessel ran aground in the channel and unless the dredging takes place soon, this type of incident will become more frequent. ###
02.25.2009	Today, the House of Representatives passed an omnibus spending bill that will provide continued funding for governmental programs through the end of fiscal year 2009. In this bill, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) secured $3 million for the West Sacramento Flood Control Project. “We need to rebuild our country and our economy, and investing in infrastructure projects that keep us safe from floods is one of the smartest investments that we can make,” said Thompson. “The 44,000 residents of West Sacramento don't need to be told the importance of flood control projects. And building these levees will create many good paying jobs in our community.” The Sacramento urban area is widely recognized as being the most vulnerable to flooding of any urbanized area in the country with the exception of New Orleans. Five years ago, the Army Corps of Engineers planned, designed and constructed a project to provide the city flood protection. However, certain areas of the project have failed to perform during winter conditions and must be improved. In addition to this funding, Congressman Thompson successfully advocated for $4.6 billion in emergency funding for the Army Corps of Engineers that was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed into law by President Obama last week. That money has yet to be disbursed, and will be distributed to Army Corps Projects shortly. ###
02.25.2009	Today the House of Representatives passed an omnibus spending bill that will provide continued funding for governmental programs through the end of fiscal year 2009. In this bill, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) secured $10.5 million for the Napa River Project, and additional money for other projects important to Napa County. “Investing in smart infrastructure projects like the Napa River is one of the best ways we can keep good jobs in our communities and invest in our future,” said Thompson. “We've learned the hard way in Napa that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and I'll continue to fight for funding for this project to make sure that our homes and businesses are kept safe.” The funding for the project was $1.1 million over President Bush's budget request. In FY 2008, Congressman Thompson secured $10.8 million for the Napa Flood Project, which was $3.3 million above the President's budget request. To date, Congressman Thompson has successfully increased funding over the President's budget for this project by $28.3 million. Last year, President Bush refused to work with Congress to come up with a compromise to pass a budget for 2009. The spending bill passed by the House today now heads to the Senate, and is expected to be signed into law shortly after passage in the Senate. In addition to this funding, Congressman Thompson successfully worked for $4.6 billion in emergency funding for the Army Corps of Engineers that was included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed into law by President Obama last week. The Napa River Project is one of the projects that will be considered for this funding. Congressman Thompson also secured funding for the following projects that are important to Napa County, including: $24.5 million for Pierce's Disease, Research and Control - Pierce's Disease is a harmful plant virus that is spread by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. In the late 1990's, this pest was responsible for the complete destruction of more than 1,000 acres of grapevines in Temecula that cost growers and the California economy tens of millions of dollars. This funding will be allocated to plant inspection programs and viticulture research institutions. $5.3 million for Sudden Oak Death, Research and Control - Sudden Oak Death is a fungus-like pathogen that has decimated oak trees, and can even infect other plant species like our prized Redwood trees. This disease has stricken at least 12 of California's counties and has spread to the Pacific Northwest. This funding will be allocated to the research, eradication and control of this pathogen. $218,000 for Olive Fruit Fly, Research and Control - The Olive Fruit Fly is the world's most disastrous olive pest and has infested thousands of acres of California's olive groves, jeopardizing the state's vital olive oil and table olive industries. ###
02.17.2009	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) was re-appointed Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence for the 111th Congress. Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes (D-TX) announced the subcommittee assignments. Thompson will also serve on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. “I am honored that my colleagues trust me to help ensure our nation has the best intelligence programs in the world and that we are using our capabilities effectively and responsibly,” said Thompson. “The men and women who serve our country by gathering intelligence are one of our nation's best assets, and I look forward to assisting their efforts.” "Mike Thompson led active oversight efforts as a subcommittee chairman in the 110th Congress, and I am pleased that he will repeat this role again,” said Chairman Reyes. “As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, his efforts are critical to ensuring that the men and women of the Intelligence Community receive the resources and authorities that they need to keep the country safe.” This is Congressman Thompson's second term as Chair of the subcommittee. As chairman, Thompson will direct hearings, investigations and legislative initiatives under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. The subcommittee authorizes the budgets and activities of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the national security elements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the intelligence elements of the Departments of State, Energy, Treasury, and Homeland Security. “Securing peace and stability around the world cannot be done without effective intelligence gathering,” said Congressman Thompson. “My belief in the power of good intelligence to create a world without terrorism has only been strengthened by my experience on this Committee. We must continue to work for a world where intelligence is our best weapon, and war is our last resort.” Thompson, a Vietnam combat veteran, served on the House Committee on Armed Services from 1998 until 2002. He was appointed to the Committee on Ways and Means in the 109th Congress, where he currently serves on the Health and Select Revenue Measures subcommittees. ###
02.14.2009	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) publicly called for an end to the president's dangerous escalation of the Iraq War and a firm timetable for a phased redeployment of U.S. troops out of Iraq. During a speech on the House floor, Thompson urged his colleagues to support H Con Res 63. This bill expresses Congress' states of the president's decision to send more than 20,000 additional U.S. combat troops into Iraq and Congress' continued support for the men and women serving in Iraq. Thompson also spoke in support of a bill he recently introduced (HR 787), which calls for redeployment to begin on May 1st, with all combat brigades out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. Leaders of the House provided each Representative the opportunity to voice their opinion on the Iraq War this week. Thompson was one of 11 veterans who spoke against the president's escalation. Debate of H Con Res 63 will continue throughout the week, resulting in a vote on Friday. Below please find a transcript of Mr. Thompson's remarks. “Mr. Speaker. As a combat veteran, from the bottom of my heart, I say thank you to the brave men and women who have served in Iraq, each with great distinction. Our troops have done an outstanding job. They have done all that we asked of them and more. They have performed with the utmost professionalism, making us all very proud.” “I believe it is past time that we start bringing these brave men and women home. They should be home with their families, not in the middle of Iraq's civil war. Moreover, we shouldn't be sending more of our troops into Iraq's civil war. Some of our service members have been on two, three and even four tours of duty in Iraq.” “This escalation would put too much of a strain on our military, and not just our troops. Much of our military's equipment is damaged, and it will take years and billions of dollars to repair and replace it. Nearly every Reserve and National Guard member has been mobilized. This escalation is in no one's best interest.” “Two weeks ago, I joined with my colleague Patrick Murphy from Pennsylvania - a decorated Army Captain who served in Iraq - to introduce binding legislation to begin a phased redeployment of our troops out of Iraq.” “Our bill, which has already attracted 20 co-authors from both sides of the aisle and has a companion bill in the Senate, provides a practical and comprehensive strategy for ending our military involvement in Iraq. It sets a firm deadline for phased redeployment of our troops beginning May 1, with all combat brigades out by March 31, 2008. It provides a concrete plan for shifting security responsibilities to where they belong - with the Iraqis.” “I've visited with our troops in Iraq and talked to the men and women who have been training the Iraqi security forces. They've told me that the U.S. troops have finished their job. The Iraqis need to step up and start securing their country. Americans cannot continue to do it for them.” “Our bill recognizes that the president's escalation plan is a continuation of his failed â€˜stay the course' slogan and it would not allow the increase troops levels without congressional approval.” “Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot win the peace in Iraq. The Iraqis must be the ones to do that. Our bill recognizes this reality and creates a surge in diplomacy, not troops, by creating a special U.S. envoy that will help build relationships between Iraq and their neighbors.” “This bill is a strategy for success in Iraq and is the best way to bring our brave men and women home as quickly and safely as possible.” “While I strongly believe we should be debating and passing our binding solution, HR 787, I know that this week's debate is the first real debate we've had on Iraq in more than four years. In this week alone, we will more than quadruple the amount of time given to debate of this war since it began. Thank you, Speaker Pelosi, for bringing this important matter to the floor. This resolution is a critical step in getting our men and women out of this ugly mess - a full-blown civil war - in Iraq.” “I support today's resolution, which joins with the American people in sending the president a loud and clear message that escalation is not the answer. We need to focus on getting our troops out of Iraq as safely and quickly as possible and make sure that the Iraqis step up and assume the security responsibilities for their country.” “I also rise to tell those who have served, those who are serving in Iraq today and their proud families, thank you. Your nation thanks you for your great service to our country.”
02.13.2009	Today the House of Representatives passed The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1), a comprehensive economic recovery package designed to jumpstart the economy, provide tax benefits for families and small businesses, and invest in infrastructure and innovation. Developed with the Obama Administration, this package will create 3.5 million new jobs, give 95 percent of working families an immediate tax cut, shore up the nation's aging infrastructure and help our country shift to green energy technology. The stimulus measure is expected to pour $26 billion into California to build roads and bridges, and upgrade schools, and would create nearly 400,000 jobs in the state, the most in the country. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) helped draft key energy tax provisions of the bill and voted in favor of the legislation, which passed the House by a vote of 246 to 183 and is expected to pass the Senate later today. “This legislation will save or create 8,000 jobs in our district at a time when we really need them,” said Congressman Thompson. “From one end of the district to the other, families are really struggling, and this legislation will make an immediate impact on their lives by cutting taxes, investing in our schools, roads and bridges, and keeping our police and fire stations open. With these targeted investments, we'll put people to work quickly and make our country more competitive over the long term.” H.R. 1 includes $287 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and $502 billion in carefully targeted investments in infrastructure, education, clean energy and healthcare. The legislation also includes key provisions to ensure that rural communities are not left behind and receive their fair share of assistance. Some of the key job creating provisions of H.R.1 include: - $110 billion to repair and modernize roads, bridges, transit and waterways, including $4.6 billion requested by Congressman Thompson for the Army Corps of Engineers; - $116 billion for a Making Work Pay tax credit which will cut taxes for more than 95% of working families; - $20 billion in targeted tax cuts for American businesses, large and small, to spur job creation; - $50 billion in new funding and tax incentives to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas through clean, renewable technologies; and, - $7.2 billion to expand broadband internet access in rural and underserved areas; and - An unprecedented level of transparency, oversight and accountability to ensure our tax dollars are spent wisely. Congressman Thompson was able to secure several key provisions in the final stimulus bill that will make crucial investments in green energy technology and led efforts to provide critical funding for the Corps of Engineers. Under provisions authored by Congressman Thompson, state and local governments will be able to more easily finance the purchase of solar systems and will have access to $2.4 billion in new energy conservation bonds to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Congressman Thompson also authored key provisions to establish a new investment tax credit for facilities to manufacture green technologies in America rather than shipping those manufacturing jobs overseas. Additionally, the Thompson provisions will provide grants to incentivize businesses to invest in renewable technology today, rather than waiting until the economy improves. “Creating good jobs here at home that will also help shift our country towards energy independence is one of the best investments we can make,” said Congressman Thompson. “By encouraging the manufacturing of alternative energy technology and making it easier for consumers to use it, we are not only putting our economy back on track but we are also positioning ourselves to be a world leader in innovation and green energy.” The Senate is expected to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act later today, and President Obama has indicated he will sign it into law as soon as possible.

02.04.2009	Today President Barack Obama signed legislation into law that will provide health care to 11 million children from working families. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) was invited and attended the ceremony at the White House. “Today change came to America as our country took the first major step towards reducing the number of children who don't have health insurance,” said Congressman Thompson. “The State Children's Health Insurance Program has been an extraordinary success- over 1.5 million children in California get their health care through this program. However, over a million and a quarter kids are still uninsured in our state alone- which is just plain wrong.” “By signing this bipartisan bill into law, almost 700,000 uninsured children in California and 4 million uninsured children across the country will now have access to health care. Our children deserve a healthy start and this legislation gives kids that chance.” The State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) was created in 1997 to provide health care coverage for children in families that earn too little to afford health insurance for their children but too much to qualify for Medicaid. The bill signed by the President today reauthorizes SCHIP through 2013 and preserves the coverage for all 7.1 million children currently covered by SCHIP, including 1,538,416 children in California. The bill also extends health care coverage to 4.1 million additional low-income children, who are currently uninsured. The bill is fully paid for. "Today is a victory for children, not only in Napa County, but throughout the nation. The expansion of SCHIP is a great booster shot towards broader healthcare reform,” said Mark Diel, Executive Director of the Children's Health Initiative in Napa County. “Mike Thompson has been a steadfast advocate on behalf of our children and this will help secure health insurance coverage for almost 4,000 children in Napa County." "Ensuring that every child in this country has access to affordable health care is critical to the health of individual children, their families and our community as a whole. Today's signing of the SCHIP expansion is an important step in that direction," said Dr. Mary Maddux-Gonzalez, the Sonoma County Health Officer. “Every year health care has just become more expensive, and we've had to cut back on paying for other things in order to afford to keep our family insured,” said Candy Sugarman of Hopland, whose middle class family has been paying nearly $15,000 a year for health coverage. “Paying for health care has become like paying a second mortgage. This is such a great program and I'm thrilled that our family can take part, and I really hope that some day this same kind of affordable coverage will be available for our entire family.” “Passage of SCHIP will result in hundreds of children in Lake County getting the healthcare they need and deserve,” said Gloria Flaherty, Executive Director of the Lake Family Resource Center. “This will mean healthier children, families, and communities- and peace of mind for parents. We are proud of our Congressman for his continued support and dedication to this cause, our President, for making children's health a priority, and our country for recognizing that children's health is important to all.” “This is great news for the Humboldt County families who are struggling to provide health insurance for their children. Since the Humboldt County Children's Health Initiative started in 2006, we've signed up approximately 1,500 children who would probably otherwise be without health insurance. In this challenging economy with layoffs looming, it is more important than ever for families to have access to low-cost health insurance,” said Alexandra Wineland, Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Branch director. “This is a wonderful day for Yolo County children,” said Yolo County Supervisor Helen M. Thomson. “Since the President has signed this bill, we will be able to continue to provide health insurance to our children and to bring in many more children who currently have no health care. Thank you Congressman Thompson, for all of your work on behalf of our children.” This bipartisan bill has been endorsed by dozens of organizations, representing millions of Americans - ranging from business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses and Business Roundtable to the American Hospital Association, AARP and Families USA. ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
01.28.2009	The House of Representatives voted today in support of a comprehensive economic recovery package to provide funding for a major infrastructure spending program and tax benefits targeted at individuals and small businesses. Developed with the Obama Administration, this job creating package will rebuild America, give 95 percent of working families an immediate tax cut, and invest quickly in the economy. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) helped draft key provisions of the bill and voted in favor of the legislation, which passed the House by a vote of 244 to 188. “There isn't a day that goes by without new signs that our economy is grinding to a halt,” said Congressman Thompson. “This bill provides desperately needed funding and tax relief to help working families cope with these challenging times. By making these critical investments, particularly in rural communities like those in our district, we are not only putting people to work in the short run, but also strengthening our economy for the long haul.” H.R. 1 includes $275 billion in tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and $550 billion in carefully targeted investments in infrastructure, education, clean energy and healthcare. California alone will receive a minimum of $32 billion in recovery funds in addition to the billions of dollars in tax cuts that will flow to citizens of the state. Independent economist Mark Zandi estimates that this will save or create over 800,000 jobs in California. The legislation also includes key provisions to ensure that rural communities are not left behind and receive their fair share of assistance. Some of the key job creating provisions of H.R. 1 include: - $90 billion to repair and modernize roads, bridges, transit and waterways, including $4.5 billion requested by Congressman Thompson for the Army Corps of Engineers; - $145 billion for a Making Work Pay tax credit which will cut taxes for more than 95% of working families; - $20 billion in targeted tax cuts for American businesses, large and small, to spur job creation; - $41 billion for local school districts to repair and upgrade their facilities; - $63 billion for increased food stamps, unemployment benefits, and job training to assist those who have lost their jobs; - $73 billion in new funding and tax incentives to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas, including several alternative energy tax provisions authored by Congressman Thompson that will provide billions of dollars in tax incentives to expand the use of renewable energy; - $6 billion to expand broadband internet access in rural and underserved areas; - An unprecedented level of transparency, oversight and accountability will ensure our tax dollars are spent wisely. During drafting of H.R. 1 in the Ways & Means Committee, Congressman Thompson was able to include key provisions of legislation he authored (HR 546) that will allow state and local governments to help homeowners and businesses more easily finance the purchase of solar systems and provide $2.4 billion in new qualified energy conservation bonds to finance state and local government programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the Thompson provisions will provide grants to incentivize businesses to invest in renewable technology today, rather than waiting until the economy improves. “The solar energy tax provisions I authored will make it easier for businesses and homeowners to have solar panels installed,” said Congressman Thompson. “This has the twin benefits of creating green jobs while at the same time reducing our dependence on foreign oil.” The Senate is expected to consider companion economic recovery legislation next week with the expectation that a House-Senate Conference will be convened the following week to negotiate a final bill. House and Senate leaders have said that they expect to send this legislation to the President by President's Day, February 16th.

01.22.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) re-introduced legislation to grant airline passengers basic rights by ensuring they have access to food, water, and other basic necessities, and preventing passengers from being held indefinitely on planes. Last year, Rep. Thompson was the first member of Congress to introduce passenger rights legislation. “We need to ensure that when passengers set foot on a plane, they will be treated fairly and humanely,” said Congressman Thompson. “This bill will also help airlines develop standards so that they can have a plan in place to deal with extended tarmac delays. Obviously preventing extended delays by improving airport infrastructure and upgrading the air traffic control system needs to happen. But no matter what, we need to make sure that passengers will not be held in uncomfortable and unsafe conditions.” Congressman Thompson's bill, the companion to legislation introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine), would require: - Airlines to provide passengers with food, potable water, comfortable cabin temperature and ventilation, and adequate restrooms while a plane is delayed on the ground. - Passengers be offered the option to safely deplane after sitting on the ground for three hours. This option would be provided every three hours, should the plane continue to sit on the ground. - The creation of a consumer complaint hotline run by the Department of Transportation (DOT) so that passengers can alert the agency about delays. - DOT to review and approve contingency plans developed the airlines. DOT would also be allowed to fine air carriers and airports that do not submit or comply with contingency plans. Last Congress, the Passenger Bill of Rights introduced by Congressman Thompson was included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization passed by the House of Representatives. Similar legislation was included in the Senate version of the FAA reauthorization, but was blocked on the Senate floor.
01.22.2009	The House Committee on Ways and Means voted today in support of a comprehensive economic recovery package to provide tax, health and unemployment relief to families while also encouraging businesses to create new jobs. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) helped draft and voted in favor of the legislation, which passed the Committee by a vote of 24 to 13. The bill includes several alternative energy tax provisions authored by Congressman Thompson. The legislation will now be combined with other components of the recovery package from other House Committees into H.R. 1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for consideration by the full House of Representatives next week. “We need to make sure that working families are getting help through these tough economic times,” said Congressman Thompson. “By providing tax relief and assistance with healthcare costs to working families, and making investments that will create green jobs, we're going to make sure that all Americans will benefit from this recovery package. I will continue to work with my colleagues to make sure that this legislation effectively and efficiently delivers a boost to the economy, so that taxpayers get the most out of their investment in our country's future.” H.R. 598 would also provide tax incentives to businesses to help them expand their payrolls and make broad investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. “Investing in alternative energy is a smart thing to do,” said Congressman Thompson. “For example, the solar energy tax provisions I authored will make it easier for businesses and homeowners to have solar panels installed. This will create green jobs and at the same time reduce our dependence on foreign oil. Not only will this help us in the short term, it will also enhance the long-term security and sustainability of our economy.” The package provides payment incentives to encourage the widespread adoption of Health Information Technology (HIT) to modernize American healthcare, cut red tape, eliminate redundant care and reduce health insurance premiums for millions. At Congressman Thompson's urging, the bill also allows telemedicine facilities to be eligible for grants. At the markup, Congressman Thompson spoke out against an amendment that would have hurt rural doctors' ability to use HIT funding. The amendment was eventually defeated. Congressman Thompson also worked closely with Committee leadership to make sure that rural communities would be guaranteed their fair share of distressed area bonds. These bonds can be issued by cities and counties to help pay for infrastructure projects and job training programs. As a result of Congressman Thompson's advocacy, rural areas with lower populations will not be penalized when funds are distributed by the states. The larger package of recovery provisions that will be considered on the House floor next week include unprecedented accountability requirements. Funds for projects would be distributed through existing formulas to programs with proven track records. How funds are spent, all announcements of contract and grant competitions and awards, and formula grant allocations would be posted on a special website created by the President. This website will include explanations from Governors, mayors or others making funding decisions personally certifying that the investment has been fully vetted and is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars. ###
01.16.2009	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) scorned a draft Bush Administration proposal to open up 2 million acres off the coast of Mendocino for oil exploration in 2014. The “Draft Proposed Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2010-2015” issued by the Minerals Management Service lays out the proposed five year plan for managing oil and gas leasing in the OCS. Under the Bush Administration, the ban on drilling in the OCS expired last year. “As the door closes on the Bush Administration, I'm not surprised that they are pulling one more political stunt,” said Congressman Thompson. “Drilling off our coast would do nothing to end our dependence on foreign oil, and would have no impact on gas prices at the pump. Studies show that there is about 2 billion barrels off of the Mendocino Coast, which would satisfy U.S. demand for oil for less than 100 days. There is simply not enough oil off the coast to justify the risk that drilling poses.” The North Coast of California is home to one of only four upwelling ecosystems in the world. This upwelling system brings nutrient rich water from the ocean floor to the surface and is vital to maintaining the fisheries that support California's $200 million fishing industry. “Despite advances in offshore drilling equipment, oil spills are still a regular occurrence,” said Congressman Thompson. “Even with advanced warning, Hurricanes Rita and Katrina caused 124 oil spills of over 741,000 gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. And the cost for cleanup of these spills is tremendous- when the Cosco Busan freighter spilled in the San Francisco Bay, 50,000 gallons of fuel oiled 50 miles of beaches. Clean-up costs may yet exceed $60 million, averaging out to over $1200 per gallon of fuel spilled. We cannot afford to let that happen.” Last week, Congressman Thompson introduced legislation that would would permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. ###
01.15.2009	Late last night Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced legislation that would encourage state and local governments to help homeowners and small businesses finance the purchase of solar technology. Under current solar tax credit laws, this type of assistance is discouraged because individuals receive a much smaller tax credit if they receive financing help from state or local governments. Thompson's bill will eliminate this penalty, and allow local governments to finance solar programs through tax exempt bonds. “Installing solar panels can cost $20,000 or more for a single home,” said Congressman Thompson. “The high upfront cost stops a lot of people from making this investment, which is hurting the market for solar technology and eliminating good paying green jobs. By helping families finance these investments, we can create thousands of long-term green jobs, and dramatically reduce energy use.” Because of the thousands of green jobs that would be created by increasing the demand for solar technology, Congressman Thompson is encouraging the Obama Administration and Congressional leadership to include his solar energy proposals in any economic stimulus package. The Congressman also cited the leadership of local communities for launching innovative public/private partnerships to encourage solar energy usage. “Our district has been a leader in the solar energy field for a long time, and it's time the federal government caught up,” said Congressman Thompson. “Sonoma County is setting up a program to help finance the purchase of solar panels through revenue bonds, which are repaid over twenty years. By ensuring that the tax code doesn't penalize this type of program, we will make it easier for people to switch to cleaner, greener energy sources.” ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
01.14.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) today joined a majority in the House of Representatives in support of bipartisan legislation to provide health care to 11 million children from working families. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2) was approved by a vote of 289-139. The bill is very similar to the legislation that President Bush vetoed twice in the 110th Congress. In a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives, Congressman Thompson said: “Investing in children's health care is one of the wisest choices our federal government can make. Children have to be healthy to get an education and achieve their full potential as adults. When kids see the doctor more regularly, they receive the preventive services that keep them healthier longer - and they are less likely to end up in the emergency room, which saves everyone money.” “Almost a million and a quarter children in California are uninsured. That is simply not acceptable. In contrast to President Bush's multiple vetoes of similar bills, today - with President-elect Obama's enthusiastic support - the House will vote to provide coverage for 4 million additional children. That is truly change we can believe in.” SCHIP was created in 1997 to provide health care coverage for children in families that earn too little to afford health insurance for their children but too much to qualify for Medicaid. The bill passed today by the House of Representatives reauthorizes SCHIP through 2013 and preserves the coverage for all 7.1 million children currently covered by SCHIP, including 1,538,416 children in California. The bill also extends health care coverage to 4.1 million additional low-income children, who are currently uninsured. The bill is fully paid for. This bipartisan bill has been endorsed by dozens of organizations, representing millions of Americans - ranging from business groups such as the National Federation of Independent Businesses and Business Roundtable to the American Hospital Association, AARP and Families USA. ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
01.14.2009	As Congress readies an economic stimulus plan, Congressman Thompson (D-CA) today spoke out on the necessity of including funding for the Army Corps of Engineers. The Obama Administration's original proposal included no funding for Army Corps projects. “The Army Corps of Engineers oversees many crucial projects in our district and across the country,” said Congressman Thompson. “We must invest in infrastructure projects that will immediately create jobs and lay the foundation for future economic growth, and Corps projects clearly fit those criteria.” The Corps has 282 projects currently under way where their construction capability is under funded by a combined $2.2 billion this year alone. Fully funding this present capability would create hundreds of thousands of jobs across the country in a short period of time. Congressman Thompson raised the issue with Congressional Leadership last week in a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and vowed to continue to advocate for Army Corps of Engineers funding. “Not only are these projects a great opportunity to create good paying jobs quickly, we also need to recognize the cost should we fail to invest in the levies and flood control projects the Corps helps to build. For example, if the levies in the Sacramento Delta were to break, entire towns would be underwater and 63% of Californians would be without drinking water. The longer we wait to address these security threats, the higher the cost will be, both in terms of dollars and in terms of lives. I will continue to work with the Obama Administration and Congressional leadership to make sure that the Army Corps of Engineers receive funding in the stimulus package.” ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
01.12.2009	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall (D-W.Va.), Science and Technology Committee Chairman Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.), and Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Bob Filner (D-CA), along with 29 of their colleagues, sent a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Minority Leader John Boehner (R-OH) late Friday urging them to ensure that rural areas receive an equitable share of any economic stimulus package. “People across this country are struggling to pay their mortgages and afford rising health care costs, but rural communities are being hit even harder by the tough economy,” said Congressman Thompson. “Congress must ensure that America's rural areas receive their fair share of any economic stimulus package by investing in the highways, bridges, and other infrastructure that are the arteries of our country's economy. America cannot be restored to greatness without the help of all Americans, not just those in urban areas.” "Throughout rural Appalachia, successful public-private partnerships are thriving from small seed monies. Rural America can prosper from the sparks of funding a stimulus bill can ignite for long range job development and sustainability. The upcoming stimulus bill must be primed to unleash rural America's potential," said Congressman Rahall, Co-Chairman of the House Appalachian Caucus. “Rural areas in Tennessee and much of the Southeast, especially farming communities, have been challenged over the last few years with severe droughts, and the current recession has only made things worse for families and county economies,” Congressman Gordon said. “Investing in rural communities by funding projects that update America's electric grid and expand broadband internet access will not only create jobs, but also establish the necessary infrastructure for our country to compete in the 21st Century.” “Rural areas, like Imperial County in California, are hurting in this time of economic crisis,” said Congressman Filner. “Congress must ensure that the stimulus bill includes mechanisms to give rural areas their fair share of economic stimulus and job creation funding to advance economic development projects. Local representatives of rural communities also need to mobilize to ensure their voices are heard when funds, like transportation dollars, are distributed by state lawmakers. When all levels of government work together, then we can make a big difference.” The text of the letter is below: January 9, 2009 The Honorable Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House U.S. House of Representatives H-232 The Capitol Washington, DC 20515 Dear Speaker Pelosi: As Congress continues to craft an economic stimulus package, it is critical that the benefits of any stimulus are broadly distributed throughout rural, urban, and suburban America. Approximately 50 million Americans live in rural communities. An economic stimulus package must recognize that rural Americans make vital contributions to our economy and face the same struggles with rising unemployment as people living in urban and suburban communities. In fact, seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for non-metropolitan areas were higher each quarter in 2008 than for metropolitan areas. We urge you to support provisions in an economic stimulus package to ensure that rural communities receive their fair share of federal funds. We strongly support your continued efforts to include infrastructure spending in a recovery package. However, legislation with infrastructure spending that ultimately only funds projects in urban and suburban communities will fail to provide the broad economic benefit the American people expect. Facing rising unemployment, rural America cannot afford to be shortchanged in an economic recovery package. As representatives of rural districts, we know that rural communities are prepared with ready-to-go infrastructure projects that could put people to work within months. Rural communities have the workforce and the infrastructure needs to effectively utilize new federal spending. Rural areas should be provided with an equitable share of economic stimulus funds to improve their local economies just like metropolitan communities. The Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act of 2008, H.R. 7110, included a provision to distribute stimulus funds between rural and metropolitan communities. Funds in the Federal Transit Administration Transit Capital Assistance Grants were specifically reserved for rural formula grants. Congress should build on the precedent created by the transit funds in the Job Creation and Unemployment Relief Act with guarantees in new economic recovery legislation to ensure an equitable distribution of all infrastructure funds between rural and metropolitan areas. We look forward to working with you to improve our nation's economy and strengthen rural America through the economic recovery package. Thank you for your continued leadership during this economic crisis. Sincerely, Rep. Mike Thompson Rep. Nick Rahall Rep. Bart Gordon Rep. Bob Filner Rep. Joe Baca Rep. John Barrow Rep.

01.06.2009	Bill to Permanently Ban Drilling on North Coast Introduced January 6, 2009 WASHINGTON - On the first day in the 111th Congress, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced a bill that would permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The Northern California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act provides protection to the unique and productive marine environment along Northern California's outer continental shelf (OCS). “For the economic and biological health of our country, it's critical that we permanently protect this unique area from the environmental hazards of off-shore drilling,” said Congressman Thompson. “Unfortunately in the last Congress drilling became a political drama, rather than a policy debate. My legislation is one aspect of a broader campaign to restore sensible, science based policy and ensure the health of our oceans for generations.” During the last Congress, the ban on OCS drilling expired, which leaves the North Coast susceptible to drilling in as little as three years. The moratorium on OCS drilling had been a bipartisan agreement in Congress since 1982, but came under regular attack, and was not renewed in 2008. In order to make sure that the North Coast of California is permanently protected, Congressman Thompson introduced his legislation today. “Our coastline is home to one of the four most important upwellings in the world, which together support 20 percent of the ocean's fish. Drilling on the North Coast doesn't make sense, either from an economic standpoint or an environmental perspective. By permanently banning drilling, we can provide our coast with the protection it needs, regardless of who is in charge in Washington,” said Congressman Thompson. Upwelling regions are coastal areas that support extremely abundant and productive marine life. This is because an upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters up from the ocean depths that, when combined with sunlight, enhance seaweed and phytoplankton growth. The seaweed and phytoplankton provide energy for some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, including many of the world's most important fisheries, such as the North Coast fisheries. Drilling for gas and oil off the Northern Coast of California could cause serious harm to the unique and productive ecosystem and abundant marine life found off the coast, including the fish many local North Coast economies depend on. ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
12.22.2008	Thompson Urges Spouses of Deceased Veterans to Check if They Received All Benefits Glitch in Computer Program Led to Wrongful Denial of Benefits December 22, 2008 WASHINGTONâ€” Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) alerted constituents that due to a computer error at the Veterans Administration (VA), for almost 12 years surviving spouses of veterans may have been wrongfully denied benefits. Under a law passed in 1996, the spouse of a deceased veteran is entitled to benefits for the month of the veteran's death, but instead the department has been demanding the last month's payment back from the widows, or simply not sending a check at all. “It's outrageous that the spouses of the men and women who have sacrificed so much for our country have been wrongfully denied this last month of payments,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “I urge all survivors of veterans who died after December 31, 1996 to check with the VA to see if they were affected by this error and make sure the VA has their most current address. If folks encounter a problem they shouldn't hesitate to contact my office and we'll work on their behalf to make sure they receive all of the benefits their family member earned by serving our great nation.” The VA has pledged to work quickly to fix the error, and is reviewing their payment records for veterans who died after December 31, 1996, and who are survived by a spouse. The VA will begin issuing retroactive payments to eligible surviving spouses at the end of this month. Surviving spouses can contact the VA's Survivors' Call Center at 1-800-749-8387. The Call Center is open Monday through Friday from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm central standard time. Inquiries can also be submitted on the Internet at https://www.vba.va.gov/survivorsbenefit.htm. ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
12.11.2008	House Votes to Suspend Unfair Retirement Tax on Seniors December 11, 2008 WASHINGTON - The U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation last night that would temporarily suspend a tax on seniors who fail to take a required minimum distribution from their retirement accounts. The bill would waive the penalty for 2009, allowing seniors to recoup some of the losses they have experienced as a result of the poor economy. “The House has protected our seniors by temporarily lifting the rules that force unwilling seniors to sell a certain percentage of their accounts,” said Congressman Thompson (D-CA), a member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over all tax matters. “At this time of economic uncertainly, we should not jeopardize the future retirement security of America's seniors by forcing them to sell more stock than necessary, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation as quickly as possible.” Under the Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act (H.R. 7327), all taxpayers, those who usually take the required minimum distribution amount monthly and those who take a lump sum amount at the end of the year, would have equal treatment. Under current law, individuals who have reached age 70Â½ must take an annual required minimum amount from their retirement plan or IRA. Failure to take the distribution would subject the individual to a 50-percent excise tax penalty on the amount that should have been withdrawn. In addition, the bill would ease funding requirements for employer-sponsored pension plans that would be forced to make significantly increased contributions during these difficult economic times when they are very short on cash. The bill includes temporary relief for multi-employer plans that have been negatively impacted in this economic downturn. The bill would also make nominal technical corrections to the Pension Protection Act of 2006. According to 2000 Census figures, California's 1st District is home to over 84,000 seniors. ### CONTACT: Laurel Brown at (202) 225-3311, (831) 212-2550 or laurel.brown@mail.house.gov
10.29.2008	Thompson: Best Stimulus is Capital Project Investment October 29, 2008 WASHINGTON--- Today at a hearing of the Committee on Ways and Means, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) insisted that any additional economic stimulus package should include significant investment in infrastructure. By focusing on projects that are ready to begin construction immediately, the American economy would receive an immediate boost, the country's crumbling infrastructure would receive much-needed improvements, and these projects would serve the needs of America for decades. “Investing in infrastructure is one of the best ways to create and sustain good paying jobs,” said Congressman Thompson. “Every dollar we invest in infrastructure gives our economy a 59% return. Putting people to work fixing our aging roads and bridges and shoring up our levies will also build the foundation for future economic expansion.” According to the Federal Highway Administration, $1 billion in infrastructure funding generates $1.3 billion of employment income, and supports over 36,000 jobs. There are projects across the 1st Congressional District that would be eligible for this economic stimulus funding. “These projects are more than just job creators, they are also vitally important to our safety and security,” said Congressman Thompson. “For example, if the levies in the Sacramento Delta were to break, towns would be underwater and 60% of Californians would be without drinking water. Investing in infrastructure just makes sense.” Congressman Thompson also advocated for changes to retirement plan rules requiring seniors to withdraw a certain amount from their portfolio. In a letter to Chairman Charlie Rangel (D-NY), Congressman Thompson argued that due to the dire economic conditions, the current rules governing the disbursement of retirement plans will force seniors to liquidate part of their retirement plans at depressed values, and also require them to sell off an unfair percentage of their accounts. “At this time of economic uncertainly, we should not jeopardize the future retirement security of America's seniors by forcing them to sell more stock than necessary,” said Congressman Thompson. “We need to protect our seniors by temporarily lifting the rules that force unwilling seniors to sell a certain percentage of their accounts.”
10.17.2008	In July, the House of Representatives passed the American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act. This legislation established the HOPE for Homeowners Program, which will help 400,000 families keep their homes and maintain neighboring property values. Borrowers who are in danger of losing their homes may refinance into a government backed, fixed rate mortgage that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration. Lenders will be required to revalue the home to ensure that they do not profit at taxpayer expense. Additionally, borrowers who use the program will share a portion of any future sale of the property to offset the cost of the program. Information on the program can be found at the following website:https://www.hud.gov/hopeforhomeowners/consumerfactsheet.cfm If you need assistance on a mortgage or related housing issue, please visit the Hope for Homeowners webpage at the website linked below. https://www.hud.gov/hopeforhomeowners/index.cfm
10.03.2008	Today Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement following the final vote on the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act: “In the last few days it's become clear that we must take action to restore a measure of confidence in our economy. You don't have to look any further than today's unemployment report, which showed our economy shedding more than 159,000 jobs in the last month. And unemployment in California is higher than at any point in the last 12 years. This just added to the growing pile of evidence that we can't afford to wait for the perfect piece of legislation. We have to do something to get our credit markets working again.” “This week I heard from people all across the district who are starting to feel the credit crunch in a real way. I heard from Dick Caletti at Standard Structures in Windsor. He was about to finalize a $10 million order from a Texas company until they got word this week that the project was stalled because of the credit crisis. There are fifty jobs tied to that one contract. Many more of our small businesses will be forced to lay off workers or wait on hiring new workers if they don't have access to credit.” “I've said from the beginning that we must pass regulatory reform to address the underlying causes of this crisis, and I've received written commitments from Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank that passing regulatory reform legislation will be at the top of our agenda moving forward and will stay there until we get it done.” “At the end of the day I had to set aside my outrage at all of the flawed policies, greed and incompetence that got us to this point and do what was best for our district and our country moving forward. I had to choose to either do nothing or vote for an imperfect rescue package. I voted for the bill because I believe it was the only option that we had available to begin to work our way out of this crisis. I would not have made this vote without commitments from Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Frank that Congress will address the needed regulatory adjustments to help protect the taxpayers and establish a safer financial system.”
09.25.2008	Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement: This proposal is clearly one of the most critical issues to come before Congress during the ten years I've had the honor to serve our district. Since this proposal was announced last Sunday, nearly all of my time has been spent working to figure out this crisis and the possible solutions. On one hand, none of us want to see our financial markets collapse. We're told the current financial crisis will dramatically impact not only the “fat cats” but also everyday, hard-working Americans. Retirement funds, 401ks, annuities and public sector retirements could be greatly reduced. Real estate equity would fall even further, hurting not only those whose homes are in foreclosure, but everyone in our communities. Many loans for cars, homes, small and large businesses and even college would dry up, further choking local economies. On the other hand, many of these problems stem from greedy people who acted without concern for the livelihood of everyday Americans. Financial practices were developed and deployed that have exacerbated this mess, and the Administration failed to enact proper oversight over these complicated financial instruments. The pressure to act quickly on this matter would not necessarily bring us the best policy solution. President Bush, Vice President Cheney, Secretary of the Treasury Paulson, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chairman Cox, and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke showed up at 6pm on Thursday night to tell Congress we have until Monday to give them $700 billion or the sky is going to fall. Monday has come and gone and the sky is still in place, but I agree on the essential principle that we need to take action. However, I am not willing to rush into action nor am I interested in saddling American taxpayers with this incredible debt. In the coming days I will continue to work to see if we can find a solution that is best for our economy and the taxpayer. That solution must come with strong reforms, oversight and accountability that ensure this doesn't happen again. These reforms must be tough and well thought out. As I continue to work on this, I am asking the Congressional leadership to take the time to do this right- that's more important than doing it fast.
09.19.2008	DeFazio, Thompson Tell Bush: Hands Off Salmon Disaster Money September 19, 2008 WASHINGTONâ€”Today Representatives Peter DeFazio (OR-04) and Mike Thompson (CA-01), along with 10 other members of Congress wrote to President Bush urging him to distribute the full $170 million in disaster aid to fisherman suffering from the closure of the salmon fishing season on the West Coast. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced this week that it would be releasing only $100 million of the $170 million in funds appropriated by Congress this summer. Given that the Administration attempted to reallocate $70 million earlier this year to pay for cost over runs associated with the 2010 Census, members are concerned that they again intend to reallocate the remaining money to fix the mistakes made by Bush's political cronies. “I am absolutely astounded that the Administration is not distributing the full $170 million Congress allocated in the Farm Bill to deal with the salmon disaster. Instead, they are trying to steal $70 million from salmon fishermen and give it to an incompetent defense contractor,” DeFazio said. “The fishing community of Oregon is already suffering because of the flawed Bush policies in the Sacramento River basin. They should not have to suffer again because the President has hired people in Florida who can't count. We've been there before.” “The Bush Administration has once again put politics ahead of people. Because of the Administration's disastrous policies Pacific coast fishing families have been devastated,” said North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “Congress appropriated $170 million in federal disaster relief, but this latest proposal by the Bush Administration to withhold a large portion of these funds shows no regard for hardworking fishing families nor their livelihood." On May 1, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) decided to close the salmon fishery in California and most of Oregon, after the Pacific Fishery Management Council recommended the closure. The closure is due to the unprecedented decline in salmon returning to the Sacramento River, which typically makes a significant contribution to the Oregon fishery. Unfortunately, since these depleted stocks will be co-mingled with other stocks, the season must be almost entirely closed. The closure signals the worst commercial and recreational fisheries failure in Oregon history, and is the first ban on salmon fishing since the industry began 150 years ago. Washington, Oregon, and California estimated damages to the fishing industry to total $290 million dollars. Short-term assistance is critical so that fishers can make boat payments, insurance payments, mortgage payments, and keep food on the table. In June, the Office of Management and Budget, which puts together the President's annual budget, sent Congress a revised budget request for more funding to carry out the 2010 Census. The White House is requesting $546 million more for the Census, and has proposed using $70 million of the $170 million in salmon disaster money allocated in the Farm Bill, to pay for the cost over-runs. The Administration entered into a contract with the Harris Corporation, a Florida defense contractor, to conduct the Census, but the contractor has run into serious cost over-runs in the amount of hundreds of millions of dollars. Congressmen DeFazio and Thompson, along with 13 other members of Congress, sent President Bush a letter at that time which was largely ignored by the Administration. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform held a hearing on the Harris Corporation and the problems with the Census on June 11, 2008. https://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=2001 The text of the letter sent to President Bush is below: September 18, 2008 The Honorable Jim Nussle, Director Office of Management and Budget Washington, DC. 20503 Dear Director Nussle: We write with increasing concern regarding full disbursement of the $170 million appropriated by Congress to compensate fishers for the unprecedented closure of the West Coast salmon fishery. Earlier this week, NOAA Fisheries (NOAA) indicated that it would be dispersing $100 million of the $170 million appropriated by Congress to provide aid to affected fishers. NOAA further indicated that the remaining $70 million may be disbursed if further need was demonstrated, and “if Congress did not act to rescind the funds.” We have been informed that NOAA is not dispersing the full amount now because OMB has not yet released the funds. We find this unconscionable. First, as we expressed to you in June, it is unacceptable that the Administration has proposed - and now seems to be trying to implement - a plan to take disaster aid from the fishing communities of California, Oregon and Washington to pay for cost overruns associated with this Administration's questionable contract with the Harris Corporation to complete the 2010 census. Indeed, the reason why Congress had to step up to provide this emergency aid to fishers in our states is because of this Administration's unlawful and shortsighted policies regarding the Pacific Northwest's rivers. Second, we have received no satisfactory explanation for why OMB can legally withhold funds that Congress has appropriated for a specific purpose such as this. The states of Oregon, Washington, and California have followed the process set out in the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which provides for emergency assistance. Now that NOAA has accepted the application from Pacific Fishery Management Council, and has approved the $170 million grant to the states, OMB is legally obligated to release the funds so that affected fishers may receive the aid they desperately need. The law provides for no further “assessment of need,” and we are aware of no precedent for OMB's alleged “phased” disbursement of these funds. To us, the fact that OMB is withholding $70 million, when it proposed in June to reprogram this exact same amount to pay for the Administration's mistakes with its census contract, smacks of political gamesmanship. Playing games with the livelihood of fishers across the Pacific Northwest is yet another sign that the Bush Administration has no commitment to protect our valuable river systems, and no interest in helping the fishing communities and economies that rely on them. It is also completely unacceptable. We insist that you comply with congressional intent and immediately release the full $170 million in federal disaster aid for Pacific Northwest fishers. Sincerely, Baird Blumenauer Capps DeFazio Eshoo Farr Hooley Matsui Thompson, Mike Woolsey Wu Miller, George
09.05.2008	Thompson Announces Additional Funding for Napa Flood Protection September 5, 2008 WASHINGTONâ€” Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced that he has secured $900,000 in additional funding for the Napa River Project from the Army Corps of Engineers. This additional funding will help accelerate the Napa Creek phase of the project. “Continued funding for the Napa flood project is essential to the safety of our community,” said Thompson. “We need to make sure that construction can continue and our businesses and homes are protected in case of another flood. In addition to fighting for this project in the regular congressional funding process, I'll keep looking for every bit of money to help move the Napa River Project along.” Last year, Congressman Thompson secured $10.8 million for the Napa Flood Project, which was $3.3 million above the President's budget request. To date, Congressman Thompson has successfully increased funding over the President's budget for this project by $27.2 million. For 2009, the House Appropriations Committee included $11 million for the Napa River Flood Project in the FY09 energy and water appropriations bill. This figure is $3.6 million more than President Bush included in his budget proposal to Congress. The bill has been passed by the Committee but awaits consideration by the full House of Representatives. In December 2005 and January 2006, flooding along the Napa River caused more than $115 million worth of damage to Napa and the surrounding communities. More than 1,200 homes and 250 businesses suffered flood damage. Fortunately, the areas where the existing Napa River Flood project was completed were protected. Otherwise, the damage would have undoubtedly been more severe. The Napa River Project is widely viewed as the premier flood protection and environmental restoration project in the country and is used by the Army Corps of Engineers as a model for other projects nationwide.
07.14.2008	Rep. Thompson on President's Move to Lift Ban on Oil Drilling Along the Outer Continental Shelf July 14, 2008 WASHINGTON - Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement: “This may be good politics, but the policy falls short of the mark. Opening new areas to drilling will do nothing to lower the price of gas today and very little to lower it in the future. And it does nothing to help our country forge a long-term path toward energy independence. “Our district's coast is rich in marine resources that have tremendous value to our local economy. An oil spill would be devastating to the coastal economy and its unique ecosystem. In addition, the rocky terrain would make a spill almost impossible to clean up. Despite new drilling technology, there is still a significant risk of spills, especially during transport. “Moreover, drilling along the Outer Continental Shelf would not increase the oil supply for many years. The President's own Energy Information Administration (EIA) stated that production would take years to begin and 20 years before production was large enough to even produce small price impacts at the pump - less than a nickel a gallon. And remember, oil is traded globally and there is no guarantee Americans would see a drop of any new oil. “If the President - who's had eight years to develop a national energy plan, but hasn't - is serious about reducing the price at the pump, he would:Allow for additional withdrawals from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to increase domestic supply. The SPR is currently at 98% capacity, and reducing it slightly to 90% would immediately increase supply, reduce prices and still maintain a substantial amount of reserve; Work with Congress to take aim at speculators who are artificially increasing the cost of oil, and; Require oil companies to use existing oil and gas leases, which according to the Department of Interior covers nearly 70 million acres - roughly the size of Colorado - and are estimated to have billions of barrels of recoverable oil. “These are short-term solutions that will help bring down the price of gas. However, we also need a long-term strategy that reduces our dependence on oil. Even though President Bush only has a few months left in office, it's not too late for him to work with Congress to begin to create the long-term energy plan our nation desperately needs.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov

06.28.2008	Call for Disaster Declaration for California Wildfires June 28, 2008 WASHINGTON-Today, Congressman Mike Thompson joined Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and members of the California Congressional Delegation in a letter to the President requesting a disaster declaration for the wildfires throughout California. The text of the letter is below: The Honorable George W. Bush The White House Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write in support of the State of California's request for a disaster declaration in our state. Currently, there are an estimated 1088 fires burning throughout California. 265,000 acres have been burned; 284 homes have been damaged or destroyed; thousands have been evacuated. Volunteers, state and federal officials have quickly responded to these fires and are doing an excellent job. But the overwhelming number of fires has stretched State and Local resources to the limit. We need more help. This is a disaster of major scope and consequence. There have been fires in thirty counties; the governor has declared a state of emergency in seven counties; all of California's resources are battling these fires. Still, fifteen percent of all fires on state land do not have a single firefighter fighting the blazes. This is not due to negligence- our fire agencies have had to make the hard choices to abandon some fires in order to battle others. These fires are the product of more than 8,000 lightning strikes and record-low rain fall. And meteorologists say there is more to come. Experts say that there are more lightning strikes, and more fires on the way. An Emergency Declaration under the Stafford Act will provide the essential federal resources needed to save the homes, property, and potentially lives of constituents in our state. These assets are greatly needed and will be put to good use in the days to come. Thank you for your time and attention to this very important issue.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
06.27.2008	Oil Companies should “Use It or Lose It” June 27, 2008 WASHINGTONâ€”Last night, Congressman Mike Thompson voted for legislation requiring oil companies to drill for oil on the U.S. land they have already leased, rather than expand drilling into new areas. Currently, oil and gas companies hold leases to drill on nearly 90 million acres of federal land. Of that, nearly 70 million acres - an area the size of Colorado - are not being touched, despite estimates that they contain 80% of oil and gas reserves on federal lands. The “Use It or Lose It” bill (HR 6251), co-sponsored by Congressman Mike Thompson, gives oil companies an incentive to explore already available lands, rather than try to open new areas off the Outer Continental Shelf or in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to exploration. Although the bill garnered a majority of support, it needed a two-thirds majority to pass. It will be voted on again after the July 4th congressional recess. “When we sit atop only 2% of the world's oil supply, but consume a quarter of the world's supply, it's clear we can't drill our way out of the fuel crisis,” said Thompson. “However, we can encourage drilling on the land we've already leased to oil companies, much of which they aren't currently using. There is no reason to expand drilling to new areas - areas that could suffer devastating environmental consequences - when oil companies aren't using the land they have.” Oil from already leased land can come on line much faster than any newly leased land. It's estimated that oil from new areas such as the Outer Continental Shelf or ANWR could take up to 10 years to reach the market. “Utilizing existing leases is only one part of a much-needed comprehensive energy policy,” said Thompson. “We also need to consider other short-term solutions like releasing a small portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and cracking down on unregulated oil speculators who are artificially inflating the price of oil.” “We also need to continue investing in long-term solutions, like renewable energy, fuel efficient vehicles, public transportation, incentives for homes and businesses that use solar, wind and biomass and research of other energy technologies.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
06.26.2008	House Honors Life of Wine Icon Robert Mondavi June 26, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, the House of Representatives passed a resolution honoring the life of the late Robert Mondavi, a pioneer of the American wine industry. H. Con. Res. 365 was introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley), Mr. Mondavi's U.S. Representative and friend. A companion resolution was introduced by Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, and was passed by the Senate. “Mr. Mondavi's pursuit of excellence and passion for winemaking could be found in every sip of a Robert Mondavi vintage,” said Thompson. “Through innovation and determination, he redefined American wines and influenced the growth and prosperity of one of our nation's most important industries. Robert Mondavi's leadership is irreplaceable.” The resolution details the years of tireless commitment Mr. Mondavi put into his dream of making California wines among the best in the world. It describes the rise of the Robert Mondavi Winery to worldwide acclaim and Mr. Mondavi's many successful international ventures. It also lauds his enormous passion for promoting philanthropic causes, including his generous donations to establish the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science and the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for Performing Arts at UC Davis and Copia: The American Institute for Food, Wine and the Arts in downtown Napa. “To me and many others, he was best known - and loved - as a dear friend, a pillar of the community and a much-admired philanthropist,” said Thompson. “I was fortunate to know Mr. Mondavi my whole life. I grew up with his children and I later worked with him on issues important to the wine community. Of all his accomplishments, it was his commitment to our community that I found most inspiring.” “Mr. Mondavi's legacy can be found throughout the world, but it is most treasured at home,” said Thompson. “Our district would not be what it is today without him. I will miss him greatly. Our thoughts and prayers are with Margrit, sons Michael and Tim, daughter Marcia and his entire family.

06.25.2008	House Votes to Stop Tax on Estimated 45,000 Tax Filers in 1st Congressional District June 25, 2008 WASHINGTONâ€”Today, the House of Representatives approved legislation that would stop a tax on 25 million middle-class families, including an estimated 45,000 tax filers in the 1st Congressional District, without adding to our national debt. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Relief Act of 2008 (HR 6275) keeps millions of Americans from being hit by a tax originally designed to only affect the very wealthy. “American families are already strained by rising gas, food and healthcare prices, and don't deserve to be caught in a tax originally meant for the rich,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “The last thing these families need is a larger tax burden, and I am very pleased that we were able to stop the tax increase without adding to our national debt.” The legislation provides one-year relief from the AMT without adding to the deficit by closing loopholes in the tax code, encouraging tax compliance and repealing excessive government subsidies given to oil companies. “I believe we need to permanently fix the AMT problem, but that's going to require a broader effort to simplify our tax code and improve fairness,” added Thompson. “I'm very hopeful that the next president will be willing to make that happen in a fiscally responsible way.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
06.24.2008	House Passes Major Medicare Improvements; Aim to Increase Access in Rural Areas June 24, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, the House passed legislation that would significantly improve Medicare benefits for 44 million American seniors and people with disabilities. The bill, which Congressman Mike Thompson helped craft as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, pays particular attention to recipients in areas with limited access to healthcare. In addition, the bill includes several provisions championed by Thompson that directly impact the 1st Congressional District. “Medicare providers in rural areas like Northern California often lack the resources they need to serve the public,” said Thompson. “This bill increases payments for sole community and critical access hospitals, increases payments for rural ambulance services and ensures physicians are fairly reimbursed for Medicare services.” Without this legislation, physicians across the country would face a 10.6 percent cut in reimbursements for Medicare services beginning July 1st. Alarmingly, the data suggests that over 60 percent of California physicians would leave the Medicare program or stop taking new Medicare patients if these cuts are implemented. “Although this bill stops cuts to physician payments, it is not about how much we pay doctors,” said Thompson. “This bill is about access to healthcare for patients. When doctors don't get reimbursed, they often can't continue serving Medicare patients.” The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (HR 6331) also includes provisions from Thompson's telehealth legislation, which expands the types of health facilities that offer telehealth services. Telehealth, the delivery of health services via telecommunications, is a proven method for doctors and patients to effectively communicate from separate locations. Also included are provisions from Thompson's cancer prevention bill, expanding the Welcome to Medicare Physical Examination from six months to one year for all new Medicare enrollees. Thompson has been a leading champion for preventive healthcare since his time in the State Senate, and believes this provision will help millions of Medicare recipients stay healthy. “Making investments in preventive healthcare is one of the best ways to keep people healthy and reduce our nation's healthcare costs,” added Thompson. In addition, the bill permanently extends a Thompson-authored law that helps National Guard and Reserve physicians maintain their practices while deployed overseas. Prior to Thompson's law, Guard and Reserve physicians would have difficulties arranging other physicians to cover their practices while they were deployed and still get reimbursed for Medicare services; however, this law will expire on July 1st. This bill ensures that physicians can continue to serve our country overseas without worrying about losing their medical practice at home. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act now moves to the Senate for consideration. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
06.12.2008	Legislation to Care for Veterans Unknowingly Used in Chemical and Biological Weapons Tests Heard by House Subcommittee June 12, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) took another step toward helping veterans who were unknowingly tested with chemical and biological weapons in the 1960s and 70s. The House Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs held a hearing on a Thompson-authored bill that would give these veterans health benefits and compensation for illnesses resulting from “Project 112” weapons tests. Project 112, which included ship-based Project SHAD, was conducted between 1963 and 1973 by the Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies. The DoD now admits that during these projects, unknowing military personnel were involved a number of chemical weapon tests such as VX nerve gas and Sarin nerve gas and were exposed to biological weapons such as E. Coli, Rabbit Fever and Q fever. “First the government denied the tests existed. Then they said the tests happened but were harmless. Now they admit dangerous substances were used on our military personnel, yet they still refuse to give them care for their illnesses,” said Thompson. “We can't change the past, but we can begin to right this wrong by giving these men the proper healthcare and compensation they earned.” HR 5954 provides veterans of Project 112 a “Presumption of Service Connection.” This means the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) presumes the relationship between service and a health condition, making the veterans involved eligible for medical benefits and/or compensation for their conditions. For example, veterans exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War are already given a “Presumption of Service Connection.” “I understand security classifications and the sensitivity of our operation,” said Jack B. Alderson, a retired Lt. Commander from the U.S. Navy Reserves and resident of California's 1st Congressional District. “However, these were not volunteers but service personnel ordered to do a dangerous job and they did it, and did it well, now their nation needs to take care of them.” In 1964, Alderson was the officer in charge of five U.S. Army light tug boats that were used to test chemical and biological weapons. The tug boats acted as sampling stations and targets for disseminated weapon clouds. After the DoD admitted that the tests did exist and included harmful agents, they released more than 6,000 names of military personnel used in the tests. However, the GAO reported in February that the DoD had halted their efforts to disclose additional names and many veterans remain unaware that they were even involved. This legislation would require the DoD to hand over all the names to the VA, which must then notify the veterans. This legislation has been endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans of America, Veterans of Foreign Wars, American Legion, Disabled American Veterans and Paralyzed Veterans of America.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 and anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.04.2008	Reps. Thompson and Hulshof Introduce Bill to Expand Use of Telehealth Technology June 4, 2008 WASHINGTON - Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Kenny Hulshof (R-MO) introduced legislation that would increase the number of health facilities that offer telehealth services to Medicare recipients. Telehealth, the delivery of health services via telecommunications, is a proven method for doctors and patients to effectively communicate from separate locations. This technology is an important resource for transmitting medical advice, information and imaging, but Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services is currently limited to rural areas and specific types of health facilities. The Thompson-Hulshof legislation would expand Medicare reimbursement to urban and suburban areas and include more facilities, like skilled nursing facilities and home health services. It will also allow doctors to monitor patients remotely. “People in rural Congressional Districts like ours often have to travel long distances to see a specialty physician,” said Thompson. “We know that telehealth technologies are an effective way to bring high-quality, affordable healthcare to Americans, no matter where they live. This legislation will make sure Medicare recipients can access telemedicine technology in more cities and towns and in more health facilities. As healthcare becomes more expensive, telehealth technology is a great way to help people get the care they need.” "Telehealth has the potential to make the best treatments and medical professionals available to any American," said Hulshof. "This legislation has broad support from the medical community, as we all share the same goal: to take full advantage of medical and technological advances to save lives and keep people healthy. Telehealth also has great potential to save billions of taxpayer dollars, so this bill is truly a win-win." The legislation also provides $30 million in grant funding to help health facilities pay for the telehealth equipment and to expand telehealth support services. Telehealth has shown it provides better management of chronic diseases, reduces emergency room admissions and lowers healthcare costs. Telehealth services can also play an important role in addressing the epidemic of physician shortages in rural America by bringing physician specialty services to remote communities. In addition, faster diagnoses enabled by telehealth allow patients to get care more quickly.### CONTACT: Anne Warden (Thompson) at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov Erik Rasmussen (Hulshof) at (202) 225-2956 or erik.rasmussen@mail.house.gov
05.29.2008	Thompson, Boxer and Feinstein Introduce Resolution to Honor Robert Mondavi May 29, 2008 WASHINGTON - Last week, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) introduced a resolution to honor the life of Robert Mondavi, a pioneer of the California wine industry who passed away in May at the age of 94. Senator Boxer said, “Those who knew Robert Mondavi recognized him as a uniquely passionate and brilliant man. He took pride in promoting California wines worldwide and advocating causes that he held close to his heart. His work will be remembered fondly by all those whose lives he touched. He will be deeply missed in the Napa Valley and in California.” “Robert Mondavi is a name that will forever be associated with great California wine. He was a winemaking pioneer who showcased California's ability to make world-class wines. He dedicated his life to being an ambassador for California wine and food and proved that Napa Valley wines could compete on the international stage,” Senator Feinstein said. “He will be missed.” Congressman Thompson said, “Robert Mondavi was without question one of the true pioneers of the California wine industry. Were it not for his foresight and determination, the Napa Valley would not be what it is today. Robert was not only an extraordinary winemaker and businessman; he was a pillar of our community. His legacy can be found throughout Northern California, from COPIA to the Mondavi Center at UC Davis, from the Napa Valley Wine Auction charitable giving to his work on land stewardship and habitat preservation. His passing leaves a void that cannot possibly be filled. He was a wonderful friend and I will miss him greatly.” The resolution recognizes Mondavi's many achievements, including the establishment, in 1965, of the Napa Valley winery that bore his name and helped bring visibility and acclaim to California wine, the innovative techniques he brought to wine production, as well as his commitment to philanthropy.
05.14.2008	Rep. Thompson's Bills to Protect Land and Wildlife Included in Farm Bill May 14, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, the House of Representatives passed a final version of the Farm Bill, which included two bills by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) that would incentivize landowners who protect wildlife habitat, farmland and open spaces. “Protecting public lands and the wildlife that live on them isn't enough - we have to help our private landowners do their part to guard their land from development and restore critical wildlife habitat,” said Thompson. The first provision would extend an important tax incentive for landowners who donate their land's development rights to local land trusts, creating a conservation easement. Once placed under a conservation easement, the land cannot be developed at any time in the future, even if the land is sold. However, the landowner and all future owners can continue to farm the land. The incentive was originally created by a previous bill that expired at the end of last year. The provision in the Farm Bill would extend the tax incentive for two more years. “Our farm lands and open spaces are being lost to development at a frightening pace," said Thompson. "Conservation easements give people the incentive they need to avoid selling their land to developers. Protecting our open spaces not only makes our air and water cleaner, it helps preserve our beautiful American landscape.” The second provision would provide landowners with a permanent tax deduction if they agree to implement plans to recover threatened and endangered species. To qualify for the tax deduction, landowners must demonstrate that the species listed as endangered or threatened live or migrate through their property. In addition, the landowner must implement a government-approved recovery plan designed to reverse the decline of the listed species. “If we want the Endangered Species Act to be truly successful, we have to help private landowners implement proven recovery plans," said Thompson. "This provision will for the first time give landowners the incentive and the technical assistance to do what needs to be done to help protect endangered and threatened wildlife on private land.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
05.13.2008	Rep. Thompson Secures Disaster Relief for Communities Hit by Salmon Season Closure May 13, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) announced that $170 million has been included in the Farm Bill to aid families and businesses in California, Oregon and Washington affected by the biggest and most devastating Pacific salmon season closure in American history. “This funding is desperately needed by the communities and families who rely on salmon fishing, many of whom face losing their businesses and homes due to two years of no fishing,” said Thompson. In April, an historic drop in juvenile Chinook salmon in the Sacramento River led to a complete closure of the commercial and recreational salmon seasons in California and Oregon. In Washington, the season was also closed because populations of the Columbia River Chinook and Coho salmon are at near-record lows. In response, Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez declared the salmon season a federal fisheries disaster, which authorizes Congress to provide aid to affected communities. Thompson and other members of the California, Oregon and Washington delegations asked Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help find disaster aid so communities could get aid as quickly as possible. Communities on the Pacific Coast that would receive this aid are still recovering from the 2006 salmon season closure, which was due to historically low salmon stocks in the Klamath River Basin. In 2007, Thompson secured $60.4 million in aid for California and Oregon fishers and related businesses affected by that closure. However, this year's closure will have a much larger economic impact because the Sacramento River salmon are considered the â€˜driver' of Pacific Coast salmon stocks. In addition, for the first time, the recreational salmon fishing season will be closed. “Providing disaster relief is not something we can do each year,” added Thompson. “And the people who rely on fishing for their livelihoods don't want us to. We need to make a commitment to restoring our salmon habitats, especially in the Klamath River Basin. A problem of this magnitude needs a long-term solution.” Thompson and fishing and conservation groups along the Pacific North Coast have been working for years to restore salmon habitats. However, low water levels caused by unsustainable and unlawful water plans put in place by the Bush Administration have contributed to the precipitous decline in West Coast salmon populations. “We also need to pay attention to the political forces that helped create this disaster,” said Thompson. “Because of the Bush Administration's poor water policies that were found to be in violation of the law, every major salmon river in the continental U.S. is now being run by the courts. As a result, the agencies responsible for restoring these rivers aren't giving Congress the information we need to make them healthy again. The Bush Administration should be making decisions based on science, not politics.” The House and Senate are expected to pass this final version of the Farm Bill later this week.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
05.05.2008	Rep. Thompson's Statement on Trip to Iraq May 5, 2008 WASHINGTON - This weekend, as Chairman of the House Intelligence subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) visited several sites throughout Iraq to conduct oversight of intelligence-related matters. He released this statement following his return from Iraq: “In addition to meeting with General Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker, as well as some of my own constituents, I had the honor of spending some time with our troops. Our brave men and women in uniform continue to do an amazing job despite being overextended and caught in the middle of a civil war. “You need to look no further than the recent increase in attacks on the Green Zone - an internationally-controlled, fully-protected area in Baghdad - and the ongoing threat of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) to know how important strong, effective intelligence is to ensuring our troops return home as fast and safe as possible. “This war has given Iran the opportunity to strengthen its influence in the region. After my visit, I believe more strongly than ever that Iran's threat must be addressed by bringing the world together through a surge in diplomacy. Strong intelligence gathering capabilities is the key to peacefully nipping the problem of Iran in the bud. It's also the key to fighting terrorism worldwide, improving our national security and keeping us out of future wars. “I continue to support immediately beginning the redeployment of our troops out of Iraq and giving the Iraqi government full responsibility for their national security. I believe we must work with the United Nations to develop an international strategy for controlling the violence in Iraq and ensuring it does not spread across borders, which would certainly lead to a regional civil war.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
05.01.2008	Thompson and Rehberg Fight for Veterans Unknowingly Exposed to Toxic Tests in 60s and 70s May 1, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Denny Rehberg (R-MT) introduced legislation that would provide healthcare to veterans who were unknowingly subjected to biological and chemical weapons tests conducted in the 1960s and 70s. The existence of these tests, known as Project 112, including Project SHAD, was denied by the Department of Defense (DoD), despite reports from participating veterans that they were being stricken with unusual diseases. The DoD now acknowledges that the tests took place, but the Veterans Administration (VA) will not provide these veterans with health benefits and compensation for their diseases. The Thompson-Rehberg legislation would require the VA to assume the toxins used in the weapons tests caused injury to the veterans, making them eligible for medical benefits and/or compensation for their conditions. “For ten years, I've been fighting to get the government to acknowledge that these extremely dangerous tests made some of our brave veterans sick and even caused some of their deaths,” said Thompson. “These men risked their lives for their country, and in return, their government treated them like guinea pigs and has for years turned its back on them. This legislation will make sure they don't have to wait any longer for the help they need and deserve.” “Project 112 is one test the Department of Defense has undoubtedly flunked,” said Rehberg. “Now, these brave men and women who served our country have been left to suffer. These veterans deserve quality healthcare and recognition by their government that it understands what they've had to go through. This bill is a great step toward that.” Project 112, which included Project SHAD, was conducted between 1963 and 1973 by the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. During these projects, a number of weapons containing chemical and biological agents such as VX nerve gas, Sarin Nerve Gas and E. Coli were tested on unknowing military personnel. Normally, a veteran must provide proof of a connection between service and the health condition being claimed. This bill would provide veterans of Project 112 a “Presumption of Service Connection,” which means that the VA presumes the relationship between service and a health condition is based on the other criteria, such as dates and location of service. For example, veterans exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War are already given a “Presumption of Service Connection.” In addition, this bill instructs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs within 180 days of enactment to notify all veterans of potential exposure to the biological or chemical weapons used in Project 112 and Project SHAD. A Government Accountability Office report (GAO-04-410) issued in May of 2004 concluded that a substantial number of veterans still remain unaware that tests were conducted on them. The Thompson-Rehberg legislation has been endorsed by the Vietnam Veterans of America. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden (Thompson) at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov Bridger Pierce (Rehberg) at (202) 225-3211, 406-581-8971 or bridger.pierce@mail.house.gov
04.30.2008	Rep. Thompson Gets Perfect Score on Breast Cancer Policy April 30, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, Congressman Mike Thompson was recognized by California advocates from the National Breast Cancer Coalition (NBCC) for his perfect record of support. During a meeting in his Capitol Hill office, the NBCC advocates, including two women from the 1st Congressional District, presented him with a certificate of excellence. “Each year, tens of thousands of American women die from breast cancer,” said Thompson. “As we work toward a cure, we must do everything we can to promote early detection and invest in effective treatments. I am proud to be recognized by the National Breast Cancer Coalition, and look forward to continuing our partnership in the fight against breast cancer.” In addition to consistently supporting breast cancer prevention and detection legislation, he is the author of the Medicare Early Detection of Cancer Promotion Act, which will waive co-pays for colonoscopy and mammography services. “The vast majority of cancer diagnoses and deaths happen to older Americans, so we should make it as easy as possible for seniors to get regular cancer screenings,” said Thompson. Sixty percent of new cancer diagnoses and 70 percent of cancer deaths occur in people over 65. “Co-pays for these services create a barrier to care,” added Thompson. “If we eliminate the co-pays, more seniors will get screened, saving lives and money.” Currently, beneficiaries pay no coinsurance for most cancer screening services covered by Medicare, but they must pay a 20% co-pay for colonoscopy and mammography services. This legislation will eliminate co-pays for mammograms and colonoscopies, prompting more seniors to utilize these live-saving services. Thompson's legislation also extends the eligibility period for the “Welcome to Medicare” visit from the current time frame of six months to one year. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
04.16.2008	Thompson Votes to Simplify Tax Code, Close Loopholes for Government Contractors April 16, 2008 WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Congressman Mike Thompson voted to make the tax code simpler and fairer for American families and increase accountability of how federal dollars are spent. The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification Act (HR 5719), which Thompson helped draft in the Ways & Means Committee, strengthens protections against identity theft and tax fraud, expands tax help for low-income taxpayers and stops taxpayer harassment by ending the private collection of federal taxes. This bill also closes a loophole that allows government contractors to set up sham companies in foreign jurisdictions to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. “For too long, changes to the tax code have done little to benefit low- and middle-class families,” said Thompson. “But today we took a step toward changing that.” Data clearly suggests that the current tax code puts taxpayers at a disadvantage. For example, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that private debt collectors hired by the IRS placed over one million calls, many to innocent people, trying to reach only 35,000 taxpayers. And the IRS program that oversees debt collection has lost almost $50 million, in part because of the huge bounty paid to private debt collectors. This legislation would stop the IRS's use of private debt collectors. Many taxpayers are also not getting their fair share. For example, about 25% of households eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in 1999 did not claim it, and according to the GAO, working Americans may have lost out on approximately $8 billion in unclaimed earned income credits in 2004. This legislation would strengthen IRS outreach to make sure people know they are entitled to tax refunds under the EITC. It would also permit the IRS to refer these taxpayers to tax clinics This bill also addresses the rise of identity theft by requiring the IRS to notify taxpayers if there's been an unauthorized use of their identity and it cracks down on misleading Web sites that try to get personal information by imitating the IRS. It takes steps to close egregious corporate loopholes and stop federal contractors from using foreign subsidiaries to evade Social Security and other employment taxes. Currently, companies can avoid paying their fair share of Social Security and Medicare taxes by creating shell companies in the Cayman Islands. The Taxpayer Assistance and Simplification closes this loophole, which costs American taxpayers almost $100 million a year. “The average American's tax payment covers about half a second of spending in Iraq,” said Thompson. “It's ridiculous that we're then giving contractors in Iraq a chance to take even more American tax dollars. It's time we close these loopholes and use our tax dollars where they're needed - here in the U.S.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov

04.03.2008	Thompson Honored for His Dedication to Veterans April 3, 2008 LAKEPORT, CA - Congressman Mike Thompson was honored last weekend by the Vietnam Veterans of America's Lake County chapter for his efforts to improve benefits and services for our veterans. Dean Gotham, president of the local Chapter 951, presented Thompson with a certificate of appreciation. “I have the honor and privilege to present Congressman Mike Thompson with a Certificate of Appreciation for his accomplishments in helping all veterans,” said Gotham during the presentation. “Since March 30th is â€˜Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day,' the Officers and Board of Directors of Chapter 951 decided that this was a perfect time to acknowledge our fellow veteran, Congressman Mike Thompson.” “I am as honored to receive this certificate from my fellow veterans as I am to work on their behalf every day in Washington,” said Thompson. “These true American heroes deserve the best we can give them, and I'll continue to fight for better veteran services and health care.” Since coming to Congress, Thompson has led and supported many efforts to better serve the men and women who have fought for our country. Most recently, he supported the largest increase in funding for the Veterans Administration in U.S. history. He also continues his work to help Project 112 and Project SHAD veterans who were unknowingly used in chemical and biological agent tests. In addition, his staff in four offices throughout our Congressional District work daily to help local veterans get the benefits they deserve. Thompson is also a vocal advocate for our troops, and has worked tirelessly to bring our troops home from Iraq as quickly and safely as possible. Thompson was the first Vietnam veteran elected to the California State Senate. He served in combat with the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant/platoon leader with the 173rd Airborne Brigade where he was wounded and received a Purple Heart. He was also an instructor at the Army's Airborne School.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
03.07.2008	Congressman Thompson and Senator Feinstein Call for Speedy Disaster Relief for the 2008 Salmon Season March 7, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson with Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer and 46 Senators and Representatives from California, Oregon and Washington called on Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez to give Congress the authorization to distribute disaster funds to Pacific Coast commercial fishers and related businesses. In a letter to the Secretary, the bipartisan group wrote that if the salmon season is as bad as it was in 2006, when over 90 percent of the season was closed, the Secretary should quickly declare it a federal fisheries failure so Congress can immediately get aid to affected communities. They also called on the Secretary to work closely with California, Oregon and Washington to assess the financial impacts of a limited salmon season. “We've already seen the devastating economic effects a closed season can have on salmon fishers and related businesses, particularly in Northern California” said Congressman Thompson. “Another closed season would be an even bigger blow to the North Coast. If stocks are as low as predicted, Secretary Guitierrez must act quickly to declare the season a commercial fisheries failure so Congress can help our communities get back on their feet.” “In 2006, the Klamath fisheries suffered serious financial losses when the salmon season collapsed. Unfortunately, this year's Sacramento River salmon population is expected to be as bad as or worse than 2006,” said Senator Feinstein. “So, I urge Secretary Gutierrez to prepare for the worst -- and begin to put in place measures that would help protect fishermen and impacted local communities from the economic pressures of yet another dismal salmon season.” Preliminary reports from the Pacific Fishery Management Council predict returns of juvenile Central Valley Chinook salmon at 90,000 fish - the lowest level since 1990 and the second lowest of all time. Sacramento River salmon are considered the â€˜driver' of Pacific Coast commercial fisheries. If the season is as bad as predicted, Congressman Thompson will introduce legislation for relief funds; however, the Magnuson-Stevens Act says that Congress is not authorized to appropriate disaster funds until the Secretary of Commerce declares the season a commercial fishery failure. “When we had record lows on the Klamath River in 2006, it took months and months for the Secretary to declare the season a failure,” added Thompson. “As a result, fishing families and businesses on the North Coast are just now getting federal relief. If we know we are going to have another limited season, we need to act as quickly as possible to help these families.” In 2007, Congressman Thompson introduced legislation to provide Pacific Coast salmon fishers, tribes and related businesses with $60.4 million in federal relief. The bill was signed by President Bush in May, and the funds are currently being distributed. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden (Thompson) at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov Scott Gerber (Feinstein) at (202) 224-9629 or scott_gerber@feinstein.senate.gov
02.28.2008	Reps. Thompson and Rehberg Want Project SHAD Investigation Reopened February 28, 2008 WASHINGTON - Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Denny Rehberg (R-MT) called on the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to reopen its previous investigation into the long-term health effects on veterans exposed during the operation of Project SHAD. Project SHAD, or Project Shipboard Hazard and Defense, was conducted between 1962 and 1974 by the Department of Defense. During Project SHAD, a number of weapons containing chemical and biological agents such as VX nerve gas, Sarin Nerve Gas and E. Coli were tested on unknowing military personnel. A Government Accountability Office report (GAO-04-410) issued in May of 2004 concluded that a substantial number of veterans remain unaware that tests were conducted on them. In a letter to the IOM, Thompson and Rehberg stated that the recent study of Project SHAD health effects was deficient because it failed to include information on key test participants, despite the fact that the names of many such participants were available. In light of this concern, they want the IOM to reexamine the study's results. “We can't understand why a study of Project SHAD's health effects on veterans wouldn't include the very veterans that were used in the tests,” said Congressman Thompson. “These veterans deserve to know the truth about what these chemicals have done to their health. As a fellow veteran, I'm determined to make sure this study is done properly.” “The veterans involved in the SHAD program deserve a thorough review of how these harmful chemicals may have affected them,” said Congressman Rehberg. “However, the work that's been done so far just doesn't cut it. Mike and I are sending a clear message that the valuable input these veterans can provide shouldn't be taken for granted.” In 2003, Congress directed the IOM to conduct a study of the long-term health effects on veterans exposed during Project SHAD. The study, which was released in June 2007, failed to link Project SHAD to the health problems experienced by veterans exposed to those tests. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden (Thompson): (202) 225-3311 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov Bridger Pierce (Rehberg): 202-225-3211 or bridger.pierce@mail.house.gov
02.14.2008	Reps. Thompson, Eshoo Introduce Waterboarding Ban February 14, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today Anna G. Eshoo (D-CA 14th), Chairwoman of the Intelligence Community Management Subcommittee of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, with Mike Thompson (D-CA 1st), Chairman of the Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence Subcommittee, introduced a bill to ban waterboarding by the United States Government. “It's time to make a clear statement for the world to hear and understand, and for the Bush Administration to obey: Waterboarding is torture and Americans will not participate in it. “For this reason, today we have introduced a bill to ban waterboarding once and for all. The bill makes clear that waterboarding is torture, and cannot be used by anyone in the United States government, including the CIA. “As General David Petraeus stated: â€˜What sets us apart from our enemies . . . is how we behave. In everything we do, we must observe the standards and values that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and respect. While we are warriors, we are also all human beings.' “Senator John McCain stated: â€˜People who have worn the uniform and had the experience know that this is a terrible and odious practice and should never be condoned in the U.S. We are a better nation than that.' “We agree. But the Bush Administration has consistently refused to take waterboarding off the table permanently, and that's why it's time for Congress to step in. “Our bill will ban waterboarding once and for all. Anyone who waterboards in the future will be subject to criminal prosecution. Period. “Criminalizing waterboarding is not a new policy for the United States. In 1947, the United States prosecuted a Japanese military officer for carrying out a form of waterboarding on a U.S. civilian during the Second World War, securing a conviction and a sentence of 15 years of hard labor. The United States military has prosecuted American military personnel for subjecting prisoners to waterboarding, including sentencing a U.S. Army major to 10 years at hard labor for subjecting an insurgent to waterboarding in the Philippines during the Spanish-American War. “For those who might say that this bill will lead to the prosecution of officers who relied on the guidance of the Justice Department, we note that our bill is prospective. “Now, from this day forward, let the world know that the United States of America will practice what it has always been revered for: Dignity, democracy and the rule of law.”# # # Contacts: Anne Warden (Thompson) at (202) 225-3311 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov, Jason Mahler (Eshoo) at (202) 225-8104 or jason.mahler@mail.house.gov
02.08.2008	House of Representatives Takes On Rising Cost of College, Complexity of the Financial Aid Process February 8, 2008 WASHINGTON - Yesterday, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted for legislation to address the skyrocketing cost of a college education and remove other obstacles that make it harder for qualified students to go to college. By an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 354 to 58, the House approved the College Opportunity and Affordability Act (H.R. 4137), which would reform the nation's higher education programs to better work in the interests of students and families. This is the second piece of major legislation in the 110th Congress that makes college more affordable and accessible. Last year, Congress enacted into law a $20 billion increase in college financial aid over the next five years, the largest increase in student aid since the G.I. Bill of 1944. “A college education is necessary for a growing number of jobs in the 21st century economy. Yet affording college is nearly impossible for too many low- and even middle-income families,” said Congressman Thompson. “We must encourage colleges to keep prices reasonable so all Americans have a shot at higher education. And we also need to make more financial aid available for those who need it.” An October 2007 report from the College Board showed that, over the previous five years, tuition and fees had increased across the board, at public and private colleges and at two-year and four-year colleges. In California, tuition and fees at a public 4-year university grew by 9 percent between the 2006-07 and 2007-8 academic years. This bill would address these rising prices by encouraging colleges to rein in price increases, ensuring that states maintain their commitments to higher education funding and providing students and families with consumer-friendly information on college pricing and the factors driving tuition increases. The legislation also strengthens provisions previously approved by the House to avoid conflicts of interest in the student loan programs. The bill's new provisions include requiring better consumer disclosures and protections on private student loans. Together these protections form a Bill of Rights for college consumers. “Any student or parent who has filled out financial aid forms knows how complicated it can be to get loans or assistance for college,” added Thompson. “In addition to keeping college affordable, we also need to make paying for college much less confusing.” In addition, the College Opportunity and Affordability Act would:Streamline the federal student financial aid application process; Make textbook costs more manageable for students by, among other things, helping them plan for textbook expenses in advance of each semester; Allow students to receive year-round Pell Grant scholarships; Strengthen college readiness and support programs for minority and low-income students; Increase college aid and support programs for veterans and military families; Improve safety on college campuses and help schools recover and rebuild after a disaster; Ensure equal college opportunities and fair learning environments for students with disabilities; and Strengthen our nation's workforce and economic competitiveness by boosting science, technology, and foreign language educational opportunities. H.R. 4137 is a comprehensive reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, the primary federal law aimed at expanding college access for low- and middle-income students. The bill is supported by a broad coalition of students, colleges and universities, consumer rights advocacy groups, minority organizations, and more. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
02.05.2008	President's Budget Cuts Critical Health Care Programs; Boosts War Funding Through More Foreign-Owned Debt February 5, 2008 WASHINGTON - Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) released the following statement in response to President Bush's budget proposal: “The president's budget is bad news for millions of Americans. While American families are struggling with worsening economic conditions, the president's budget steals billions from critical health care programs in order to finance his War in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthy. But even after cutting tens of billions from important domestic programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the budget still carries a $410 billion deficit, one of the highest in our nation's history. Once again, the president wants to pay for his misguided foreign and fiscal policies with more foreign-owned debt. And unfortunately, our grandchildren will have to pay the tab for the president's unprecedented fiscal irresponsibility. “California, which is already dealing with serious economic problems, takes an especially hard hit in the president's budget. $17 million will be cut from state firefighter grants and $20 million will be cut from law enforcement grants. $15 million will be cut from teacher training programs, $127 million will be cut from vocational programs and $42 million will be cut from after-school programs. $14 million will be cut from the state's Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program and $19 million will be cut from housing assistance. And $54 million would be cut from federal highways in the state. “I'm also extremely worried about how the cuts to Medicare will impact rural areas like those in our district, which typically have a higher rate of Medicare recipients. In addition, the president makes cuts to other rural health programs and zeroes out some programs completely. Our rural areas are already having a difficult time retaining doctors and affording expensive medical equipment. Now is not the time to make it even more difficult to access health care in our rural areas. “We should be doing everything we can to help middle- and low-income families grapple with the economic downturn. As health care costs skyrocket, we should maintain our investments in Medicare and Medicaid, which helps millions of our most vulnerable citizens. We should also be spending our tax dollars on American infrastructure projects that infuse money and jobs into our communities. “Congress is committed to investing in real American priorities, like job-growth, education and health care. We need a president who shares that commitment, as well as a commitment to fiscal responsibility. This president brought us the five largest deficits in American history. It's time for a change.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
01.29.2008	Congressman Thompson Responds to State of the Union Address January 29, 2008 WASHINGTON - Congressman Mike Thompson released the following statement in response to President Bush's State of the Union Address: “Last night, the president offered few real solutions to the problems that have developed since he came into office. In fact, the president shared a much rosier view of the conditions facing American families than reality dictates. While our country remains the greatest on earth, Americans are struggling with the rising costs of energy, gas, healthcare, education and housing. And the war in Iraq continues to drain our treasury and military, while our reputation among our allies steadily deteriorates. Over the past seven years, the president squandered the financial resources and international goodwill our nation had when he came into office. Because of this, American families are facing tough times, and they are ready for a change. “Unfortunately, the president's State of the Union address offered little direction or inspiration for America's future. His claim that No Child Left Behind is a success drew laughs from Republicans and Democrats alike. And one of the few ideas he had - privatizing public education - is a non-starters on both sides of the aisle. “Like many of my fellow Americans, I am looking for a president who offers bold solutions to problems like climate change, our dependency on foreign oil and the millions of Americans without health care. We especially need a president who will bring our troops home as quickly and safely as possible and will implement a diplomatic strategy for quelling and containing violence in Iraq. But most important, we need a president who values bipartisanship and problem-solving over political rhetoric and pandering. “Our nation faces many challenges, but with the right leadership, I am confident that the state of our union can once again be strong. Over the past year, Congress has begun to take our county in a new direction. We've made strides toward energy independence, better care for our veterans, lowering the cost of college and improved national security. However, Congress acknowledges we have much more to do. I look forward to working with a president who shares this commitment.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
01.23.2008	House Tries Again to Give Neediest Children Health Care January 23, 2008 WASHINGTON - Today, the House of Representatives tried for the second time to override the President's veto of a bipartisan children's healthcare bill, which would help millions of families who are unable to afford health insurance. Unfortunately, only 260 members voted in support of the bill, which is less than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), who voted in favor of the override, noted that this is an especially devastating blow to millions of families that are struggling under increasingly challenging economic conditions. “Thousands of families in Northern California are unable to cope with the rising cost of heat, food, gas and health care. And as unemployment in California grows, so does the number of people without health insurance. As our economy worsens, providing health coverage for the children from the neediest families is more critical than ever,” said Thompson. The bill continues coverage for the 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). It also extends coverage to 4 million uninsured children who qualify for the program, but aren't currently enrolled. In addition, the bill includes changes requested by President Bush after his first veto, such as making sure the lowest-income children are served first. However, despite these changes, the President vetoed the bill a second time. “As our country faces an economic crisis, the president played politics with the health of our neediest kids and too many of my colleagues in Congress followed his lead today,” said Thompson. “This bill was crafted by Republicans and Democrats and it is supported by 43 governors and the vast majority of Americans. Had Members of Congress voted in the best interest of their constituents, today's veto override would not have failed.” Economic conditions in California combined with the state's budget shortfalls make expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program especially critical. California's unemployment rate was more than 6% in December, one of the highest rates in the nation. As the housing market collapses and gas and energy prices rise, more families will be unable to provide their children with health care.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
12.19.2007	Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed a final version of the Energy Independence and Security Act, landmark energy legislation that will make our country more energy independent, cut energy costs for families and reduce global warming. The legislation was passed by a vote of 314-100 and will be sent to the president, who is expected to sign the bill into law today. “The Energy Independence and Security Act is an historic step toward improving our environment and decreasing our dependency on foreign oil,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “This legislation is going to have a tremendous impact on our country's future and will save Americans billions in gas and energy costs.” H.R. 6 will increase vehicle fuel efficiency to 35 miles per gallon in 2020 - the first congressional increase in 32 years - and slash U.S. oil consumption by more than 4 million barrels per day by 2030. The legislation also expands the use of American-grown biofuels to 36 billion gallons in 2022 and increases the efficiency of buildings, homes, appliances and lighting. “Millions of American families are struggling with the rising cost of energy and gasoline,” added Thompson. “This bill sets our country on a course toward reining in these prices while simultaneously conserving our natural resources.” Unfortunately, provisions in the original bill that would have strengthened and extended tax credits for renewable energies like solar, geothermal and biomass were dropped by the Senate in order to secure a majority of support. “These provisions would have helped American households and businesses save money and reduce their carbon footprint. I'm extremely disappointed they were removed by the Senate,” said Thompson. “However, I'll work to ensure we complete the greening of our tax code as soon as possible next year.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
12.13.2007	Last night, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted to bring immediate tax relief to 23 million American families who would otherwise pay higher taxes under the alternative minimum tax (AMT), including 42,000 families in California's 1st Congressional District. The AMT Relief Act (H.R. 4351) is completely paid for, meaning the tax relief would not add to our national debt. “This Administration has presided over seven years of fiscal mismanagement: spending has skyrocketed, entitlements have expanded and taxes have been cut - without any regard to the bottom line,” said Congressman Thompson. “As a result, our budgets haven't balanced, our surpluses turned into deficits, our national debt exploded and our borrowing from other countries more than doubled. If there was ever a time when fiscal discipline was paramount, it is today.” This bill would extend the one-year AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits and increase the AMT exemption to $66,250 for joint filers and $44,350 for single filers, ensuring that no additional taxpayers are liable for the AMT this year. “The AMT was created to fairly tax multi-millionaires, not burden middle-class families,” said Thompson. “Congress is committed to making sure millions of Americans do not end up with a tax hike next year.” In addition to a temporary relief from the AMT, the bill also provides additional tax cuts to an estimated 12 million families by enhancing the child tax credit. The bill lowers the income eligibility floor to $8,500. “We pay for this tax relief by closing loopholes that allow tax avoidance for wealthy folks who move their money off-shore,” added Thompson. “And we take what we gain from closing that loophole to pay for middle-class tax relief.” Although the end of the year is approaching, Congressional leaders have been in constant communication with the IRS to ensure that tax forms will account for the AMT relief and the 2007 filing season is as seamless as possible.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
12.06.2007	Today, the House of Representatives passed landmark legislation to decrease the nation's dependence on foreign oil and reduce our emission of greenhouse gases. In addition, the Energy Independence and Security Act (H.R. 6) is poised to reduce energy and gas prices, create new jobs and strengthen national security. It also provides historic tax incentives for businesses and homes that become more energy efficient or switch to clean, renewable energy sources. “The steps we took today to promote energy independence and the protection of our natural resources will improve the lives of generations of Americans,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), who voted in favor of the bill. “Our dependence on foreign oil has serious consequences for our economy and national security. And our dependence on greenhouse-gas-emitting energy sources is putting the health of the entire planet at risk. This Congress has made an historic commitment to redefining American energy consumption, and this legislation is a large step toward achieving that goal.” One of the bill's most groundbreaking provisions would increase fuel economy standards (also known as CAFE standards) to 35 miles per gallon by 2020 for new cars and trucks, which will save Americans money at the pump. In addition, it will reduce oil consumption by 1.1 million gallons per day in 2020 (one-half of what we currently import from the Persian Gulf) and reduce greenhouse gases equal to taking 28 million of today's average cars and trucks off the road. This is the first increase in CAFE standards by Congress since 1975. The legislation would also make a robust investment in American biofuel production. This includes a focus on diversifying the crops used in biofuels so that states from coast to coast will benefit from the provision. It would require utility companies to generate 15 percent of their energy from renewable sources, such as wind, solar, ocean tides and geothermal. It would also strengthen and extend renewable energy tax credits, which Congressman Thompson championed as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. These include a long-term extension of tax credits for businesses and homes that use solar power, as well as other improvements to make the tax credit a better value for homeowners. In addition, there is a four-year extension of the production tax credit for other forms of renewable energy, including many forms which are produced in the 1st Congressional District such as biomass and geothermal. Other incentives include: - A tax incentive for the installation of energy management devices known as smart meters, which give consumers near real-time access to their energy usage information; - An extension of a tax credit for homes that make energy-efficient improvements or purchase energy-efficient devices; - A new tax credit for plug-in electric vehicles; and - Allowing employers to include the cost of employees commuting by bike in any transportation benefits they may provide. “With the way energy costs are skyrocketing, we need to do everything we can to make energy-efficient homes, businesses and vehicles more available and affordable,” said Thompson. “Investments in renewable energy not only improve our environment - they will create more American jobs and help us to better control our country's future.” The measure also repeals about $21 billion in tax subsidies for Big Oil, which is similar to provisions included in H.R. 6 when it was passed by the House in January. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
12.04.2007	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement on the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which found that Iran had halted its efforts to build a nuclear weapon in 2003: "During my telephone town hall meeting in November, a woman from our district expressed her concern that the Bush Administration was threatening to use military force against Iran. I told her I am equally concerned by the president's saber rattling. I also said that I thought the president's rhetoric was inappropriate and unjustified. "I said that because, as chairman of a House Intelligence Subcommittee, I was briefed on the development of the NIE. However, what's most alarming to me is that while I received that information two months ago, the Bush Administration knew about it well before I did, yet the president continued with his war bravado. As recently as October, he said that Iran's efforts to create nuclear technology could result in World War III. "It is inappropriate that an Administration which led our country into an ill-advised war in Iraq based on faulty intelligence could be so apparently irresponsible with intelligence on Iran. Their efforts to frighten and mislead the American public are wrong." ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
11.09.2007	Today, the House passed a bill that would provide millions of middle-class families with tax relief and help grow our economy without increasing the national deficit. One of the most important provisions in this bill would protect 23 million middle-class families from being hit by the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), including more than 42,000 families in California's 1st Congressional District. “The AMT was created to make sure multi-millionaires were paying their fair share. It was never designed to hit middle-class families,” said Congressman Mike Thompson, who voted in favor of the Temporary Tax Relief Act of 2007 (H.R. 3996). “This bill is going to bring tax relief to tens of thousands of working families throughout our district. And it's not going to increase the national deficit by one cent.” In regards to the AMT, this bill would provide one-year AMT relief for nonrefundable personal credits and increase the AMT exemption amount to $66,250 for joint filers and $44,350 for individuals. In addition to fixing the AMT, this bill would: Provide 30 million American homeowners with property tax relief; Help 12 million families by expanding the child tax credit; Help 4.5 million families better afford college with the tuition deduction; Save 3.4 million teachers money with a deduction for classroom expenses; and Provide thousands of American troops in combat with tax relief under the Earned Income Tax Credit. “The new Majority in Congress made a firm commitment to fiscal responsibility,” said Thompson. “This bill provides millions of hard-working Americans with much-needed tax relief, without passing the cost onto our grandchildren and without borrowing from foreign countries, such as China. And it will provide significant help to Americans trying to achieve the dream of homeownership and higher education.” The bill would also help spur economic growth. The Temporary Tax Relief Act would extend tax incentives targeting small businesses and provides assistance to homeowners facing foreclosure or bankruptcy. The bill also contains provisions modeled upon two pieces of legislation authored by Congressman Thompson. H.R. 1576 would make permanent tax incentives to landowners who conserve our country's agricultural land and open spaces. H.R. 1304 would improve the manner in which motor sports complexes may depreciate facility-related expenses. The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311 or (703) 338-4480.
11.08.2007	Today, the Senate voted to override the president's veto of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) by a strong bipartisan majority, making the bill law. The House voted to override his veto Tuesday night. WRDA authorizes hundreds of vital infrastructure projects across the country that will help restore wetlands, protect communities from catastrophic floods and enhance natural resources, including several projects within the 1st Congressional District. "The past three Congresses failed to pass WRDA, and when the new Majority in Congress made sure its passage was a top priority, the president vetoed it,” said Congressman Mike Thompson, who voted in favor of the override. “Fortunately, Congress voted to override the president's veto with a strong, bipartisan majority. Communities across the country have waited too long to repair aging infrastructure that's putting their residents and businesses at risk.” The president vetoed the bill for being “fiscally irresponsible,” yet this bill does not spend one cent. It is a multi-year authorization bill; spending only occurs when Congress later appropriates funds for projects. “Much of our nation's flood control and navigation infrastructure is out of date,” said Thompson. “Many environmental restoration projects are struggling with inadequate funding. This bill authorizes the government to spend the money necessary to keep our communities safe. It's an excellent example of how this Congress is working to address the priorities of the American people.”###CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311 or (703) 338-4480.
10.25.2007	Today, the House of Representatives again passed a bipartisan bill to provide health coverage to more than 10 million children. This bill strengthens language that the president claimed to be problematic in the previous version, which he vetoed in September. “The president alleged that the first bill covered illegal immigrants, which couldn't be further from the truth,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), who voted in favor of the bill. “However, the new bill clearly spells out the process by which states must verify citizenship before enrolling new beneficiaries, ensuring that the SCHIP program only serves U.S. citizens.” “The president also alleged that the bill covered children in families with incomes of $83,000,” added Thompson. “The new bill specifically prohibits the Administration from issuing waivers that allow children in families with income over 300% of the poverty level to enroll in SCHIP.” “Today's vote demonstrates that Congress refuses to let politics get in the way of taking care of our children,” said Thompson. “We'll do whatever it takes to get these 10 million kids covered.” The bill still continues coverage for the 6.6 million children currently enrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), including more than 1,600 children in Lake County. It also extends coverage to 4 million uninsured children who qualify for the program, but aren't currently enrolled. “The first SCHIP bill was born out of bipartisan compromise, and today's bill is a further gesture that we are committed to working across the aisle to create strong, effective policy,” said Thompson. “There is simply no room for playing politics when it comes to the health of our kids. This bill passed with an overwhelming bipartisan vote and is supported by 43 governors and the vast majority of Americans. We cannot and will not give up on the health and the future of our children.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
10.18.2007	Today, the House fell 13 votes short in an attempt to override President Bush's veto of a bill to reauthorize the popular State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). “Unfortunately, Members of Congress who chose to walk lock-step with the president rather than represent their constituents have kept millions of children from getting the health care they desperately need,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “This bipartisan bill will provide coverage to more than 10 million children from families that can't afford private insurance,” continued Thompson. “In addition to being supported by the vast majority of Americans, this bill is supported by 43 governors and hundreds of health-related organizations, including the health insurance companies. And, it's completely paid for. Those Members of Congress who voted against this bill and then call themselves compassionate conservatives should take a long, hard look in the mirror.” Specifically, this legislation would continue coverage for 6.6 million children and extend coverage to 4 million children who qualify, but are not currently enrolled. California has already identified 200,000 uninsured children who could benefit from this program if the current bill became law. “This bill is the product of months of compromise between Democrats and Republicans, so when opponents say they're waiting for a compromise bill, they're blowing a lot of hot air,” said Thompson. “Claims that this bill provides coverage to adults and illegal immigrants or raises the income eligibility are equally false. This bill does not change the eligibility for SCHIP at all. It simply increases the resources available for SCHIP so kids who aren't currently enrolled but qualify can get the coverage they need.” An override of the president's veto requires a two-thirds majority, and today's vote was 13 votes short. “We're going to continue to fight for this bill until we prevail,” said Thompson. “Reauthorizing SCHIP in order to expand health care for our children is a fight we cannot afford to lose.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
10.02.2007	Last weekend, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) was presented with the Sierra Club's Edgar Wayburn Award for passing legislation that permanently protects 273,000 acres of wilderness in Northern California. The award is given annually in recognition of service to the environment by a person in government. Thompson was joined by other Sierra Club award winners, including former Vice President Al Gore and author and New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman. “Northern California's commitment to protecting our rich natural resources should be an example for the entire country,” said Thompson. “I am pleased to receive this award, and I hope it helps further our efforts to protect our country's wild spaces and threatened and endangered species.” “Congressman Thompson's environmental record has been exemplary throughout his career in public life, and that consistently high standard was raised to a new level in 2006, when the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act became law,” said Sierra Club president, Robbie Cox. The award was presented to Congressman Thompson on September 29th during the Sierra Club's Annual Dinner in San Francisco. During the ceremony, Gore was presented with the John Muir Award for his work to raise awareness of climate change and Friedman was presented with the David R. Brower Award for his stories pertaining to the environment. Thompson's award recognized his successful passage of the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act (H.R. 233) in the 109th Congress, designating 273,000 acres of federal lands in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino and Napa Counties as wilderness in perpetuity. The bill also designates 21 miles of Scenic River and approximately 51,000 acres as a Recreation Management Area for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. It was signed into law in October, 2006.### CONTACT: Anne Warden (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
09.20.2007	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement after the House of Representatives passed the FAA Reauthorization: “Today, the House sent a clear message to the flying public: everyone has a right to be treated decently and fairly while on a plane or in an airport, especially during excessive delays. “For too long, we've heard story after story of paying customers being subjected to uncomfortable and sometimes unsafe conditions when flights are delayed or cancelled. Right now, airline passengers aren't guaranteed access to clean drinking water, food, bathrooms or medical care. They can also be held on a plane for hours on end against their will. “I believe this is unacceptable, which is why I introduced the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights (HR 1303) in March, which requires airlines to provide passengers with the basic necessities during delays and allows passengers to get off the plane when delays became excessive. Today, the House voted on these key provisions in the FAA Reauthorization bill, taking a large step toward securing passenger rights. “The inclusion of passenger rights in the FAA Reauthorization bill is a big win. However, we must make sure this legislation not only becomes law, but also does the job. We'll be keeping a close watch on whether the airlines use this as opportunity to improve the way they treat passengers.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov. The House FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) Reauthorization (H.R. 2881) requires airlines and airports to have emergency contingency plans to take care of passengers who are involved in long flight and tarmac delays, including plans on deplaning after a lengthy delay. These plans must account for the provision of food, water, clean restrooms and medical care for passengers. The Department of Transportation can fine those who fail to develop or comply with these plans.
09.19.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), author of the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights (HR 1303) announced to a crowd on the National Mall that the House's FAA Reauthorization legislation will require airlines and airports to deplane passengers after excessive delays. In addition, the legislation includes another provision from Thompson's bill, which will require airlines to provide passengers with food, clean drinking water, usable bathrooms, proper ventilation and medical care during delays. “This is a tremendous victory for everyone who flies,” said Thompson. “Right now, passengers have no assurance that they'll be given basic necessities when planes are delayed. They could be kept on planes against their will for hours and hours. I introduced the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights because I believe passengers deserve to be treated decently and fairly when they fly, especially when there are excessive delays. The language in the FAA Reauthorization is a huge step toward making that happen.” Since Thompson introduced HR 1303 in March, excessive airplane delays have continued and the public's outrage has grown. With the help of the Coalition for an Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, Thompson has added 49 Members of the House as co-sponsors to his bill. Inclusion of HR 1303's key provisions in the FAA Reauthorization demonstrates Congress' determination to improve the airlines' treatment of passengers, and it is a victory for the flying public. “Millions of Americans depend on the airlines for work and pleasure, and we want to make sure they can continue to serve us,” added Thompson. “I think this bill will help the airlines by providing an industry standard for the treatment of passengers.” A manager's amendment to the FAA Reauthorization requires the airlines and airports to submit their plans for handling delays to the Department of Transportation (DOT); however, the DOT may establish minimum standards for the plans. Within nine months of the date of enactment, the Secretary of the DOT shall review, approve or require modifications to the plans. If the airlines or airports do not follow their plans, the DOT can impose civil penalties. “I thank the thousands of people who have joined our effort to create a Passengers Bill of Rights, especially the Coalition for an Airline Passengers Bill of Rights,” said Thompson. “We now need to focus on getting these critical provisions through the House and Senate conference and onto the president's desk.”### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
09.10.2007	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement on the testimony given by General Petraeus: “General Petraeus' report was just a thinly guised veil of President Bush's routine excuses for continuing war. While his intentions may be good, the General only confirms my belief that redeployment should begin immediately. “After nearly five years in Iraq, it is abundantly clear that the Iraqi government will not take responsibility for securing its country as long as our troops are doing it for them. Just this January, President Bush said that with the support of 30,000 more U.S. troops, the Iraqi government planned to secure their county by this November. But a GAO report out just last week finds that the Iraqi government is nowhere close to controlling their country. Even worse, another recent report on the Iraqi security forces found that the Iraqi police force and the agency that oversees it are overrun with corruption and sectarianism. “The president also said in January that if the Iraqi government does not make progress, it will lose the support of the American people. I believe the American people have lost faith in the Iraqi government and in President Bush's failed strategies. For our own safety and that of the Iraqi people, we need a new direction in Iraq - one that puts our resources into finding a diplomatic strategy for quelling the violence in Iraq and rooting out terrorism both in Iraq and around the globe. “We are far beyond envisioning our troops home, as General Petraeus has implied. The American people want to see all of their troops home as soon as possible, period.” ### Congressman Thompson has been a vocal critic of the war since before it began. He recently introduced a bill (HR 3071), which calls for redeployment of troops out of Iraq to begin immediately, while simultaneously requiring the president to work with the United Nations to implement a region-wide strategy for containing Iraq's civil war.
08.27.2007	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement in response to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: “The evidence that U.S. attorneys were fired for political purposes has mounted for almost a year, and the credibility of our nation's justice system has increasingly suffered. Rather than â€˜fix the problems' as he promised, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has only stonewalled Congress' attempt to hold the Bush Administration accountable and has given questionable testimony about his own involvement. His resignation was long overdue. Moreover, if the investigations find that the law was broken or justice obstructed, Gonzales should face charges. “I hope the president will use this as an opportunity to bring integrity back to the office of the Attorney General by appointing a nominee who holds the law above politics and aims to strengthen, not diminish, our civil liberties. “This is also an opportunity to re-examine the continuation of warrantless surveillance. The House Intelligence Committee will be crafting new legislation to replace the flawed Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the law that governs the surveillance of foreign targets for intelligence purposes. We need a law that allows us to collect information on those who threaten our nation's security, without violating the rights of law-abiding Americans. FISA should also be altered to ensure that an independent court, not the Bush Administration, determines when the communications of Americans need to be monitored.”### Congressman Mike Thompson (CA-01) is Chairman of the House Intelligence Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence. Five months ago, Thompson sent a letter to President Bush calling for the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.

08.04.2007	Today, the House of Representatives passed the most significant energy reform legislation in over a decade. The New Direction for Energy Independence, National Security, and Consumer Protection Act (HR 3221 & HR 2776) will make an historic investment in new energy technologies and renewable energy, improve energy efficiency for a wide array of products, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions significantly. “Our district is on the cutting edge of many new energy technologies: the Geysers are the largest complex of geothermal power plants in the world; we have numerous world class wineries that are powered by solar energy,” said Rep. Thompson. “Our universities have also been leaders - from UC Davis' development of the plug-in vehicle to the cutting edge biofuels research being conducted at Humboldt State. This bill improves and expands federal incentives for the development of these types of renewable and alternative energy, so communities across the nation can follow our lead.” The legislation extends federal tax credits for the production of biomass, geothermal, wind, and many other types of renewable energy. The solar investment tax credit is extended for eight years, providing long-term stability for the solar energy industry; also extended are the Biodiesel and Renewable Diesel tax credits. Additionally the legislation creates new monetary incentives and expands existing credits for taxpayers to make their homes and their businesses more energy efficient. The bill also makes a first-time investment in new technology known as “smart meters,” which will allow consumers to better manage their electricity usage during peak hours. This is of critical importance to states like California, where electricity infrastructure is already stressed and overloaded. Lastly, the bill sets ambitious goals that will help lower the country's carbon emissions and reduce our dependence on tradition fossil fuels. Utility companies would be required to meet a renewable energy portfolio standard whereby 15 percent of their energy must be derived from renewable sources by the year 2020. “This legislation makes a long overdue investment in renewable energy, and it does so without increasing the budget deficit by a single dime,” said Thompson. “As I have said many times in the past, we cannot drill our way to energy independence. We have no choice but to fully embrace the renewable energy sources and innovative technologies available to us; and this bill does just that.”###
08.03.2007	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) secured $300,000 from the FY08 “Commerce, Justice, Science” spending bill for a new public safety microwave system for Mendocino County. The system will help law enforcement, fire protection and emergency medical services communicate with one another during emergencies. It will also increase access to broadband Internet and phone communications, which is much-needed in many of our rural communities. “Effective and fast communication between first responders is a critical way to keep people safe during an emergency,” said Thompson. “This funding will go toward helping Mendocino Co.'s first responders obtain the state-of-the-art communications equipment they need to alert each other and local residents when a crisis strikes.” The current communications system in Mendocino County will be obsolete in a few years, making this funding imperative. This new system will be capable of handling Mendocino County's secure high-speed data transmission needs, such as mobile data terminals, secure video conferencing, biometric identification, infrastructure security applications and other sources of digital traffic. Apart from the above capabilities, it will fill the requirement standards established by the Department of Homeland Security for secure data transmissions.### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225- 331, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
08.03.2007	Rep. Mike Thompson secured approximately $39.4 million for local agriculture priorities and research in the FY08 agriculture spending bill, which was passed last night by the House of Representatives. “Agriculture is a vital part of our local economy, which is why I've made supporting agriculture one of my top priorities in Congress,” said Thompson. “The success of our farmers and ranchers depends on protecting their crops from harmful pests and disease, and this funding will better equip them to do just that.” The $39.4 million includes funding for the following projects: -$32.247 million- Pierce's Disease, Research and Control - Pierce's Disease is a harmful plant virus that is spread by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. In the late 1990's, this pest was responsible for the complete destruction of more than 1,000 acres of grapevines in Temecula that cost growers and the California economy tens of millions of dollars. This funding will be allocated to plant inspection programs and viticulture research institutions. -$3.172 million- Sudden Oak Death, Research and Control - Sudden Oak Death is a fungus-like pathogen that has decimated oak trees, and can even infect other plant species like our prized Redwood trees. This disease has stricken at least 12 of California's counties and has spread to the Pacific Northwest. This funding will be allocated to the research, eradication and control of this pathogen. -$826,638- Olive Fruit Fly, Research and Control - The Olive Fruit Fly is the world's most disastrous olive pest and has infested thousands of acres of California's olive groves, jeopardizing the state's vital olive oil and table olive industries. -$2.69 million- Viticulture and Tree Crop Research - This funding will support the planning and construction of a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)/ Agriculture Research Service (ARS) facility for advanced viticulture and tree crop research, which will be located at UC Davis. -$444,820 -Biological Broomweed Research - Exotic brooms (Spanish, French, Scotch, and Portuguese brooms) are invasive plants that cause economic and environmental losses to forestry, agriculture, and rangelands in the Western United States. This funding will allow the development of biological controls and re-vegetation technologies to combat these invasive and dangerous plants. “These diseases and pests have been a constant threat to the farms and ranches in our region,” added Thompson. “Thus far, our local efforts to control them have been successful, but it is important for us to continue these prevention efforts.” The bill must now be approved by the Senate before being sent to the president. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden (Thompson) at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
08.01.2007	Today, the House of Representatives passed the Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act of 2007 (The CHAMP Act, HR 3162). This historic legislation reauthorizes the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which provides health insurance coverage for millions of children in working families with incomes slightly too high to qualify for Medicaid. It also includes important Medicare provisions, which benefit providers and beneficiaries alike. “Keeping kids healthy today means that the government will inherit a healthier Medicare population tomorrow,” said Thompson during a speech on the House floor. “Investments in our children are both common sense and cost-effective.” The CHAMP Act maintains current SCHIP eligibility requirements, but it provides states with the resources needed for outreach to eligible children not yet enrolled in the program. As a result, five million new children will be able to obtain health care. The bill also makes critical changes to the Medicare program. Without this legislation, physician reimbursement rates would be slashed by 10 percent next year, and by an additional 5 percent in 2009. “This legislation will provide five million new kids with healthcare and millions of children already in the SCHIP program will keep their benefits,” added Thompson. “With this legislation, physicians will avoid the biggest rate cut in the history of the Medicare program, which would have triggered a mass exodus of doctors from Medicare. Today, Congress took an historic step and dramatically improved healthcare for millions of Americans.” The CHAMP Act also expands preventive healthcare available to Medicare beneficiaries, and it provides critical new funding for rural healthcare. “For many reasons, it's much harder for seniors in rural areas to access high-quality healthcare than it is for their urban counterparts,” said Thompson. “This bill extends key bonus payments for rural providers, ensuring that doctors, ambulances, home health agencies and other providers will keep their doors open in rural communities like ours.” Thompson also noted that the CHAMP Act does not increase the deficit. Consistent with the Democratic Majority's commitment to Pay-As-You-Go rules, of which Thompson is a long-time advocate, the CHAMP Act is fully funded. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
07.31.2007	Today, startling new evidence was revealed during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on whether government officials manipulated science in order to divert water from the Klamath River. The Depart of Commerce's Inspector General testified that department officials bypassed key oversight mechanisms when creating a biological opinion on how a water diversion would affect endangered fish in the Klamath. The final biological opinion, which was later found in violation of the Endangered Species Act, contributed to the deaths of 80,000 spawning salmon. “Today's hearing is clear evidence that the scientific process behind the water diversion was purposely manipulated by government officials,” said Thompson. “Sidestepping this process led to an illegal water plan that contributed to the largest adult salmon kill in the West.” The hearing was held by the House Natural Resources Committee in response to a request made by Thompson and 35 of his Democratic colleagues from California and Oregon. They called for the hearing because of the reported pressure Vice President Cheney placed upon the Department of Interior to, as the Washington Post stated in their June investigative report, “prioritize economic interests over protected fish.” The Post reported that the vice president called for water to be diverted from the Klamath River Basin to farms in Oregon in order to secure the farmers' votes. Vice President Cheney declined to testify at the hearing. However, testimony from the Department of Commerce's Inspector General, John M. Seeba, indicates that Department of Commerce bureaucrats did manipulate the science. While the vice president reportedly called a Department of Interior bureaucrat, Commerce and Interior worked in tandem to create the water diversion plan. “The history of political strong-arming in the Klamath is despicable,” added Thompson. “Fortunately, a silver lining has begun to form. Stakeholders in the Klamath River Basin are working together on a plan to recover the fish and help the farmers who need water for their land. I believe there is room for both the fishers and the farmers, but we must ensure the government's future involvement is transparent and honest. To that end, I am committed to continuing this investigation and improving the oversight process.” ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
07.27.2007	Today, the House approved the 2007 Farm Bill, which will govern federal agriculture and food programs. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) applauded the inclusion of programs for specialty crops, organic crops, conservation and enhancement of nutrition. “This farm bill is a change in direction from previous farm policy," said Thompson. “It gives specialty crops and organic crops a place at the table, while at the same time preserving the importance of conventional agriculture across the country." The bill includes an historic $1.6 billion in funding for fruit and vegetable programs, which have not received Farm Bill benefits in the past. Among other things, specialty crops will receive $38 million for technical assistance, $215 million to fund research on improving productivity and profitability, and $364 million in grants for research, education, pest and disease management and food safety. For the first time, organic crops also received funding - approximately $55 million for technical assistance and research. “This bill represents the diversity and bounty of American agriculture," added Thompson. “Fruits, vegetables and organic crops are the fastest growing segment of the agricultural economy, and we should be doing everything we can to help this industry continue to grow. This bill is a big win for California agriculture." The Farm Bill also provides assistance to agricultural land owners who implement conservation programs on their property. This year's bill includes more than $26 billion for conservation programs, a 25 percent increase from the 2002 Farm Bill. In addition, this year's bill extends the Wetlands Reserve Program, a voluntary incentive program that helps land owners restore wetlands. The bill also includes $300 million for a new program, the Regional Watershed Enhancement Program. This program funds cooperative agreements between agriculture producers and the government to improve regional water quality in rivers and regions like the Klamath River Basin. “Northern California has some of the best agricultural land in the world, but we are also home to critical wildlife habitats," said Thompson. “It's important that we provide our farmers and ranchers with the tools they need to conserve their land and the species that live on it. This bill will help ensure our land and animals are protected for future generations." The bill also takes critical steps that will expand renewable fuel production, encourage American energy independence and protect our environment. The measure boosts renewable energy programs by 600 percent, providing $2 billion in loan guarantees for the development of refineries that process renewable fuels, a key step toward bringing more renewable fuels to market in America. An additional and $1.5 billion for production incentives for ethanol and biodiesel made from agricultural, forest, and waste plant materials is also included. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov
07.27.2007	Earlier today, the House Ways and Means Committee, of which Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) is a member, approved major legislation extending health insurance coverage to millions of children and improving the Medicare program. The Children's Health and Medicare Protection Act (CHAMP Act) represents the government's most significant investment in children's healthcare since 1997. “This legislation makes it clear that improving our country's healthcare system is a top priority for Congress, particularly when it comes to taking better care of children, seniors and low-income Americans," said Thompson. Specifically, the legislation equips states with the tools and the means to find and enroll more than 80% of the six million kids eligible for but not enrolled in the State Children's Health Insurance Program. It also makes significant changes to our Medicare program, improving primary and preventive benefits for our seniors, strengthening low income assistance programs, and bringing payment parity to various Medicare providers. In addition, the bill eliminates the scheduled cuts in Medicare's physician reimbursement rates (10% in 2008 and 5% in 2009), and replaces them with a rate increase. This will impact doctors across the nation and preserve access to care in many communities, including those throughout California's 1st Congressional District. The CHAMP Act also expands reimbursement provisions critical to rural communities, which are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. These provisions directly benefit the 1st District, from increased reimbursements for rural ambulance services and rural home health services to bonus payments for physicians practicing in underserved areas. Thompson has coauthored legislation that many of these provisions were based upon, the H-CARE Act (HR 2860). “Rural communities often struggle to provide residents with access to doctors and medical services," said Thompson. “As a member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, I've consistently fought to improve healthcare in rural areas, and today we achieved a tremendous victory. This legislation will give rural counties a leg up in their efforts to attract high-quality healthcare providers." The bill also makes critical investments in Medicare's preventive benefits - keeping seniors healthier longer saves money in the long term and improves quality of life now. These investments include waivers for co-payments on many cancer screening benefits, and are also based upon legislation Congressman Thompson authored earlier this month (HR 3042). “Sixty percent of new cancer diagnoses and 70 percent of cancer deaths occur in people over 65, so we should be making it as easy as possible for seniors to get regular cancer screenings," said Thompson. “If we eliminate the Medicare co-pays, more seniors will get screened and stay healthier longer." Additional legislation authored by Thompson was also included in the CHAMP Act. Specifically, the act permanently waives Medicare's 60-day leave of absence limitation for National Guard and Reserve physicians called to active duty. This provision is based on Thompson's legislation, HR 3007. “These restrictions cause real hardships for physicians in the Armed Forces Reserve and the Guard, who are absent from their practices for much longer than 60 days when they are called up for active duty," said Thompson. “My legislation ensures that doctors in the Reserve and Guard only need to find one replacement doctor while they're gone. This will help more than 3,000 doctors protect their patients and practices when called to serve." Finally, the bill grants California the authority to continue providing adult day health services through the Medi-Cal program. With this authority in jeopardy late last year, Thompson forged a coalition of 37 Members of Congress from the eight impacted states to spearhead this change. Thompson is a senior Member of the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over the Medicare program. This legislation is expected to be considered by the full House next week, and must be reconciled with similar Senate legislation prior to being sent to the President and signed into law. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
07.17.2007	Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), John Murtha (D-PA), George Miller (D-CA) and Doris Matsui (D-CA) introduced legislation to immediately begin redeploying troops out of Iraq while simultaneously working with the United Nations to implement a region-wide strategy for containing Iraq's civil war. Thompson and his colleagues introduced this bill because there is no solid strategy for controlling the violence and political unrest in Iraq after U.S. troops redeploy. It is also clear that while U.S. troops are performing excellently, their ongoing presence in Iraq will not lead the Iraqi government to take control of its country. This bill will create a realistic exit strategy that brings our troops home and helps the Iraqi government take steps toward security. This legislation - the Iraq Redeployment and Regional Security Act - specifically calls for redeployment of U.S. troops to commence no later than 30 days after enactment, with all troops out within one year. It also requires that the president institutes a regional diplomatic plan, in conjunction with the United Nation's Security Council, to curtail and contain Iraq's civil war, prevent the establishment of al Qaeda safe havens and prevent genocide. The president must report to Congress every month on the status of the plan and the progress being made. Rep. Mike Thompson: “Our troops have done an amazing job, but keeping them in the middle of a civil war will not get the Iraqi government any closer to securing and rebuilding their country. Moreover, without a plan to keep Iraq's civil war from spilling over to neighboring countries, the chaos in Iraq will multiply exponentially throughout the Middle East, putting the world in even greater danger. We must have a sound diplomatic strategy to contain Iraq's civil war or we will face consequences we can't even imagine.” Rep. Doris Matsui: “The time has come for Congress to hold the President accountable for his failed policy in Iraq. We can no longer talk about the need for change; the American people are calling for a new plan for Iraq, and this critical legislation takes action to answer that call. This Congress is committed to delivering on its promise of a new direction and a return to the priorities of our country.” All four original co-authors of this bill voted in favor of the Iraq bill introduced by Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO) and last week, which would force the President to begin redeployment of U.S. troops within 120 days of enactment, with American forces out no later than March 31, 2008. They continue to support that bill, as well. The difference between the Skelton bill and the new bill, however, is two-fold: 1) This bill forces the president to begin withdrawal of American forces sooner than the other bill, and 2) this bill makes clear that the U.S. must engage the international community in the creation of a regional containment plan. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
07.17.2007	Today, the House passed the FY 2008 “Energy and Water” appropriations bill, including $8.5 million for the West Sacramento Flood Control Project. The funding, championed by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), will be used to address deficiencies in the current levee design. “The safety of West Sacramento's 43,000 residents depends on the city's levees,” said Thompson. “We learned a painful lesson from Hurricane Katrina about what happens when we wait too long to fix levee problems. This funding will be used to survey the levees, identify areas for improvement and make those improvements happen.” The Sacramento urban area is widely recognized as being the most vulnerable to flooding of any urbanized area in the country with the exception of New Orleans. Five years ago, the Army Corps of Engineers planned, designed and constructed a project to provide the city flood protection. However, certain areas of the project have failed to perform during winter conditions and must be studied and remedied. In addition to this funding, yesterday, West Sacramento property owners approved a $42 million assessment package for local flood protection. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
07.12.2007	Today, Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Jim Ramstad (R-MN) introduced legislation to improve beneficiary access to Medicare's cancer screening services. The Medicare Early Detection of Cancer Promotion Act will waive co-pays for colonoscopy and mammography services and extend the eligibility period for the “Welcome to Medicare” visit from the current time frame of six months to one year. “The vast majority of cancer diagnoses and deaths happen to older Americans, so we should be making it as easy as possible for seniors to get regular cancer screenings,” said Thompson. Sixty percent of new cancer diagnoses and 70 percent of cancer deaths occur in people over 65. “Co-pays for these services create a barrier to care,” added Thompson. “If we eliminate the co-pays, more seniors will get screened, saving lives and money.” “Nearly 100,000 Americans will die this year from colorectal and breast cancer, yet many of these deaths could have been prevented” said Ramstad. “By passing the Medicare Early Detection of Cancer Promotion Act, we can expand access to life-saving colonoscopy and mammography services, services that are truly the first line of defense in preventing cancer deaths.” Currently, beneficiaries pay no coinsurance for most cancer screening services covered by Medicare, but they must pay a 20 percent co-pay for colonoscopy and mammography services. This legislation will eliminate co-pays for mammograms and colonoscopies, prompting more seniors to utilize these live-saving services. In addition to saving lives, promoting cancer prevention also saves Medicare - and the American taxpayer - money. Preventive services cost considerably less than caring for people with cancer. For example, Medicare pays between $200 and $400 for a colonoscopy - but if colon cancer mestastasizes, total costs of care can exceed $58,000 per patient. The efficacy of cancer prevention screening is clear. When caught in the first stages, the five year survival rate for breast cancer is 98 percent and the five year survival rate for colorectal cancer is 90 percent. However, if these cancers move into more advanced stages, the survival rates are only 26 percent for breast cancer and 10 percent for colorectal cancer. This legislation will also increase the number of seniors who seek cancer prevention services by extending the “Welcome to Medicare” period. During these physicals, Medicare beneficiaries can take advantage of certain screening and preventive health services and learn about others. Currently, fewer than 5 percent of new beneficiaries are seeking appointments for the “Welcome to Medicare” visit, and extending the eligibility period means that more people will be able to benefit from it. Thompson and Ramstad are both members of the Ways & Means Health Subcommittee. ###
07.12.2007	Yesterday evening, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted for the largest single investment in college financial aid in more than 60 years. This legislation approved by the House will help millions of students and families pay for college - at no cost to the American taxpayer. The College Cost Reduction Act of 2007 (HR 2669) increases college aid by $18 billion over the next five years. This bill pays for itself by reducing the excessive federal subsidies being paid to the college loan industry. The House voted in favor of this legislation 273-149. “The best way to grow our economy and strengthen our middle class is by helping more people attend college,” said Thompson. “Unfortunately, every year, about 200,000 American students hold off on going to college or skip it altogether because they can't afford it. Our country was built on the principle that everyone can better themselves, and I'm proud that we are taking this step to make higher education accessible to more Americans.” This legislation reduces the cost of college in three important ways. - First, the maximum value of the Pell Grant scholarship will increase by $500 over the next five years. About 6 million low- and moderate-income students would benefits from this increase. - Second, this legislation would cut student loan interest rates in half, which will benefit millions of borrowers. Like legislation passed by the House earlier this year, interest rates will be cut from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent, saving the average borrower $4,400 over the life of the loan. - Third, this bill prevents student borrowers from facing unmanageable levels of federal student debt by guaranteeing that borrowers will never have to spend more than 15 percent of their yearly discretionary income on loan repayments and by allowing borrowers in economic hardship to have their loans forgiven after 20 years. “Tuition prices have skyrocketed for years, meaning more and more students and families are taking on increasing amounts of debt,” added Thompson. “Their debt burden makes it extremely hard to fulfill dreams of homeownership, a family and retirement security. This bill will make it easier for millions of Americans to achieve the goal of a college education.” The College Cost Reduction Act includes a number of other provisions that will ease the financial burden imposed on students and families by the cost of college, including: - Tuition assistance for excellent undergraduate students who agree to teach in the nation's public schools; - Loan forgiveness for college graduates that go into public service professions; - Increased federal loan limits so that students won't have to rely as heavily on costlier private loans; New tuition cost containment strategies; and - Landmark investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions and minority serving institutions.
06.29.2007	Yesterday, the House Transportation Committee released the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) authorization bill, including language from Rep. Mike Thompson's (D-CA) "Passengers Bill of Rights." This is the first time that passenger rights have been included in both the House and the Senate versions of the FAA Authorization. "This is good news for American travelers," said Thompson. "Right now, passengers are at the mercy of the airlines. When delays occur, passengers have absolutely no assurance that they'll be provided with basic necessities, like food, drinking water and a reasonable temperature. This bill is an initial step toward ensuring passengers are treated fairly and decently when flying." The House FAA Authorization bill requires that airlines develop emergency contingency plans, including how each aircraft will "provide food, water, restroom facilities, cabin ventilation and access to medical treatment" during delays. It also requires that airlines make a plan for accessing facilities and gates during an emergency or extended delays so passengers can deplane. The House Transportation Committee conducted a mark-up of the bill today. The Senate version of the FAA Authorization has already been finalized, but has not been voted on by the full Senate. In March, Thompson introduced comprehensive Airline Passenger Bill of Rights legislation, which requires airlines provide passengers with basic necessities during delays and deplane passengers after a 4 hour delay (or 3 hours if departure is unlikely to occur before 4 hours). His bill also calls on the Department of Transportation and the FAA to review airport policies and infrastructure to help ensure airlines can meet these new standards. "While the FAA Authorization language is a good start, we need concrete standards for the treatment of passengers, including a limit to the amount of time people are held on the tarmac" added Thompson. "The airlines have promised Congress multiple times that they'd stop stranding passengers, but nothing has changed. We want to keep our airlines in business, but there must be a minimum standard for treatment of passengers." "The coalition is encouraged that now both the House and Senate FAA bills include the concept of passenger rights," said Kate Hanni, Executive Director of the Coalition for an Airline Passenger's Bill of Rights. "We intend to work with our champions, Sens. Barbara Boxer and Olympia Snowe and Rep. Mike Thompson, through the floor and conference process to make sure that the final bill guarantees stranded passengers enforceable rights including a clear and explicit right to deplane when left on the tarmac. While we are excited that passenger rights is further down the runway than ever before in Congress, the bills aren't ready for takeoff." The FAA Authorization also requires the Department of Transportation to provide monthly statistics on diverted flights and the amount of time passengers are held on an aircraft during diversions. This is the first time the government would be collecting this information, and Thompson applauded the committee for including it. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.28.2007	Today, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources reviewed North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson's bill to permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The Northern California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act (H.R. 2758), which Thompson introduced last week, provides protection to the unique and productive marine environment along Northern California's outer continental shelf. "Every year there are attacks against the congressional moratorium on domestic drilling, and I am concerned that one day it might be lifted," said Thompson during today's hearing. "There are some areas of our country's Outer Continental Shelf where permanent protection is sensible and absolutely necessary. My district, which comprises the longest coastline of any congressional district in the continental U.S. and one third of the California coast, is an area that deserves such protection." The West Coast is one of only four major upwelling regions in the world, which are areas that support extremely abundant and productive marine life. These upwelling regions include many of the world's most important fisheries, such as the North Coast fisheries. Drilling for gas and oil off the Northern Coast of California could cause serious harm to the rich marine life found off the coast, including the fish many local North Coast economies depend on. In addition, Northern California's thriving tourism industry could suffer from drilling. "An oil spill along the North Coast would be disastrous to our unique marine life, pristine beaches and spectacular views," said Thompson. "In addition, given the rural and rugged nature of my district, there would be limited accessibility and resources available for clean up. My bill will ensure a spill never happens." ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-331, (703) 338-4480 and anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.28.2007	The day after Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) called for an investigation into Vice President Cheney's role in the death of 80,000 spawning salmon, the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee announced he will be holding a hearing. In response to a letter by Thompson and 35 of his Democratic colleagues from California and Oregon, Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-WV) released the following statement: response to a letter by Thompson and 35 of his Democratic colleagues from California and Oregon, Chairman Nick J. Rahall (D-WV) released the following statement: "This Committee has already begun examining the penchant for this Administration to favor politics over science in the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, which was highlighted during a May 9th hearing and in the resignation of the Interior Department's Deputy Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks over the fiasco. "In light of the revelations being made over the situation in the Klamath River Basin, it is my intention to again convene the Committee to delve into the issues raised by the Members of Congress from California and Oregon. It certainly appears this Administration will stop at nothing to achieve political gain from natural resources disasters. Ultimately, it will be hardworking Americans and their healthy environment that will lose if we fail to act." The request by West Coast Democrats came after a Washington Post investigative report found that Vice President Cheney instigated the damaging water policy that resulted in the largest salmon kill and fishing disaster in our nation's history. The Post indicates that Cheney manipulated scientific evidence in order to win votes from farmers who would benefit from the diversion. "I am pleased that Chairman Rahall is committed to getting to bottom of the vice president's involvement," said Thompson. "The courts found that this water policy was in direct violation of the Endangered Species Act, and the American public should know if their vice president caused science to be manipulated for petty political gain." ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.27.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), along with 35 California and Oregon Members of Congress, called for congressional hearings on Vice President Dick Cheney's involvement in the political decision that killed 80,000 spawning salmon. They made this request to House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Nick Rahall (D-WV) after a Washington Post investigative report found that Cheney pressured mid-level bureaucrats in the Department of Interior to divert water from the Klamath River Basin for political gain. "We've known since 2002 that the Bush Administration manipulated science in a perverse and petty attempt to win votes," said Thompson. "Now it appears that this manipulation goes straight to the top. Despite what he may think, Vice President Cheney is not above the law and not above Congress' oversight. We want a thorough investigation of his involvement in the largest salmon kill and fishing disaster in our nation's history." In 2002, the Interior Department diverted water from the Klamath River Basin to farmers in Oregon, resulting in the death of 80,000 adult salmon. The Washington Post reports that Vice President Cheney called for the damaging water policy to secure the farmer's votes, despite scientific evidence that it would endanger two federal protected species of fish, a violation of the Endangered Species Act. Thompson and others brought a lawsuit against the Administration in 2002, and three courts found that the water diversion was "arbitrary and capricious and in violation of the Endangered Species Act." In the letter to Chairman Rahall, the Members wrote, "The ramifications of that salmon kill are still being felt today as returns to the Klamath River are so low that commercial, sport and tribal fishing seasons have been curtailed for the past three years. In fact, last year's commercial fishing season for all of California and Oregon was cut by over 90 percent, and was the largest commercial fishing closure in the history of the country, causing over $60 million in damages to coastal economies." "Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of Vice President Cheney choosing political gain over the health and welfare of the American people and our natural resources," added Thompson. "It's time the vice president is brought out of the shadows and held accountable for his actions. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.27.2007	Today, the House of Representatives passed the FY 2008 Interior-Environment appropriations bill, which included a $500,000 request by North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson for the Martin Slough Interceptor project. The purpose of this project is to replace Eureka's antiquated wastewater system. Thompson championed funding for the project because the current sewage system regularly overflows into the Humboldt Bay, posing a serious threat to public health and the local environment. "Humboldt Bay is one of California's largest and most biologically-significant coastal estuaries," said Thompson. "When overburdened, Eureka's sewage system regularly spills toxic wastewater into the Bay, putting our residents and marine life at risk." The environmental risks stemming from sewage overflows has made completion of the $23 million project an urgent priority for the City of Eureka. In addition to the environmental benefits, the new sewage system will provide Eureka with the infrastructure it needs for future economic growth. "I called for this funding because Eureka's sewage problem is urgent and warrants federal assistance," added Thompson. "I'm pleased to see that the House Leadership has made the Martin Slough Interceptor project a priority." "On behalf of the Eureka City Council and all Eureka citizens, I wish to thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership on this project which is so vital to the environmental and economic health of our region," said David Tyson, City Manager. "The importance and magnitude of the Martin Slough Interceptor project cannot be overstated. The project will upgrade failing critical infrastructure through construction of a more effective and efficient wastewater collection system, one which will improve water quality and public health in Eureka and the Humboldt Bay region. We express our gratitude to the Congressman for his longstanding support of this local project." Congress has previously appropriated funding for the Martin Slough Interceptor, including $500,000 in FY 2001; $450,000 in FY 2003; $750,000 in FY 2005; and $376,000 in FY 2006. In addition to the Martin Slough Interceptor, the Interior-Environment appropriations bill includes $27 billion in discretionary spending for environmental and conservation programs. It includes $2.5 billion for National Parks and $451 million for National Wildlife Refuges, both of which will benefit the North Coast. The bill also included unprecedented spending on climate change research and the development of a system for regulating greenhouse gases. This bill will now be sent to the Senate for consideration. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden at (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.26.2007	Today, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) joined a bipartisan group of his colleagues in opposition of efforts to expand domestic off-shore oil and gas drilling. As they do each year, proponents of off-shore drilling attempted to lift the current congressional moratorium on drilling in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) through amendments in an appropriations bill. Thompson and his allies criticized this proposal as dangerous and unnecessary, and they urged their colleagues to vote against them. The amendments will be voted on tonight or tomorrow. "Lifting the moratorium on new drilling could result in disastrous economic and environmental consequences," said Thompson. "Yet it will do nothing to reduce our dependency on oil and gas." The moratorium on OCS drilling has been a bipartisan agreement in Congress for 25 years, and it has been renewed annually since 1982. However, the moratorium has come under regular attack, which is why Thompson recently introduced a bill to permanently protect the North Coast from drilling. The Northern California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act (H.R. 2758) will permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. "California's North Coast would be especially vulnerable if the moratorium was lifted," added Thompson. "Drilling off the North Coast would threaten our marine life and cause our local economy to suffer." The North Coast is part of a unique upwelling zone, one of only four in the world. These zones support incredibly abundant and productive marine life, which local fishing communities depend on. The North Coast also supports a large tourism industry vital to local and state economies that is dependent upon its pristine cove and beaches and spectacular views. "Every year, there are attacks against the moratorium, and I'm afraid that one day it might be lifted," said Thompson. "An oil spill off our beautiful North Coast would be devastating. My bill will make sure that never happens." On Thursday, the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources will review Thompson's bill. ### Watch Rep. Mike Thompson speak on the House floor.

06.19.2007	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) has introduced a bill that will permanently prohibit oil and gas drilling off the coasts of Mendocino, Humboldt and Del Norte Counties. The Northern California Ocean and Coastal Protection Act (H.R. 2758) provides protection to the unique and productive marine environment along Northern California's outer continental shelf. "Northern California's coast brings biological and economic benefits to the entire country," said Thompson. "It's critical that we permanently protect this unique area from the environmental hazards of off-shore drilling." The West Coast is one of four major upwelling regions in the world. Upwelling regions are coastal areas that support extremely abundant and productive marine life. This is because an upwelling brings cold, nutrient-rich waters up from the ocean depths that, when combined with sunlight, enhance seaweed and phytoplankton growth. The seaweed and phytoplankton provide energy for some of the most productive ecosystems in the world, including many of the world's most important fisheries, such as the North Coast fisheries. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, while upwelling regions make up only one percent of the world's oceans, they contribute to approximately half of the world's fish catch. Drilling for gas and oil off the Northern Coast of California could cause serious harm to the unique and productive ecosystem and abundant marine life found off the coast, including the fish many local North Coast economies depend on. "I've been working with Congressman Thompson to protect Northern California's coast from oil and gas development since he was elected to the State Senate in 1990," said Rachel Binah, Former Chair, Environmental Caucus, California Democratic Party Democratic National Committeewoman. "I'm proud that he continues to show his leadership by providing permanent protection to some of the world's most beautiful coastline." "For years, I've been working with local environmentalists, businesses, fishing communities and public officials to provide our coast with the protection it needs," added Thompson. "Like me, they believe that permanent federal protection is the only way to ensure the North Coast's marine life is just as bountiful decades from now as it is today." ### CONTACT: Anne Warden, (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
06.05.2007	Today, the House passed a bill by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) honoring the 15th anniversary of National Trails Day. National Trails Day, which occurs annually on the first Saturday of June, is a national recognition of our country's 200,000 miles of trails. Thompson's bill (H.Res.401) celebrates trails for providing Americans with recreational and educational activities on our public lands. It also underscores the importance of protecting trails so future generations can continue to access and enjoy our country's natural beauty. "National Trails Day is a tribute to America's love of the great outdoors," said Thompson. "Trails enrich our nation's communities by helping protect our natural vistas, views and habitats. They also provide millions of Americans with endless recreational and educational opportunities." Since 1993, thousands of volunteers and trail enthusiasts have held events across the country to celebrate National Trails Day. Last week, more than 1,200 events were held in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. National Trails Day events include horseback rides, bike rides, kayak trips, interpretive hikes, exhibits and demonstrations. "Northern California has some of the best trails in the world," said Thompson. "National Trails Day is a great opportunity to explore Northern California's unique and stunning public lands." Rep. Thompson has been a long-time champion for California's wild spaces. Last fall, his bill designating 273,000 acres of Northern California as federally-protected wilderness was signed into law. The designation spans five counties in the 1st Congressional District and is the largest addition of wilderness to California in more than a decade. ### CONTACT: Anne Warden - (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
05.30.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, embarked on a five-day intelligence oversight trip to the United Kingdom and Sweden. The purpose of his trip is to examine the growth of religious extremism in Europe and the threat that this trend poses to the U.S. and our allies. In addition, Thompson will meet with local officials to discuss how the U.S. and European countries can better coordinate counterterrorism measures and the sharing of intelligence. "Strong intelligence is our best weapon for fighting terrorism," said Thompson. "And close collaboration with our allies and partners is critical given that many of these extremist groups operate in multiple countries. We need to share information with our allies and learn from each others' experiences if we are to counter the threats posed by these dangerous groups." Thompson, a Vietnam combat veteran, will also spend a day with wounded soldiers at the Army's Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany. This is his second visit to the hospital since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began.CONTACT: Anne Warden, (202) 225-3311, (703) 338-4480 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov.
05.30.2007	Following the president's signature on emergency disaster relief for the Pacific salmon industry, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson quickly assembled Members of Congress from California and Oregon to ensure the funding is promptly distributed. "The president's approval of this disaster relief is long overdue," said Thompson. "The Administration's failed water policies resulted in our country's largest commercial salmon fishery disaster, and North Coast residents have suffered because of it. Our salmon fishermen and businesses will finally get the aid they desperately need." The $60.4 million in emergency funding will be distributed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA), which has regulatory jurisdiction over the nation's fishing industries. Thompson and members of the state congressional delegations formally invited Dr. William Hogarth, Director of NOAA Fisheries, to a meeting in Washington, D.C. to discuss how and when those affected by the disaster will receive aid. "We've been working for the past two years to get this funding, and now that we have it, we can't waste another minute getting it to our salmon fishermen and related-businesses," continued Thompson. "We worked extremely hard to secure this funding and we'll work just as hard to make sure it gets to the right people, right away. The fisheries disaster was due to irresponsible federal management of the Klamath River, which caused 80,000 adult salmon to die in 2002. Since then, the salmon population has continued to deteriorate, forcing the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to sizably reduce the fishing seasons in 2005 and 2006. As a result, the commercial fishing season was cut by more than 90 percent last year, costing fishing families and associated fishing businesses more than $60 million. The disaster relief was passed by both the House and Senate last Thursday and signed by the president on Friday as a part of a larger emergency supplemental spending bill. The salmon industry funding provision was based on a bill introduced by Thompson in January. The letter to Dr. Hogarth was signed by Reps. Lois Capps, Peter DeFazio, Anna Eshoo, Sam Farr, Darlene Hooley, Zoe Lofgren, George Miller, Lynn Woolsey and David Wu.

05.24.2007	Today, the House of Representatives passed a bill that included emergency funding for the 2006 Pacific salmon fisheries disaster, rural schools and several other top-priority domestic needs. This is the final version of the emergency supplemental funding bill; after approval from the Senate, it will be sent to the president for his signature. The funding for the Pacific salmon disaster and rural schools was strongly championed by North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson because they are critically important to the 1st Congressional District. Specifically, this bill will provide $60.4 million for California and Oregon's commercial salmon fishing industry, a provision introduced by Thompson. It will also provide $425 million for schools in rural schools and counties nationwide, including Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake and Mendocino Counties. "The Pacific salmon disaster and our seriously underfunded rural schools are exactly the type of emergencies these supplemental bills were meant to fund," said Thompson. "Our rural communities deserve this funding, and I urge the president to sign this legislation." Both the Pacific salmon fisheries disaster and the funding owed to rural schools were neglected by the previous Majority in Congress, which failed to pass nine of 11 appropriations bills. Since then, rural communities in the 1st Congressional District have struggled without the much-needed funding. The lack of relief for the salmon industry has strained the entire North Coast economy. Additionally, it has been difficult for schools within the 1st Congressional District to maintain the programs and staff their students rely on. "Last year's commercial salmon fishing closure was the largest in U.S. history and was declared a federal emergency by the Secretary of Commerce," said Thompson. "Yet the previous Majority in Congress did nothing to help the thousands of fishermen, tribes and businesses in desperate need of aid. The funding we approved today will help get these families and businesses back on their feet." "Our local schools desperately need this funding," added Thompson. "Investing in our students is one of the best ways to ensure our communities stay strong. These schools already qualify for the funding under the law, and this bill makes sure they finally get it." The rural schools funding goes to areas with large amounts of federally-owned land. The federal land does not generate local property tax, so these areas qualify for federal in-lieu tax payments for schools and roads. This is the third time the House has voted in support of this funding this year. However, this time, the president has indicated that he will not veto the legislation.

05.24.2007	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement today after his vote on the Iraq emergency supplemental spending bill, which did not include benchmarks nor a timeline for ending the war: - Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement today after his vote on the Iraq emergency supplemental spending bill, which did not include benchmarks nor a timeline for ending the war: "Today, I voted against the Iraq supplemental because it only furthers the president's open-ended war in Iraq. In our fifth year at war, funding should go through the regular budgeting process. It's not an emergency at this stage, and if the Administration doesn't know after four years how to fund the war, we're in more trouble than we may think. Moreover, the Iraqi government needs to take responsibility for securing their country so we can bring our troops home as safely and quickly as possible. Without benchmarks, we don't know whether the Iraqi government is making progress. Without a timeline, the Iraqi government won't be motivated to meet the benchmarks. "I've been opposed to this war since the beginning. The Bush Administration has had it wrong from every vantage. Our troops have done a fantastic job. However, from â€˜mission accomplished' to â€˜stay the course,' this war has been run on slogans and photo ops, rather than sound strategy. There hasn't been accountability for the nearly $400 billion in taxpayer dollars we've spent or the wrong-headed decisions made along the way. This bill continues more of the same. "We must put our troops and veterans first, which is why the new Majority in Congress has increased funding to train, equip and protect our troops and provide quality care for our veterans. Our troops shouldn't have to rely on their families to send them everything from body armor to socks. The best way to protect our troops is to create a strategy for ending the war through benchmarks and a timeline. I can't support a war funding bill that doesn't make our troops and veterans the top priority." ### CONTACT: Anne Warden, (202) 225-3311 or (703) 338-4480
05.23.2007	Today, the House passed a bill (HR 2429) to help physicians maintain their medical practices at home while serving their country overseas in the Guard or the Armed Forces Reserve. The bill, introduced by Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Sam Johnson (R-TX), fixes a limitation in Medicare law, which restricts to 60 days the amount of time a physician can fill in for another physician who is on a leave of absence. This limit does not work for physicians in the Armed Forces Reserve and the Guard, who are absent from their practices for much longer than 60 days when they are called up for active duty. "When these physicians are deployed, they leave behind families and jobs just like any other person in the Reserve or Guard," said Vietnam veteran Congressman Mike Thompson. "But they also leave behind their patients. Doctors who are taking care of our troops overseas shouldn't have to worry that their patients aren't being cared for here at home." "This bill is just common-sense and eliminates red-tape for those serving our country - and their communities. It's time we helped our weekend warriors - who happen to be doctors - to keep their patients and their practice," said the 29-year Air Force veteran and former Vietnam prisoner of war Congressman Sam Johnson. "This bill is a slam dunk!" Medicare currently allows physicians to enter reciprocal billing arrangements, whereby replacement physicians can care for the absent physician's patients and bill Medicare accordingly. However, these arrangements cannot last longer than a 60-day period. After 60 days, a second replacement must be found. Securing replacement physicians is an expensive and difficult process, especially for practices in remote and rural areas. Physicians who cannot secure multiple replacements during their absence can either lose their patients to other practices or their patients must go without care. HR 2429 suspends the 60-day cap for physicians filling in for Reserve and Guard members called for duty through the rest of the calendar year. "Passage of this bill provides an immediate fix for physicians serving right now," said Thompson. "It will help thousands of physicians protect their patients and practices when they're called to duty and away serving our country. But, we need to make sure that this problem is permanently fixed. Representative Johnson and I are planning to introduce legislation that will do that and we are optimistic that it will receive equally strong support." This bill has been endorsed by the American Medical Association. ### Contact: Anne Warden (Rep. Thompson), 202-225-3311 or anne.warden@mail.house.gov Nikki Miller (Rep.

05.17.2007	Today, through the efforts of Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), a key provision to reduce waste and abuse of reconstruction funding for Iraq and Afghanistan was included in the 2008 Defense Authorization bill and passed through the House by a vote of 329 to 27. The provision was based on a bill introduced by Thompson in the last three Congresses called the War Funding Accountability Act. "Accountability is no longer optional for the federal government," said Thompson. "Americans deserve to know where their tax dollars are going, and Iraq and Afghanistan are no exception.” Specifically, the Defense Authorization bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report every six months on the handling of contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. The GAO will report on the value of contracts, how the contracts were awarded and whether the contracts are achieving results. The bill also expands the authority of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction to include all reconstruction funding regardless of source or fiscal year. “We've found that contractors in Iraq charged $45 per case of soda and $100 per 15-pound bag of laundry,” said Thompson. “Brand-new $85,000 trucks were abandoned if they had minor mechanical problems. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction found that $8.8 billion was handed over to Iraqi ministries with virtually no tracking of what it was spent on. Meanwhile, communities are raising money to send our service members armor and supplies.” “This Defense Authorization makes sure our tax dollars are going where they belong - protecting our troops, not lining the pockets of contractors,” said Thompson. “This bill will scrutinize every single contract and contractor to ensure it's in the American public's best interest." The provision was strongly supported by the Blue Dog Coalition, of which Thompson is a member. This group's sole purpose is to promote fiscally responsible government spending. This action comes on the heels of a damaging report issued by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction detailing continued and egregious abuses in the government's funding of the war in Iraq. Inadequate facilities and non-functioning equipment built by highly paid contractors, insufficient monitoring of government contracts and billions of dollars unaccounted for due to inefficiencies and bad management are just a few of the examples of waste, fraud and abuse detailed in the report.
05.17.2007	Today, an amendment introduced by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) to prohibit gang-activity in the military passed the House as a part of the 2008 Defense Authorization bill. This amendment revises military command policy to prohibit service members from associating with criminal street gangs, whether on duty or at home. Thompson introduced this amendment because a growing number of gang members in the military are returning to the streets armed with combat training, putting local law enforcement at a dangerous disadvantage. "Gang members with military training present a serious danger to society," said Thompson. "We must work to stop this disturbing trend while it is still emerging." The FBI has documented members of nearly every major street gang on both domestic and international military installations. The FBI's National Gang Intelligence Center released a report on January 12, 2007 detailed gang-related activity in the U.S. Armed Forces. Findings include: Since 2004, the FBI and El Paso Police Department have identified more than 40 military-affiliated gang members stationed at Fort Bliss in Texas. Officials at Fort Hood, Texas have identified nearly 40 gang members on base since 2003. And nearly 130 gang and extremist groups have been identified at Fort Lewis in Washington in the past 24 months. "I realize that some gang members join the military to change for the better and those folks would not be affected by this amendment," continued Thompson. "But some are not there to change. This amendment would require the military to identify street gangs so that it can either help to weed gang members out of service or deter them from gang life." Thompson's amendment was included in the FY 2008 National Defense Authorization bill (H.R. 1585) by a voice vote last night. The measure authorizes $503.8 billion in budget authority for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the national security programs of the Department of Energy (DoE), and $141.8 billion to support ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan during fiscal year 2008. The Defense Authorization passed the House 329 to 27. This measure was lauded for improving our military readiness, which has been seriously depleted from the multi-year wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It also includes funding to equip our troops with better equipment, armor and training and funding to provide our service members with better healthcare, pay and benefits. "This is a first step toward stopping gang members from getting in the military in the first place," said Thompson. "I'm also going to keep working with the FBI, the military and local law enforcement to keep these dangerous criminals off our streets."
05.14.2007	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) today announced the introduction of the Energy Conservation through â€˜Smart Meters' Act. The legislation would create a special tax incentive for the installation of energy management devices - known as smart meters. A smart meter is an automated electronic electricity metering device that will replace existing home and business electricity meters. These meters allow remote readings on an hourly basis, rather than once per month, giving consumers near real-time access to their energy usage information. “The first electricity meter was invented in the 1930's at the dawn of electrification in the United States. If you look at your energy meter today, you will see fundamentally the same device using technology that is 70 years old. This outdated technology prevents consumers from receiving the real-time information they need to make decisions about energy use,” said Nunes. "Smart meters empower consumers to make smart decisions about their energy use," said Thompson. "They are also a great example of how conserving our resources can also save money. This bill helps consumers take a step toward reducing their energy bills and their carbon footprint, as well as our nation's dependency on foreign oil." With smart meters, consumers will be able to reduce consumption when prices are high in order to save money on their electric bills. This technology is also the first step in the development of smart appliances that will be able to recognize high price periods and conserve power automatically. “Although I believe that Congress should do a lot more to provide increased domestic energy production, cutting-edge energy conservation measures like smart meters should also be part of our national energy strategy," said Nunes. According to the Government Accountability Office and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, widespread adoption of smart metering technologies would save American consumers billions of dollars in electricity costs.

05.11.2007	Last night, by a strong bipartisan vote of 302 to 120, the House passed an emergency spending bill that would provide much-needed funding for the Pacific salmon fisheries disaster, rural schools, agricultural disaster relief and wildfire emergencies. “This bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support because it provides emergency relief to hundreds of communities across the country,” said North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson. The bill includes $60.4 million for California and Oregon's commercial salmon fishing industry, a provision introduced by Thompson. The relief is needed for fishermen, tribes and businesses impacted by the commercial fishery failure of 2006, which was due to irresponsible Bush Administration water policies. “The emergency relief for our salmon industry is long overdue,” said Thompson. “Last year's commercial salmon fishing closure was the largest in U.S. history. The affected families and businesses need aid right away, and the president's claim that they should take out loans is illustrative of his disconnect from the real needs of working Americans.” The emergency spending bill also includes $425 million owed to rural counties. This funding goes to areas made up of large amounts of federally-owned land. The federal land is exempt from property tax, so these areas qualify for federal dollars for their schools and roads. The previous Majority in Congress failed to appropriate these funds last year. Unfortunately, President Bush has threatened to veto this spending bill. Thompson called this “a slap in the face to millions of hard-working Americans.” In regard to the salmon disaster relief, Thompson said, “North Coast salmon fishing families and businesses are suffering because of the president's wrong-headed decision to divert water from the Klamath River. To suggest that these people don't deserve federal aid is like rubbing salt in their wounds.” “Due to the fishing closure last year, my business lost $50,000,” said Deniel Caouette, owner of Deniel's Place CafÃ© in Klamath, California. “That may not seem like much to the president, but we're holding on by a thread and his suggestion that we just â€˜borrow' the money reveals how out of touch he is with plight of working people on the Klamath River.” The president's veto is also a rejection of funding for the nation's rural schools. “This president says he wants to leave no child behind while simultaneously keeping funding out of our schools,” continued Thompson. “This veto signals that he doesn't care about getting rural students a good education.” “Without funding, our county schools are at severe risk,” said Jan Moorehouse, Superintendent of Del Norte County Unified School District. “These funds should have been secured last year and the president's callous disregard demonstrates he is ignorant to the needs of rural communities in the West.” The spending bill, entitled the Agriculture Disaster Assistance and Western States Emergency Unfinished Business Appropriations Act of 2007, now goes to a vote in the Senate. There is already enough support in the House to override the president's veto.
05.02.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson joined Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Leadership outside the Capitol to raise awareness of the treatment barriers facing mental health patients. According to the Government Accountability Office, 90 percent of health insurance plans impose financial limitations and treatment restrictions on mental health and addiction benefits. In response, Thompson has co-authored the Paul Wellstone Mental Health and Addition Equity Act (H.R. 1424). This bill requires all insurers that offer mental health care to provide the same level of benefits as they would for any other medical condition. “Mental illness and addiction are diseases like any other,” said Thompson. “It is unconscionable that people suffering from these sometimes life-threatening diseases are discriminated against when they ask for help.” Currently, health insurers are allowed to offer mental health benefits that differ significantly from the medical and surgical benefits offered under the same plan. As a result, beneficiaries often pay more for these services and are eligible to use fewer of them. The Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act requires any insurer choosing to provide mental health benefits to equalize the financial requirements and treatment limits in comparison to other benefits. “There are already so many barriers for people with mental health problems, from the stigma associated with it to a nationwide shortage of providers,” said Thompson. “This bill will make sure that health insurance is not one of them. It's time we leveled the playing field in the treatment of mental health. Millions of Americans are depending on it.” A majority of respondents to a National Mental Health Association survey indicated that they would support parity legislation even if it meant a $1 per month increase to their premiums. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that such legislation will increase healthcare costs less than that amount. H.R. 1424 was introduced by Reps. Patrick Kennedy and Jim Ramstad and co-authored by Thompson on March 7, 2007. The bill is cosponsored by a bipartisan majority of 265 Members of Congress.
05.02.2007	Last week on “National Teach Children to Save Day,” North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson honored Humboldt County educator, Sarie Toste, by commemorating her achievements in the Congressional Record. Thompson recognized Toste for spearheading a program in elementary schools throughout Northern California that helps children learn the fundamentals of financial literacy. “Learning to save and invest money is a lesson our children will benefit from throughout their lifetimes,” said Thompson. “Along with the rise in credit card use, too many American adults are in trouble financially because they never learned how to manage their money wisely.” Toste initiated the first “Learn to Earn” program 11 years ago as the superintendent at Pacific Union Elementary School, when she realized that the children did not understand that they could save their money, watch it grow and help realize future dreams. “Sarie's program is so amazing because it shows kids how enjoyable it can be to set goals for themselves and have the discipline to save for them,” said Thompson. “I believe the â€˜Learn to Earn' program is something every student in America could benefit from.” “Learn to Earn” is a collaborative effort with a regional financial institution, Umpqua Bank, which provides weekly on-campus banking. The children sign up, deposit one dollar and receive a passbook. Every week a bank representative visits the school and accepts student deposits. The children set savings goals, calculate interest earned and watch their account grow. With more than seventy schools throughout Northern California, the nearly 6,000 young savers have banked $1.5 million dollars, making “Learn to Earn” the largest, most successful school savings program in California. An accompanying curriculum helps teachers introduce the basic concepts of sound money management. This is in sharp contrast to the savings habits of our nation's adults. Today, America's savings rate is negative, the lowest rate since the Great Depression. Even more alarming is the dramatic increase in personal debt, which has grown over the past decade by approximately 300 percent.
04.20.2007	Last night, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to help restore wetlands, protect communities from catastrophic floods and enhance natural resources across the country. The Water Resources Development Act of 2007 (WRDA) authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to construct flood protection projects and improve our nation's rivers and harbors. The bill passed the House of Representatives tonight by a vote of 394-25. “Federal authorization for these important flood control and conservation projects is long overdue,” said Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA). “This legislation will give our communities added flood protection and enhance natural resources nationwide.” St. Helena Flood Project and Napa River Salt Marsh Thompson was successful in adding language to this legislation that will provide added flood protection to the City of St. Helena and restore the Napa River Salt Marshes. “Giving the Army Corps of Engineers the authorization to work with the City of the St. Helena will provide the city with better flood protection,” said Thompson. “In addition, restoration of the Napa Salt Marshes will provide an exciting opportunity for large-scale wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay." The City of St. Helena is in the final stages of developing a comprehensive flood protection project to address its chronic flooding issues. The language that Thompson secured will allow the Army Corps of Engineers to assist the City in proceeding with the planning, design and construction for this important flood protection project. The Napa River Salt Marsh project will restore portions of a former 9,460 acre commercial salt pond complex that is valuable to tidal wetlands, and create one of the largest restored wetlands on the West Coast. San Pablo Bay Restoration Thompson was successful in adding language to this legislation that authorizes restoration of the San Pablo Bay. “The San Pablo Bay watershed is among the richest watersheds in the American West,” said Thompson. “This legislation authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to restore the San Pablo Bay watershed, which is critically important for fish and migratory birds along the Pacific flyway.” The restoration will cover more than 50,000 acres of the San Pablo Bay watershed. The authorization also allows the Corps to coordinate the work with other ongoing restoration projects in the bay. “I appreciate Congresswoman Lynn Woolsey's support of this important project,” said Thompson. Middle Creek Restoration Thompson was successful in adding language to this legislation that will fund, design and construct the Middle Creek Ecosystem Restoration Project. “Restoring Middle Creek is a critical step toward enhancing the area's flood protection and improving the wetlands surrounding Clear Lake,” said Thompson. The Project will restore 1,200 acres of wetlands and 500 acres of floodplain in the Clear Lake area. It entails reconnecting Scott's Creek and Middle Creek to the historic Robinson Lake wetland and floodplain. These two watersheds provide 57 percent of the water flow into Clear Lake. Salt River and Redwood Creek Thompson was successful in adding language to this legislation to assess ecosystem restoration within the Redwood Creek levee flood control project. In addition, the authorization included restoration of the Salt River, which is a critical habitat for endangered species. “Protecting the community of Orick from flooding and improving Redwood Creek's aquatic habitat and fisheries are equally important priorities for Humboldt County,” said Thompson. “This bill authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to reassess any conflicts between these two priorities, so that we can move forward toward a solution.” “The need to restore the Salt River is abundantly evident,” said Thompson. “This project will restore and enhance habitat for salmonids and other listed species and prevent future flooding and infrastructure disasters.” The Salt River project is designed to restore approximately two miles of habitat along the Salt River, which has experienced major ecosystem degradation due to long-term sedimentation and drainage problems. Failure to address these problems has resulted in local flooding, which has threatened pastures, waste systems and county roads. Sacramento River's Shipping Channel Thompson was also successful in adding language to this legislation that authorizes improvements to the Sacramento River's shipping channel. “The Sacramento River is critical to regional commerce,” said Thompson. “This bill authorizes efforts to deepen the river so larger ships can navigate through the channel, opening the port to ships from Oakland to West Sacramento.” “With his strong advocacy on this legislation, Congressman Thompson is getting the job done on critical steps toward protecting our public and making the port an indispensable asset for moving goods in and out of our region while reducing congestion and air pollution,” said West Sacramento Mayor Christopher Cabaldon. “Congressman Thompson's help on WRDA is essential to deepening the port's shipping channel and making us an economically successful and financially strong port for the region and for California,” said Supervisor Mike McGowen. “I appreciate Congresswoman Doris Matsui's support of this important project,” added Thompson. The WRDA bill will now move to the Senate for consideration.
04.18.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson will lead his first hearing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis, and Counterintelligence of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The hearing will focus on what our country's 16 intelligence agencies are doing to improve the quality of their intelligence analysis, the sharing of information across agencies, and training and career development for analysts. “The best intelligence tools in the world are useless without the capability to effectively analyze information and provide it to policymakers,” said Thompson in preparation for the hearing. “It's critical that we continually assess the effectiveness of our agencies' intelligence analysis and make improvements where necessary. As Chairman, I'm dedicated to making strong intelligence analysis one of Congress' top priorities.” During today's hearing, the subcommittee will discuss the 16 agencies' strategies and budget proposals for enhancing their intelligence analysis. The subcommittee will also evaluate the degree to which intelligence agencies have implemented provisions of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which required agencies to expand information sharing, make regular use of alternative analysis techniques, and improve multi-disciplinary training for intelligence analysts. The lead witness at the hearing will be Dr. Thomas Fingar, the Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis. Thompson also asked senior intelligence officials from the Central Intelligence Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Departments of State, Treasury and Energy to testify. “Just because the activities of our intelligence agencies are often classified does not mean these agencies aren't accountable to the American public,” said Thompson. “Hearings like this one are an example of how Congress is working to make sure these agencies are using taxpayer dollars effectively to enhance national security.” As Chairman, Thompson sets the agenda for subcommittee hearings. He plans to hold additional hearings on issues related to terrorism and the Intelligence Community's collection and analysis capabilities throughout the year.
03.28.2007	Today, an amendment authored by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) to protect real estate sellers from identity theft was adopted by the Ways and Means Committee. Thompson's provision changes the tax code to better protect people's Taxpayer Identification Numbers (TIN) or Social Security Numbers (SSN) during real estate transactions. The National Association of Realtors has endorsed this critical change to the tax code. “Privacy has become a growing concern for people involved in real estate transactions,” said Thompson. “The current law gives too many people access to sellers' personal information. This change makes sure that information is protected.” Thompson's amendment updates the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA), a tax law enacted long before identity theft was a prevalent problem. FIRPTA places sales of U.S. property under heightened scrutiny if the seller is from overseas, to ensure sellers pay all appropriate taxes to the U.S. government. U.S. sellers can avoid this additional scrutiny by providing the buyer with their SSN or TIN. Fears of identity theft are making sellers reluctant to provide this personal information, causing transactions to fall apart or buyers to assume liability should the seller fail to pay certain taxes. "Mr. Thompson has shown great leadership on an issue of growing importance," said Linda Goold, Tax Counsel of NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. "The National Association of Realtors has identified transactions in different parts of the country where sellers have cancelled the sale of their property simply because they don't want to give their Social Security number to a stranger. Everyone wins under Mr. Thompson's proposal. It assures that the IRS will continue to receive important information, that seller's privacy is protected and buyers are not at risk of losing the opportunity to purchase a home solely because of a seller's legitimate privacy concerns." “Congressman Thompson's amendment is the FIRPTA fix that's needed to help protect home sellers from concerns about identity theft,” said Colleen Badagliacco, President of CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. “By enabling settlement providers to securely collect the information, this amendment also effectively protects home buyers from being held liable for someone else's due on sale taxes.” "Concerns about identify theft have gotten to the point where some sellers won't provide a tax identification or Social Security number to the buyer,” said Ted Loring, Jr., President of Consolidated Management, a Eureka, California-based property management company. That leaves the buyer on the hook, liable for any taxes due on the sale that haven't been collected from the seller. Allowing the seller to give his or her tax id to a trusted party, like the escrow company, takes everyone off the hook. The seller's identify is protected; and the buyer doesn't run the risk of being billed for someone else's tax liability. “This is an important solution to a big problem that affects people nationwide,” said Thompson. “We were debating a bill to better protect taxpayers from fraudulent and predatory behavior, and my amendment was a perfect addition. Congress is a key player in the fight against identity theft, and today we expanded the tools taxpayers can use to protect themselves.” Thompson's amendment was included by the Ways and Means Committee in the Taxpayer Protection Act, HR 1677.
03.19.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Rep. Dave Camp (R-MI) introduced a bill to help landowners conserve our country's precious agricultural land and open spaces. The bill would permanently extend an important tax incentive for farmers and ranchers who donate their land's development rights to local land trusts, creating a conservation easement. The currently available tax deduction for conservation easements, which expires at the end of the year, has been extremely successful at encouraging landowners to preserve their land's agricultural purpose rather than sell it to developers. “America's agricultural lands and open spaces are being swallowed up by development at an alarming rate,” said Rep. Thompson. “Conservation easements are slowing that trend, but it can take time for landowners to implement them. By making this law permanent, we are ensuring a consistent and stable tax policy for landowners who protect their property from development. It will keep farmers in agriculture, preserve open spaces, and enhance the quality of our air and water.” “Conservation easements work,” said Rep. Camp. “Without this land preservation tool, some of the nation's most pristine environmental and agricultural properties would have been lost to commercial development. For the sake of future generations, we need to make this law permanent and continue to encourage land conservation.” The conservation easement tax provision encourages landowners to protect their land from development by giving them a tax deduction equal to the land's development value. Once placed under a conservation easement, the land cannot be developed at any time in the future, even if the land is sold. However, the landowner and all future owners can continue to farm the land. Specifically, the provision provides a tax deduction equal to the land's development value up to 50 percent of the land donor's income for all individuals except ranchers and farmers, who are capped at 100 percent of the donor's income. The deduction can be carried forward for 15 years. Thompson and Camp's bill has received strong support from the Land Trust Alliance, National Cattleman's Beef Association, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation and more than 40 other leading groups. The bill has 22 original co-sponsors, including Reps. Roscoe Bartlett (R-MD), Tim Bishop (D-NY), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Eric Cantor (R-VA), Dennis Cardoza (D-CA), Ben Chandler (D-KY), Vernon Ehlers (R-MI), Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE), Scott Garrett (R-NJ), Jim Gerlach (R-PA), Wayne Gilchrest (R-MD), Darrell Issa (R-CA), Steve Israel (D-NY), Ron Kind (D-WI), Randy Kuhl (R-NY), John Lewis (D-GA), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Patrick Murphy (D-PA), George Radanovich (R-CA), Jim Saxton (R-NJ) and Ellen Tauscher (D-CA).
03.08.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Rep. Don Young (R-AK) introduced the Endangered Species Recovery Act, which would provide landowners with tax incentives if they agree to implement species recovery plans. To qualify for the tax incentives, landowners must demonstrate that animals listed as endangered or threatened live or migrate through their property. In addition, the landowner must implement a government-approved recovery plan designed to reverse the decline of the listed species. “Americans have always loved the great outdoors for our country's diversity of fish and wildlife,” said Thompson. “We should do everything we can to provide incentives to landowners to help recover our endangered and threatened species. This bill will help the government create positive partnerships with landowners to implement effective recovery plans nationwide.” “For too long, private property owners have suffered under the Endangered Species Act,” said Young. “An overwhelming majority of these owners are strong conservationists who want to help in the recovery of species but they have been the victims of the restrictions mandated by the original law. This is a fair bill that works in the best interests of landowners and our threatened and endangered species. It's truly a bi-partisan, multi-interest bill that will help attain our goals of treating property owners fairly and safeguarding species that need their land for their recovery.” Landowners can qualify under the Endangered Species Recovery Act by agreeing to implement land management practices that coincide with pre-approved species recovery plans. The agreements must include a schedule, deadline and monitoring system. Reps. Jim Ramstad (R-MN) and Ron Kind (D-WI) joined Thompson and Young today to introduce this bill. Senator Max Baucus (D-MT) and Senator Mike Crapo (D-ID) introduced companion legislation in the Senate last week. The Endangered Species Recovery Act has been endorsed by dozens of wildlife conservation and sporting organizations, including the American Sportfishing Association, Ducks Unlimited, Trout Unlimited, Environmental Defense, National Wildlife Federation, Defenders of Wildlife, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and the National Endangered Species Act Reform Coalition. The American Farm Bureau also supports this bill.
03.05.2007	Rep. Mike Thompson's (D-CA) binding legislation to end U.S. involvement in Iraq is gaining fierce momentum in the House of Representatives. HR 787, which restricts the president's dangerous escalation of the Iraq War and sets firm deadlines for redeployment, gained 18 co-sponsors over the past week, bringing the total to 45. Thompson's bill is the only Iraq legislation in the House with bipartisan support and the only one with a Senate companion, which was authored by Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). “This bill is an achievable strategy for ending our involvement in the war and helping the Iraqi government stabilize their country,” said Thompson. “The support for this bill is an indication that many members of Congress are ready to find a solution to the crisis in Iraq and get our troops out as safely and quickly as possible.” Thompson introduced his bill, the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007, last month with Iraq War veteran Congressman Patrick Murphy (D-PA). The plan closely follows the bipartisan recommendations of the Iraq Study Group by requiring a phased redeployment of U.S. troops to begin no later than May 1, 2007, with all combat brigades out of Iraq by March 31, 2008. “I've been against this war since the beginning and think our troops should have been redeployed long ago,” said Thompson. “Our troops have done everything we've asked of them and they shouldn't be in the middle of Iraq's civil war. The Iraqi government should step up and take responsibility for securing their country.” Thompson's bill allows for the President to request from Congress a brief suspension of redeployment if there is clear evidence that the Iraqi government is achieving certain security, diplomatic and reconstruction milestones. Foreign policy experts agree that this is the most realistic way to get the Iraqi government to assume control of their country and get our troops out of Iraq as quickly and safely and possible. “If the Iraqi government is making progress, we should help them rebuild and stabilize their country,” said Thompson. “But bringing our troops home must be our top priority.” HR 787 also calls for increased diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. It requires the President to appoint a special U.S. envoy that will help build relationships between Iraq and its neighbors. “The president's escalation plan is a continuation of his failed â€˜stay the course' slogan,” said Thompson. “We should be putting our resources toward a surge in diplomacy, not troops. That's the only way we will effectively help bring stability, and ultimately peace, to Iraq.” Thompson has been a vocal critic of the war since 2002 and voted against the authorization of the war. In the previous session of Congress, he introduced legislation calling for redeployment of troops out of Iraq by September 30th, 2006. He also introduced legislation for the third time that would require oversight and accountability of all military and reconstruction spending in Iraq.

03.01.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights, legislation that would require all airlines to provide a minimum level of customer service. “We must find a way for airlines to conduct business without holding passengers on planes for hours on end,” said Thompson. “Passengers should always be treated fairly and decently when traveling, even when unforeseen complications arise. I believe this bill will help both passengers and the airlines know what to expect when problems occur.” Thompson's bill clearly outlines the standards of service airlines must incorporate in their contracts of carriage, which are legally binding agreements between passengers and airlines. These standards include allowing passengers to deplane after three hours on the tarmac, while providing pilots with flexibility if takeoff is imminent, and providing passengers with adequate food, safe drinking water, clean and sanitary facilities, air ventilation and a reasonable temperature while waiting on an aircraft. Airlines must also keep passengers fully informed about the timing and cause of flight delays and cancellations. The bill also calls on the Department of Transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to review airport policies and infrastructure to help ensure airlines can meet these new standards. “Whether it's for business or pleasure, Americans rely on the airlines, and I do not want to create a law that puts them out of business,” said Thompson. “I recognize that there is a lot of work that Congress needs to do to improve airport infrastructure and upgrade the air traffic control system. But we need assurance that passengers will not be unnecessarily put in uncomfortable and unsafe conditions. I think this Passenger Bill of Rights is the best way to account for the needs of the passengers and the airlines.” ### Summary of the AIRLINE PASSENGER BILL OF RIGHTS Gives passengers the right to deplane after any ground delay of three hours or more, with two exceptions. Allow two 30-minute exceptions if the pilot reasonably determines that a flight will depart not later than 30 minutes after the delay, or If the pilot reasonably determines that permitting a passenger to deplane would jeopardize passenger safety or security. Requires airlines to provide passengers with adequate food, safe drinking water, sanitary facilities, air ventilation, and a reasonable temperature while waiting on an aircraft. Requires airlines to frequently update passengers at the airport and aboard aircraft on the cause and timing of delays. Requires airlines to disclose information on chronically delayed flights at the time of ticket purchase. Requires airlines to make every effort to return checked bags to passengers within 24 hours. Requires airlines to draft and prominently display a Passenger Bill of Rights. Requires airlines to make information on the lowest fares readily available to the traveling public. Calls on the FAA to work with airlines to allow long-delayed flights to offload passengers who choose to disembark - without losing that flight's position in the departure sequence. Calls on DOT to: Review airline and airport emergency contingency plans to make sure that the plans will effectively address weather emergencies in a coordinated manner. Convene a meeting of air carriers, airport representatives and the FAA to discuss procedures to better respond to weather emergencies resulting in lengthy flight delays. Study the ability of air carriers to provide essential needs of passengers, including food and water in cases where the flight is diverted to an unscheduled airport due to an emergency or weather situation. Requires airlines to include this bill in their contract of carriage.
02.26.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) released the following statement on a passenger bill of rights he plans to introduce: “Flying will never be as comfortable as home, but passengers have a right to know what level of service they can expect on an aircraft.” “I think the airlines will also benefit from having a set of rules to guide them through difficult situations, such as weather emergencies. Flying is a necessity of life for many people, and we certainly don't want to do anything that will hurt the airlines' ability to operate. However, I believe all airlines can meet the standards outlined in this bill.” “Passengers should not be held on an airplane for hours and hours on end. My bill will give every passenger the right to deplane after a flight has been held on the ground for three hours.” “If a plane is delayed, airlines must provide passengers with certain necessities. My bill requires that airlines provide every passenger with food, safe drinking water, sanitary bathroom facilities, adequate ventilation and a reasonable temperature while the plane is delayed.” Additional provisions in the bill include: - Require airlines to frequently update passengers at the airport and aboard aircraft on the cause and timing of delays. - Require airlines to disclose information on chronically delayed flights at the time of ticket purchase. - Require airlines to make every effort to return checked bags to passengers within 24 hours. - Require airlines to draft and prominently display a Passenger Bill of Rights, which either meets or exceeds the standards in this bill. - Require airlines to make information on the lowest fares readily available to the traveling public.
02.01.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced binding legislation that would restrict the president's dangerous escalation of the Iraq War and set firm deadlines for a redeployment of American troops. Thompson's bill is companion legislation to a bill introduced earlier this week in the Senate by Senator Barack Obama (D-IL). “A realistic plan for ending this war is long overdue,” said Thompson. “This bill draws a hard line with the Iraqi government by giving them firm benchmarks for securing their country and making it clear that the U.S.'s involvement is coming to a close.” The Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007 (HR 787) sets forth a comprehensive plan for both ending the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq's growing civil war and helping the Iraqi government rebuild and secure their country. It requires a phased redeployment of U.S. troops to begin no later than May 1, 2007, with all combat brigades out of Iraq by March 31, 2008, which is in accord with recommendations released late last year by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group. The plan also allows for a limited number of U.S. troops to remain in a protection, training and counter-terrorism role. In addition, if the Iraqi government meets certain political, diplomatic and reconstruction benchmarks outlined by the Administration, the plan allows for the temporary suspension (for no more than 90 days) of troops redeployments, however only with congressional approval. “Our troops have done an amazing job, but success in Iraq will only be achieved by the Iraqis themselves,” said Thompson. “Sending more troops into the heart of Iraq's civil war will only put more American lives at risk. This legislation provides a practical plan for ending the war as safely and quickly as possible.” Thompson's bill also blocks the president's ill-advised plan to escalate the war by requiring congressional approval for additional troops beyond the number in Iraq on January 10, 2007. Escalation has been opposed by both Democrats and Republicans, including Senator John Warner, a World War II and Korean War veteran and former Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Senator Chuck Hagel, a Vietnam veteran. Thompson also introduced legislation in the 109th Congress calling for redeployment of troops out of Iraq. During this Congress, he also introduced legislation that would require oversight and accountability of all military and reconstruction spending in Iraq. Summary of the Iraq War De-escalation Act of 2007 (HR 787) Requires congressional approval for sending any additional troops to Iraq beyond the number in Iraq on January 10, 2007. Commences redeployment of US troops no later than May 1, 2007 with all combat brigades out by March 31, 2008. Allows for a limited number of US troops to remain as basic force protection, to engage in counter-terrorism, and to continue the training of Iraqi security forces. If the Iraqis are successful in meeting the 13 benchmarks for progress laid out by the Administration, the plan allows for the temporary suspension of this redeployment (for no more than 90 days), subject to the agreement of Congress. The President must provide Congress with a full explanation of why he is temporarily suspending redeployment. Requires the President to submit quarterly reports to Congress describing and assessing the Iraqi government's progress in meeting benchmarks and the redeployment goals. Conditions future economic assistance to Iraq on significant progress toward achievement of benchmarks. Allows exceptions for humanitarian, security, and job-creation assistance. Requires Iraq to fulfill its commitment to spend not less than $10 billion for reconstruction, job creation, and economic development without regard for the ethnic or sectarian make-up of Iraqi regions. Recommends the President appoint a Special Envoy for Iraq to carry out this diplomacy within 60 days. Mandates that the President submit a plan to prevent the war in Iraq from becoming a wider regional conflict.
01.31.2007	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) was appointed Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence for the 110th Congress. Intelligence Committee Chairman Silvestre Reyes (D-TX) announced subcommittee assignments earlier this week. Thompson will also serve on the Oversight and Investigations subcommittee. “I am honored that my colleagues trust me to help ensure our nation has the best intelligence programs in the world and that we are using our capabilities effectively and responsibly,” said Thompson. “The men and women who serve our country by gathering intelligence are one of our nation's best assets, and I look forward to assisting their efforts.” "As a combat veteran, Mike Thompson knows the value of timely and reliable intelligence,” said Chairman Reyes. “As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence, he will use those life lessons and experiences to ensure the tip of the spear is always sharp and the oversight of the intelligence community is robust." As chairman, Thompson will direct all hearings, investigations and legislative initiatives under the subcommittee's jurisdiction. In addition, the subcommittee will provide oversight to numerous programs within the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and several Department of Defense intelligence activities. “A strong intelligence community is essential in times of peace and in times of war,” said Thompson. “By ensuring our intelligence capabilities continue to evolve, we will help create a world where our citizens can live without fear of terrorism and where war is a last resort. Through my chairmanship, I am committed to making intelligence our nation's best weapon.” Thompson, a Vietnam combat veteran, served on the House Committee on Armed Services from 1998 until 2002. He was appointed to the Committee on Ways and Means in the 109th Congress, where he currently serves on the Health and Select Revenue Measures subcommittees.
01.18.2007	Last night, Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the appointment of Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) to the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Thompson, who is entering his fifth term of Congress, will also continue to serve on the Ways and Means Committee. “I am honored that the Speaker has entrusted me with the enormous responsibility of serving on the House Intelligence Committee,” said Thompson. “Maintaining our nation's strength and prosperity in a post-9/11 world calls for a well supported and evolving intelligence community, which I will work diligently to achieve,” said Thompson. “However, I also intend to engage in an honest debate about whether U.S. intelligence policies are truly making us safer. There are some serious questions that need to be asked about how we've handled terrorism, surveillance and the war in Iraq, and I plan to get some answers.” Committee members' primary responsibility is to provide oversight of the federal government's intelligence community and draft intelligence legislation. The breadth of the committee's reach is extensive; the committee has oversight responsibility for portions of seven major Cabinet departments and numerous agencies including the Central Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, National Security Agency, Department of Defense, Department of Energy Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and Department of State. In addition, the Committee authorizes all government funding for U.S. intelligence efforts. “Americans made it clear during the last election that they want better accountability of our government's foreign policy and national security decisions,” said Thompson. “As Democrats bring balance and bipartisanship back to federal government, I will help make sure we also provide the rigorous oversight Americans have asked for.” Thompson, a combat Vietnam veteran, has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at increasing accountability in Iraq and Afghanistan, responsibly redeploying troops out of Iraq and enhancing service-related benefits for American veterans. As a freshman legislator, Thompson was appointed to the House Committee on Armed Services, where he served until 2002. He was appointed to the Committee on Ways and Means in the 109th Congress, where he currently serves on the Health and Select Revenue Measures subcommittees.
01.17.2007	Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and George Radanovich (R-CA), co-chairs of the Congressional Wine Caucus, joined the Wine Institute, the National Grape and Wine Initiative, WineAmerica and the Winegrape Growers of America to release an unprecedented study on the impact of wine, grapes and grape products on the American economy. “This landmark study confirms what we have known intuitively for a long time,” said Congressman Mike Thompson. “Grapes, wine, and other grape products are truly an economic catalyst with tremendous growth potential in all 50 states. Policymakers can maximize these economic benefits by supporting legislation that enhances the wine and grape-product industry. Our support will ensure that this all-American industry continues to produce superior products and provide a strong contribution to our economy.” The study, produced by MKF Research LLC, found that U.S. wine, grape and grape-product industries contribute more than $162 billion annually to the American economy. The report also highlights the surging employment and tourism numbers, both of which are catalyzed by the growing U.S. grape and wine markets. “The numbers are really impressive, but there are many other benefits from grapes that should be considered,” said Congressman Radanovich. “By maintaining the vineyards in the San Joaquin Valley and those throughout the nation, we help preserve our agricultural lands. Further, vineyards and wineries revitalize and support local economies in rural communities, account for over 1 million direct and indirect jobs and contribute over $129 million to charitable causes. As an added benefit, it is important to mention that grapes, grape juice and wine contain antioxidants, which improve health.” “This report demonstrates what an important role the 1st Congressional District of California plays in the national economy,” said Thompson. “It also shows how all 50 states can learn from our region's efforts to protect and improve the wine industry. We are at the forefront of efforts to protect our agricultural lands and watersheds. We also produce top-notch research on issues that have a large impact on the wine and grape industries, such as disease control and sustainable farming practices.” The Congressional Wine Caucus is a bipartisan, bicameral coalition of U.S. Representatives and Senators with an interest in the grape and wine industries. The Caucus serves to highlight the many benefits of these strong industries.
01.12.2007	Today, the House overwhelming passed a bill (HR 4) repealing the current prohibition on negotiating the prices of Medicare prescription drugs. The bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA), will require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct cost-saving negotiations with pharmaceutical companies. These negotiations are expected to result in real savings for 22 million Americans enrolled in Medicare. “The current prohibition on negotiating lower prices is an insult to the American people,” said Thompson. “This legislation is an important first step because it gives the Secretary another tool to maximize savings for seniors and value for taxpayers. While it will not instantly result in huge savings on prescription drugs, it brings us a one step closer to providing all older Americans with the medicines they need.” The bill provides the HHS Secretary broad discretion on how to best implement the negotiating authority and achieve the greatest price discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, it continues to prohibit the HHS Secretary from requiring a particular formulary (i.e., a list of covered drugs) to be used by Medicare prescription drug plans or limiting access to any prescription medication. During debate on the House floor, Thompson noted that allowing the Secretary to negotiate prices complements - but does not replace - the negotiations being conducted by private plans. He also pointed out that this legislation does not create price controls on prescription drugs. Thompson also supported this bill because lower prices means it will take seniors longer to hit the coverage gap - also known as the “donut hole” - the period during which they have to pay 100 percent of their drug costs. “Less than 25 percent of the drug plans in my district offer any sort of coverage in the 'donut hole' - and those plans have premiums as upwards of $100 a month,” said Thompson. “A lot of Northern California's seniors can't afford that. So, when they hit the coverage gap, they foot the entire bill or they go without their medicine. This bill is one more tool that can be used to lower costs and prolong the amount of time it takes before seniors hit that gap.” A recent poll by Newsweek found that 92 percent of Americans support the bill. Rep. Thompson is a member of the House Ways & Means Healthcare Subcommittee. Click here to hear Congressman Thompson's floor speech. Time codes: CSPAN 1/12/07 11:59:40 - 12:01:22
01.11.2007	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) and 252 Democratic and Republican Representatives voted to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act (HR 3). The bill, which expands federal research on devastating diseases like Alzheimer's, diabetes and various cancers, is the third piece of legislation in the Democratic Majority's “100 Hours” agenda. Thompson was an original co-sponsor of the bill. “The vote signifies a federal commitment to exploring every possible option available for curing these terrible illnesses,” said Thompson in a statement. “Today, we cast a vote for hope.” The bill, which is also known as the DeGette-Castle bill after its bipartisan authors, authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to support research involving embryonic stem cells, regardless of the date on which the stem cells were derived from an embryo. Currently, federal funds are limited to those stem cell lines that existed when President Bush issued an executive order on August 9, 2001. The bill passed today only authorizes federal research funds for stem cell lines generated from embryos that would otherwise be discarded by fertility clinics. It also includes strict ethical guidelines for stem cell research. “Federal restrictions on new lines have dashed the hopes of millions of Americans who are impacted by life-threatening illnesses that this research may cure,” said Thompson. “In addition, America is losing top medical researchers and scientists to other nations without such restrictions.” “I am very proud that the Democratic Majority has made facilitating this life-saving research a cornerstone of our agenda.”
01.05.2007	Within the first two days of Congress, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) voted for sweeping and historic changes to the rules that govern the House of Representatives. The rules package, which passed by an overwhelming majority, will help restore ethics, civility and fiscal responsibility to the halls of Congress. “Americans made it clear last November that they were fed up with the previous Majority's questionable ethics, dishonesty and partisan politics,” said Thompson. “Today, we made it clear that we'll do what it takes to make this an institution the American people can put their trust and faith in.” During the debate over the rules package, Thompson took to the House floor, calling on his colleagues to reinstate pay-as-you-go budgeting. The pay-as-you-go amendment to the rules package ensures that the House will not consider any bill that increases the federal deficit. “Congress expects America's families to set a budget and to pay their bills, and Congress should be held to that same standard,” said Thompson. “This rule takes the first step towards restoring fiscal responsibility in the federal government by requiring the House of Representatives to pay for the bills that we pass.” Pay-as-you-go budgeting was used by the House throughout the 1990s, but was allowed to expire in 2002. As a result, federal deficits and debt have reached historic levels; the federal government currently has a $296 billion deficit and our national debt is nearly $9 trillion. “Our children and grandchildren are going to be paying for the irresponsible spending of the past five years,” said Thompson. “I am proud to be a Member of a Majority that will restore fiscal sanity to Washington.” In addition to a pay-as-you-go requirement, the rules package includes several ethics provisions, including banning gifts from lobbyists, banning travel paid for by lobbyists, prohibiting members from using corporate planes and requiring all House staff to attend ethics training. The package also prohibits the Speaker of the House from holding votes open in order to affect the outcome and requires that members of the Minority party are given enough time to review legislation before having to vote on it.

01.04.2007	On the first day of the 110th Congress, North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) introduced legislation to provide federal disaster relief to California and Oregon's salmon fishing industry. The bill authorizes the appropriation of $60.4 million for the fishermen, tribes and businesses that were impacted by the commercial fishery failure of 2006. California Senator Barbara Boxer also introduced companion legislation today in the Senate. Representatives Lois Capps, Anna Eshoo, Sam Farr, Peter DeFazio, Darlene Hooley, Doris Matsui, George Miller, Tom Lantos, Zoe Lofgren, Lynn Woolsey and David Wu co-authored Congressman Thompson's legislation. Senator Boxer's legislation is co-authored by Senators Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden. “It is our responsibility to do everything we can to help the thousands of families and businesses that are suffering from the largest commercial salmon fishery disaster in our nation's history,” said Thompson. “The devastating impact this disaster has had on California's North Coast has been apparent for years, and it is time we help bring this important industry back to life.” The fisheries disaster was due in large part to poor federal management of the Klamath River, which caused 80,000 adult salmon to die in 2002. Since then, the salmon population has continued to deteriorate, forcing the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to sizably reduce the fishing seasons in 2005 and 2006. As a result, the commercial fishing season has been cut by more than 90 percent this year, costing fishing families and associated fishing businesses more than $60 million. There is also an expectation that the commercial salmon season will be significantly reduced in 2007, as well. “Getting our fisherman and salmon businesses back on their feet is a top priority for me and my colleagues from California and Oregon,” said Thompson. “But is also important that we stay focused on restoring the salmon population in the Klamath so this disaster does not continue into the future. That's why we passed legislation last congress requiring the government to implement a salmon restoration plan, and I look forward to monitoring the government's progress.” In December, the House and Senate passed a bill setting a six-month deadline for a finalized comprehensive recovery plan for salmon on the Klamath River. The provision was included in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act at the request of Thompson and Boxer. It is the first time Congress has ever required the implementation of a disaster recovery plan.
01.04.2007	Today, Congressmen Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Peter DeFazio (D-OR) introduced legislation that would enable Del Norte County to receive the federal funds needed to improve the Del Norte County Airport without raising matching funds. The legislation follows up on a commitment made by Thompson and DeFazio at meetings held in Crescent City and Brookings, Oregon last fall, to help with improvements to the regional airport. Local officials have long expressed their concern that they are not being able to meet the 10 percent match requirement for federal grant funds. The Del Norte County Airport is a regional facility used by residents of Del Norte and Curry Counties. “This bill makes sure that counties like Del Norte aren't disadvantaged by their size or economic factors when trying to improve the airports their citizens rely on,” said Thompson. “Rural areas like the North Coast can't be expected to raise the type of funds that cities like San Francisco or LA can, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't get the assistance for improving their airports. Our legislation will make sure Del Norte County Airport gets the funding it needs to build a new terminal and make runway improvements.” "Access to air service is essential in rural areas to connect individuals and to allow for economic development," DeFazio said. "I am pleased to support this legislation, which will help the Del Norte County Airport overcome the current barriers to federal funding and improve air service for residents of Del Norte and Curry Counties." Specifically, the bill waives the federal grant matching requirements for rural municipalities with certain economic factors, such as per capita income and unemployment rate. These municipalities can qualify for airport improvements funds without matching 10 percent of the grant amount. Thompson and DeFazio wrote this legislation because it is often extremely difficult for counties like Del Norte to raise the matching funds, which bars them from receiving the much-needed transportation grants. "Improvements at Del Norte County Airport is the county's top priority,” said Del Norte County Supervisor Dave Finigan. “It is great to see that on the first day of the new session, it is also Congressman Thompson's top priority." "This legislation puts Del Norte County on the right path,” said Del Norte County Supervisor Martha McClure. “It will not only save the county money, but it will, more importantly, save us time - we'll be able to begin the project without having to delay to raise the funds. It will be miraculous!"
12.15.2006	Today, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) criticized the Bush Administration for downplaying a new report from the Treasury Department showing that the federal budget deficit is almost $200 billion more than what the president told us in October. Thompson, a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, called the budgetary slight-of-hand “a serious disservice to the American taxpayer.” The Treasury Department's Financial Report, which was quietly released this afternoon, shows that the federal deficit is actually $450 billion rather than $248 billion, the amount announced by the president with significant fanfare two months ago. This discrepancy results from the government using two different accounting standards to calculate the deficit; the report issued in October is determined using cash-based accounting, whereas the second, less-publicized report issued today uses accrual-based accounting. Accrual-based accounting provides a more accurate picture of finances and is required of all U.S. business with revenues over $5 million. “Whatever way you slice it, both of these numbers show that our nation's spending is out of control,” said Thompson. “Each year, these deficits get tacked on to the already outrageous national debt of $8.6 trillion, a debt our grandchildren's children will be dealing with.” To put these numbers into perspective, Thompson noted that each American would need to pay nearly $29,000 to eliminate the national debt. In 2005, net interest payments on the national debt were $184 billion, which is triple all federal funding for education and six times the amount for either the environment or veterans' health care. “Unfortunately, it's typically for this Administration to release this type of unflattering news on a Friday afternoon,” said Thompson. “We must bring honest and responsible spending back to Washington by re-instituting rules in Congress that make sure bills won't pass unless they're paid for.”
12.09.2006	Today, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill setting a six-month deadline for a finalized comprehensive recovery plan for salmon on the Klamath River. The provision was included in the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act at the request of North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson and California Senator Barbara Boxer. It is the first time Congress has ever required the implementation of a disaster recovery plan. “Declining salmon stocks on the Klamath River has brought the salmon to near extinction and had a devastating impact on tribal fisheries and the North Coast economy. We have waited too long for a plan to restore the salmon population from the responsible federal agencies,” said Thompson. “This bill makes sure there are no more delays. It sets a firm deadline for putting a restoration plan into action and makes sure Congress can keep careful track of the progress.” In 1997, the Department of Commerce listed the Coho salmon of the Klamath River as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. In 2002, poor federal management of the Klamath River caused 80,000 adult salmon to die, constituting the largest adult salmon kill in our nation's history. Since that time, the salmon population has continued to deteriorate, forcing the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to sizably reduce the fishing seasons in 2005 and 2006. As a result, the tribal subsistence fishery has nearly collapsed and the commercial fishing season has been cut by more than 90 percent this year, costing fishing families and associated fishing businesses more than $60 million. The provision requires the Secretary of Commerce to complete the recovery plan by April 2007. The Secretary must submit a report to Congress detailing their progress. This report must also detail progress made on the restoration of salmon spawning habitat, including water conditions, as they relate to salmon health and recovery; the status of other Klamath River anadramous fish populations, particularly Chinook salmon, and the actions taken to address the National Research Council recommendations regarding monitoring and research on Klamath River Basin salmon stocks. “This is important for the future of salmon, and reviving the North Coast salmon industry,” said Thompson. “However, we still need to get disaster aid to the fishermen, tribes and businesses that are suffering from this year's salmon closure. I will continue to fight to get disaster funding through Congress.”
11.15.2006	Reps. Mike Thompson and Lynn Woolsey announced today that the Charles M. Schulz Sonoma County Airport will get the federal assistance needed to re-establish commercial air service next year. According to officials at the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Sonoma County Airport will receive funding to hire private screener personnel, which complies with a formal request inserted by Senator Dianne Feinstein in a Senate appropriations bill. This decision by the TSA removes the last obstacle for reinstating commercial service in Sonoma County after a five-year absence. Experts estimate that the airport's expanded service will generate $45 million in revenues for the county, not including the economic benefits it will undoubtedly bring to the surrounding counties like Napa, Mendocino and Lake. “Sonoma County Airport offers tremendous economic opportunities to Sonoma County and Northern California, and I am confident that our effort to secure this funding will pay off in spades from the new jobs and tourism the airport will create,” said Thompson. “After several months of working with the TSA, I think the agreement to fund private screeners is fair and equitable. I am very thankful that Senator Feinstein made this a priority for the Senate, and I am glad that working together with Congresswoman Woolsey, we were able to help Sonoma County Airport get the screeners they need.” “I am glad that after the hard work of local airport officials, community leaders, and those of us in Washington, that the TSA has reached this important decision,” said Woolsey. “Providing funding for screeners will not only protect the traveling public, but will allow for the continued economic growth of our region.” Earlier this year, the TSA told Thompson and Woolsey that Sonoma County Airport would not be provided the screener personnel required by law, even though the TSA supplies screeners to all other currently operating commercial airports. Thompson and Woolsey sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff in August requesting that the TSA provide the necessary screeners. In addition, Senator Feinstein had language inserted in the Senate Homeland Security appropriations bill directing the TSA to provide screeners to Sonoma County Airport and other airports in similar situations. This week, the members of Congress learned that the TSA will not permanently provide screeners, but will reimburse the expense of hiring private screeners, which satisfies the requirements for establishing commercial service. The TSA will, however, provide screeners until private ones can be employed. Airport officials expect that Horizon Air will launch their operations out of Sonoma County in March 2007, servicing about 116,500 travelers annually.
10.17.2006	Today, the president signed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act (H.R. 233), designating 273,000 acres of Northern California as wilderness in perpetuity. The bill, authored by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), also designates 21 miles of Scenic River and approximately 51,000 acres as a Recreation Management Area for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. “Today marks the largest addition of wilderness to California in more than a decade,” said Thompson. “After more than five years of hard work and tremendous support from hundreds of environmentalists, outdoor enthusiasts, businesses and government officials, this beautiful and unique land has received the highest protection the law allows.” In an effort led by Thompson and Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, the U.S. House and Senate passed the Northern California wilderness designation by unanimous votes this past summer. The president's signature today marks the final step in making the wilderness and recreation area designations permanent. “The work put into this wilderness designation is an example of how good policy is made,” said Thompson. “Senators Feinstein and Boxer and I worked with dozens of groups with diverse interests who came together with the single goal of ensuring Northern California's wild places are preserved for generations. I share today's achievement with all who helped to make this victory for wilderness possible.” “We are grateful for Congressman Thompson and Senators Feinstein and Boxer's hard work and for all the individuals who contributed to this important effort," said Humboldt County Supervisor John Wooley. "This bill not only provides protection to our local wild places, but is also is a formal recognition of how important wilderness preservation is to our society.” This bill will designate existing public lands in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino and Napa Counties as wilderness and designate the Black Butte River in Mendocino County as a wild and scenic river. In addition, it would designate a Recreation Management Area in Mendocino and Lake Counties for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes.
09.26.2006	Today, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act (H.R. 233) and sent the bill to the president for his signature. The bill, authored by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), designates more than 273,000 acres of Northern California as wilderness, 21 miles as a scenic river and approximately 51,000 acres as a Recreation Management Area for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. The designation spans five counties in the 1st Congressional District and is the largest addition of wilderness to California in more than a decade. In an effort led by Thompson, the bill passed through the House this past summer, also by a unanimous vote. Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, who were both very instrumental in developing and gathering support for the bill, championed its passage today in the Senate. “This landmark vote to secure 273,00 acres of Northern California wilderness will reverberate for generations as millions of Americans have the opportunity to enjoy its unique beauty,” said Thompson. “We are all indebted to Senators Boxer and Feinstein for committing years of steadfast support to this bill.” Thompson also noted that this designation aids in the protection of dozens of endangered species of animals and plants. “America's wilderness represents the things we love about being American - our free spirit, our sense of adventure and our passion for exploring the unknown,” said Thompson. “This designation marks a tremendous victory for conservationists, outdoor enthusiasts and all Americans who care for the outdoors.” This bill will designate existing public lands in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino and Napa Counties as wilderness and designate the Black Butte River in Mendocino County as a wild and scenic river. In addition, it would maintain all existing roads, private lands and grazing rights, and it would designate a Recreation Management Area in Mendocino County for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes. The president's signature of HR 233 is expected in the next few weeks.
09.14.2006	Hailing the National Wildlife Refuge System as the premier wildlife land system in the world, the four leaders of the newly formed bipartisan Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus (CWRC) - Co-chairs Reps. Ron Kind (D-WI) and Jim Saxton (R-NJ) and Vice Co-chairs Mike Castle (R-DE) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) -gathered with a diverse coalition of national conservation and recreation organizations today to celebrate the launch of the caucus and highlight the importance of protecting and preserving the Refuge System. “Our national refuge system is truly a triumph of American vision and commitment to responsible stewardship, protecting critical habitat and wildlife while providing economic benefit to local communities from recreational users,” stated Rep. Ron Kind, whose western Wisconsin district includes the Upper Mississippi River and Necedah Wildlife Refuges. “Yet this system - which benefits so many - is struggling to fulfill its mandate in the face of tightening budgets and additional burdens such as the threat of invasive species. We formed the caucus to create a collective voice for our nation's refuges in Congress and to ensure the legacy of the system is preserved for future generations.” The mission of the CWRC is to fortify, protect and preserve the National Wildlife Refuge System by supporting adequate Refuge funding, working for the strategic growth of the Refuge System through easements and targeted land acquisition, and by promoting legislation to improve the Refuge System. The CWRC also aims to educate members of Congress about the increasing number of challenges facing the System through briefings and other forms of outreach. “Many Members of Congress across the country have wildlife refuges in their district or close to their district,” said Congressman Jim Saxton, a co-chairman of the new caucus whose own rural southern New Jersey district includes the Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge and its Holgate wilderness area. “We share many of the same concerns such as maintenance, encroachment and funding issues. This caucus will give us a structure within the House to tackle the common problems the refuges face.” Wildlife Refuge budgets have long lagged behind what is needed to keep up with fixed costs such as salaries and fuel. These chronic shortfalls have resulted in an overall backlog of $3.1 billion, severely inhibiting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) from carrying out the mission of the Refuge System. "For more than 100 years, the National Wildlife Refuge System has protected many of our country's most important habitats, protected numerous endangered species, made our water cleaner and provided Americans with beautiful areas to explore and enjoy,” said Rep. Mike Thompson. “However, recent funding cuts are a reminder that wildlife refuges need our continuous support. Through the Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus, we will provide a much-needed voice in Congress for this critical conservation tool.” “The purpose of this caucus is critical-we are serving as a united voice aimed at protecting our nation's environmental treasures. My home state of Delaware has two refuges which protect marshes of the Delaware Bay that are the home of migratory shore birds and other animals. Every time I visit I am in awe of their beauty. I know others feel exactly the same about the refuges on their district and that is why we are redoubling our efforts to conserve and preserve these pristine areas,” said Rep. Mike Castle. In anticipation of the launch the caucus membership, the Caucus recently introduced legislation to help combat invasive species, the number one ecological and financial threat the Refuge System. The Refuge Ecology Protection, Assistance, & Immediate Response (REPAIR) Act (H.R. 5900) REPAIR Act, proposes an innovative and cost-effective approach to maximize eradication efforts and establishes a grant program to combat invasive species on and adjacent to Refuges.
09.13.2006	Today, the bipartisan Congressional E-Waste Working Group will bring together some of the nation's largest e-waste stakeholders to develop a solution to the growing problem of obsolete electronics disposal. The participants, who represent electronic manufacturers and retailers, recyclers, environmental groups and state officials, will be discussing what role the federal government can play to mitigate e-waste's harmful effects and how to distribute responsibility for disposal. The Congressional E-Waste Working Group, which includes Reps. Mike Thompson (CA-01), Mary Bono (CA-45), Louise Slaughter (NY-28) and Zach Wamp (TN-03), was formed in 2005 to explore options to the problem of e-waste. The group invited stakeholders to Capitol Hill to discuss potential solutions. Rep. Mike Thompson said: “The problem e-waste poses to the environment and our health is clear, and it is encouraging that many groups are actively working toward a solution. However, rather than having a patchwork of state regulations and individual company policies, a federal solution may be a more effective approach. By bringing these groups together to sort through the options, we'll be a lot closer to finding a realistic way of decreasing the amount of e-waste ending up in our landfills.” Rep. Mary Bono said: "Our environment deserves a solution to the ever-expanding technological market and the dramatic increases in e-waste. The federal government recognizes the need to address e-waste concerns and this working group will collectively examine, with stakeholders, the best ways to establish a national policy and define the scope of national effort." Rep. Louise Slaughter said: “We're coming together to produce clear and consistent e-waste guidelines. Developing a national plan is critical if we want to protect our environment and the vitality of electronics manufacturers. If we don't respond to e-waste now, U.S. businesses will be put at a competitive disadvantage, while the consequences to the environment will grow more severe.” Rep. Zach Wamp said: “An East Tennessee company, â€˜Five R,' has recycled and refurbished parts from old computers, fax machines, photocopiers and other electronics so that they aren't wasted or taking up space in landfills. And, the Department of Energy in Oak Ridge is involved with a program to refurbish old radiation detection equipment. We have experience to offer other states to address the growing problem of e-waste.” The Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimates that 100 million electronic devices become obsolete each year. The degradation of these devices can release toxic materials into the environment. E-waste now accounts for more than 40 percent of the lead and 70 percent of the metals in U.S. landfills. Groups represented at today's meeting include Best Buy, Consumer Electronic Association, Consumer Electronics Retailers Coalition, Dell Inc., Electronic Industries Alliance, Electronic Waste Recycling Program - California, Goodwill Industries International, Hewlett-Packard Company, IBM, International Scrap Recycling, Kodak, National Recycling Coalition, Panasonic, Product Stewardship Institute Inc., Washington State Department of Ecology, Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition, Sony Electronics and CTIA, The Wireless Association.
09.07.2006	Today, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and 63 of his colleagues introduced bipartisan legislation that would significantly improve federal health policies for rural communities, like those in Northern California. The Health Care Access and Rural Equity (H-CARE) Act would, among other things, change the way doctors, hospitals, pharmacists and other providers are reimbursed for medical expenses. It is expected to greatly increase rural patients' access to healthcare. “Many parts of our district are faced with physician shortages, community pharmacists struggling to make ends meet, and under-funded hospitals, clinics and ambulance services,” said Thompson. “This legislation would make critical reforms to certain Medicare payment policies and addresses funding shortfalls. I support H-CARE because it would effectively provide relief to many of our local healthcare providers and has the potential to help thousands of our district's rural citizens." H-CARE would improve rural healthcare throughout California's 1st Congressional District by: -Increasing payments to rural Disproportionate Share Hospitals (hospitals with a large number of uninsured patients). There are 3 of these hospitals in the 1st Congressional District and 2 immediately outside the district that treat our local citizens. -Extending 2% bonus payments for rural ground ambulance services. -Increasing rural health clinic reimbursements. Our district has 26 Rural Health Clinics. -Requiring prompt payment from Medicare Part D plans to pharmacists. -Authorizing loan programs targeting rural hospitals in need of capital improvement, such as hospital renovation and expansion. -Authorizing grant funding for Health Information Technology purchases for rural health care providers. Health Information Technology purchases include equipment for electronic medical record filing and prescriptions. -Reauthorizing Rural Health Care Services Outreach and Rural Health Network Development grants. -Facilitating the provision of telehealth services across state lines. This would allow patients to consult doctors in other states via computer and telephone. H-CARE was unveiled today at a press conference on Capitol Hill. To date, twelve national organizations have endorsed the legislation, along with numerous statewide organizations from across the nation. # # #
08.17.2006	Today, President Bush signed a measure into law that will aid in the protection of thousands of acres of the nation's shrinking agricultural lands. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), who serves on the Ways and Means Committee, spearheaded efforts to create the new tax provision. It will increase deductions available to farmers, ranchers and other landowners who donate their property for conservation purposes. These land donations, called conservation easements, allow farmers and ranchers to continue using the land, while protecting the property from future development. “This new law is a big win for farmers and our environment,” said Thompson. “Agriculture is a core component of our economy and our American heritage, and we have lost thousands of acres of agricultural lands to urban sprawl over the past decade. It is imperative that we find new solutions for protecting these invaluable areas. Through this provision, we take an important step toward keeping urban development from destroying our farmlands and harming the environment.” When landowners donate their property as a conservation easement, whether through the government or a public land trust, they maintain ownership and management of the land, while forgoing their rights to develop the land in the future. Conservation easements have historically been an effective tool for protecting farmland, and Thompson anticipates this new law will enable more farmers to donate their land for conservation purposes. Thompson worked with a broad grassroots coalition of farmers, conservationists and government officials to help secure this provision. "This bill marks a brand new day for efforts to protect our nation's landscapes, natural resources and local economies," said Alan Front, Senior Vice President of the nonprofit Trust for Public Land. "With the inclusion of this landmark conservation provision in the pensions bill, Congressman Thompson and his colleagues have made it possible for more and more Americans to do the right thing with their properties; as a result, more farmers will stay on the land, more conservation gifts will be made for the benefit of the public and communities will retain more of their traditional land uses, character and economic cornerstones.” “This provision does more to preserve agricultural lands in the long term than any currently-available zoning laws can,” said Andy Beckstoffer, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers. “It truly allows us to be better stewards of the land, ensuring our country's farmland is available for future generations.” The tax provision expands the current tax law in two ways: 1) It raises the cap for such deductions to 50 percent of donor income for all individuals except ranchers and farmers who are capped at 100 percent of donor income. The current cap is 30 percent for all landowners. 2) It extends the carry-forward period for conservation easement deductions to 15 years from the currently-allowable five years. This provision was included in Section 1206 of the Pension Protection Act (H.R.4).
08.11.2006	Last week, the U.S. Senate unanimously agreed to the House resolution introduced by Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) recognizing the significance of the Napa Valley victory at the 1976 Paris Wine Tasting. House Concurrent Resolution 399 recognizes both the outstanding accomplishments of those responsible for the winning wines and also the many successes of the California wine industry in the thirty years since this event. In 1976, the world of wine was astounded when two Napa Valley wines won a blind taste test held by leading French wine experts in Paris, France. The winning wines were the 1973 Stag's Leap Wine Cellars SLV Napa Valley Cabernet crafted by Warren Winiarski and the 1973 Chateau Montelena Napa Valley Chardonnay crafted by Miljenko â€˜Mike' Grgich. This event became known as the “Tasting Heard â€˜Round the World” and heralded the beginning of the rise to preeminence of California wines. “California's victory in 1976 helped launch what is now one our state's most important industries,” said Thompson. “By honoring this day, we recognize the many contributions our local wine industry has made to our state and the entire country.” Today, California wines are enjoyed around the world and contribute more than $45 billion a year to the U.S. economy. “The everlasting result and reward of the Paris Tasting has been to see the revolutionary improvement in wine quality throughout the world,” said James L. Barrett, founder and vintner of Chateau Montelena. “Everyone was a winner in that tasting, so I invite wine lovers around the world to enjoy a glass of their favorite wine from California, from Spain, from Australia or New Zealand, from South America or France, anywhere in the world and celebrate the event that helped to make that possible.” “Our victory pumped new energy into the California wine industry,” said Grgich. “We were suddenly proud to be from the Napa Valley and we redoubled our efforts to make better wines year after year. This new recognition will only serve as further incentive to continue making world class wine." "Like the finding of America, the discovery that the beautiful wines of the “New World Napa Valley” could stand together with some of the greatest standard bearers of France was like the opening of a new continent to explore everywhere,” said Winiarski. “We are very proud to have the recognition of both houses of Congress and the Smithsonian Institute for the contribution our wine made in that tasting, and we are especially grateful to Mike Thompson for initiating the Congressional Resolution."

08.10.2006	Statement made today by North Coast Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) in response to U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez's announcement that the Klamath River has been named a commercial fisheries failure: “Today's long-awaited announcement opens the door for the West Coast's salmon fishing communities to receive the relief they so desperately need. I applaud Commerce Secretary Gutierrez's decision to finally declare the Klamath River a federal fisheries failure, and I thank Senators Boxer and Feinstein for working so hard with me to help aid the thousands of families who depend on the commercial salmon fishing industry. However, despite this massive step forward, there is still a tremendous amount of work that needs to be done to help these families get back on their feet and restore one of Northern California's most important industries. First, we must appropriate the funds needed to help the thousands of families that lost their livelihood. Next, we must take steps to restore the salmon population by ensuring a clean and adequate supply of water. Over the coming weeks, I will be working closely with my colleagues in the House and Senate to ensure these funds are appropriated as quickly as possible.” The Commerce Secretary made his announcement during a conference call today with Thompson, U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Ron Wyden (D-OR), California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski and members of the California Congressional Delegation and Oregon Congressional Delegation.
08.05.2006	Last night, the U.S. Senate gave final approval to legislation that is intended to help protect thousands of acres of agricultural lands and open space throughout California and the nation. The measure is an important tax provision that will expand deductions available to landowners who donate their land for conservation purposes. As a member of the Way and Means Committee, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) championed the provision, securing its approval in the House of Representatives last month. The bill now goes to the President for his signature into law. “This measure is a landmark victory for preventing urban sprawl from swallowing up our nation's remaining farming lands and open spaces,” said Thompson. “By providing our farmers and ranchers with the opportunity to protect their land from development, we are taking a significant step toward preserving our country's agricultural heritage and improving the quality of our environment.” The improved provision is expected to encourage more landowners to build upon currently existing deductions in a way that will help our working farmers remain in agriculture, rather than sell to developers, which translates into cleaner air and water for both humans and animals. Thompson credited Napa Valley agriculturalist Andy Beckstoffer for his leadership and hard work in helping to secure a broad coalition of grassroots support that spans farming, environmental, wildlife and local government stakeholders. “This could do as much to preserve the Napa Valley in the long term as the agricultural preserve ordinance itself,” said Andy Beckstoffer, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers. “We are doing a good job of preserving the hillsides; this provision will give us the chance to preserve the truly premium vineyard land as well.” Thompson also received strong support from conservation groups, such as The Land Trust of Napa County. “This provision is a significant boost for our conservation efforts,” said John Hoffnagle, Executive Director of The Land Trust of Napa County. “It is absolutely vital that we protect our agricultural land from development, and this opportunity for landowners is a landmark achievement.” Specifically, the provision expands the current tax law in two ways: 1) It raises the cap for such deductions to 50 percent of donor income for all individuals except ranchers and farmers who are capped at 100 percent of donor income. The current cap is 30 percent for all landowners. 2) It extends the carry-forward period for conservation easement deductions to 15 years from the currently-allowable five years.
07.19.2006	Today, the U.S. House Resources Committee passed by voice vote the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act (H.R. 233). This bill has unanimously passed the Senate twice and would designate more than 275,000 acres of northern California as wilderness and approximately 79,000 acres as a Recreation Management Area for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes, all of which is already public land. A revised version of the bill, which is part of a compromise between North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and the House Resources Committee, is expected to reach the House floor next week and be sent to the Senate for consideration. “This widely-supported and bipartisan bill will ensure that one of our nation's most exquisite treasures will be protected for future generations to enjoy,” said Congressman Thompson. “With the help of my colleagues in the Senate, Chairman Pombo and the dedicated individuals and businesses in California, we are closer than ever to signing this important bill into law.” California Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein introduced the legislation in the Senate. Senator Barbara Boxer said, "We are inching closer and closer to protecting more than 275,000 acres of precious California land as wilderness. I applaud Congressman Thompson for his hard work to move this effort forward in the House, and I am more optimistic than ever that we will soon see this bill signed into law.” “So much of our wildlands is vanishing, and it is vital that we preserve what remains,” Senator Feinstein said. “I am deeply proud to be part of this agreement with Senator Boxer, Chairman Pombo and Congressman Mike Thompson to protect as wilderness over 275,000 acres of California's northern coast including the King Range, one of California's most striking and beautiful environmental jewels." This bill would protect public land in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino and Napa Counties as wilderness and designate the Black Butte River in Mendocino County as a wild and scenic river. Also, it will not close any existing roads, affect private lands or alter any grazing rights, and it will designate a Recreation Management Area in Mendocino County for off-highway vehicles and mountain bikes.
06.17.2006	Earlier this month, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a state of emergency in 10 Northern California counties affected by the federal government's decision to severely restrict ocean salmon fishing. In doing so, he made commercial fishermen in Del Norte and nine other counties eligible for state-guaranteed loans totaling $9.2 million. The response of local fishermen was lukewarm at best. While the offer might be better than a kick in the stern, a loan carrying 7 percent interest isn't really what a fisherman struggling with a major income loss really needs. As Kenny Graves, captain of the Crescent City-based Jeannie Marie, said, “It does not make good financial sense to borrow money that you have little or no certainty of paying back.” For fishermenâ€”as well as businesses related to the fishing industryâ€”there's something in the works that makes much better sense. Federal legislation written and introduced by U.S. Rep. Mike Thompson, who represents Del Norte and the rest of California's First District in Congress, would provide $81 million in direct assistance to fishermen and other businesses hurt by this year's salmon shutdown on the West Coast. Every bit as crucial as that financial help for fishermen and businesses is a second component of Thompson's bill that directs the U.S. Department of Commerce to complete a Klamath River salmon recovery plan within six months and authorizes $45 million to implement the plan. The Department of Commerce would also be required to report to Congress annually on the progress of the Klamath recovery plan. A long-term plan for fixing the Klamath's problemsâ€”and the money to put it into playâ€”is essential to maintaining a vital commercial salmon fishing industry along the North coast and beyond. The Klamath River was once the third-greatest producer of salmon in the continental United States. Today, the Klamath's salmon runs are below 10 percent of historic levels. Fisheries scientists cite several things that have contributed to the Klamath's ailing health. A federal water management plan has reduced river flows, leading to rising water temperatures and poor water quality that have allowed deadly parasites to attack juvenile salmon. Aging dams without fish ladders have cut off historic salmon spawning areas. While we appreciate the governor's actions, Thompson's bill would do much more to help our fishing industry.
06.15.2006	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) condemned the Republican Iraq resolution on the House floor today. Thompson, a Vietnam War combat veteran and Purple Heart recipient, was asked by Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to manage a portion of the floor debate. Thompson called on Congress to bring our troops home as soon as possible. "Mr. Speaker, this resolution will not ensure any success in Iraq. It will not bring our troops home. It will only signal the death of true, honest debate within the walls of this great chamber. Today's so called debate is politics at its worstâ€¦ we're playing politics while US men and women are being killed, wounded and kept away from their families. I remember laying in an Army hospital bed just home from Vietnam while Congress played politics. It was disdainful then and when I think of those brave men and women I've visited at Walter Reed, Bethesda and Ramsteinâ€¦ It makes me sick today. Lets do our job and bring our troops home as soon as possible. For weeks we have been told and the American people have been promised, by the Republican majority that there would be a debate on this floor on the Iraq war. Instead we get what the news is reporting as “Republican election year strategy.” This feel good resolution ignores the issues most important to the men and women serving in Iraq, their families and the taxpayers who have already been billed nearly a Â½ trillion dollars. It ignores the issues raised by some of our most respected generals and it ignores the lack of accountability and oversight that's led to some of the most egregious and embarrassing examples of waste, fraud and abuse on record. We need to be working nonstop to bring our troops home as soon as possible not to score political points while they are fighting a war. And we need to be working to keep them as safe as possible until they're home. For starters, we need to send a loud message to the insurgents that we will not occupy Iraq, we will not control Iraq's oil. A message that we want to leave Iraq as much as they want us to leave. On my last visit to Iraq everyone I spoke with wants the Iraqis to assume more of the security responsibilities faster. Our military has done its jobâ€”often in two, three or four tours of dutyâ€”an unconscionable demand on our troops, an unconscionable demand on their families and an unconscionable demand on their communities. And make no mistakeâ€”it's taking a toll on our military. Stay the course is not a strategy for success and we're not doing our job by being a rubber stamp for this administration. Mr. Speaker, this is not an honest debate. While the majority plays politics our men and women serving in Iraq are in terrible danger." # # #
05.11.2006	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) renewed his call today to extend the deadline for seniors to sign up for the new Medicare Part D drug benefit. Beneficiaries have until Monday, May 15 to sign up for the plan or face lifetime penalties for failing to do so. Thompson is a cosponsor of H.R. 3860 a bill that would extend the deadline and suspend the penalty for the 2006 calendar year. Thompson, a member of the Health Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee voted against the Medicare Prscription Drug Benefit in 2003. “On Monday, most seniors who have not yet signed up for the new Part D benefit will face a significant financial penalty,” Thompson said. “That is unacceptable, especially since this benefit was supposedly created to save seniors money. Right now, seniors in our community are picking and choosing from 48 different drug plans. Too many of them have been overwhelmed by the options and haven't yet signed up. Enrollment has been especially low among our poor. There is extra financial assistance available for low-income seniors, but fewer than 20% of those eligible have signed up.” Thompson is also the author of H.R. 4737, legislation that would increase funding by $100 million to Medicare State Health Insurance Programs, known in California as HICAPs. These are federally mandated programs that provide Medicare beneficiaries with unbiased information about their coverage options. Although Thompson is working with his colleagues to extend the Medicare deadline, he encouraged seniors to sign up for the program by Monday. “Inconceivably, repeated bipartisan calls for an extension of the Medicare Part D deadline are falling on the Administration's deaf ears,” he said. “And, as a result, in just four days, most seniors who have not yet signed up for Part D will be penalized for life. We can't trust the Administration to do what's right and extend the deadline so seniors should make every attempt to sign up.” Without a change to federal law, seniors who do not sign up for the drug benefit and who do not currently have "creditable" coverage will face a lifetime penalty should they sign up later. For every month between May 2006 and their eventual sign-up date, an additional 1% will be added to their monthly premiums. To find out if you have creditable coverage, call a Medicare representative at 1-800-MEDICARE. To receive help in choosing a plan, speak with a Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (HICAP) representative at 1-800-434-0222.

04.24.2006	Bay Area Members of Congress unveiled disaster assistance legislation today for West Coast salmon fishing communities that will be impacted by this year's slashed salmon season. Reps. Mike Thompson and Lynn Woolsey announced the bill in front of hundreds of salmon fishermen at a rally on San Francisco's Pier 47. “The Bush Administration's gross mismanagement of the Klamath River has led to this year's and last year's shortened salmon season,” Thompson, the bill's author, said. “Yet, the administration isn't offering any assistance to the affected fishing communities nor do they have a plan to restore the salmon. That is why tomorrow we will be introducing legislation that would offer $81 million dollars in federal assistance. It will also contain measures to revive the Klamath salmon and hold this administration accountable to ensure they cannot manipulate the river for political gain ever again.” The bill has three components: Â·It would provide $81 million in emergence appropriations for impacted commercial fishermen and related businesses in the region. The Department of Commerce would distribute the assistance through the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. Â·It would direct the Department of Commerce to complete a Klamath salmon recovery plan within 6 months of the bill's passage. After the completion of the plan $45 million would be allocated for conservation projects such as stream gauges and monitoring equipment, fish passage projects, and additional NOAA fisheries staff and resources to better track and study Klamath River salmon. Â·The Department of Commerce would be required to report to Congress on the progress of the Klamath on a yearly basis. In 2002, the Bush administration's water diversions on the Klamath River resulted in a record fish kill that claimed 80,000 adult salmon the next fall. Experts have directly attributed the adult fish kill and a parasitic infection affecting spring juveniles, resulting from poor federal management of the river, as being responsible for the low salmon returns estimated for this year. “Without the emergency disaster assistance provided in this legislation, the near closures this year will force many fishermen to tie their boats up for good and never fish again,” said Rep. Lynn Woolsey. “It's not too late to safe Klamath salmon and its not too late to save our fishermen.” Leader Nancy Pelosi said: "The oceans are under siege - all around the world, fish populations are dropping sharply. We must bring back the fish, river-by-river, and region-by-region. Here in California and Oregon, we must all work together-fishermen, tribes, scientists, farmers, and political leaders at the local, state, and federal level. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of Congressman Thompson's new legislation, which will provide disaster assistance and ensure funding for the recovery and restoration of the Klamath salmon." The Pacific Fishery Management Council recommended on April 6, 2006, that the 2006 commercial salmon season be drastically reduced. The decision will severely affect ocean and in-river salmon fisheries along 700 miles of coastline, from Point Falcon, Oregon to Big Sur, California. The economic impact to coastal communities is expected to be devastating. “The bill we're introducing in Congress will greatly help the Klamath River and its tributaries,” Rep. George Miller said. “When you have a healthy river, you have fish, and that's good for local communities, the commercial fishing industry, recreational anglers, tribes, and the entire West Coast. Those of us who care about the Pacific coast's salmon -- and about the fishing communities of the coast -- face a number of serious challenges, but if we work together, we can fix this situation.” “I share the outrage of commercial and sport fishermen up and down the Pacific Coast. In Half Moon Bay in my Congressional District, members of the small commercial and sport fishing fleet are fighting for their livelihoods,” Rep. Anna Eshoo said. “Along with my colleagues, I'm with them in this fight. We're going to stay on this until we have a resolution for the long term.” # # #
04.07.2006	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) today filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with NOAA Fisheries asking for all documents pertaining to federal salmon policy dating back to 2001. “It's time to shine a bright light into the shady backrooms where the Bush Administration has been making politically motivated decisions about the management of the Klamath,” Thompson said. “These politically motivated decisions are directly responsible for the poor condition of the Klamath and the near loss of this year's salmon season.” In 2002 the Bush administration inappropriately diverted Klamath River water to upper basin farmers to solidify their political base. These water diversions resulted in a fish kill that claimed 80,000 adult salmon. Experts say the fish kill and parasitic infection, resulting from poor federal management of the river, are responsible for the low salmon returns expected this year. Thompson's FOIA request would include all administration correspondence pertaining to the 2002 decision to divert water and the 2002 fish kill. Today's request comes amid NOAA Fisheries' continued refusal to provide Congress with a report quantifying the economic impact of last year's shortened salmon season. In a March 29th meeting NOAA officials told Members of Congress that last year's shortened salmon season did not warrant a fisheries disaster. “I have continually asked NOAA fisheries to provide me with the data used to determine that last year's slashed salmon season didn't have a negative economic impact. They have balked each time,” Thompson added. “I find it mystifying that the president can declassify top secret intelligence information that is harmful to our national security, but his own administration won't provide unclassified information on a topic important to the livelihoods of thousands of Americans up and down the California and Oregon coast.” # # #
04.06.2006	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson released the following statement today in reaction to the Pacific Fishery Management Council's decision to limit this year's salmon season. “The Bush Administration's incompetence and gross mismanagement of the Klamath River led to this year's shortened salmon season. The Administration manipulated the Klamath for political gain and as a result the livelihoods of thousands of California and Oregon residents now hang in the balance. “Last year's salmon season was slashed, yet the administration failed to offer any assistance to the affected fishermen. Last week I organized a meeting with the Departments of Commerce and Interior at which administration officials showed little if any interest in assisting the affected fishermen or working together to find a basin-wide solution to the Klamath's dire state.” Thompson represents the First Congressional District, which includes the southern Klamath Basin. In the fall of 2002, after Interior Secretary Gale Norton refused to meet with Thompson to discuss the fish kill of 80,000 adult salmon, Thompson dumped 500 pounds of dead salmon on the steps of the Interior Department during a press conference calling attention to the problem. # # #
02.28.2006	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) today introduced legislation (H. Con. Res. 348) that would call for the redeployment of American forces in Iraq following the completion of the Iraqi constitutional amendment process. If passed, the bill would also honor the members of the U.S. armed forces and reserves for their service and express the sense of the Congress that the United States should not maintain a permanent military presence in Iraq or interfere with Iraqi oil revenues. “Our brave men and women serving in Iraq have performed courageously and honorably and they deserve our thanks and respect,” Thompson said. “Congress and the president must set the bar and identify what it will take for us to accomplish the mission in Iraq. When the Iraqi people conclude the process of amending their constitution and establish their democratic government we must begin to re-deploy our troops.” The text of the bill states, “Resolved in the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), that it is the sense of the Congress thatâ€” 1)the United States should not maintain a permanent military presence or military bases in Iraq; 2)the United States should not attempt to control the flow of Iraqi oil; and 3)United States Armed Forces should be re-deployed from Iraq as soon as practicable after the completion of Iraq's constitution making process or September 30, 2006, whichever comes first.” Thompson, a Vietnam combat veteran, began drafting the legislation upon returning from a Congressional visit to Iraq in late January. The trip was Thompson's second to Iraq. In the fall of 2002 he traveled to the region to see first hand what American forces would face if they were sent to Iraq. Upon returning in October of 2002 Thompson penned an editorial explaining his reasons for traveling to Iraq and predicted that U.S military personnel would be engaged in protracted urban warfare for many years if we invaded. Thompson voted against the resolution giving the president the authority to invade Iraq. Thompson's legislation is the only bill in Congress that stipulates that the Iraqi people should control their oil revenues; it is also the first to combine a withdrawal plan and a clear statement that the United States will not occupy permanent military bases in the country. “Today, the Iraqi insurgency is being fueled by the notion that we have become an occupying force in Iraq. We need to send a clear message that we have no intention on staying in Iraq indefinitely,” Thompson added. “Congress needs to tell the Iraqi people and the Arab world that we will not build permanent military bases in Iraq and that we will not attempt to control the flow of their oil.”
02.22.2006	“I am opposed to the takeover of operations of American ports by any foreign government and I support legislative and legal efforts to block this particular transfer. If anything good can come out of this latest fiasco, it would be the importance of re-focusing our federal government's attention on the critical role that our ports serve in protecting our national security. Only 6% of the 9 million shipping containers that currently enter our ports each year are being inspected. This is unconscionable. The Administration needs to provide the resources necessary for our Coast Guard and Customs Service to properly secure our ports.” -Rep. Mike Thompson
02.08.2006	In an effort to help guide seniors through what they are calling confusing and ill-conceived changes in Medicare prescription drug coverage, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) introduced a bill today that would add $100 million to funding for State Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIPs). Known as HICAPs in California, SHIPs are federally mandated programs that provide Medicare beneficiaries with unbiased information about their coverage options. Lately, they have been focused on helping seniors sign up for the new drug benefit and resolving Part D enrollment disputes. “These programs are overwhelmed and understaffed,” Thompson said. “The Administration knows that beneficiaries want one-on-one assistance and they say SHIP counselors are the best trained to provide that help. But, they haven't funded these programs at a level that lets them assist all beneficiaries. This bill increases funding without adding a single penny to the deficit.” The increase in SHIP funding is paid for by a one percent reduction to a health plan stabilization fund that was included in the Medicare Modernization Act. This fund has never been used and the Senate has voted to eliminate it and redirect the funding. Last year, SHIPs were funded at $31.7 million. With over 43 million Medicare beneficiaries, that averages out to less than 80 cents per person. This bill will bring beneficiary assistance funding up to approximately $3 per person. Thompson questioned Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt about the SHIP program when the Secretary testified before the House Ways and Means Committee today. He pressured Leavitt with data indicators, which show that SHIPs cannot meet beneficiary demand, and said that he was unmoved when the Secretary responded that beneficiaries must look to other resources for help - such as pharmacies, churches, or family members. “HHS cannot expect pharmacists - who are already under-reimbursed and who are sorting out their own payment problems with these drug plans - to walk beneficiaries through every step of this process,” said Thompson. “Nor can they rely on just any volunteer. SHIP counselors are specifically trained to do this job. They need to be given the funding to put that training into action.” # # #
02.03.2006	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) released the following statement today in response to the President's federal disaster declaration for 29 California Counties, including Napa, Sonoma, Mendocino, Lake, Humboldt Del Norte and Yolo. On January 10, 2006 Thompson authored a letter, signed by 26 members of the California Congressional Delegation, urging the President support the Governor's call for disaster relief. “I'm relived and gratified that the Administration has finally realized the true extent of damage caused by the New Year's floods and storms. This was the last major hurdle we had to clear in order to get badly needed federal assistance to those who suffered the most. “Initial estimates pegged the cost of storm related damage at over $350 million. This federal assistance will help local communities and individuals get back on their feet.” # # #
01.31.2006	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) released the following statement in reaction to the President's State of the Union Address tonight. Rep. Mike Thompson is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally responsible Democrats. “The President is right, 2006 will be a decisive year. However, suggesting that we face a choice between â€˜pursuing the enemies of freedom' or â€˜retreating from our duties,' is not only unnecessarily divisive but also just plain wrong. “On Monday night, I returned from a fact-finding trip to Iraq. Talking to our soldiers reconfirmed what many of us already knew. Our armed services are the best in the world and our men and women in uniform are doing an outstanding job. They have done their job. Now it is time for our government to do its job and begin to bring them home. “The United States consumes 25% of the world's oil but holds only 3% of the world's oil reservesâ€”I've been citing this statistic for years. Stating that America is addicted to foreign oil is old news. Alternative energy technology is the cure for our addiction. Yet, President Bush only included $4.5 billion for alternative energy research while he included $12 billion in tax breaks for oil companies. “I whole heartedly agree with the president, we need to invest in education and energy research. However, actions speak much louder than words. I hope that the president will follow up on his rhetoric with funding for science education and alternative energy research. Institutions like the Schatz Energy Lab at Humboldt State and the Institute of Transportation Studies at UC Davis are leading the world in this research. “President Bush must take ownership of his failed Medicare prescription drug benefit. To say that the federal government is providing health care for the poor and elderly while this drug plan is failing just widens the president's credibility gap. “Earlier this month I held a series of town hall meetings. My constituents voiced concerns about the shortfalls of the Medicare drug benefit and the rising costs of health care. “The president offered no solutions to these problems tonight. He is reviving the failed â€˜ownership society' of last year's Social Security privatization debate and applying it to health care. He proposed band-aid solutions that do nothing to address the crux of health care cost increases or provide people with access to quality health care. Instead, the president's broad proposals shift additional costs onto beneficiaries and do nothing to reduce the ranks of the uninsured. “The Country and Congress must begin an honest and open debate on an end to the war in Iraq, reducing our dependence on foreign oil and reforming our health care system. While the president discussed these issues tonight, it isn't clear whether or not he is willing to adequately address them.” # # #
01.10.2006	Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) today called on President George W. Bush to include $31 million in his upcoming budget to expedite the completion of the Napa River - Napa Creek Flood Protection Project. In a detailed letter delivered to the White House today, Thompson and Feinstein expressed to the President the value of the Napa Flood Protection Project and the urgency of completing its construction in light of the recent storm damage. “We believe fully funding the Army Corps capability for the Napa River-Napa Creek Flood Control Project will help finish the project as well as protect citizens and property in the City and County of Napa from future flooding,” the lawmakers said. The current damage in Napa County for the New Year's Eve Flood of 2005 is over $100 million. More than 1,200 homes and 250 businesses have suffered flood damage. The lawmakers pointed out to the President that the devastation would have been much greater without the initial work that has already been performed on the Flood Protection Project. They also stressed that local officials have indicated that damages could have been reduced had the project been able to stay on its original construction completion schedule. “This is an important project to the City and County of Napa that will protect its citizens from flooding and continue the resurgence of downtown Napa,” Senator Feinstein said. “Millions of dollars in private investment have been made in Napa on the promise of better flood protection. Local officials have recognized the significance of this project by contributing their match. Now it is time for the federal and state governments to do their part.” “The Corps' capabilities have been under-funded over the past 5 administration budget proposals,” Rep. Thompson said. “While Congress has been able to replace a portion of these lost funds, the project is still below capacity and completion has been pushed back by several years. Recent storms have shown us the significant value of this project and the additional costs we will incur if it is not completed as quickly as possible.” The lawmakers called on the President to include $31 million in his upcoming budget proposal to fully fund the Army Corps of Engineers capabilities for expediting the project's completion. “Congress has recognized the importance of this project by increasing funding for the project by $23.5 million over the Administration's request since fiscal year 2002,” the letter states. “The local community has demonstrated its financial commitment to this project and its significance by approving a local half-cent sales tax increase in 1998, which has covered any budget shortfalls by providing more than 70% of the project's funding to date.” A copy of the Feinstein-Thompson letter is attached. January 10, 2006 President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We are writing to request that you include $31 million in fiscal year 2007's budget for the Napa River - Napa Creek Flood Protection Project, which is being built in the City and County of Napa, California. We understand this amount will fully fund the Army Corps of Engineers capability in fiscal year 2007 and is especially important as this project reaches an important construction phase in the heart of Napa's downtown business and residential district. The City and County of Napa experienced significant damage as a result of record flooding over this past New Year's Day Weekend. More than 1,200 homes and 250 businesses suffered damage with initial cost estimates totaling over $100 million. Little or no damage was observed in areas of Napa where the project has been constructed. The new higher bridges along with over 700 acres of flood plain constructed in the central and southern areas of the project operated as expected in reducing water levels as well as moving water out of the City in a more rapid manner. The Napa Flood Control Project has been singled out by local, state and federal officials as a national model of responsible public safety that provides both environmental protection and economic development. Over $200 million in private investment has been made in areas adjacent to the Napa River because of the promise that the project's completion will reduce instances of flooding in the City and County. Congress has recognized the importance of this project by increasing funding for the project by $23.5 million over the Administration's request since fiscal year 2002. The local community has demonstrated its financial commitment to this project and its significance by approving a local half-cent sales tax increase in 1998, which has covered any budget shortfalls by providing more than 70% of the project's funding to date. We believe fully funding the Army Corps capability for the Napa Riverâ€”Napa Creek Flood Control Project will help finish the project as well as protect citizens and property in the City and County of Napa from future flooding. Thank you for your consideration of this request and let us know how we can be of assistance. Sincerely, Dianne Feinstein, United States Senator Mike Thompson Member of Congress # # #
12.08.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) will deliver the following speech today during floor debate of the Republican Tax Reconciliation bill. Thompson is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition. Text as prepared for delivery: “Mr. Speaker, just weeks ago the Majority came down to the floor and cut $50 billion from services for middle class workers, students, hungry children, farmers and single moms. Today, they are back with Part Two - pushing almost $60 billion in tax breaks for Americans who need help the least. And they are trying to peddle this as deficit reduction. Only on this floor can you spend $10 billion more than you cut and call it deficit reduction. “Our constituents know that these numbers don't add up. And, they also know that these priorities don't add up. “This bill grows the deficit and it turns a blind eye to the tax increase the middle class will face in just 23 days. That's when relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, expires. Years ago, the AMT was created to prevent 155 very wealthy families from sheltering all of their income from taxes. If relief expires, 16 million families will start paying this tax next year. “This is an issue that hits home for my constituents. California is hit harder by the AMT than any other state in this country. Almost a quarter of the revenue that Treasury gets from the AMT comes to Washington directly from California. If AMT relief isn't extended, that number will increase. “This legislation extends tax cuts that aren't even close to expiring - cuts that are on the books for three more years. It changes more than 25 different tax provisions - but somehow, our friends in the Majority could not find room for AMT relief. “16 million families impacted, 23 days until expiration, zero regard for the middle class. “I urge my colleagues to vote against this irresponsible legislation and support the Rangel substitute. This substitute extends immediately expiring tax provisions AND it protects our middle class families from the AMT.” # # #
12.06.2005	The House of Representatives today unanimously passed legislation that will streamline the management of Redwood National and State Parks. North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson worked with California Senator Dianne Feinstein to include the legislation in a California lands bill (S. 136) which the Senate approved in July. The legislation approved today adjusts the boundary of Redwood National and State Parks to include the 25,000 acre Mill Creek parcel acquired by the California Department of Parks and Recreation in 2002. The boundary adjustment was necessary in order to extend the benefits of the unique cooperative management agreement that exists between the state and federal government. “Adding the Mill Creek property to the Redwood National Park is a historic step and will enable us to protect California's magnificent redwood forests for generations to come,” Senator Feinstein said. “This legislation will also provide watershed protection, and protect wildlife habitats preserving the forest. I would like to thank Congressman Mike Thompson for his partnership in protecting these remarkable natural treasures.” “This boundary adjustment will allow the Redwood National and State Parks to manage this important addition more efficiently and cost effectively,” Thompson said. “Senator Feinstein was instrumental in passing this bill and sending it to the president's desk.” The Mill Creek addition includes the upper watersheds of the Mill and Rock Creeks, tributaries to the Smith Riverâ€”the longest un-dammed river in California. Mill Creek supports the most significant run of federally protected Coho Salmon on the Smith River. The language included in S. 136 is identical to the “Redwood National Park Boundary Adjustment Act” (H.R. 361) a bill that Rep. Thompson first introduced in 2003. The National Parks Service, Del Norte County, the Save-the-Redwoods-League, the State of California, the Yurok Tribe and support the legislation. After being approved by both houses of Congress S. 136 has been sent to the president for his signature. # # #
11.17.2005	31 Blue Dog Democrats today sent a letter to Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Bill Young and Ranking Member John Murtha urging them to include the McCain anti-torture amendment in the FY2006 Defense Department Appropriations conference report. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), a Vietnam combat veteran, authored the letter. The text of the letter is below: November 16, 2005 The Honorable Bill Young, Chairman, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on Appropriations, H149 Capital, Washington, D.C. 20515 The Honorable John P. Murtha, Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee on Appropriations, 1016 Longworth House Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Young and Ranking Member Murtha: As Members of the Blue Dog Coalition, we support a Senate-passed amendment that would establish clear guidelines for interrogating prisoners captured by our military. This amendment, proposed by Senator John McCain of Arizona, with 11 cosponsors, was approved as part of the FY2006 Defense Department Appropriations bill on a vote of 90-9 and is identical to language included in HR 3985, which a number of Blue Dogs have cosponsored. As Blue Dogs, we believe we must not lose sight of the importance of combating terrorism. The threat of a terrorist attack still hangs over our nation. However, in our effort to defend the liberties that we cherish, we should not erode the very freedoms we seek to protect. Above all else, America must lead the world by example. We owe it to the world to hold ourselves to a higher standard and to demonstrate our commitment to democracy and human rights both at home and abroad. These are the values that distinguish us from our enemies and we must hold firm to these fundamental beliefs if we are to win the war on terror. Recent reports of abuses committed against detainees in U.S. custody, such as the incidents at Abu Ghraib prison, suggest appalling acts that dishonor our military and our nation. It is important that in our effort to prevail in the war on terrorism we do not sacrifice the integrity and accountability of government and military officials. Therefore, we urge the inclusion of the McCain anti-torture amendment in the FY2006 Defense Department Appropriations conference report. Establishing the Army Field Manual as the uniform standard for the interrogation of detainees will reduce the significant level of confusion that still exists with respect to which interrogation techniques are allowed. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Mike Thompson, Jane Harman, Dennis Cardoza, Mike Ross, Lincoln Davis, David Scott, Jim Cooper, Loretta Sanchez, Allen Boyd, Jim Costa, Michael H. Michaud, Tim Holden, John Salazar, Dan Boren, Melissa L. Bean, Joe Baca, Jim Matheson, Ellen O.Tauscher, Dennis Moore, Charlie Melancon, Steve Israel, Sanford D. Bishop, Jr., Robert E. “Bud” Cramer, Marion Berry, Harold E. Ford, Jr., Collin C. Peterson, Earl Pomerory, Stephanie Herseth, Mike McIntyre, John Barrow, Adam Schiff,
11.15.2005	In an effort to encourage Congress to lead by example, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) introduced a resolution today that would direct the House and Senate to coordinate its recycling and reuse of obsolete computers and electronic equipment. Thompson, himself a founding member of the E-Waste Working group, was joined by the group's other founding members, Rep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY), Rep. Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-Calif.) and Rep. Mary Bono (R-Calif.), in cosponsoring the measure. “Our ultimate goal is to pass a national plan to address the growing e-waste problem. Each year Americans dispose of 2 million tons of electronics which contain harmful chemicals such as lead and mercury,” Thompson said. “Before we can enact a national plan, Congress needs its own plan to properly dispose of its own e-waste. This is an opportunity for Congress to lead by example.” The resolution would express the sense of the Congress that leaders of Congress and other legislative branch offices (Congressional Budget Office, General Accounting Office, Library of Congress, Architect of the Capitol, etc.) should work together to establish and implement a coordinated program for the reuse, recycling and appropriate disposal of obsolete computers and electronic equipment. “A patchwork of state and international e-waste laws risk placing our domestic manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage and worsening the environmental consequences of e-waste,” Slaughter said. “This resolution is a strong first step towards advancing a national approach to the recycling and reuse of electronic equipment.” “Raising awareness in Congress for the e-waste problem is one of the primary goals of the E-Waste Working Group,” said Congressman Cunningham. “I think this resolution will pressure the legislative branch to become more familiar with electronic recycling and once Congress decides to act on electronic waste, it is important for us to show our commitment by practicing our own responsible consumption.” “The potential harm to both the environment and humans from the improper disposal of e-waste is a rapidly growing concern that Congress needs to address,” Rep. Bono said. “I am thrilled to work with Congressmen Thompson, Cunningham and Congresswoman Slaughter to address this issue and hope that this working group can set the groundwork for a useful and intelligent conversation on how best to tackle this rising problem.” The average useful life of a computer is only 2 years. Americans dispose of 50 million computers each year or 3,000 tons each day. Each computer contains harmful elements such as lead, cadmium and mercury, which if disposed of improperly can harm people and the environment. The Congressional E-Waste Working Group was formed in May of 2005 with the goal of exploring national solutions to the burgeoning e-waste problem and educating Members of Congress. # # #
11.08.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Rep. Denny Rehberg (R-Mont.) today introduced the “Veterans Right to Know Act,” a bill that would establish an independent commission to investigate chemical and biological weapons testing conducted on American servicemen and women. Between 1962 and 1974, the Department of Defense (DoD) conducted a number of weapons tests on unknowing military personnel, using chemical and biological agents, such as Vx nerve gas, Sarin Nerve Gas and E. Coli. A Government Accountability Office report (GAO-04-410) issued in May of 2004 concluded that a substantial number of veterans remain unaware that tests were conducted on them. “Throughout the 60's and 70's our government exposed thousands of servicemen and women to harmful chemical and biological agents. Today, these veterans have the right to know what they were exposed to so that they can receive the healthcare they need and deserve,” Thompson said. “This legislation will establish an independent investigation to uncover which tests took place, what agents were used and which veterans were exposed.” "This is about openness, honesty and forthrightness in government; above all, it's about doing the right thing and uncovering the truth. Truth is what these brave veterans have asked for and truth is what they deserve,” Rehberg said. The “Veterans Right to Know Act,” would create a 10-member, bipartisan Commission (modeled after the 911 Commission) to investigate chemical or biological warfare tests carried out under Project 112/SHAD. The commission would be required to report to Congress and the President 36 months after it is established. The commission would work with the Veterans' Administration to inform those who were exposed to testing. If veterans have symptoms associated with the tests they would be eligible for proper medical treatment and any potential service related disability compensation. The bill has been endorsed by, the Vietnam Veterans of America, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Military Officers Association of America, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Blinded Veterans of America. # # #
11.01.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson denounced new recommendations released today by the President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. The recommendations would eliminate important tax deductions for Californians, costing taxpayers thousands of dollars each year in increased taxes. “The panel's recommendations do little to simplify our tax code, instead they saddle middle-class Americans with higher taxes,” Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley), a member of the House of Representatives' tax writing committee, said. The panel recommended eliminating the deduction for state and local taxes, substantially reducing the home mortgage interest deduction, capping the deduction for employer-provided health insurance and reducing the deduction for charitable giving. “Californians live in some of the most expensive housing markets in the country,” Thompson said. “That fact, coupled with our state and local tax rates, means that eliminating these important deductions will hit taxpayers hard. Californians will see their taxes go up by thousands of dollars a year.” A report by the House Ways and Means Committee minority staff has shown that if the deduction for state and local taxes is eliminated, average Californians could see their federal taxes increase by over $2,200. Rep. Mike Thompson is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee which has jurisdiction over tax issues. He is also a member of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of moderate Democrats dedicated to restoring fiscal responsibility in government. # # #
10.28.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) has secured $57 million for local agriculture priorities in the federal spending bill for 2006 which was approved by the House of Representatives today. “Agriculture is vital to the 1st Congressional District and contributes millions of dollars to our local economy each year,” Thompson said. “The programs funded in this bill will provide essential services to protect our crops from harmful pests and disease.” The $57 million includes funding for the following projects: Â·$42.6 millionâ€”Pierce's Disease, Research and Controlâ€”Pierce's Disease is a harmful plant virus, spread by the glassy-winged sharpshooter. It was responsible for the complete destruction of more than 1,000 acres of grapevines in Temecula starting in the late 1990's that cost growers and the California economy tens of millions of dollars. The funding will be allocated to plant inspection programs and viticulture research institutions. Â·$5.4 millionâ€”Sudden Oak Death, Research and Control â€”Sudden Oak Death is a fungus-like pathogen that has decimated oak trees and infected other plant species such as California's prized redwood trees. The disease has stricken at least 12 California counties and has spread to the Pacific Northwest. The funding is allocated between three different programs, $3. million for the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service, $2.3 million for the Agricultural Research Service and $93,000 for the Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service. Â·$7 millionâ€”Specialty Crop Grantsâ€”Specialty crops include: tree nuts, wine grapes, dried fruits, and nursery crops. The grant program will allow the Secretary of Agriculture to award grants to promote the farming of specialty crops. Â·$1.7 millionâ€”Olive Fruit Fly, Research and Control â€”The Olive Fruit Fly is the world's most destructive olive pest and has infested thousands of acres of olive groves throughout California, jeopardizing the state's important olive oil and table olive industries. $1.35 million will be allocated to the Agricultural Research Service and 320,000 will be allocated to the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service. Â·$300,000â€”Broom Biological Control, Researchâ€”Broom and Gorse are foreign weeds that have infested areas in California, Oregon and Washington, causing economic and ecological damage. The funding will be used to develop biological control agents to eradicate these invasive weeds. Â·$100,000â€”Ludwigia Controlâ€”Ludwigia is a plant that damages waterways and fosters mosquito populations which transmit the West Nile Virus. The funding will support scientific research to develop sustainable methods for managing the vegetation. “Our communities' vigilance and our local education efforts have prevented the spread of sharpshooters and Pierce's Disease in our region,” Thompson said. “This continued federal funding will help build upon our local efforts and support important research into eradicating this potentially devastating winegrape disease.” The Senate will pass the Agriculture Appropriations Bill next week and the President is expected to sign the legislation shortly thereafter. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) is a member of the House Ways and Means Committee and the co-founder and co-chair of the Congressional Wine Caucus. # # #
10.21.2005	The national debt rose to $8 trillion today marking a record high for the federal government's deficit spending. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) called this milestone a consequence of the Congressional leadership's abhorrent fiscal track record. “$8 trillion dollars is the price of the Congressional leadership's failed policies,” Thompson said. “Unfortunately, the Congress won't be paying this price, our children and grandchildren will.” Thompson said “trillion” is a term that most mathematicians do not use but is unfortunately more closely associated with governments. To put the number in context, a million hours ago was in 1891, a billion seconds ago Richard Nixon was president and one trillion seconds ago-31,688 years-Neanderthals walked the earth. “This development comes as no surprise, many of us have been attempting to restore fiscal responsibility to Congress for years now but the Congressional leadership has defeated our efforts.” Thompson, a member of the fiscally conservative Congressional Blue Dog Coalition, has led past floor debates on attempting to apply PayGo rules to all spending and tax measures that the Congress approves. These rules would require that the federal government must be able to pay for any bill that the Congress approves. His effort was defeated by one vote but he vowed to keep trying. # # #
10.18.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) issued the following statement today in reaction to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals' rejection of the Bush administration's water diversion plan for the Klamath River. The court rejected the plan on the grounds that it would not protect threatened Klamath River Coho salmon. Thompson was one of the plaintiffs in the case. “Today's unanimous decision by the court confirmed what we have been saying for years, Klamath River salmon need sufficient flows of cool, clean water to survive,” Thompson said. “A sustainable water plan in the Klamath benefits fishing communities up and down the Pacific Coast. This year's drastically reduced salmon season is a product of the first year of the administration's water plan, which resulted in up to 80,000 dead fish. The 9th circuit has handed down a major victory for salmon restoration efforts.” Congressman Thompson represents California's First District, which spans much of the Northern California Coast. # # #
07.26.2005	The Senate today passed U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer's (D-CA) Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act, which would protect approximately 300,000 acres of public lands in California. “This bill ensures that some of Northern California's most treasured wild places will remain wild,” Boxer said. “By protecting the natural beauty that is part of California's identity, future generations will be able to cherish and enjoy this land.” Boxer's bill will protect select areas in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake Mendocino and Napa counties by designating portions of the public land as “wilderness.” The bill also designates a free flowing portion of the Black Butte river as “wild and scenic.” Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA)is the lead cosponsor of the legislation in the Senate. Congressman Mike Thompson (also D-CA) introduced the House version of the bill. Boxer said,“I would like to send my gratitude to the many wonderful Californians who contributed to this community effort. I would also like to thank Senator Feinstein and Congressman Mike Thompson for their leadership.” Feinstein said,“The King Range is a vast and beautiful tract of land. It is one of California's great environmental treasures. That's why I'm so pleased that the Senate has approved legislation to protect 300,000 acres along California's northern coast including the King Range. Senator Boxer and Representative Thompson have shown great leadership in moving this bill forward. It is my hope that this bill will be passed by the House and signed into law by the President soon.” Thompson said, “Today the North Coast Wilderness Bill cleared a major hurdle on the track to putting this important legislation on the president's desk. Without Sen. Boxer's and Sen. Feinstein's hard work this bill would not have passed the Senate.” # # #
07.20.2005	The House Energy and Commerce Committee today held the first Congressional hearing on the nation's growing electronic waste (e-waste) problem. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA) and other members of the Congressional E-waste Working Group testified at the hearing. “Each day electronic products are becoming smaller and lighter, but they are also creating an ever-growing environmental and waste disposal problem,” Thompson said. “Today the average lifespan of a computer is only two years and Americans are disposing of 3,000 tons of computers each day.” The Environment and Hazardous Waste Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee held today's hearing which was titled, “Electronic Waste: An Examination of Current Activity, Implications for Environmental Stewardship, and the Proper Federal Role.” Representatives from the Department of Commerce and Environmental Protection Agency testified as well as representatives from California, Maine and Maryland, the three states that have passed e-waste laws. “Without a national recycling infrastructure consumers and businesses are left with few alternatives for getting rid of their old computers and electronics,” Thompson added. “This hearing is an important first step in addressing this growing problem. The E-waste Working Group will continue to work with the committee to investigate the problem and look for a common sense national solution.” Earlier this year Thompson introduced the National Computer Recycling Act (H.R. 425) a bill that would direct the EPA to develop and implement a national e-waste recycling program. # # #
07.14.2005	A Congressional Subcommittee held a long awaited hearing on the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act (H.R. 233) today with local elected officials and wilderness advocates testifying on its behalf. North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson, the bill's sponsor, testified on its behalf before the Forests and Forest Health Subcommittee of the House Resources Committee. “The public lands covered in this bill are some of the most beautiful in our country and are truly deserving of wilderness designation,” Thompson said in his testimony. “We worked in a bipartisan manner with stakeholders in every county of the 1st Congressional District to ensure all concerns were considered and we drafted a bill that balanced all interests.” California Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein introduced the legislation in the Senate earlier this year. The bill has been approved by the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and is awaiting approval by the full senate. "California's wild beauty is an essential part of its identity," said Senator Boxer. "If Congress acts this year and passes this bill, future generations will be thanking us for preserving places like the King Range and the remaining stunning, wild, and unspoiled Northern California coast. I would like to thank Representative Thompson, who has been leading the effort on the House side for this bill, and Senator Feinstein, whose hard work on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has been invaluable." “Today's hearing moves us one step closer to passing this bill and protecting this environmental treasure for future generations,” Senator Feinstein said. “Congressman Thompson, Senator Boxer, and I have spent countless hours working to ensure that this bill strikes the right balance - especially with regard to preventing catastrophic fire and protecting property and grazing rights. I look forward to working with the Committee to ensure that the bill moves forward and is enacted into law.” Mendocino County Supervisor Jim Wattenburger and Del Norte County Supervisor Martha McClure testified in support of H.R. 233. They were joined in Washington by a number of local officials and wilderness advocates who are lobbying on behalf of the legislation. “As a pro-business Republican and member of the Ukiah Chamber of Commerce, the economic benefits of this proposal are also clear to me,” Supervisor Wattenburger said. “Tourism is an important part of our economy along with timber, fishing, agriculture and retail. The areas proposed for protection are considered poor candidates for logging but are well suited to attract visitors who want to hike, boat, hunt and fish.” “I thank Chairman Pombo and Subcommittee Chairman Walden for holding this hearing and appreciate Congressman Thompson's diligent effort in crafting this bill that considers the impacts to local citizens and addresses their concerns,” Supervisor Martha McClure said. “I support this bill because there is no land being taken off the tax roll and no roads will be closed.” During the hearing Rep. Thompson addressed concerns about fire management policies, road closures and timber management policies. “We adjusted the proposed wilderness boundaries to keep roads open and minimize the impact on future logging,” Thompson said. “H.R. 233 also strengthens the land managers ability to prevent and fight fires on wilderness land.” # # #
06.15.2005	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) voted today in support of a measure that would have prohibited the Department of Justice from interfering with states' medical marijuana laws. The amendment to the Science, Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations bill authored by Rep. Hinchey (D-NY) was defeated by a vote of 161 to 264. Thompson said he was disappointed by the final vote and charged that the fight for states' rights on the matter is not over. “This is an issue of compassion and common sense,” he said. “In the age of corporate scandals and terrorism, the Department of Justice has responsibilities far more important than arresting cancer patients.” On June 6, the Supreme Court ruled that federal authorities could prosecute medical marijuana patients regardless of whether or not state laws allow for its use. In the majority opinion Associate Justice John Paul Stevens noted that Congress could act to change the law. The Hinchey Amendment would have barred the Department of Justice from using federal funds to prevent states from implementing their medical marijuana laws. Thompson is also a cosponsor of the “States' Rights to Medical Marijuana Act” (H.R. 2087), a bill that would repeal the federal restrictions that prevent states from allowing the medical use of marijuana. Medical marijuana has provided thousands of patients with relief from symptoms associated with serious illnesses. # # #
06.14.2005	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) announced today that Lidia Soriano a 2005 graduate of Napa's Vintage High School is the winner of this year's First District Congressional Art Competition. Soriano's painting, entitled “Self Reflection,” will be displayed in the United States Capitol for one year. Lidia was in Washington today to attend the ribbon cutting for “An Artistic Discovery,” an exhibit that features works of art competition winners from across the country. Lidia's art teacher Christine Golik and Vintage classmate Sarah Douglas accompanied her to today's ribbon cutting and Congressional reception. “The annual Congressional Arts Competition provides a means for talented young artists in our community to showcase their work,” Thompson said. “Lidia's painting will be seen each day by Members of Congress, staff and the thousands of tourists visiting the Capitol. I congratulate Lidia on her accomplishments and I wish her luck as she continues her education and painting.” Lidia is the first in her family to graduate from high school and next fall she will be attending Napa Valley Community College. “I have had a great time touring Washington and visiting places like the National Gallery of Art,” Lidia said after today's events. “Today's ribbon cutting was exciting. It was great to meet other artists from around the country and see my painting displayed in the United States Capitol.” Southwest Airlines donated three roundtrip tickets to Washington, D.C. for Lidia and her guests and the Napa County Hispanic Network donated $100.00 to help defray her expenses. While in Washington Lidia and her guests have visited a number of art galleries and monuments in addition to taking a tour of the Capitol. # # #
06.13.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) today announced the introduction of bipartisan legislation that will increase telehealth services offered to Medicare beneficiaries and expand access to health care for all Americans. Last week, Thompson and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-MO) introduced the “Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act of 2005” (H.R. 2807), a bill designed to widen the reach and expand the utilization of telemedicine nationwide. “The data tells us that telemedicine delivers high-quality, cost-effective care to rural and medically underserved areas,” Thompson said. “Our bill builds on those facts and will result in more people seeking and receiving the care that they need.” The legislation will eliminate geographical restrictions on and expand the types of facilities eligible for Medicare telehealth reimbursements. Further, it will authorize $30 million in funding for telehealth grant programs to be administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration. These programs will link rural hospitals, health care providers and patients to other hospitals, providers and patients. “Telemedicine has successfully increased access to health care throughout Northern California,” Thompson said. “The Medicare Telehealth Enhancement Act will expand existing facilities nationwide and increase the access of all patients to medical experts across the country.” The bill was referred to the House Ways and Means Committee of which Thompson and Hulshof are both members. # # #
06.10.2005	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) teamed with Congressman Tom Reynolds (R-NY) this week to introduce bipartisan legislation that would allow for greater tax deductions for charitable donations of art and collectables. The Art and Collectibles Capital Gains Tax Treatment Parity Act (H.R. 2786), will allow artists to claim a fair market tax deduction for charitable donations of their work. Under current law artists, authors, musicians and scholars may only deduct the cost of materials used to create their works, not the fair market value of the product. “This legislation is about fairness,” Thompson said. “If an individual donates stocks or bonds to charity they receive a deduction for the full value. But under current law if an artist donates a creation they only receive a deduction for the value of raw materials used to create it.” The legislation would set certain limitations to protect against potential abuses. For example, the safeguards include a provision requiring eligible works to be at least 18 months old and to be appraised in accordance with strict Treasury Department regulations. The bill has been referred to the House Committee on Ways and Means of which Reps. Thompson and Reynolds are both members. Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Charles Schumer (D-NY) introduced companion legislation in the Senate. “This bill is particularly important to creative and art abundant regions like California's North Coast. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation,” Thompson added. # # #
05.24.2005	Two Republicans and two Democrats joined forces today in the fight to reduce electronic waste (e-waste). Reps. Mike Thompson (D-CA), Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-CA), Louise Slaughter (D-NY) and Mary Bono (R-CA) announced the formation of the Congressional E-Waste Working Group at a news conference this morning. The working group will explore possible solutions to the nation's growing electronic waste problem while educating Members of Congress about its consequences. Over 50 million computers are disposed of annually and each of these computers contains harmful elements such as lead, cadmium and mercury. If electronics are disposed of improperly they can harm people and the environment. “Today the average lifespan of a computer is only 2 years and Americans are disposing of 3,000 tons of computers each day. Many people are unaware of how to properly dispose of outdated electronics, so they hold on to them, taking up space in homes and businesses,” Rep. Thompson said. “E-waste is a growing environmental problem that warrants national action. Our working group will meet on a regular basis to investigate the possible solutions to this problem.” “I am proud to announce my participation in the newly formed E-Waste Working Group,” Rep. Cunningham said. “Electronic recycling has not received the attention it deserves from the federal government and this is why we have established the E-Waste Working Group. My colleagues and I stand here today to show our personal commitment to solving this important issue.” "E-waste is a national problem that needs a national solution. Since the year 2000, we've increased the number of electronics entering the waste stream by at least 10 million units,” Rep. Slaughter said. “As we continue to dispose of more and more units each year, finding a national disposal approach becomes more and more critical. We can no longer afford to ignore this growing problem." “The potential harm to both the environment and humans from the improper disposal of e-waste is a rapidly growing concern that Congress needs to address,” Rep. Bono said. “I am thrilled to work with Congressmen Thompson, Cunningham and Congresswoman Slaughter to address this issue and hope that this working group can set the groundwork for a useful and intelligent conversation on how best to tackle this rising problem.” Following today's news conference the E-Waste Working Group co-sponsored its first Congressional staff briefing with seven stakeholder groups, the Consumer Electronics Association, the Consumer Electronics Retailers Coalition, the Electronics Industries Alliance, Panasonic, Sony, Hewlett-Packard, and Goodwill Industries. The event was titled, “Electronic Device Recycling: Is a National Implementation Approach Necessary?” Ben Wu, The Department of Commerce's Undersecretary for Technology and Matt Hale, Director of the EPA's Office of Solid Waste, addressed the staff members in attendance. # # #
05.23.2005	The Social Security and Medicare Trustees released a report today showing that Social Security will be able to pay full benefits through 2041 and at least 74 percent of benefits thereafter. In response, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) called on the President to abandon his risky Social Security privatization plans. “The president has said that Social Security is in crisis and facing bankruptcy. Today's reportâ€”issued by his trusteesâ€”clearly proves him wrong,” Thompson said. “Social Security is facing a long-term challenge but the real crisis is the president's privatization plan. It takes so much money out of the Social Security Trust Fund that full benefits stop getting paid more than a decade sooner than currently projected.” In 1983 Democratic House Speaker O'Neill and President Regan worked together on compromise that strengthened Social Security. Thompson indicated that he and other Democrats are prepared to work in a bipartisan manner to solve the challenges facing Social Security. “We are going to have to act to protect Social Security and I'm prepared to work with all of my colleagues to explore reasonable options to secure the future of this important program,” Thompson said. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) serves on the House Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over Social Security. # # #
05.04.2005	North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez this afternoon urging him to declare a fisheries disaster in California and Oregon. This year's abridged salmon season will have a drastic economic impact on coastal communities throughout the two states. In order for individuals and businesses to apply for federal disaster assistance the Secretary of Commerce must declare a fishery disaster. The text of the letter can be found below: May 4, 2005 Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez Office of the Secretary Room 5516 U.S. Department of Commerce 14th & Constitution Ave. NW Washington, DC 20230 RE: Disaster Declaration for 2005 California Salmon Fisheries Dear Secretary Gutierrez: This year salmon fishermen from California and Oregon will experience unprecedented restrictions on their salmon fishing season due to very poor adult salmonid returns to the Klamath River. The low returns are the result of a multi-year drought and subsequent water conditions. The situation is so extreme that I am writing to urge you to declare a fishery disaster, as provided for under the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Act, to provide financial relief for the affected individuals, businesses and communities. On April 8th 2005, the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) recommended severe restrictions on the offshore ocean salmon fisheries of California and Oregon. As a result, in California, the Fish & Game Commission has imposed a drastically reduced salmon fishing season for commercial ocean and in-river fishermen and for the subsistence fishery relied on by the Yurok, Hoopa and Karuk Tribes. This will result in catastrophic economic losses for fishing families and for fishing dependent communities. The estimated loss to the California commercial fishing fleet alone could exceed $100 million. The situation for others, including processors, port and tribal communities, related on-shore businesses, sports fishing guides and related businesses will be disastrous. Similar steps have been taken in Oregon with similar impacts on the local fishing industry and communities. At least twice before, NOAA Fisheries declared the salmon fisheries of the West coast a disaster, once following the seven-year drought of the late 1980's and Secretary Gutierrez early 1990's and an earlier one following the El NiÃ±o of 1982-83. Declaration of a fishery disaster is the first step needed to allow the affected individuals and businesses to access federal disaster relief programs called for under the Magnuson-Stevens Act. I urge your immediate review of the situation so that the affected communities can help prepare for the impact of the new restrictions. If you have any questions regarding this request or need additional information concerning the financial impact of the restrictions please not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON Member of Congress # # #
04.20.2005	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) today placed a debt clock in front of his Capitol office in an effort to call attention to our nation's mounting national debt. The clock, which will be updated daily, currently reads $7.671 trillion in national debt, which equals a $27,000 share for each American. “Congress has the responsibility to reign in our out-of-control debt,” Thompson said. “These debt clocks will remind members of Congress and visitors that we must act to restore fiscal responsibility to our government. It will be harder for members of Congress to ignore our growing debt when they are faced with it each day.” By next week more than two-dozen members of the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally responsible Democrats, will be displaying debt clocks outside of their offices. Earlier this year, Thompson joined the Blue Dogs in releasing the following 12-Step Budget Reform Plan to get America's fiscal house in order: 1) Require a balanced Budget 2) Don't let Congress buy on credit - Restore PAYGO 3) Put a lid on spending 4) Require federal agencies to put their fiscal houses in order 5) Make Congress tell taxpayers how much they're spending 6) Set aside a rainy-day fund 7) Don't hide votes to raise the debt limit 8) Justify spending for pet projects 9) Ensure that Congress reads the bills it's voting on 10) Require honest cost estimates for every bill that Congress votes on 11) Make sure new bills fit the budget 12) Make Congress do a better job keeping tabs on government programs “Members of Congress and the White House need to start behaving like American families, we need to pay for what we pass,” Thompson added. “These common sense budget reforms would bring fiscal responsibility back to the federal government. The growing debt clock outside my office will highlight the urgent need for reform.” # # #
03.23.2005	The Social Security and Medicare Trustees released a report today showing that Social Security will be able to pay full benefits through 2041 and at least 74 percent of benefits thereafter. In response, Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) called on the President to abandon his risky Social Security privatization plans. “The president has said that Social Security is in crisis and facing bankruptcy. Today's reportâ€”issued by his trusteesâ€”clearly proves him wrong,” Thompson said. “Social Security is facing a long-term challenge but the real crisis is the president's privatization plan. It takes so much money out of the Social Security Trust Fund that full benefits stop getting paid more than a decade sooner than currently projected.” In 1983 Democratic House Speaker O'Neill and President Regan worked together on compromise that strengthened Social Security. Thompson indicated that he and other Democrats are prepared to work in a bipartisan manner to solve the challenges facing Social Security. “We are going to have to act to protect Social Security and I'm prepared to work with all of my colleagues to explore reasonable options to secure the future of this important program,” Thompson said. Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) serves on the House Ways & Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over Social Security. # # #
03.17.2005	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) voted against the 2006 Budget Resolution earlier today citing the budget's lack of fiscal responsibility as the reason for his vote. “This Budget does not take responsible steps toward reducing the budget deficit and paying down our national debt,” Thompson said. “I voted against it because the Congress and the Administration must take responsibility for the financial future of our country.” Thompson supported a budget reform plan offered by the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democrats that he belongs to. The plan called for adding pay-as-you-go rules to the budget, adopting discretionary spending caps and creating a “rainy day” fund for national emergencies. Thompson has been a longtime advocate of pay-as-you-go rules that would require Congress to pay for any bill that it passes. A number of Republicans supported the Blue Dog budget reforms in the House Budget Committee. However, the Republican Leadership blocked consideration of the reforms during debate on the House floor. The national debt is currently $7.8 trillion much of which is held by foreign countries such as China, Japan and even OPEC, the alliance of oil producing nations. “Each American's share of the national debt is roughly $26,000,” Thompson added. “If we continue to adopt fiscally irresponsible budgets we will leave a legacy of debt for generations to come.” The budget resolution passed this afternoon by a vote of 218-213. # # #
03.11.2005	The House of Representatives yesterday approved a transportation bill that provides $12 million in loan forgiveness for the North Coast Railroad Authority (NCRA). North Coast Congressman Mike Thompson was able to secure this funding in H.R. 3 the Transportation Equity Act, the bill that determines the direction of federal transportation funding for the next six years. “The North Coast Railroad is a critical piece of infrastructure that has the potential to greatly improve our region's economy,” Thompson said. “This funding will help the railroad in its efforts to get trains running again which would provide greater access to the Port of Eureka and reduce truck traffic on Highway 101.” In addition to $12 million in loan forgiveness, the bill designates the NCRA as the lead agency to accept $8.6 million in unused funding that had been approved in transportation funding passed in previous years. The NCRA manages 300 miles of tracks running through Humboldt, Mendocino, Sonoma and Marin Counties. Reopening the railroad will provide an additional transportation link between the Humboldt Bay and the San Francisco Bay Area which in turn will lessen truck traffic on Highway 101 by approximately 17,000 miles a year and reduce highway maintenance costs by up to $2 million each year. The next step for the Transportation Equity Act is consideration in the Senate and a conference committee where the House and Senate will compromise on the final version of the bill. Thompson signaled that he is confident this language will remain in the bill, “this legislation still has some hurdles ahead of it but I will continue to fight for this important funding.” # # #
03.02.2005	Two House members from opposite parties have joined together to call for Congressional hearings on the growing national issue of electronic waste. Reps. Randy “Duke” Cunningham (R-CA) and Mike Thompson (D-CA) today called on the House Science Committee to begin hearings on legislation aimed at stemming the tide of e-waste being generated from obsolete computers and other electronic components that are impacting human health and our environment. Over 3,000 tons of electronics are discarded every day in America with 50 million obsolete computers finding their ways into community landfills per year. If not properly recycled, the large amounts of lead, cadmium and chromium found in e-waste can expose humans and water systems to high levels of carcinogens. “States have already begun to pass a myriad of laws to address this problem, but there needs to be a comprehensive e-waste reduction program addressed at the federal level,” said Cunningham. “Congressman Thompson and I are committed to finding a solution to regulate and reduce e-waste.” “E-Waste is becoming one of our nation's fastest growing environmental and waste concerns,” Thompson said. “A Congressional hearing will bring more attention to the issue and allow us to gather expert testimony on the problem. I look forward to working with Congressman Cunningham and our colleagues to find the best possible solution to reduce e-waste.” Thompson and Cunningham have each introduced separate bills to combat e-waste through new recycling efforts. Earlier this year Cunningham introduced the Tax Incentives to Encourage Recycling (TIER) Act (H.R. 320) and Thompson introduced the National Computer Recycling Act (H.R. 425). A copy of the letter they sent to House Science Chair Sherwood Boehlert is below. March 2, 2005 The Honorable Sherwood L. Boehlert Chairman Committee on Science 2320 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Boehlert: Over the last two Congresses, we have introduced separate legislation to address the burgeoning problem of electronic waste, or e-waste. Despite the fact that both of our bills take different approaches to address this issue, we believe this problem needs the full attention of Congress. We request that your Committee hold a hearing on the issue of computer recycling and e-waste. The e-waste that is generated from obsolete computers is fast becoming a serious danger to public health and the environment. Over 3,000 tons of electronics are discarded everyday in our country. Additionally, the average life span of a computer has shrunk from five years to two and approximately 50 million computers are discarded every year. E-waste contains large amounts of documented hazardous materials and carcinogens, including lead, cadmium, chromium, brominated-flame retardants and PVC plastics. We are concerned that until e-waste is properly recycled, its hazardous components will continue to threaten human health and the environment. Maine and California have already enacted statewide e-waste laws. However, without a national law, a patchwork of different state laws makes it difficult and expensive for manufacturers and retailers to follow them. With federal regulators slow to implement a comprehensive e-waste reduction program, we feel that your committee's attention is appropriate and necessary. A hearing by your panel is one step in the right direction of addressing our country's e-waste problem. We both would be happy to appear before the Committee in person or to submit a written statement for the record. Thank you for your time and consideration. We look forward to working with you to address this serious concern. Sincerely, MIKE THOMPSON Member of Congress RANDY “DUKE” CUNNINGHAM Member of Congress # # #
02.15.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) announced the introduction of the War Funding Accountability Act at a press conference in the U.S. Capitol today. The bill would require the administration to account for the money it is spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “We need to support our troops and ensure that they have the resources needed to do their job,” Rep. Thompson said. “This bill will make certain that Congress exercises its oversight responsibility and accounts for the $82 billion supplemental appropriation that the president has requested for Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress can't continue writing blank checks to the administration.” The War Funding Accountability Act would ensure that troops are receiving the supplies and equipment they need, require the administration to seek additional international support and require the administration to report to Congress on the progress being made in Iraq and Afghanistan. Thompson said the legislation would help reduce wasteful spending by the Pentagon and price gouging by contractors working on the reconstruction of Iraq. The costs of reconstruction could be greatly reduced if rebuilding contracts are given to the Iraqi people rather than international companies. In one instance U.S. contractors estimated it would cost $15 million to rebuild a cement factory, Iraqis were able to complete the project for only $80,000. The Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative Democratic members of Congress voted to endorse the measure and members of the group joined Thompson at today's press conference. They highlighted the fact that the administration failed to include the $82 billion request in the standard budget which was released last week. “This is not an emergency request, the President knew that we would need additional funding for Iraq but he didn't include it in his budget,” Thompson said. “This is a slap in the face to the American taxpayer.” # # #
01.26.2005	Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.) today introduced the National Computer Recycling Act, a bill that would direct the EPA to develop and implement a national electronic waste (e-waste) recycling program. “Over 3,000 tons of electronics are discarded everyday in our country,” Rep. Thompson said. “Obsolete computers are taking up space in closets, warehouses and landfills and each of these computers contains dangerous materials such as lead and chromium which pose a significant risk to human health and the environment.” “Electronic waste is growing exponentially as more Americans are upgrading their computer equipment every few years,” Rep. Slaughter said. “But with federal regulators slow to implement a comprehensive e-waste reduction program, Congressional action is necessary to curb the rising tide of this toxic waste.” The average life span of a computer has shrunk from five years to two and approximately 50 million computers are discarded every year. Maine and California have already enacted their own e-waste laws. Without a national law, states are creating a patchwork of different laws from coast-to-coast making it difficult and expensive for manufactures and retailers to adhere to fifty different laws. The National Computer Recycling Act would: Â· Direct the EPA to develop a grant program to encourage municipalities, individuals and organizations to start e-waste recycling programs. Â· Require a comprehensive e-waste study to be conducted by the EPA which would make ongoing recommendations for addressing the problem. Â· Direct the EPA to asses a fee of up to $10 on new computers in order to fund the grant program and exempt manufactures and retailers that have existing recycling programs from the fee. The bill's sponsors hope to hold meetings and roundtables with all parties that have a stake in the e-waste debate. Rep. Thompson said, “We've done our best to draft a bill that considers the interests of all parties involved and we will continue to seek input as we move forward. However, the e-waste problem is growing worse each day and the time has come for Congress to act.” # # #
01.24.2005	Senators Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) reintroduced the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act in the Senate today. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) introduced the bill in the House earlier this month on the first day of the 109th Congress (January 4, 2005). “We drafted this bill in a bipartisan manner, it's supported by numerous individuals, businesses and organizations in the First District and throughout California,” Thompson said. “This bill will protect some of California's most treasured lands for generations to come.” Senator Boxer said, "This legislation will help preserve and protect more than 300,000 acres of California wilderness for future generations, including some of the most magnificent areas in our state. Last year, we were able to pass this bill in the Senate. I am hopeful that with the continuing hard work of my colleagues, Senator Feinstein and Congressman Thompson, we will be able to see this important legislation signed into law this year." "The King Range is one of our state's most striking and beautiful environmental jewels," Senator Feinstein said. "That's why I am so pleased to be a part of the effort to permanently preserve 300,000 acres along California's northern coast including the King Range. Our wildlands are vanishing. We need to preserve what's left. This bill takes an important step toward that goal. My great thanks go to Senator Boxer and Representative Thompson for their leadership on this issue. " The bill would designate over 300,000 acres of public land in Del Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Mendocino, and Napa Counties as wilderness. It would also designate the Black Butte River in Mendocino County as a wild and scenic river. However it will not close any existing roads, nor will it encompass any private lands or alter any grazing rights. The sponsors of the legislation worked with the Bush Administration, Senator Larry Craig (R-Idaho) and Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) to address any concerns with the legislation. The Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent on December 7, 2004. However, since the House ran out of time to pass the bill before the end of the 108th Congress both the House and the Senate will have to pass it in the 109th Congress. “I would like to thank Sen. Boxer and Sen. Feinstein for their work in moving this legislation through the Senate,” Thompson said. “I look forward to having a hearing on the bill before the House Resources Committee in the coming months.” # # #
01.05.2005	Congressman Mike Thompson (D-North Coast) has secured a seat on the powerful Ways and Means Committee. Thompson was appointed to the post this morning by a vote of his legislative peers at the nation's Capitol. The Committee on Ways Means ranks as one of the oldest and most prestigious standing committees in the House of Representatives. It has long been recognized as the most powerful committee on Capitol Hill and carries jurisdiction over all major legislative matters including Social Security, Medicare, health care financing, international trade and tax reform. Established in 1789, its members have included 8 future U.S. Presidents, 4 future Supreme Court Justices, 34 Cabinet members and 21 future Speakers of the House of Representatives. Thompson called it an honor to be selected to the post after serving only 3 terms in Congress. “I am honored to serve on such a prestigious and powerful committee that will be in the middle of many of today's most heated and consequential policy decisions. My top priorities include ensuring that Social Security and Medicare are not jeopardized by irresponsible stock market schemes, improving the accessibility of quality health care in rural areas and assisting American small businesses through common sense tax and trade policies.” "I'm proud to name Mike Thompson to the Ways and Means Committee," House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said. "Californians -- such as our dear friend Bob Matsui -- have a long and distinguished history on the Ways and Means Committee. Mike has the talent and experience to successfully build on this impressive legacy. He will be a vital voice on the Committee for pay as you go spending and fiscal responsibility." # # #
01.02.2005	Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) represents a district contiguous to Rep. Robert Matsui's district in Northern California and considered Bob his best friend in Congress. The following is a statement from Mike regarding Bob's passing last night: “Bob was not only a great leader, he was my best friend in Congress. He was a thoughtful and compassionate mentor who championed the causes of the less fortunate by consistently being the most skilled and informed person in the room. He won monumental legislative victories not by being the loudest but by being the smartest. His leadership and friendship will be painfully missed throughout his district, state and our nation.”
10.06.2004	The House of Representatives approved legislation yesterday (H.R. 4569) that would direct the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a national plan to control and manage Sudden Oak Death. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) worked with House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas (R-CA) and Rep. Max Burns (R-GA) to introduce the legislation. “Sudden Oak Death is not unique to California, it is prevalent in many regions of the country,” Thompson said. “Developing a national plan to combat the disease will help protect many oak species and prevent costly environmental problems such as erosion and forest fires.” The legislation calls on the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a national plan for the control and management of Sudden Oak Death. In developing the plan, the Secretary will be asked to compile information to identify hosts of the pathogen “Phytophthora ramorum,” to survey the extent of Sudden Oak death in the United States, to look at past and current efforts to understand the risk posed by the pathogen, and to include cost estimates for the implementation of efforts to control the disease. Sudden Oak Death has killed large numbers of tanoaks, coast live oaks and black oaks in California's coastal counties. Since its discovery in Mill Valley in 1995, the disease has spread from twelve coastal counties in California to southern Oregon and has infected other plants, including rhododendron and huckleberry. Rep. Thompson has secured $10.7 million to fight Sudden Oak Death and will continue to work with his Congressional colleagues to fight the spread of this disease. In the upcoming fiscal year, there is $13.6 million pending U.S. Senate approval. # # #
10.05.2004	Announcing that he will vote against the bill, Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Napa Valley) called today's surprise vote on reinstating the military draft a shameless political maneuver unfitting of our troops' service. Thompson, a combat veteran and former member of the House Armed Services Committee, charged the Republican House Leadership with abusing House rules for their own political gain. By using a parliamentary maneuver usually reserved for noncontroversial legislation, the Republican leadership skirted the committee process and brought the legislation directly to the House floor without holding hearings or taking expert testimony in the Armed Services Committee. The bill is slated for a vote this afternoon under the rules of the Suspension Calendar which limits debate to 40 minutes and requires a two-thirds vote to pass. Thompson charged that bringing this legislation to the House floor without holding hearings or truly debating the issue of military manpower is a disservice not only to national policy but also to our troops. “The House Leadership seems to believe that any rumors of a potential military draft will be put to rest by defeating this bill. Unfortunately they are wrong,” Thompson said. “American families are concerned about a draft because our troops are bearing the excessive burdens of the war in Iraq. Talk of a draft will continue until the situation in Iraq stabilizes and we bring our troops home.” The Administration has not addressed many of the concerns that are raised by the bill such as the military's manpower needs, recruitment and retention and the overextension of our troops. # # #
09.09.2004	Congress today approved a key appropriations bill that moves toward correcting low Medicare reimbursement rates for physicians in Sonoma County. Under language requested by Sonoma County Representatives Mike Thompson and Lynn Woolsey, the federal Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services must present a plan to Congress by January 1 for fixing a decades old discrepancy in the reimbursement rates paid to doctors in Sonoma and three other California counties. “Remedying this problem is one of the most important steps we can take to improve health care in Sonoma County,” Thompson said. “Physicians are being reimbursed at levels well below what they need to practice medicine in Sonoma. This legislation will begin the process of correcting the problem.” Private insurers and health plans peg their rates to what Medicare is paying so this should raise the bar across the board. Physicians have long pointed to the low reimbursement rate in comparison to the high cost of practicing medicine in Sonoma County as one of the chief reasons for doctors leaving the area and for the failure of several medical groups. “It's about time the Federal Government committed to Sonoma County's health care reimbursement inequities,” said Rep. Woolsey. “In helping Sonoma County, we have also helped other California areas.” The language in the Labor/Health and Human Services spending bill codifies an understanding reached by the former CMS Administrator Tom Scully at a meeting with Sonoma County physicians arranged by Thompson and Woolsey last year. Scully acknowledged that local physicians should be receiving higher pay for their services but that a remedy may take years to accomplish. “Hopefully we've moved that timeframe forward a bit,” Thompson said. “The Sonoma County health care community has done an excellent job in making the case that the unfairness of Medicare reimbursements must be resolved,” said Rep. Woolsey. The Senate has not yet considered its version of the bill. # # #
07.17.2004	The House of Representatives last week approved $400,000 in Forest Legacy funding for Ridgewood Ranch, the onetime home of Seabiscuit. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-North Coast) requested the funding as part of the fiscal year 2005 Interior Appropriations Bill. Last month the National Trust for Historic Preservation named Ridgewood Ranch one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places. Seabiscuit, the racehorse who inspired Americans during the Great Depression, arrived at Ridgewood in 1939 and recuperated from injuries on the ranch before his heroic win at Santa Anita. “The Ridgewood Ranch is a treasure for Mendocino County. It combines pristine forests and farmlands with celebrated historic sites,” Thompson said. “These funds will be critical in the overall effort to conserve its open spaces and preserve its historic sites.” The funds will be used to purchase a Conservation Easement to permanently conserve the ranch's productive forestlands and portions of its wildlife habitat and watersheds. The ranch spans 5,000 acres of land including 2,250 acres of oak woodlands, 2,000 acres of rangeland and 5 miles of steelhead creeks. The House of Representatives passed the bill late last week. The House and Senate will need to reconcile the bill before the final version is sent to the President for approval. ###
