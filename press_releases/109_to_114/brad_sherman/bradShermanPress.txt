01.16.2019	Washington, D.C. – Today, on the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is reminding residents of the San Fernando Valley and metropolitan Los Angeles about how they can prepare for a future seismic event. Twenty-five years ago, dozens of lives were lost, and thousands were injured by one of the largest earthquakes in our nation’s history. The Northridge Earthquake was also one of the costliest federal disasters, with damages in excess of $20 billion. “The images of the collapsed apartments, freeways, bridges and buildings should remind us to prepare ourselves and our families for when Los Angeles is struck again by a major earthquake,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is imperative that we take the steps necessary to protect ourselves and our families should another major disaster occur, whether it is an earthquake, a fire, or another natural disaster.” In an effort to prepare the Valley and the metropolitan Los Angeles area, Congressman Sherman has been a leader in ensuring that annual funding is made available for the West Coast Earthquake Early Warning System. “With advanced notice, people can take cover, trains can slow down, and doctors can pause surgeries – it can save lives and reduce the economic impact of an earthquake,” said Congressman Sherman. Sherman is also reminding the area how they can prepare for a future seismic event. Sherman encourages all residents to prepare themselves by taking the following steps before, during, and after an earthquake: Before an earthquake: (1) Check for hazards in the home, (2) identify safe places indoors and outdoors, (3) educate yourself and family members, (4) have disaster supplies on hand, (5) develop an emergency communication plan, and (6) help your community get ready by talking to your neighbors or participating in your neighborhood council. During an earthquake: Take cover indoors in a safe place such as under a sturdy table or within a doorway. If outdoors, stay in a safe open area away from buildings, streetlights and utility wires. After an earthquake: Expect aftershocks, listen to a battery-operated radio or television for emergency information, use the telephone for emergency calls only, stay away from damaged areas, inspect your home for damage, and inspect gas lines and electrical systems, as well as sewage and water lines.

Congressman Brad Sherman represents the west and south San Fernando Valley, including the community of Northridge.
12.21.2018	Washington, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Energy has released its Final Environmental Impact Statement for cleanup of its portion of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory (SSFL) site, located in Ventura County, California. The report recommends a lesser soil cleanup standard than established in the 2010 Administrative Order on Consent (AOC) that was entered into with the State of California. In response, Congressman Brad Sherman said, “The AOC is a binding agreement between the federal government and the state of CA. Under the AOC, those who live near the Santa Susana Field Laboratory are entitled to a full cleanup of the contaminated site. It is unacceptable that the U.S. Department of Energy would propose anything less and walk away from previously agreed upon standards. The California Department of Toxic Substances Control should require the full cleanup called for in the AOC.” Today’s statement from Congressman Sherman echoes his prior statement. On April 12, 2017, Congressman Sherman commented in writing on the U.S. Department of Energy’s Draft Environmental Impact Statement, “The U.S. Department of Energy should not consider alternatives that do not provide for a complete cleanup of the facility.”
12.21.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the Asia Subcommittee, and Congressman Ted Yoho (R-FL), the Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee introduced the Uighur Intervention and Global Humanitarian Unified Response (UIGHUR) Act. The legislation is cosponsored by Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA), Congresswoman Ann Wagner (R-MO), and Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA). Currently, in the Chinese region of Xinjiang, as many as one million Uighurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities are being detained in so-called “political re-education” camps. Meanwhile, Uighurs living outside of China are being harassed and silenced – including here in the United States. The bipartisan legislation will prevent advanced technologies from being exported to China to facilitate human rights violations in Xinjiang, ensure the federal government does not procure from companies that help Beijing unjustly detain Turkic Muslims, and create new mechanisms for reporting Chinese government surveillance in the United States. “Beijing thinks we will turn a blind eye as it targets Turkic Muslims around the world. We must prove them wrong,” said Congressman Sherman. “By preventing companies from profiting off of human rights violations and mandating increased transparency, this legislation will send more than a powerful message. It will also create meaningful tools for the United States to hold China accountable.” “I am happy to introduce this important legislation with Ranking Member Sherman. Cutting-edge technologies should be used to lift up, not oppress humanity. The existence of mass detention centers -renamed ‘political re-education’ camps - in China, is unacceptable. We must hold the perpetrators of these gross human rights violations accountable.” said Congressman Yoho. Among other provisions, the bill also calls for Global Magnitsky sanctions on those who orchestrate “political re-education” camps, establishes new human rights disclosure requirements for sensitive exports to China, and instructs American diplomats to protest the deportation of Turkic Muslims to China and increase their outreach to the Uighur community.
12.19.2018	Senators Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-30), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Luke Messer (IN-06) today introduced legislation that increases Congressional oversight over any civil nuclear cooperation agreement – or 123 agreement – between the United States and Saudi Arabia. Since 2017, there have been reports of negotiations between the Trump administration and Saudi Arabia on a potential 123 agreement, with Energy Secretary Rick Perry recently returning from the region after meeting with leaders about a potential deal. Specifically, the No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act would require Congress to affirmatively approve any 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia. Typically, 123 agreements—which authorize U.S. companies to sell nuclear technology abroad—go into effect unless veto-proof majorities of Congress pass joint resolutions of disapproval. The legislation also makes clear that Congress believes that no 123 agreement with Saudi Arabia should be approved unless and until the Kingdom is truthful and transparent about the death of U.S. journalist Jamal Khashoggi, unless it commits to forego any uranium enrichment or spent fuel reprocessing activities – the so-called “gold standard – within its territory, and until it agrees to implement the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA) Additional Protocol. The legislation also urges Saudi Arabia to make substantial progress on protecting human rights, including through the release of political prisoners. “Saudi Arabia’s recent turn toward authoritarianism is evident in its flagrant and growing disregard for international laws and fundamental human rights, and it must be held to account,” said Senator Markey. “Crown Prince Mohamad bin Salman has made it perfectly clear that he is more interested in harnessing nuclear energy in Saudi Arabia for geopolitical power than for electrical power and has even publicly declared his willingness to pursue nuclear weapons at his discretion. These disturbing facts make it crucial that the United States does not compromise on nonproliferation standards in any 123 agreement it negotiates with Saudi Arabia. This legislation would ensure that we put key checks in place to ensure that Saudi Arabia never ends up with the U.S. technology or materials to make a nuclear bomb and that Congress is the final say before approval of any agreement. I thank Senator Rubio and Congressman Sherman for their partnership on this important legislation that will help stop a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.” “The United States should suspend all talks related to a civil nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia until the Saudi government agrees to the ‘Gold Standard’ requirements and proves they are willing to be responsible partners that respect the basic rights of their citizens,” said Senator Rubio. “This important bill will ensure Congress has oversight over and the right to affirmatively approve any nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia and also continues to press the Saudis for accountability in Jamal Khashoggi’s murder.” “A government that cannot be trusted with a bone saw, should not be trusted with a nuclear weapon,” said Rep. Sherman. “Saudi Arabia’s plan to build a nuclear plant makes no economic sense as a means of generating electricity but makes perfect sense if the goal is to provide a pretext for a nuclear weapons program. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, has indicated that he believes Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon and that Saudi Arabia should keep pace. This outcome that would severely threaten the security of the United States and close allies like Israel. This bill empowers Congress to carry out its constitutional oversight role to prevent an agreement that only contains the ‘plastic’ or ‘fool’s gold’ standard.” “The constitution is quite clear: any international agreement that requires major undertakings on the part of the United States – such as any proposed Saudi nuclear deal – must be sent to Congress for advice and consent,” said Rep. Messer. “Frankly, it was wrong when the Obama Administration circumvented these requirements with the Iran nuclear deal, and it would be wrong to allow any deal with the Saudis without ensuring that Congress -- acting as the voice of American people -- has a say.” A copy of the No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act can be found HERE. The bipartisan group of lawmakers have long-expressed serious concerns with Saudi Arabia’s unwillingness to commit to the gold standard for civil nuclear cooperation agreements, raising concerns that the Kingdom’s commitment to use nuclear energy isn’t solely for peaceful purposes. A commitment to the gold standard is one way the United States ensures that nations with which we engage in civil nuclear cooperation are living up to the highest nuclear nonproliferation standards. In March 2018 Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman stated in an interview that his country would develop nuclear weapons “without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb.” Just a few months later, Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Minister Adel Al-Jubeir echoed these disturbing comments.
12.10.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Census Bureau issued a San Fernando Valley Report at the request of Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). The more than 1.86 million people who live in the Valley exceed the populations of all but the four largest cities in the United States—New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston. According to the latest census data, the Valley's population has increased 106,000 (6%) since 2010. The Valley Census Report shows that Valley residents spend, on average, over a half-hour commuting to work, which is nearly 19% longer than the average American. “I will use this to argue that we need more transportation infrastructure in the San Fernando Valley,” Sherman said. “We need a subway through the Sepulveda Pass.” The typical Valley family income is $64,059, 11% higher than the country as a whole. However, nearly 2/5 of Valley homeowners spend over 35% of their income on housing, while nationwide just over 1/5 of American homeowners spend that much. And over half of Valley renters spend over 35% of their income on housing. While the Valley has a higher percentage of college graduates than America as a whole (34% to 31%), it also has more people without a high school diploma (19% for Valley, 13% for U.S.). This correlates with the Valley having a higher median income than America (by 11%) but also a somewhat higher percentage of families living in poverty (11.5% vs 10.5%). The Valley Census Report offers an annual demographic snapshot of the San Fernando Valley to help community organizations, businesses, and government leaders make better-informed decisions affecting the Valley's future and help our region compete for its fair share of funding for transportation improvements, housing, and social service programs. The boundaries used for the San Fernando Valley by the Census Bureau stretch from Calabasas to Glendale. See map below. Census County Division Boundaries according to the U.S. Census Bureau
12.03.2018	Washington, D.C. – In the aftermath of the shocking murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) unveiled the No Nuclear Weapon for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018. This legislation ensures the Trump Administration can’t negotiate a bad deal that would allow the Saudi government to build a nuclear bomb. The Trump administration is currently negotiating a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia that, under current law, would go into effect unless Congress can muster veto-proof majorities in both houses. The No Nuclear Weapon for Saudi Arabia Act of 2018 would require Congressional approval of any nuclear cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia. After the deal is negotiated, Congress could determine if it contains adequate safeguards to prevent the Saudis from using a “peaceful nuclear energy program” to build a nuclear weapon. “A government that cannot be trusted with a bone saw, should not be trusted with a nuclear weapon,” Congressman Sherman said. “Unfortunately, the Trump administration has refused to rule out signing an agreement that would allow the Saudi government to acquire and deploy the technologies necessary to build nuclear weapons.” The legislation also requires that when the Trump Administration submits a Saudi nuclear agreement, it also submit these reports on: the extent to which Saudi Arabia has agreed to the “Gold Standard” of nuclear safeguards; the extent to which Saudi Arabia has been transparent and truthful in its investigation into the death of Jamal Khashoggi; and whether Saudi Arabia has improved its human rights record, including by releasing political prisoners. Saudi Arabia’s plan to build a nuclear plant makes no economic sense as a means of generating electricity but makes perfect sense if the goal is to provide a pretext for a nuclear weapons program. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, has indicated that he believes Iran is seeking a nuclear weapon and that Saudi Arabia should keep pace. “The Obama administration negotiated a ‘gold-standard’ deal with Saudi Arabia’s neighbor, the United Arab Emirates, which prohibits enrichment and reprocessing,” Congressman Sherman said. “If President Trump is the dealmaker he claims to be, he should be able to negotiate a deal with Saudi Arabia that contains equally strict nuclear safeguards.” Click here to view Congressman Sherman’s letter to colleagues regarding the legislation.

11.27.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) announced that the maximum conforming loan limits for mortgages acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for 2019 will increase. “Loans eligible to be purchased by Fannie and Freddie generally have lower interest rates and are easier to qualify for than non-quality so-called ‘jumbo’ loans,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). In high-cost areas, including Los Angeles County, the conforming loan limits for one-unit properties will be $726,525 – this is an increase from $679,650 in 2018. In most of the country, which are not classified as high-cost, the 2019 maximum loan limit for one-unit properties will be $484,350 – an increase from $453,100. “Valley homes are far more expensive than the national average. That’s why its so important for Valley homebuyers to get federally assisted mortgages of up to $726,525,” said Sherman. “In Omaha, $726,525 buys a mansion – but in the Valley it buys, at best, a middle-class home.” Sherman continued, “In Congress, I have continued my work to support home values, which forms a critical component of our economy in the San Fernando Valley,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). “Higher FHFA conforming loan limits are crucial to supporting housing prices and overall economic recovery.” Sherman is well-situated to address such concerns, serving as a senior member of the House Committee on Financial Services. The committee has jurisdiction over housing policy, mortgage finance, real estate sales transactions, and other real estate issues.

11.20.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-30), today released the following statement supporting Leader Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House: “As I told the Los Angeles Times last summer, ‘you don’t fire the coach after you win the World Series.’ On Election Day, and under the leadership of Nancy Pelosi, House Democrats won a historic victory, with the largest increase in Democratic seats in three decades. “Leader Pelosi has a proven track record as a skilled and effective legislator, negotiator, and leader in advancing Democratic priorities. That makes her the best person to lead the Democratic Caucus moving forward. “But it is not merely about what she has accomplished, it is about what she will do. As we welcome the most diverse class of incoming Congressmen and women, Leader Pelosi is poised to battle with a Republican White House and Senate to deliver a legislative agenda for the American people. “It’s not news that I believe Leader Pelosi is the most qualified person, at the most important time, for the most important job. She has my full support for Speaker of the House.”

11.08.2018	Sherman Oaks, CA – Saturday, November 10th marks the 40th anniversary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Over the years, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) has secured over millions to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. Today, Congressman Sherman, a frequent recipient of the National Park Conservation Association’s Friend of the National Parks Award, is pushing for the expansion of the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor. “The Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area has been of tremendous benefit to Valley residents who can enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities in this pristine environment,” said Congressman Sherman. “It’s important that we preserve the natural environment for future generations. That is why I support expanding the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor.” Sherman continued, “We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to protect the natural, cultural and historical resources of this diverse area, as well as expand recreational and educational opportunities for millions of park users throughout Southern California. There are so many valuable resources within the study area that are suitable additions to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, including the significant wildlife corridor linkage through the Simi Hills, the Chatsworth Reservoir, the Santa Susana Mountains range, and Griffith Park.” The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park providing a variety of outdoor activities for over 33 million annual visitors. Congressman Sherman has long been an advocate for preserving sensitive habitats and recreational trails in this treasured national park. Additionally, these lands are immediately accessible to millions of urban residents in Greater Los Angeles, most of whom have never visited a national park.
11.06.2018	Sherman Oaks, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) met with officials from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to discuss proposed aviation procedures that will have a direct impact on communities in the San Fernando Valley. Sherman met with Clark Desing, Director of the Western Service Center and Beth White in advance of this week’s two public workshops that will focus on changes to existing departure procedures from Hollywood Burbank Airport. “We began to explore why all take-offs from Burbank Airport take-off southwest. Some planes might perhaps take-off to the south, southeast, or east,” said Sherman. Sherman will attend tomorrow’s workshop scheduled for 5 p.m. at Pickwick Gardens – Rose Garden Room, 1001 Riverside Drive in Burbank, CA. In August of this year, Congressman Sherman wrote to the FAA formally requesting that the agency fully engages with impacted communities in the San Fernando Valley to address concerns over aviation noise. Congressman Sherman has long advocated for reducing aviation noise and improving air quality in the San Fernando Valley, including phasing out noisier aircraft and establishing mandatory flight curfews. The two workshops will be held from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, November 7 and Thursday, November 8, 2018, at Pickwick Gardens – Rose Garden Room, 1001 Riverside Drive in Burbank, CA. The FAA will take public comments through November 18, 2018. Information about the project, including how to comment, will be available on the FAA’s Burbank Community Involvement website at https:///www.faa.gov/nextgen/nextgen_near_you/community_involvement/bur
10.23.2018	Sherman Oaks, CA – On the third anniversary of the Aliso Canyon gas leak, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) continues to condemn the decision of the Trump Administration to rescind natural gas storage safety regulations. In August 2018, Sherman sent a letter to Howard Elliott, Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), demanding that federal standards be restored and enforced. Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch, met face-to-face with then-President Barack Obama in 2015 and received a commitment that federal natural gas storage safety regulations would be issued. That commitment was honored. In December 2016, the relevant federal agency, PHMSA, for the first time issued regulations on Aliso Canyon and similar facilities nationwide. In June 2017, the Trump administration bowed to the demands of the oil and gas industry and withdrew those regulations. Sherman sent a letter to Administrator Elliott urging him to make the rules stronger, rather than failing to implement them. “Having lived near the largest methane leak in history, I know that people who live near Aliso Canyon, and hundreds of similar facilities nationwide, need the protection of the safety regulations that the Trump Administration withdrew,” said Sherman.

Background: Sherman’s home was as close as any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year, and thousands experienced health symptoms.
10.03.2018	Washington, D.C. – On the 10th anniversary of the Wall Street bailout, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) announced their plan to reintroduce the Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act, in the House and Senate respectively. Under the legislation, any institution that is too big to fail will be broken up and reorganized to avoid more government bailouts and future risk to the economy. Sherman introduced preliminary legislation in the House last week. Sanders will introduce more sophisticated legislation in the Senate this week. Sherman will introduce supplemental legislation in the House when it is back in session. This is the fourth time Congressman Sherman has introduced similar legislation in the House, and the fourth time Senator Sanders has introduced such legislation in the Senate. The only thing that has changed is the biggest banks have gotten even bigger – 52% bigger than 2008. “Today is especially important, as it marks the 10-year anniversary of the $700 billion Wall Street bailout becoming law. This reminds us that too big to fail should be too big to exist,” said Congressman Sherman who has advocated this position since 2009 and opposed the bailout. “Never again should a financial institution be able to demand a federal bailout. Today they can still claim: ‘if we go down, the economy is going down with us.’ By breaking up these institutions long before they face a crisis, we ensure a healthy financial system where medium-sized institutions can compete in the free market.” Sherman continued, “Every financial institution should compete for funds based on the soundness of its balance sheet, and no financial institution should be able to claim that there is a special federal safety net available to its investors because of the institution’s sheer size.” “If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,” Sanders said. “This is true not just because of the risk to our economy of another collapse and another bailout. It is also true because the current extreme concentration of ownership in the financial industry allows a very small number of huge financial institutions to have far too much economic and political power over this country.” “Too Big to Fail” refers to any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance.

09.26.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, the House of Representatives passed a major piece of legislation that will reform aspects of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). “Here in the San Fernando Valley, residents are concerned about the concentration of flights over our neighborhoods, homes, schools, and public spaces. This bill will require the FAA to consider diverging flight paths and adjusting departure procedure to address community concerns over noise,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). The bill also imposes new requirements for the FAA to follow regarding flight altitude over noise sensitive areas. The FAA will also be required to examine new ways to reduce noise exposure and designate a special regional ombudsman to address the public’s concerns about aviation noise. “This bill is a step in the right direction, and I hope that it will be signed into law soon. Last month, I specifically requested that the head of the FAA travel to the San Fernando Valley to address our local concerns about aviation noise,” Sherman said. Sherman continued, “Much more needs to be done, and I will continue to fight for quieter skies over the San Fernando Valley.” The FAA has agreed to hold public workshops in late October or early November, which will be an opportunity for the agency to explain how it will address the noise concerns of San Fernando Valley residents. In August, Congressman Sherman sent a letter to the FAA requesting that they demonstrate why this change is necessary, complete the strongest possible environmental review, and allow for a public comment period before deciding on any changes.
09.05.2018	Washington, D.C. – In a precedent-setting move, the U.S. Department of Education has employed the U.S. State Department’s definition of anti-Semitism to enforce Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This is a milestone in an eight-year effort to protect Jewish college students from anti-Semitism masquerading as legitimate criticism of the Israeli government. The effort began in 2010, when Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), working with Jewish community groups, convinced President Obama’s Department of Education that Title VI applied to Jewish students. Title VI protects against discrimination based on “race or national origin,” and a previous Bush Administration policy had excluded Jews as “merely a religion.” Anti-Semites have often claimed that their actions are merely fair criticisms of Israel. For eight years, Congressman Sherman pushed for a definition of anti-Semitism that would include calling for the abolition of the Jewish State. “You cannot protect Jewish students from anti-Semitism unless you define anti-Semitism,” Sherman said. While the Department of Education has for eight years refused to define anti-Semitism, the Department now has instructed its field offices to employ the State Department definition of anti-Semitism which includes: “Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.” The current State Department definition was developed by a 31-nation organization known as the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance). The full text is available here. “I look forward to vigorous enforcement of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act against those who harass Jewish students with claims that the only nation-state that should be obliterated is the nation-state of the Jews,” Sherman said. Sherman continued, “I applaud the Department of Education for using the same definition of anti-Semitism as the State Department. After all, if our diplomats are using a definition to criticize a foreign government, our own government should live by that definition.” Background: To view Congressman Sherman’s letter to the Department of Education sent on April 30, 2008, click here.

08.24.2018	Yesterday, I sent a letter to Amb. Mull Ssebuija Katende of Uganda calling for the immediate release of MP Robert Kyagulanyi and his colleagues. One of the MPs, Francis Zaake, health is currently in critical condition. I also call on the government of Uganda to settle their political disagreements within the bounds of democracy and release those protesters that demonstrated for MP Kyagulanyi’s release.

08.22.2018	Sherman Oaks, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced opposition to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)’s proposed changes to flight routes out of Hollywood Burbank Airport that would increase noise over many schools and residential neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley. “I am opposed to any changes that will increase aviation noise over schools and residential neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley,” Sherman said. “We should be reducing the frequency and intensity of aviation noise on our community.” Sherman sent a letter to the FAA requesting that they demonstrate why this change is necessary, complete the strongest possible environmental review, and allow for a public comment period before deciding on any changes. “The FAA needs to hear from the Valley before they make it impossible for Valley residents to hear themselves think.” “The FAA has informed me that they may make changes without first informing the public, and listening to public input. That is outrageous. The FAA appears to be moving full steam ahead without regard for either the opposition coming from the management of Hollywood Burbank Airport, or the community.” “The Valley deserves a full environmental impact study comparing current flight routes to any other proposals under consideration, as well as a transparent public comment period allowing residents to express their concerns.” Sherman has also invited the Acting FAA Administrator to the San Fernando Valley to meet with Members of Congress and community leaders to see the impact on the community directly and identify ways to reduce aviation noise in the San Fernando Valley. Sherman has been a longtime advocate for additional measures to reduce aviation noise and improve air quality in the San Fernando Valley, including phasing out noisier aircraft and establishing mandatory flight curfews.
08.17.2018	Sherman Oaks, CA – Last week, SoCalGas and local officials reached a $119.5-million settlement in response to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. In contrast, the Trump Administration has failed to take any action to protect American’s health and safety by implementing federal standards for underground natural gas storage facilities. Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) sent a letter to Howard Elliott, Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), demanding that federal standards be restored and enforced. In 2015, Sherman met face-to-face with then-President Barack Obama and received a commitment that the federal government would issue natural gas storage safety regulations. That commitment was honored on December 19, 2016, when PHMSA released an Interim Final Rule (IFR) on underground natural gas storage safety standards. Sherman writes, “On June 22, 2016, the Obama administration reaffirmed its commitment, and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act, which passed Congress unanimously, was signed into law. This legislation required PHMSA to establish minimum federal standards for underground natural gas storage facilities within two years.” Sherman continued, “…the two-year statutory deadline to establish standards in the PIPES Act has passed. It’s outrageous that almost three years since the largest methane leak from any natural gas storage facility in the United States, that these facilities have no federal standards. This lack of action is unacceptable.” In June 2017, the Trump administration bowed to the demands of the oil and gas industry and withdrew those regulations. Sherman sent a letter to Administrator Elliott, following PHMSA’s decision to grant a request by representatives of the natural gas industry to reconsider the rules and substantially delay their implementation. Click here for details of Sherman’s proposed safety improvements regulations. Click here to see Sherman’s demand for a comprehensive health study. Background: Sherman’s home was as close as any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year, and thousands experienced health symptoms.
08.10.2018	I am writing to update you on my efforts in Congress to protect civil liberties. I am proud to have earned an average lifetime score of 93% from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) for my voting record in Congress. I have also received a 100% score from Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for Women (NOW), and the Human Rights Campaign, as well as an “A” grade from the NAACP for my voting record in Congress. Keeping Families Together We need to immediately end the inhumane practice of separating children from their families at the border. In order to learn about what is happening firsthand, I visited the Youth for Tomorrow facility in Bristow, Virginia. I had the opportunity to speak with some of the children being held there. These children have faced unimaginable horrors coming to the United States, and the trauma of that journey is only perpetuated the longer they are separated from their families. Children should not be institutionalized. The process of reuniting children with their families is hampered by a system that involves a string of entities including the Department of Health and Human Services, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, among others. That is why I joined my colleagues to introduce the Keep Families Together Act, which prohibits the Department of Homeland Security from separating children from their parents and restricts the prosecution of parents who are asylum seekers. Protecting Americans from Warrantless Spying The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) regulates the government’s conduct of intelligence surveillance programs and creates a structure of congressional oversight of the executive branch’s wiretap requests. The government is required to seek warrants before monitoring Americans’ communications. Last year, Congress aimed to reauthorize a specific portion of FISA, Section 702, which addresses the intelligence community’s ability to target the communications of non-US persons located outside the United States for foreign intelligence purposes. However, I was concerned that Section 702 would allow the data and communications of Americans communicating with these non-US persons to be collected without first obtaining warrants. Information collected under the law without a warrant can be used to prosecute and imprison people, even for crimes that have nothing to do with national security. Accordingly, I voted against Section 702 reauthorization because it did not adequately protect the privacy of Americans. I voted in favor of the Amash-Lofgren amendment instead, also known as the USA RIGHTS ACT. This amendment would have made FISA Section 702 comply with the Constitution by requiring the government to seek a warrant based on probable cause, avert funds from being used to search information collected for Americans, and prevent the government from mandating that companies, app developers, or any other entity weaken the encryption of their products or services. Although the USA RIGHTS amendment did not pass, this Act would have represented a significant step to protecting Americans’ privacy and security in this digital age. Supporting Net Neutrality We need Net Neutrality regulations to prevent Internet Service Providers (ISPs, like Verizon, Time Warner, and AT&T) from slowing down some websites, while speeding up rival websites. You should have equal access to whatever sites you want, and ISPs should not be demanding payment from some web sites while threatening to slow down their content. Such payments would just be passed along to consumers, and start-up websites that cannot afford the payment would be snuffed out before they can become popular. That’s why I have consistently voted for Net Neutrality. Unfortunately, last year the FCC voted to repeal the Obama Administration’s Open Internet Regulation and end Net Neutrality as we know it. In response, I joined my colleagues in introducing legislation that would stop the FCC’s rollback of Net Neutrality protections. I will continue to work to ensure that the internet remains a free and open marketplace that encourages innovation and supports competition. Without net neutrality, I fear telecom companies could censor political speech and crush online movements for racial, gender, and economic justice. Protecting Your Right to Vote In a democracy, the right to vote is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have. Many generations of Americans have marched, fought, and even died for the right to vote. In recent years, however, many people in our country have seen an unprecedented wave of voter suppression laws enacted with the goal of suppressing minority votes and to shift power away from the people to a specific elite class. Our democratic legitimacy will be determined by how we respond, as a country, to the growing assault on voting rights. That is why I helped introduce the Voter Empowerment Act which advances reforms to ensure that eligible voters can register and cast ballots without undue burden, regardless of race, age, economic class, or disability. It includes necessary protections to ensure that all ballots are counted. Protecting Religious Liberties I believe the Supreme Court’s recent decision to uphold the Administration’s Muslim ban will be remembered as a stain on our nation’s history. The fact that the ban is moving forward is a fly in the face of American values and the fundamental constitutional principle of religious equality. This ban tears at the heart of Muslim communities in the United States by separating Muslims in the United States from their family members abroad and taking away the ability of U.S. citizens and green card holders to live with or be visited by family members. Additionally, it will exclude friends and family from milestones such as weddings, graduations, and funerals, deny final visits to ailing relatives, and bar talented, promising young people from U.S. universities and companies. It is precisely due to these reasons that I joined my colleagues in introducing the Statue of Liberty Values Act, which would block implementation of the President’s Muslim ban and send the message that the United States rejects banning immigrants and refugees on the basis of religion or nationality.
08.09.2018	Sherman Oaks - On Tuesday evening, over 6,000 Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the San Fernando Valley called in and participated in a conversation with Congressman Sherman for over ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed the questions and concerns of constituents about plastic guns, climate change, the Supreme Court, electoral reforms, and other issues. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to constituents,” said Rep. Sherman. “Telephone Town Halls allow me to easily interact with thousands of Valley residents. Own Halls are a good way for me to know what’s on the minds of Valley residents. I’ve hosted well over 200 Town Halls of various types. I particularly like Telephone Town Halls because constituents can participate without leaving their homes, so we typically get many thousands of participants.” Rep. Sherman was joined by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, who discussed the work he is doing in Sacramento and provided information on his constituent services program. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman requested input from his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: On August 2, the Trump Administration announced a plan to unravel fuel economy standards for new cars and light trucks and block California’s ability to set its own targets for emission standards. Do you support or oppose this decision? ​​​Support: 10% Oppose: 84% Unsure: 7% Not asked in February 2018 Telephone Town Hall Do you think templates to print plastic guns with a 3-D printer should be freely available online? ​​Yes: 6% No: 89% Unsure: 5%​ Not asked in February 2018 Telephone Town Hall Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President? ​​​Approve: 13% Disapprove: 84% Unsure: 3% February 2018 Results Approve: 17% Disapprove: 80% Unsure: 4% Do you support DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which provides legal status to those who were brought in the U.S. as children from being deported? ​​​Yes: 77% No: 14% Unsure: 9% February 2018Results Yes: 78% No: 11% Unsure: 11% Do you support the legislative agenda of Planned Parenthood? ​​Yes: 69% No: 19% No Opinion: 12%​ February 2018 Results Yes: 78% No: 11% Unsure: 11% Do you support the legislative agenda of the Sierra Club? ​​​Yes: 67% No: 13% No Opinion: 21% February 2018 Results Yes: 56% No: 9% Unsure: 35% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct constituents to his district office for assistance in solving personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail.
08.08.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the following statement in response to the $119.5 million settlement reached between SoCalGas and local officials in lawsuits over the biggest methane leak in U.S. history: “Natural gas should be stored in smaller and safer locations so any one of them can be shut down when needed. No major metropolitan area should be reliant on one storage facility. Throughout the crisis, we were told that Aliso Canyon cannot be shut down even temporarily because it’s the only significant facility for all of metro Los Angeles. Yet SoCalGas has done nothing to create alternative facilities. “What’s missing from this settlement is that we cannot continue to have a natural gas storage facility that is too big to fail. “We must reduce the pressure under the ground of Aliso Canyon, and we must reduce the pressure to use only Aliso Canyon.” For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year. Sherman lives about as close as anyone to the site of the world’s largest methane leak.
07.25.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee, released reports highlighting the problem of enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The reports confirm that enforced disappearances continue to be a significant issue in the region. Since 2009, anywhere from 1,250 to more than 18,000 enforced disappearances have occurred in Pakistan according to the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurist (ICJ). During a similar time frame, an estimated 430 individuals were forcibly disappeared in Bangladesh, and according to international organizations, human rights violations by government security forces have intensified. In Sri Lanka, there are at least tens of thousands of outstanding cases of disappearances dating from the country’s past internal conflict, and according to the international human rights community, there has been insufficient progress on addressing these past abuses and accounting for the victims. “The international community must do more to put a stop to these crimes, demand justice, and provide closure to the countless families who still cannot account for their loved ones,” said Sherman. Sherman has strongly advocated for a stronger response to human rights abuses in the region, and he has raised the issue with the State Department, speaking out on the House Floor, and through hearings of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

07.25.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee, released a report highlighting the problem of enforced disappearances in Pakistan. The report revealed that the Geneva-based International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) estimates that anywhere from 1,250 to more than 18,000 enforced disappearances have occurred in Pakistan since 2009. Sherman has been a strong advocate for the Sindh region of Pakistan, which has seen many enforced disappearances. “Pakistan’s government and its security and law enforcement agencies must accept responsibility for the hundreds of forcibly disappeared, killed, and tortured individuals in Sindh and take decisive action to put a stop to these crimes,” said Sherman. In August of last year, Sherman led a letter to the State Department on the issue. He also raised this issue on the floor of the House in October of last year, and the problem of enforced disappearances was discussed in a February hearing of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

07.16.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo regarding the Trump Administration’s efforts to prioritize the interests of the infant formula industry and its attempt to bully the government of Ecuador. Sherman writes, “On July 8, the New York Times reported that the American delegation to the World Health Assembly sought to block the introduction of a resolution promoting breastfeeding. The resolution’s intended sponsor, Ecuador, was threatened with “punishing trade measures” and the “withdraw[al of] crucial military aid.” It has also been reported that our Ambassador in Quito said the Administration might end military assistance in northern Ecuador if the resolution was introduced.” Sherman first highlighted the issue during a House Foreign Affair Committee hearing last week. Testifying at the hearing was the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs’ Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary who when asked if Ecuador would be “free to go forward,” he responded that “I am not here to guarantee that.” Sherman ended his letter to Secretary Pompeo with four direct questions concerning the Administration’s threats to the government of Ecuador, the bullying tactics imposed by the United States against other United Nations’ countries concerning the resolution, and the Administration’s efforts to promote breastfeeding as the World Health Assembly. You can find Rep. Sherman’s letter here and below: July 16, 2018 The Honorable Mike Pompeo Secretary U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Secretary Pompeo, When the United States engages in multilateral global health efforts, we should stand up for people, not profits. We should not be in the business of prioritizing the interests of the infant formula industry over the dissemination of scientific information regarding the benefits of breastfeeding. On July 8, the New York Times reported that the American delegation to the World Health Assembly sought to block the introduction of a resolution promoting breastfeeding. The resolution’s intended sponsor, Ecuador, was threatened with “punishing trade measures” and the “withdraw[al of] crucial military aid.” It has also been reported that our Ambassador in Quito said the Administration might end military assistance in northern Ecuador if the resolution was introduced. Only after Russia offered a revised resolution did the United States back down. However, the resolution that has been adopted is both weaker than the originally drafted version and previous resolutions on the same topic. At a recent House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing, I asked the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs’ Acting Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary to answer my simple questions about this incident. But when I asked if Ecuador would be “free to go forward,” he responded that “I am not here to guarantee that.” Although breastfeeding is not an option for all mothers, and I fully understand the value of infant formula as a solution, the science is clear: breastfeeding benefits both babies and their mothers. In fact, medical studies have concluded that children who are breastfed for longer periods have a lower risk of infection and mortality. Additionally, breastfeeding also benefits mothers by preventing breast cancer and increases the likelihood of sufficient intervals between pregnancies. Recognizing breastfeeding as an important contributor to infant and maternal health has been a longstanding policy for the United States. In a “Blueprint for Action on Breastfeeding,” David Satcher, who went on to serve as President George W. Bush’s Surgeon General, wrote “breastfeeding is one of the most important contributors to infant health. Breastfeeding provides a range of benefits for the infant’s growth, immunity, and development.” I am writing to ask for additional information about this incident and may be submitting corresponding FOIA requests. I would appreciate your prompt response to the following inquiries: Was Ecuador threatened over its potential introduction of the resolution by the State Department or any other U.S. government agency? Did Ambassador Chapman, or any other official, “suggest” or otherwise imply economic or military cooperation consequences if the resolution was introduced? After Ecuador opted to not introduce the resolution, did the United States pressure or encourage other countries to not introduce, or to revise the language of, any resolutions relating to breastfeeding? Was the State Department in contact with representatives of any infant formula company in advance of the World Health Assembly? Is the State Department aware of any Assembly-related contacts with such companies by any other U.S. government agencies or White House officials? If so, please describe the nature of these contacts. Will you commit to support efforts to promote breastfeeding at the World Health Assembly? Specifically, if an identical resolution to the one originally proposed by Ecuador is offered at next year’s Assembly, will the United States support it? Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN Member of Congress
07.12.2018	Washington, D.C.– Today marks the one-year anniversary of the filing of Articles of Impeachment by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA). Sherman, joined by Congressman Al Green (D-TX), introduced an Article of Impeachment (H. Res. 438) against President Donald J. Trump for High Crimes and Misdemeanors on July 12, 2017. Congressman Sherman released the following statement: “A year ago, today, I filed Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump, the first attempt to force the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on Obstruction of Justice and Russian interference in our election. Congressman Al Green (D-TX) cosponsored the Articles. “Democrats, Republicans, and the entire world are shocked by the latest example of America’s amateur President—ignorance accompanied by a refusal to learn, and a lack of impulse control, plus a refusal to have his staff control his impulses. We’re no longer surprised by any action, no matter how far below the dignity of the office—and no matter how dangerous to the country. “Over the last year, we have seen, and continue to see close advisors of Donald Trump be jailed, charged, and investigated. It has been confirmed that Donald Trump lied about his knowledge of the 2016 meeting where Trump’s son and advisors met with Russians in Trump Tower. Donald Trump has hinted at pardoning those who remain silent and fail to cooperate with the Special Counsel. “Meanwhile, the President is meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in a closed door, off the record conversation. “Lastly, as Donald Trump and his cohorts remain under investigation, he has nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who has supported exempting sitting presidents from criminal investigations. “The President must be held accountable under the law, through the impeachment process and the Special Counsel’s inquiry, for his actions and for this unprecedented level of corruption. I will continue my effort to force the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on Obstruction of Justice.” Click HERE to see the Article of Impeachment (H. Res. 438) filed by Congressman Brad Sherman. Click HERE to see Congressmen Brad Sherman’s op-ed published in the Huffington Post On October 5, 2017, entitled “The Case for Impeaching Donald J.

06.27.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement after his visit to the Youth for Tomorrow facility in Bristow, VA. The facility houses over 100 immigrant children including about 15 children that were separated from their families at the border: “I was pleased to join Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), Congressman Mike Thompson (D-CA), Congresswoman Doris Matsui (D-CA), and Congressman Jimmy Panetta (D-CA) during a briefing and tour of Youth for Tomorrow with facility staff, and staff from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). “I had the opportunity to speak with some of the children that are currently being held at the facility. These children have faced unimaginable horrors coming to the United States, and the trauma of that journey is only perpetuated the longer they are separated from their families. The Virginia facility is a fine institution—but children should not be institutionalized when they can instead be reunited with their parents. “The facility is currently housing 15 children that had been separated from their families at the border due to the Trump Administration’s “zero tolerance” policy. The facility is working diligently to identify the location of the parents of these children. Unfortunately, the process of reuniting children with their families is hampered by a system that involves a string of entities including HHS, Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), among others.” Congressman Sherman is Briefed by facility staff and staff from the Department of Health and Human Services at the Youth for Tomorrow facility in Bristow, VA.
06.27.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Sherman released this statement after the Supreme Court handed down a 5-4 decision in the case of Janus v. AFSCME Council 31: “In today’s decision in the case of Janus v. AFSCME Council 31, President Trump’s Supreme Court overturned decades of American jurisprudence regarding the right to organize and collectively bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. “The Court’s 5-4 opinion barred public sector unions from collecting fees to cover the costs of contract negotiations on behalf of all covered employees. “This is the latest effort to impose Right-to-Work-for-Less laws around the nation. Today’s Supreme Court decision was targeted at the public sector, but it strikes at the heart of Americans’ right to collectively bargain for better pay, safer working conditions, access to healthcare, and basic retirement benefits. “In states that have enacted similar laws, employees earn $8,402 less every year on average than other states. “The law should not force union members to pay for free riders, who receive the same benefits. “That is why I introduced the Protecting Workers and Improving Labor Standards Act, which I first introduced a decade ago. This legislation would specifically close the loophole that has allowed individual states to ban equal distribution for covering the costs of contract negotiations. “The right to representation in your place of employment is a fundamental right, it should not be restricted based on the sector or industry in which you happen to work.”​
06.12.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee, issued this statement after President Trump concluded a summit with Kim Jong-un in Singapore: “As could be expected, Trump and Kim signed a statement vague on details. In fact, it is almost devoid of details, such as timetables or concrete commitments, and the structure for future talks is not laid out with any specificity. Kim gets equal status at a meeting with the U.S. president, and we get vague platitudes about denuclearization. What has Kim really promised? Where’s the beef? “We have only an inkling of a process to move forward. And of course, Kim simply reaffirmed his commitment to “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” which is a phrase favored by the North Koreans that does not mean simply that North Korea will give up its nuclear program. “Meanwhile, Kim has scored a propaganda victory. Not only did he achieve something neither his father or grandfather could – a summit with the President – but he also was praised as “talented” and as someone who “loves his country” by Trump. All this while North Korea maintains labor camps and denies its people basic human rights. “The process going forward is simply this: Secretary Pompeo will meet with North Korean officials soon. If and when this happens, his first priority must be to codify a full freeze of North Korea’s program, especially including fissile material production – the production of bomb fuel – and the fabrication of additional weapons. “We will also need the North Koreans to provide us with a full declaration of their nuclear program – something they have promised in the past but have shirked. This needs to come at the beginning of the process, as without it, progress on actual denuclearization cannot be realistically achieved. “While Trump said the U.S. has committed to stop “provocative” military exercises – a major win for Kim, for which we gained nothing – he also said that sanctions will remain in place for now. Economic pressure remains our most important leverage. The Chinese have already begun talk of easing sanctions. This must be resisted until we have concrete achievements on the ground in North Korea. “The way forward will be tough, and serious roadblocks are almost certain to arise. Congress must be involved and committed to making this work. At the same time, we need to pressure the Administration not to give up too much, too soon. “This could have been a disaster, and it was not. We could have achieved much more, but we did not.”
05.23.2018	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), who worked with former U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer and others in securing federal funds for the new northbound lane on the 405, issued the following statement on the four-year anniversary of the opening of the new lane: “The success of this project is clearer than ever. With the growing population in Los Angeles and low unemployment, there are now more cars on the road than ever before. If we hadn’t built the lane, travel through the Sepulveda Pass would be far worse. A study from 2015 showed that without the new lane, motorists would spend 6,000 more hours each day creeping through the Sepulveda Pass.”[1] “The people of Los Angeles voted to increase the local sales tax to finance dozens of projects, most notably the Sepulveda Pass subway. This project can be built sooner with an infusion of federal dollars. If President Trump is truly committed to improving America’s infrastructure, I can think of no greater place to start than with the nation’s most congested roadway.” Background: Congressman Brad Sherman and his colleagues were instrumental in securing funding for these projects at both the state and federal level. In 1998, Congressman Sherman secured federal funds for planning improvements to the Sepulveda Pass bottleneck. In 2003, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congressman Brad Sherman worked together to secure $117 million in federal funding to construct an additional northbound lane on the 405. Congressman Sherman and then-Congressman Howard Berman both testified in support of the 405 project on April 1, 2003, before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. Sherman lobbied his colleagues intensely until the final funding bill passed in July 2005. Congressman Sherman then worked with several prominent advocates of the project, including Mayor Villaraigosa and Supervisor Gloria Molina (then-Chair of the Metro Board), to secure state funding. On February 20, 2007, Congressman Sherman traveled to Sacramento with Mayor Villaraigosa and other local officials in a successful effort to persuade the California Transportation Commission to provide $614 million—the largest piece of the project’s funding. Sherman was the only member of Congress to testify at this critical hearing of the California Transportation Commission. [1] I-405 Sepulveda Pass Improvements Project Evaluation, May 26, 2015
05.21.2018	WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), released the following statement regarding the ongoing human rights situation in the Sindh province of Pakistan: "I express my grave concerns about the human rights situation in the Sindh province of Pakistan, with special reference to enforced disappearances of persons at the hands of Pakistani security agencies. Many of the disappeared persons are from the Jeay Sindh Mahaz (JSM), Jeay Sindh Mutehada Mahaz (JSMM), and Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz (JSQM). The disappeared persons also include teachers, intellectuals, writers, and publishers. Six of my House colleagues joined me in sending a letter to the State Department on this issue in August 2017. I also raised this issue on the floor of the House in October 2017, and this problem of enforced disappearances was discussed in a February 2018 hearing of the Asia Subcommittee at the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "I strongly condemn an incident that occurred this past weekend, when Pakistan’s security forces assaulted the families of disappeared and missing persons who were on a hunger strike in protest of these disappearances. "The family members of the Sindhi victims of enforced disappearances (mainly their daughters and wives, as male members are being held by the security forces or have moved underground or remained silent as they fear the security agencies) and their friends have launched a peaceful nonviolent protest for their release. The daughters and wives of the disappeared persons were engaged in a 72-hour hunger strike in front of the Press Club at Karachi that began May 20. During this nonviolent protest, Pakistani security forces or their agents assaulted two daughters of the disappeared Hidyat Lohar (an elementary school headmaster who was taken away in April 2017 in front of school children) and two daughters of Khadim Arijo (a civil servant missing since April 2017). Security forces also reportedly detained about five of the nonviolent activists, though it seems they have been released. "It is crucial that Pakistan immediately cease these and other related human rights violations in the Sindh province. Pakistani security personnel and others involved in the enforced disappearances should be held accountable. I urge the U.S. State Department and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as well as our ambassador in Pakistan, to take up this issue with the civilian and military leadership of Pakistan. Our ambassador to Pakistan must receive guarantees from the Pakistani government regarding the protection of human rights defenders and of those who advocate for Sindh’s missing persons. It will be even more significant to set up a bipartisan fact-finding mission to probe enforced disappearances and related killings in Sindh."
05.09.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, multiple amendments offered by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to H.R. 5105, or the BUILD Act, passed the Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously. Congressman Sherman is a cosponsor of the BUILD Act, which will transfer the functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and policies of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) to the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and expand its authorities. Sherman’s first amendment would require the DFC to consider whether the parties involved in a project seeking support from the DFC participate in the Arab League’s anti-Israel boycott or any other boycott against a friendly government identified by the U.S. government. Another Sherman amendment to the BUILD Act would help ensure that the DFC avoids supporting projects where the beneficiaries are entities that conduct activities subject to sanctions. It would require an affirmative certification that the beneficiaries of DFC support, and any affiliated entities, do not conduct business that is subject to U.S. sanctions laws. “Boycott participation should be an important consideration for our foreign assistance programs,” Sherman said. “We should take appropriate steps that our foreign aid beneficiaries, and all of their affiliated companies, are not undermining our foreign policy goals—a certification requirement will be an important enforcement mechanism. Sherman is also a cosponsor and strong supporter of H.R. 5141, the U.S.-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act, which unanimously passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The Committee also unanimously passed the BUILD Act with Sherman’s amendments.
05.09.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has received a commitment from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) that its potential successor agency will not approve future projects that deliberately exclude Armenia. Earlier today, the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed H.R. 5105, or the BUILD Act. Congressman Sherman is a cosponsor of the BUILD Act, which will require the functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and policies of OPIC to transfer to the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and expand its authorities. A long-standing supporter of Armenia, Sherman quickly raised concerns about whether the OPIC policy of not supporting a project that excludes Armenia, will be carried over to the new agency if the bill is enacted. In a letter, Cameron S. Alford, the Deputy General Counsel of Projects for OPIC, committed to Sherman that the policy would carry over. Mr. Alford wrote, “OPIC will not support regional projects in the Caucasus that deliberately, by design or effect, exclude Armenia from participation or benefit, unless such exclusion is necessitated by geographic or economic impracticality…Accordingly, this will become the policy of the DFC.” In the past, Azerbaijan and Turkey have pushed pipeline and rail projects that skirted Armenia, a deliberate decision made no economic or geographic sense, given that a route through Armenia would have been a more direct route and or provided increased economic benefit.

05.09.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed H.R. 5105, or the BUILD Act. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a senior member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, is a cosponsor of the BUILD Act, which will require the functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and policies of OPIC to transfer to the U.S. Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and expand its authorities. Sherman secured an amendment that ensures that, in addition to people from business and finance backgrounds, those with international development, labor, and environmental experience can serve on the DFC board. The DFC has four non-governmental members, and some of those who serve should have experience in these fields. The Committee also passed Sherman's amendment to secure a requirement that the annual report of the DFC includes reporting on project compliance with existing labor, environmental, and social policies. Two other amendments offered by Congressman Sherman (D-CA) to the BUILD ACT passed the Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously. First, Sherman's submitted an amendment to the BUILD Act would help ensure that the DFC avoids supporting projects where the beneficiaries are entities that conduct activities subject to sanctions. The amendment would require an affirmative certification that the beneficiaries, and any affiliated entities, do not conduct business that is subject to U.S. sanctions laws. Sherman’s second amendment would require the DFC to consider whether the parties involved in a project seeking support from the DFC participate in the Arab League’s anti-Israel boycott or any other boycott against a friendly government identified by the U.S. government. While such participation would not be an absolute bar, it would be a factor for the agency to consider “Boycott participation should be an important consideration for our foreign assistance programs,” Sherman said. “We should also take appropriate steps to ensure that our foreign aid beneficiaries, and all of their affiliated companies, are not undermining our foreign policy goals—a certification requirement sanctions policy compliance will be an important enforcement mechanism. Sherman also raised concerns about whether the OPIC policy of not supporting a project that excludes Armenia, will be carried over to the new agency if the bill is enacted. In a letter, Cameron S. Alford, the Deputy General Counsel of Projects for OPIC, committed to Sherman that the policy would carry over. In the early 2000s, both OPIC and the U.S. Export-Import Bank supported a product known as the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline that deliberately avoided traversing or serving Armenia. OPIC agreed later in the decade that it would not support such exclusionary projects in the future.
05.01.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairwoman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Middle East and North Africa, sent a letter to President Donald Trump. The letter urges President Trump to enforce a critical sanctions statute against companies that sell to Iran technology it needs to censor dissidents, disrupt protesters, and restrict the free flow of information. In the wake of the 2009 protests against the Iranian government, Congressman Sherman helped lead the effort to enact Section 106 of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (CISADA). Under Section 106, firms that sell certain sensitive technologies to Iran are subject to face government procurement restrictions within the United States. However, to date, no firm has been sanctioned under this provision. Sherman, Ros-Lehtinen, and eight of their colleagues write; “We believe that the United States should take a strong stance against those firms that assist the Iranian government in its efforts to suppress information and target protesters. Enforcement of Section 106 should, therefore, be a high priority for the United States. We request that you review recent activity by the Iranian government to monitor participants in the protests and/or suppress the free flow of information in Iran, determine which firms provided the technology needed for such activity, and sanction them.” Representatives Sherman and Ros-Lehtinen are joined by eight colleagues including: Rep. Donald S. Beyer Jr. (D-VA), Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-RI), Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R- FL), Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-CO), Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-NJ), Rep. Kathleen M. Rice (D-NY), Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-PA), and Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX). You can view the letter here.
04.25.2018	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement in response to today’s Joint Congressional Address by French President Emmanuel Macron: “Today, President Emmanuel Macron delivered an excellent statement. Macron’s tough emphasis on protecting the environment was welcomed. As Macron stated, ‘there’s no planet B.’” “We have a major trade deficit with France and the European Union and Macron simply urged us to work through the World Trade Organization which has consistently been harmful to American working families.” “Further, Macron did not deal with the issue of ‘burden sharing’ except to point out that some of the burdens from defending central and eastern European Democracies have been taken on by France and other European Union countries. I hope that France will work with the United States to increase the commitment of the European allies to our common defense.” “Lastly, I was pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly with President Macron and shake his hand. He has a very strong grip. Perhaps he’s been working out—preparing for his encounter with President Trump.”
04.11.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman received the Humane Champion Award from the Humane Society of the United States. This is Congressman Sherman’s 11th consecutive award from the Humane Society. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on animal welfare issues and for his consistently perfect score on the Humane Society’s Legislative Scorecard. The Humane Society was particularly appreciative of Sherman’s leadership in introducing the Parity in Animal Cruelty Enforcement (PACE) Act (H.R. 4202) to strengthen prohibitions against animal fighting. Animal fighting has been banned in the United States for 10 years; this legislation closes a loophole that exempted U.S. territories from the federal ban. The legislation was strongly supported by the Humane Society. “Representative Sherman has again been a terrific champion for animals, co-leading on a bill to close loopholes in the current federal law on animal fighting and achieving a perfect score on the 2017 Humane Society Scorecard,” said Mimi Brody, Director of Federal Affairs for the Humane Society Legislative Fund. “We are immensely grateful for his dedication.”
03.28.2018	Sherman Oaks – On Monday, the Los Angeles Area Helicopter Noise Coalition (LAAHNC) formally announced that the Federal Aviation Administration had rejected all of its petitions for greater regulation of non-essential flights. "Despite years of effort including an automated complaint system for the public and an ongoing public dialog, we have not experienced the reduction in helicopter noise that Valley residents expect and deserve," stated Sherman. In October of 2015, LAAHNC first submitted four petitions to the FAA to propose new regulations on minimum flight altitudes, hovering times, media helicopter pooling, and protection of coastal areas. Congressman Sherman formally requested the FAA take concrete steps to address the excessive helicopter noise in the San Fernando Valley and consider all of these petitions on their merits, with appropriate exemptions for law enforcement, emergency responders, and the military. This is the second time that the FAA has rejected the petitions. "The FAA has the authority to enact regulations that reduce the impact of aviation noise over the San Fernando Valley" said Sherman, "and I will continue to work with the community until their concerns are addressed." ###
03.22.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) applauded the passage of government funding legislation that includes the FY 2018 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. Sherman led the successful effort to secure $6 million in funding for two U.S.-Israel energy cooperation programs. In April of last year, Congressman Sherman led a bipartisan group of 102 members of Congress in sending a letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development requesting funding for these programs (to view the letter click here.) Sherman wrote the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act which was enacted in 2007. “This is the highest level of funding for joint U.S-Israel energy programs in our countries’ histories. Funding these two programs will further assist our nations in achieving energy independence, and will improve our environment and national security,” Rep. Sherman said. Rep. Sherman continued, “When people think of Israel, unfortunately, they think of tsuris, but what they should think of is science. In the past, when someone heard that something big has happened in Israel, they may have asked: where was the terrorist attack and how many people died? In the future, when somebody hears that something big has happened in Israel, they will ask: what did the Israelis invent and how many lives will it save?” Sherman is also focused on securing funding in the FY 2019 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. This month, Sherman sent a bipartisan letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development requesting funding for these programs along with 92 colleagues. You can view the letter here. Background: To date, the U.S. government has provided $15.7 million for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement, matched dollar-for-dollar by the Israeli government. The program has already leveraged over $37 million in private sector investment. This is a competitive grant program for early-stage companies that is designed to connect the U.S. and Israeli private sectors and academics. Its mandate was expanded in 2014 to cover collaborative Research and Development (R&D) into renewable technologies, natural gas, and water – key areas of interest for the United States. Funding for the U.S.-Israel Energy Center (“Center of Excellence”) will bring to fruition a project that Congress, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Government of Israel have worked on for the past two years. The Center of Excellence will include joint R&D and academic and technology transfer ventures in areas such as thermal power, wastewater treatment, desalination, clean energy, produced water, natural gas, and protection of critical infrastructure through cybersecurity.
03.21.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, and Brad Sherman (D-CA), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, were joined by Ted Poe (R-TX) and William Keating (D-MA), the respective Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade in introducing HR 5357, the Nuclear Cooperation Reform Act of 2018. The bill seeks to ensure that U.S. partner countries in any civilian nuclear cooperation agreement (known as 123 agreements for the section of the Atomic Energy Act that govern such agreements) renounce the pursuit of enrichment and reprocessing technologies and capabilities. The bill will require a stronger Congressional approval process, including an affirmative vote, for U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements that fail to meet the so-called Gold Standard and will strengthen protections against nuclear proliferation. “Nuclear cooperation agreements – especially in an unstable region like the Middle East – are very serious issues for U.S. national security and should always contain restrictions on the enrichment and reprocessing necessary for a nuclear weapon,” said Rep. Ros-Lehtinen. “Agreements without these restrictions must be fully and openly scrutinized and debated and then face an up or down vote of approval from Congress. For too long, the Executive Branch has been able to minimize Congress’ role in approving these agreements, and it is time for the Legislative Branch to reassert its proper oversight role.” “Congress must ensure that U.S. national security interests are not trumped by political concerns,” said Rep. Sherman. “By requiring stronger conditions for Congressional approval of nuclear cooperation agreements, this bipartisan bill will enable Congress to raise the standards for these agreements, and add much-needed protections against nuclear proliferation.” Ros-Lehtinen and Sherman also sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan urging the United States to “press for the inclusion of binding commitments against enrichment and reprocessing” in its negotiations with Saudi Arabia on a nuclear cooperation agreement. Ros-Lehtinen and Sherman write, “Without such commitments and assurances, we feel it may be necessary to introduce a resolution of disapproval, and given the severity of the matter, we also feel it necessary to introduce a legislative fix to the Atomic Energy Act in order to assert Congressional oversight…” BACKGROUND: The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) governs U.S. nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries. Currently, these agreements are negotiated by the President and automatically go into effect after 90 days of continuous session unless Congress adopts a joint resolution of disapproval. The guaranteed presidential veto of such as resolution in effect requires a 2/3 majority in both Houses to stop these agreements, a barrier that greatly undermines Congressional input. The AEA also prescribes a number of nonproliferation standards that nuclear cooperation agreements must meet.
03.20.2018	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Representative Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Asia Pacific Subcommittee, applauded the enactment of H.R. 535, the Taiwan Travel Act. Sherman introduced the legislation last January with U.S. Representative Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-California). “Taiwan is not just an important trading partner, it is a democratic ally of the U.S. and a place where our values are displayed in the Asia-pacific region. Yet it would be surprising for most Americans to know that leaders from Taiwan are not allowed to visit the U.S. under any reasonable format,” said Rep. Sherman. Sherman continued, “This bill simply says that it is time to encourage travel of high-ranking officials from Taiwan to visit the U.S. and hold meetings at the highest levels. We should also send high-ranking officials to Taiwan. This bill is an important step in ending the effort to isolate Taiwan. By encouraging more dialogue we will reaffirm the U.S. commitment to the freedom of Taiwan.” Rep. Sherman, a long-time supporter of strong U.S.-Taiwan relations, spoke in support of the Taiwan Travel Act on January 9, prior to the House unanimously passing the legislation.

03.01.2018	Sherman Oaks - On Wednesday evening, nearly 5,000 Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the San Fernando Valley called in and participated in a conversation with Congressman Sherman for over ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed the questions and concerns of constituents about gun control, the Republican tax plan, trade, electoral reforms, and other issues. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to constituents,” said Rep. Sherman. “These types of Town Halls allow me to easily interact with thousands of Valley residents. With Donald Trump in the White House, the disastrous Republican tax plan and the recent tragedy in Florida, my constituents have more questions than ever.” Rep. Sherman was joined by State Senator Henry Stern and Assembly Member Adrin Nazarian who discussed the work they're doing in Sacramento on issues such as gun control, homelessness, and traffic. Sherman’s next Town Hall Meeting will take place on Sunday, March 25th at Reseda High School from 2:30 – 4:00 p.m. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman requested input from his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: Do you approve or disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as President? Approve: 17% Disapprove: 80% Unsure: 4% Do you support legislation to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines? Yes: 85% No: 11% Unsure: 3% Do you support the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) policy, which provides legal status to those who were brought in the United States as children from being deported? Yes: 85% No: 2% Unsure: 11% Do you support the legislative agenda of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare? Yes: 85% No: 2% No Opinion: 13% Do you support the legislative agenda of Planned Parenthood? Yes: 79% No: 13% No Opinion: 8% Do you support the legislative agenda of the Sierra Club? Yes: 56% No: 9% No Opinion: 35% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct constituents to his district office (818) 501-9200 for further assistance in solving personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail.
02.21.2018	Working to Prevent Gun Violence The epidemic of gun violence continues to grip the nation. From the concert shooting on the Las Vegas strip, the deadliest mass shooting in our nation’s history, to the horrific scene at a high school in Florida where seventeen people were killed by a gunman, this past year saw citizens across the country continue to grapple with the realities of gun violence. I have dedicated myself to fighting the scourge of gun violence. During my twenty years in Congress, I have consistently earned a 100 percent vote rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence and all other major groups fighting against gun violence. Preventing Automatic Gunfire A gunman opened fire on thousands of people attending a music festival in Las Vegas, killing 59 and injuring more than 500. He was armed with 32 guns in his hotel room; one dozen were outfitted with a “bump stock” device, which converted the semi-automatic rifles into fully automatic weapons. It is illegal for civilians to possess machine guns. However, individuals are able to purchase “bump stocks” for less than $200 and easily convert a semi-automatic weapon into a firearm that can rapidly accelerate a semi-automatic weapon's rate of fire to between 400 and 800 rounds per minute. No person should possess a device that turns a semi-automatic rifle into the equivalent of a machine gun. That is why I joined my colleagues to introduce the Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act which would ban the manufacture, possession, transfer, sale, or importation of bump stocks. We cannot become a country where the tragedy in Las Vegas becomes the new normal. High capacity magazines are another dangerous tool. By enhancing a weapon’s firing capability and reducing the need to reload, mass shooters have been able to inflict military-grade firepower on victims. I joined my colleagues in introducing the Keep Americans Safe Act, which prohibits the transfer, importation, or possession of magazines that are able to hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition. Finally, I have long been supportive of the assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004, that banned the manufacturing of certain semi-automatic firearms for civilian use. These military-grade weapons, like the AR-15 used by the gunman in Parkland, Florida, are a common thread connecting the deadliest mass shootings in America. There is no reason that military-grade weapons should be easily available; we must immediately reinstate the assault weapons ban. Background Checks - Closing the Gun Shop Loophole There is no single law that can put an end to mass shootings or gun violence, but there are proactive steps we can take to keep guns out of dangerous hands. One step is bolstering background checks which serve as the first line of defense in our efforts to keep guns from criminals, domestic abusers and the dangerously mentally ill. That is why I cosponsored the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act which expands the existing background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales, including those at gun shows, over the internet, and in classified ads. The bill also helps strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) by incentivizing states to improve reporting of criminals and the dangerously mentally ill and by directing future grant funds toward better record-sharing systems. Studies show that every day where background checks are used, the system stops more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly 20 fugitives from buying a gun. However, no system is in place to prevent these same prohibited purchasers from buying identical guns at a gun show, over the internet, or through a newspaper ad. The Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act closes these loopholes. Concealed Carry Laws Just two months after the Las Vegas tragedy, the House, unfortunately, passed the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act which would allow the concealed carrying of dangerous firearms across state lines. Right now, each state has the right to determine the extent to which it will recognize the concealed-carry laws of other states. Some states have strong laws, preventing dangerous people like domestic abusers and convicted stalkers from obtaining concealed-carry permits and requiring training and thorough evaluation as part of the process. In other states, concealed-carry laws have much lower standards. The 12 states with the weakest laws do not even require a permit. That means residents of those states may carry loaded, concealed guns in public spaces without ever having passed a background check. I vehemently opposed this short-sighted and dangerous piece of legislation because it would make it harder for law enforcement to do their job and pose a serious threat to public safety. Domestic Violence Homicide Prevention Act Leaving an abusive relationship is the most dangerous time for a domestic violence victim, and adding the threat of firearms heightens the risk of fatality for a victim. According to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control, more than 55% of female homicide victims were killed in connection to violence committed by intimate partners. When a victim makes the decision to leave an abusive situation and seeks help from law enforcement, our system must do everything in its power to protect the safety of the abused. This is why I cosponsored the Domestic Violence Gun Homicide Prevention Act which prevents domestic abusers under restraining orders from obtaining weapons. Under federal law, it is illegal for an abuser to possess a firearm if he or she becomes subject to a protection order or is convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. However, there are currently insufficient resources to ensure that authorities have the tools needed to verify a domestic violence offender’s prohibited status—and even fewer resources to ensure that no domestic violence offender continues to have access to lethal firearms. The Domestic Violence Gun Homicide Prevention Act aims to rectify these decencies within our system by establishing a grant program to encourage states to adopt a baseline of criminal disarmament policies in dangerous domestic violence situations. The bill also promotes state and local court policies that routinely identify whether a dangerous gun is present and order its removal when it poses a threat to the victim. These are just some of the issues I am focused on to reduce and prevent gun violence in America. I will keep working to prevent these types of tragedies and make our communities safer.
01.22.2018	Sherman Oaks – On Sunday, Congressman Brad Sherman hosted a Valley Town Hall at Reseda High School via Skype. Due to the government shutdown, Congressman Sherman was unable to attend the town hall in person but joined via Skype from his office in Washington, D.C. Congressman Sherman discussed the government shutdown, the Republican tax plan, foreign affairs, his constituent services program, and more with those in attendance at the Valley’s largest High School auditorium. In the crowd were a few Trump supporters, but the vast majority of attendees ranged from those who opposed Trump to those vehemently against Trump and supporting Sherman’s Articles of Impeachment. Sherman invited several local elected officials including State Treasurer John Chiang, L.A. County Assessor Jeff Prang, L.A. City Councilmember Paul Koretz, LAUSD School Board Members Nick Melvoin and Kelly Gomez, and Community College Board Member Andra Hoffman.
01.16.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, on the eve of the 24th anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is reminding residents of the San Fernando Valley and metropolitan Los Angeles about how they can prepare for a future seismic event. Twenty-four years ago, dozens of lives were lost and thousands were injured by one of the largest earthquakes in our nation’s history. The Northridge Earthquake was also one of the most costly federal disasters, with damages in excess of $20 billion. “The images of the collapsed apartments, freeways, bridges and buildings should remind us to prepare ourselves and our families for when Los Angeles is struck again by a major earthquake,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is imperative that we take the steps necessary to protect ourselves and our families should another major disaster occur, whether it is an earthquake, a fire, or another natural disaster.” In an effort to prepare the Valley and the metropolitan Los Angeles area, Congressman Sherman has been a leader in ensuring that annual funding is made available for the West Coast Earthquake Early Warning System. “With advanced notice, people can take cover, trains can slow down, and doctors can pause surgeries – it can save lives and reduce the economic impact of an earthquake,” said Congressman Sherman. Sherman encourages all residents to prepare themselves by taking the following steps before, during, and after an earthquake: Before an earthquake: (1) Check for hazards in the home, (2) identify safe places indoors and outdoors, (3) educate yourself and family members, (4) have disaster supplies on hand, (5) develop an emergency communication plan, and (6) help your community get ready by talking to your neighbors or participating in your neighborhood council. During an earthquake: Take cover indoors in a safe place such as under a sturdy table or within a doorway. If outdoors, stay in a safe open area away from buildings, streetlights and utility wires. After an earthquake: Expect aftershocks, listen to a battery-operated radio or television for emergency information, use the telephone for emergency calls only, stay away from damaged areas, inspect your home for damages, and inspect gas lines and electrical systems, as well as sewage and water lines. For more information about Earthquake Preparedness, visit the following websites: www.fema.gov, www.usgs.gov, www.oes.ca.gov, or www.lacity.org/emd. Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley constituents may contact him directly with questions or additional concerns at (818) 501-9200.
11.16.2017	Sherman Oaks - On Wednesday evening, over 5,500 Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the district called in and participated in a conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed the questions and concerns of constituents, including on the Republican tax plan, U.S. foreign policy in Iran, clean air and climate change, and health care for veterans. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to constituents,” said Rep. Sherman. “These types of Town Halls allow me to easily interact with thousands of Valley residents. With Donald Trump in the White House and the disastrous Republican tax plan proposal my constituents have more questions than ever.” Rep. Sherman continued, “Residents across the Valley are understandably concerned about the state of affairs in the White House and voiced that opinion throughout the event.” Sherman’s next Town Hall Meeting will take place Sunday, January 21 at Reseda High School. His last Town Hall at that location was attended by over 1,000 Valley residents. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman requested input from his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: Should we continue to allow deductions for state and local income and property tax? Yes: 86% No: 5% Unsure: 9% Is the Republican Tax Plan fair? Yes: 8% No: 83% Unsure: 9% Will the Republican Tax Plan… Help the economy by encouraging investment: 8% Hurt the economy by increasing the budget deficit and encouraging moving jobs overseas: 81% Unsure: 11% Do you support the legislative agenda of the Humane Society Yes: 58% No: 9% No Opinion: 33% Do you support the legislative agenda of the Sierra Club? Yes: 69% No: 8% No Opinion: 23% Do you support the legislative agenda of Planned Parenthood? Yes: 83% No: 11% No Opinion: 6% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct constituents to his district office (818) 501-9200 for further assistance in regarding personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the ninety-minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail.

11.15.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following chart that demonstrates how Democratic tax policies produce stronger economic growth than Republican tax policies. “The GOP wants Americans to believe its tax plan will jumpstart the economy, but the numbers simply prove them wrong,” said Rep. Sherman. ________________________ These statistics were calculated using data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and demonstrate how the economy has grown faster under Democratic tax policies than Republican policies. For purposes of these calculations, we defined each tax policy period as follows: Reagan (1986 law) and H.W. Bush Tax Policies: Effective January 1, 1988, to December 31, 1993 Clinton Tax Policies: Effective January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2000 W. Bush Tax Policies: Effective January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2012 Obama Tax Policies: Effective January 1, 2013, to September 30, 2017 (Democrats allowed George W. Bush's tax policies to remain in force through 2012, and raised taxes on the top brackets for 2013).
11.09.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, as President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping pose for photos, Congressman Brad Sherman released the following chart examining the rise of the U.S.-China trade deficit under Donald Trump’s leadership. “Between February and August of this year, the U.S.-China trade deficit has risen dramatically. In fact, the trade deficit has increased every month that Trump has been in office,” said Rep. Sherman. “The President acting alone could eliminate this deficit by imposing tariffs on Chinese goods now. But instead, he has chosen to be a pretend president.” Rep. Sherman continued, “The fact is we have to look at the overall trade relationship. We’re running a trade deficit in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and every billion dollars of trade deficit costs us 10,000 jobs.” You can view Congressman Sherman’s complete floor speech on the rising trade deficit and the GOP tax plan that will crush economic growth here.
10.27.2017	Washington, D.C. – Sunday, October 29, marks the 12th anniversary of the Metro’s Orange Line. The Orange Line, an 18-mile bus rapid transit system that runs through the San Fernando Valley from Chatsworth to North Hollywood, has helped residents of the Valley connect to other essential public transportation systems and has helped reduce traffic on the 101 Freeway. “I am very pleased with the success of the Metro Orange Line which has served commuters in the Valley for over ten years,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). “However, much work is still needed to alleviate congestion and improve transit service throughout the San Fernando Valley. Our next priority should be to build a subway through the Sepulveda Pass, from the Valley to LAX, with a connection in West Los Angeles to the Purple Line, now under construction. Well-designed projects not only provide jobs for those who build them, but improve our regional economy and competitiveness, and thus help create jobs in all economic sectors.” The Orange line has rapidly become one of the nation’s most successful Bus Rapid Transit Lines, accommodating 74 million boardings in the last decade, according to LA Metro. Congressman Sherman secured federal funds for construction of the Orange Line, which now carries a daily average of 30,000 riders along a dedicated busway from Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the North Hollywood Red Line Station. That project also included a bicycle and pedestrian path, as well as the Warner Center Transit Hub. In 2012, the Orange Line was extended from the Warner Center area to the Chatsworth Metrolink Station.
10.23.2017	Sherman Oaks, CA – On the second anniversary of the Aliso Canyon gas leak, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) condemned the decision of the Trump Administration to withdrawal natural gas storage safety regulations. He sent a letter demanding that the regulations be restored and enforced. Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch, met face-to-face with then-President Barack Obama and received a commitment that federal natural gas storage safety regulations would be issued. That commitment was honored. Last December, the relevant federal agency for the first time issued regulations on Aliso Canyon and similar facilities nationwide. On June 20, President Trump, gleefully bowing to the demands of the oil and gas industry, withdrew the recently adopted regulation. “Having lived near the largest methane leak in history, I know that people who live near Aliso Canyon, and hundreds of similar facilities nationwide, need the protection of the safety regulations the Trump Administration withdrew,” said Sherman.

10.16.2017	Sherman Oaks, CA – Following the release of an independent health study by Dr. Jeffrey Nordella, which concluded that Porter Ranch residents have uranium, lithium, and other chemicals in their bodies, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is calling for a comprehensive, independent, long-term health study on the impact of toxin exposures from the Aliso Canyon well blowout. Nordella’s study revealed that of 106 patients whose urine was tested, 31 percent had a presence of styrene at higher than average levels. Styrene is a derivative of benzene, a known carcinogen. Chronic exposure to styrene leads to tiredness and lethargy, memory deficits, headaches, and vertigo. “The results of Dr. Nordella’s study only strengthen the need for a long-term health study to be completed by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health,” said Congressman Sherman, whose home was as close as any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. In 2016, the Los Angeles Department of Public Health completed a study focused on air samples by testing dust samples inside homes. Officials found evidence of metals that were consistent with those found at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility site. This is not the first time Sherman has called for a comprehensive study. In February, SoCalGas reached a settlement with the Southern California Air Quality Management District (AQMD) that shortchanged Porter Ranch. The settlement called for SoCalGas to pay $8.5 million, but only one million of that sum was to be spent on a comprehensive health study. “An appropriate study of the injuries caused, and particularly the long-term effects caused by the methane leak cannot be completed for one million dollars,” said Sherman. “One million dollars is enough for a whitewash that declares that everyone is fine and no one should bother SoCalGas again.” Sherman continued, “Numerous air and facility tests over the past two years have shown elevated levels of benzene, a known carcinogen. We can no longer sit on our hands while the lives of thousands of residents of Porter Ranch are at stake” Safety Regulations Sherman is also renewing his call for stronger regulation of natural gas storage facilities in Aliso Canyon and beyond. “Now is the time to put in place stronger regulations that will work to prevent what happened at Aliso Canyon from reoccurring anywhere in California,” said Sherman. “Just because California’s standards for the storage of natural gas are stronger than those in other states or federal standards, does not mean they are sufficient.” First, Sherman urges the requirement of deep subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all active wells at subsurface natural gas storage facilities. Second, California must address the “too big to fail, too big to exist” issue by mandating that when any major metropolitan area is reliant on one storage facility for over 25 percent of its power, additional gas storage facilities must be developed. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.

10.16.2017	Background: Congressman Brad Sherman’s home was as close as any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.​ Sherman’s proposed changes include: Subsurface Valves One of the tragic ironies of the Aliso Canyon leak is that the broken well, SS25, had previously been equipped with a subsurface safety valve that was removed in 1979 and never replaced. Subsurface safety valves can protect against ruptures along the length of the well where valves located at the surface would be insufficient. Moreover, subsurface safety valves with “positive pressure” ensure that if there is any interruption of pressure (due to a malfunction, earthquake, power outage, etc.) subsurface safety valves will close. This would add an additional layer of protection to the current proposed tubing and casing requirements. The state should require deep subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all active wells at subsurface natural gas storage facilities. Too Big To Fail Additionally, there must be a commitment to address the overdependence upon very large natural gas storage facilities like Aliso Canyon, a problem endemic in the state’s natural gas storage system. The residents of Porter Ranch, many of whom remain engaged in a legal battle with SoCalGas over injuries suffered during the blowout, are currently being told that injections must resume at Aliso Canyon or we run the risk of blackouts to the entire Los Aneles metropolitan area. The state should mandate that when any major metropolitan area is reliant on one facility for over 25% of its power, that other energy sources, with priority given to renewable sources, be developed. Implementation Deadlines I recognize that neither of these recommendations can be implemented immediately. The following should be implemented by 2025, or another date that the Department of Conservation determines to be appropriate. Subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all underground active wells at natural gas storage facilities. A state-wide too big to fail standard for natural gas storage in each of the state’s major metropolitan areas. Then California residents would have proof that the State is doing everything in its power to ensure that a disaster like Aliso Canyon never happens again.
10.13.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, President Trump failed to certify Iran’s compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal. Now, any one of the House and Senate Majority and Minority leaders may introduce legislation to reimpose the sanctions that were waived by the deal within 60 days and such legislation, if introduced, will require only 50 votes in the Senate. Congressman Sherman, a senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee released the following statement: “I was the first Member of Congress of either party to urge the rejection of the Iran deal, speaking on the House Floor hours after it was published. But if the U.S. renounces the deal, Iran keeps the roughly $100 billion they got last year, while being freed from the restraints imposed by the agreement. Our goal should be to enforce and extend the nuclear deal. If we renounce the deal at this point, we cannot enforce, monitor, or extend any nuclear restrictions on Iran; in fact, we may end them. I cannot think of a worse result than Iran being free to pursue a nuclear program without the limits of the JCPOA. We should also impose the strongest possible non-nuclear sanctions on Iran for a number of reasons: its ballistic missile program, support for terrorism (Iran is still a State Department-designated State Sponsor of Terrorism), and human rights abuses. Iran is complicit in the murder of hundreds of thousands in Syria, and tens of thousands in Yemen. We need to impose these sanctions with European support. But the truth is, we do not need to renounce the deal and potentially liberate Iran from its obligations in order to impose any of these sanctions. As to one specific area where additional pressure can be brought to bear, Trump expressed his intention to target Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). I agree that we should hit the IRGC and their business partners hard. The JCPOA did not require the U.S. to lift any sanctions on the IRGC, so this is a key area where additional pressure can be applied on Iran, consistent with the Agreement. Most people will focus on the President’s decision to designate the IRGC a terrorist organization. That is an important decision, but it is by no means the most important way we can target the IRGC. The IRGC was already under sanctions for its nuclear proliferation activities, and legislation enacted in July– the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act –required that the organization be treated as a terrorist organization. What has been lacking, however, is the vigilance in seeking to discover and designate many additional organizations – businesses, foundations and other groups – that are affiliated with the IRGC, and the imposition of tough measures against the companies that do business with them. Trump did say that he will seek to designate more officials, agents, and affiliates, but nothing about secondary sanctions on their business partners. This is an organization that by some estimates controls 40 percent of Iran’s economy. To date, we have only designated some 70 organizations and individuals for affiliation with the IRGC. We have also done very little to punish firms that conduct business with those by hitting them with secondary sanctions, as is provided by several provisions of law, including a statute that I wrote with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, namely Title III of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012. If you do business in Iran, it is likely that you are doing business with the IRGC. The IRGC and its Quds Force have their hand in conflicts across the Middle East, and have the blood of U.S. troops on their hands as the purveyor of the most effective IEDs used against our troops in Iraq. I hope the Trump Administration will use the tools that they have been given to effectively punish this group and those that choose to do business with them.” Background: Congressman Sherman has been working to confront Iran, its nuclear program, and its support for terrorism since arriving to Congress in 1997. Congressman Sherman was the first Member of the House of Representatives to speak on the House Floor in opposition to the Iran nuclear deal after its text was published. On October 11, 2017, Congressman Sherman spoke at the House Foreign Affairs Committee, at a hearing titled “Confronting the Full Range of Iranian Threats,” (to view his statement, click here).
10.12.2017	Washington, D.C. – On July 12, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) filed Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. Sherman argued that Trump committed Obstruction of Justice by pressuring FBI Director James Comey to abandon the investigation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, and again by seeking to thwart the Russia Investigation. Today, the Brookings Institution issued a 108-page legal brief supporting Sherman’s legal analysis. The brief, titled Presidential Obstruction of Justice: The Case of Donald J. Trump, was authored by a team of prominent legal experts headed by Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and former chief White House ethics lawyer from 2009 to 2011. See the Brookings Institution’s brief, including a 2-page executive summary. See Sherman’s statement justifying filing Articles of Impeachment.
10.05.2017	The Case For Impeaching Donald J. Trump If Trump is impeached, it will not be for the initial crime, but for the cover-up. On January 3, 2017, I once again swore to protect and defend the constitution. Our constitution calls for the impeachment of a president who has committed high crimes and misdemeanors. Obstruction of justice is a felony under the United States criminal code. See § 1512 (b)(3) of the U.S. criminal code. It applies when anyone uses threats to hinder a federal criminal investigation. While this section is commonly applied to witness intimidation, the courts have consistently ruled that it is also applicable when one threatens an FBI agent or other law enforcement official. On June 8, I heard every word of FBI Director James Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee given under oath and penalty of perjury. Comey is a credible witness, well-respected in the law enforcement community nationwide, and he testified on the basis of contemporaneous notes. Director Comey is not a Berniecrat hostile to the Trump Agenda; he served in the Trump Administration, and wished to continue to do so. Comey testified that in February the president threatened him in order to get him to curtail the investigation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. Threatening an FBI director in order to curtail an ongoing FBI investigation constitutes a felony under § 1512. In May, President Trump fired Director Comey and indicated that his purpose was to thwart the Russian collusion investigation. A president is free to fire an FBI director if he feels that it is in the national interest, but firing the FBI director for the purpose of thwarting an ongoing FBI investigation involving the president himself, constitutes a second violation of § 1512. As to this second felony there are no evidentiary questions, as the critical evidence is the president’s own voice on video tape in an interview by Lester Holt. In July, President Trump made comments to the “New York Times,” on the record and on audio tape, that were interpreted by many as threatening Special Counsel Robert Mueller for the purpose of preventing him from looking at Trump’s financial dealings. This may well be a third violation of § 1512. In each case, the president’s efforts to obstruct justice were ill-advised and ineffectual. But the court cases are clear ― one can be convicted of obstruction of justice even for an inept and unsuccessful attempt. Or in this case, perhaps three inept and unsuccessful attempts. I believe that filing articles of impeachment was necessary for me to fully comply with my oath to defend the constitution. This is why I filed H.Res.438 on July 12. But no one believes that this Congress is likely to impeach and remove President Trump anytime soon. So, what is the practical effect? One possibility, and this is a faint hope, is that the actual filing of articles of impeachment, combined with other factors, will cause the White House staff to stage an “intervention.” Already Republican senators are publicly and privately warning President Trump that he needs to restrain his behavior or impeachment will become real. Recently, Senator Lindsey Graham warned the president that if he fires Attorney General Jeff Sessions “all hell would break loose.” This was a clear reference to impeachment, a warning made more tangible by the filing of articles of impeachment. Perhaps, Republicans and White House staff can convince President Trump to exercise impulse control and to govern competently. Maybe they can persuade him that never again should he impulsively blurt out highly sensitive intelligence to a Russian foreign minister. What seems more likely is that Trump will continue to provide reckless and incoherent governance, even after the appointment of his new Chief of Staff, General Kelly. If this continues into next year unabated, Republicans will eventually join in the impeachment effort, and a few will thank me for getting the ball rolling in July of 2017. I did not file articles of impeachment to further the interests of my political party or the political values I have fought for all my life. I served with Mike Pence in the House for twelve years and disagree with him on almost every issue. I never dreamed I would author a measure that would put him in the White House. If Trump were removed, Pence would provide constitutional, law-abiding, and relatively competent leadership devoted to implementing a deplorable agenda. I took an oath to protect the country and the Constitution, not an oath to seek advantage for my political party. The parallels to Watergate are striking. In 1972, Republican burglars stole files from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters. Back then files were sheets of paper in manila folders. In 2016, Russian cyber burglars stole files from DNC headquarters. Today, “files” are electrons on hard drives. The Watergate break-in was discovered in June 1972. About a year later, Articles of Impeachment were filed against Richard Nixon. The cyber burglary of the DNC was discovered last Spring. About a year later, I filed Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump. It took about a year after the Articles of Impeachment were filed against Nixon until the House Judiciary Committee voted to report such Articles to the House floor. (At that point, Richard Nixon resigned.) As things are now proceeding, it wouldn’t surprise me if roughly a year after I filed Articles of Impeachment there was a vote to impeach President Trump in the House Judiciary Committee. But how the future unfolds depends chiefly on whether Trump provides capable, competent leadership—his fate is in his own hands. There are some differences between Watergate and the present case. Nixon faced a Democratic majority in the House of Representatives while Trump enjoys a Republican majority. So a higher level of public concern will be necessary to initiate impeachment hearings. On the other hand, Nixon was competent, careful, and not a Russian stooge. If Trump remains the opposite, then within a year, we may see the level of public concern necessary to force impeachment hearings. A final similarity to Watergate: It was never proven that Nixon colluded with the Watergate burglars. It was not the initial crime that doomed Nixon, it was the cover-up, the obstruction of justice. We may never know whether president Trump colluded with the Russian cyber burglars. If Trump is impeached, it will not be for the initial crime, but for the cover-up, the obstruction of justice. We need not wait until all the various investigations give us a complete catalog of all of Trump’s possible wrongdoings. We have the sworn testimony of a credible and percipient witness and Trump’s own words on videotape (Lester Holt) and audiotape (The New York Times). We have clear and convincing evidence that President Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice. It is time now for the House Judiciary Committee to begin hearings on impeachment. Congressman Sherman has represented California’s San Fernando Valley since 1997. He is a graduate of Harvard Law School. He is the only member of the House of Representatives to file Articles of Impeachment (H.Res. 438), co-sponsored by Representative Al Green (D-TX).
09.20.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced his intention, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts), to introduce legislation to eliminate so-called ‘right-to-work’ laws. Sherman has introduced this legislation in the past five Congresses. In the 114th Congress, Sherman introduced the bill in July 2016 with 48 House cosponsors. Sherman consistently earns a 100 percent rating from the AFL-CIO. “We now have 28 states with ‘right-to-work’ provisions,” said Sherman. “Their stated goal is to take jobs from other states by weakening unions and, therefore, lowering wages. Only by ending so-called ‘right-to-work’ nationwide can we stop this race to the bottom.” Sherman continued, “Current ‘right-to-work’ laws require unions to represent non-dues-paying employees, thereby creating free riders – people who benefit from the union contract but don’t pay. Due to this free-rider problem, it is rare that a strong union can be organized in a ‘right-to-work’ state. In addition, ‘right-to-work’ laws create different standards for union membership in different states. This results not only in confusion over the regulation of union membership but also places a higher cost on worker representation in labor rights states.” "The country is in the middle of renegotiating NAFTA, which was a bad deal for American workers," said Senator Elizabeth Warren. "If we want to protect workers and expect a level playing field in international trade deals, we need to start at home - and that means banning states from imposing restrictions that prevent workers from joining together to fight for their future." ‘Right-to-work’ laws have come to be known as ‘right-to-work-for-less laws.’ A study released by Sherman in July 2016, shows that wages in ‘right-to-work’ states average $6,807 a year less than workers in labor-rights states. “So-called ‘right-to-work’ laws strip unions of their legal ability to collect dues when the employee benefits from a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. This forces unions to use their time and dues from their members to provide benefits to free riders who are exempt from paying their fair share,” Sherman said. “These laws are harmful to labor-rights states, like California, which allow labor unions to organize because now we have to compete with the race to the bottom. As a result, California companies have to compete with states where the workers would like better wages, working conditions, and benefits but are unable to organize to get them.” “With the introduction of legislation banning so-called ‘right-to-work’ laws, Congressman Sherman and Senator Warren have once again demonstrated their strong commitment to working families,” said Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-CIO. “‘Right-to-work’ laws undermine the economy and weaken worker’s ability to bargain for better working conditions, which translates into lower pay and fewer benefits for everyone.” In 1947, Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act (an Act that passed by overriding President Truman’s veto) allowed states to pass legislation that eliminates the ability of unions to collect dues from those who benefit from union contracts. The result encourages a race to the bottom, as states compete to attract employers by offering weak labor laws and, as a result, lower wages. Sherman’s legislation would repeal Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act.
09.05.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement after Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that President Donald Trump will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program with a six-month delay: Today’s announcement that the President will turn his back on DREAMers by ending DACA, essentially deporting nearly 800,000 young men and women who are American in every way, will undermine economic growth, bring fear to our communities, and tear families apart. "DACA has transformed the lives of young people who know no other country than America and has resulted in economic gains for cities, states, and nation as a whole. California will see the largest economic loss as a result of the President’s decision, as the removal of over 200,000 Californian DACA workers will lead to an annual GDP loss of $11.3 billion. “I am committed to working with House Republicans and my Democratic colleagues to pass legislation that will safeguard our young DREAMers.”
09.05.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today’s announcement that President Donald Trump has ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program with a six-month delay will affect over 200,000 Californians that are currently part of the DACA program. “I strongly disagree with Donald Trump’s announced changes to the DACA program and his administration’s immigration policies,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). “I have been very public in my disdain for various actions of the Trump Administration, and have introduced Articles of Impeachment for separate reasons.” Sherman continued, “Under the policy just released by the Administration it is critically important that those with DACA work permits that expire on or before March 5, 2018, apply for renewal immediately—I urge you not to wait until the October 5, 2017, deadline.” Congressman Sherman released the following practical advice to help those affected by the DACA decision: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that DACA will be terminated in six months, meaning 800,000 current DACA recipients will be subject to deportation unless Congress acts. The Department of Homeland Security has issued a memo outlining the process by which DACA will be repealed. No new initial applications will be accepted after today, September 5. Individuals whose work permit expires on or before March 5, 2018, may apply for renewal of their work permit by submitting an application by October 5, 2017—but Sherman urges you to apply ASAP. If your DACA work permit expires between February 5, 2018, and March 5, 2018, you will need special advice on when to file. Applications filed more than 150 days before expiration may be premature, but those filed after October 5, 2017, will be rejected under President Trump’s order. Anyone whose work permit expires on March 6, 2018, or after does not have the option to renew their DACA work permit and will then lose all DACA protections. Further, DHS has released a list of “Frequently Asked Questions” that can be accessed here. Residents of Congressman Sherman’s District in the west and the south San Fernando Valley can obtain assistance at (818) 501-9200. Others should contact their own local members of Congress.
08.18.2017	Washington, DC – This week, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) sent a letter to Alice G. Wells, the Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs and David Hale, the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan expressing strong concerns about human rights in Sindh. Sherman is joined by Representatives Barbara Comstock (R-VA), Trent Franks (R-AZ), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), and Adam Schiff (D-CA). The letter raises concerns about enforced disappearances, religious extremist attacks, and forced conversions. The letter also urges the State Department to place a priority on human rights and democracy in its interactions with the Government of Pakistan. Sherman is Chair of the Congressional Sindh Caucus, and Ranking Member on the Asia Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Information on the Sindh Caucus is found at https://sherman.house.gov/congressional-sindh-caucus Text of the letter can be found here and below. ______________________________________________ August 17, 2017 The Honorable Alice G. Wells Acting Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian Affairs U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street NW, Washington, DC 20520 The Honorable David Hale U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan American Embassy Diplomatic Enclave, Ramna-5 Islamabad, Pakistan Re: Human Rights in Sindh Dear Acting Assistant Secretary Wells and Ambassador Hale: We write to express our concerns about human rights violations in the Sindh province of Pakistan. With the United States undertaking a review of policy toward Pakistan, and the recent political leadership changes in that country, we urge you to place a priority on human rights and democracy in your interactions with the Government of Pakistan. The State Department notes that “we have a broad multi-faceted partnership with Pakistan,” but we must ensure that human rights are a priority. In 2016, Amnesty International reported that Pakistani security forces “committed human rights violations with almost total impunity,” while Human Rights Watch observed that “law enforcement and security agencies remained unaccountable for human rights violations.” The State Department itself noted that, in Pakistan, “the most serious human rights problems were extrajudicial and targeted killings; disappearances; torture; lack of rule of law…; gender inequality; violence against gender and sexual minorities; and sectarian violence.” We are concerned about a number of ongoing human rights violations in Sindh. First, advocates for political and social rights are taken into custody and imprisoned on questionable grounds. Just recently, a leading Pakistani daily wrote about continuing “enforced disappearances of political activists in the province” of Sindh. Second, the people of Sindh face religious extremist attacks. Sindh has historically welcomed peoples of all faiths and ethnicities, and is home to significant communities of Christians, Sufis, and Hindus. Yet religious extremism, and the government’s unwillingness or inability to curb groups linked to extremism, contribute to violence, including against minorities. For instance, in February this year, ISIS claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in Sindh that killed over 80 people. Third, there are forced conversions of Sindhi girls belonging to minority communities. While the numbers are unclear, reports suggest that every year, over 1,000 girls and young women in Pakistan, including many in Sindh, are forcibly converted upon marriage. The Pakistani government has not done enough to stop this practice, and reform measures are circumvented or not enforced. We urge you to work with the Government of Pakistan to seek the release of persons held on false charges in Sindh, to protect religious freedoms of the Sindhi people, to end the forced conversions of minority Sindhi girls and women, and to take stronger steps upholding human rights in Sindh. Sincerely, Brad Sherman Member of Congress Carolyn Maloney Member of Congress Adam Schiff Member of Congress Barbara Comstock Member of Congress Dana Rohrabacher Member of Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton Member of Congress Trent Franks Member of Congress
08.09.2017	Washington, D.C. – Following the President’s comments that if North Korea continues to threaten the U.S. then it will be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen before,” and Defense Secretary James Mattis’ warning that if its aggression continues the regime could face the “destruction of its people,” Ranking Member Sherman of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee Brad Sherman released the following statement: My district in California’s San Fernando Valley is among the closest to the rapidly developing North Korean menace, and I am fully cognizant of the threat North Korea poses to our allies, American forces in the region, and the U.S. mainland. “President Trump’s statement was reckless and puts American lives in danger; his remarks undermine the credibility of the American Commander in Chief to act as a rational world leader, and his rhetoric demonstrates that America is willing to escalate tensions in the region so casually rather than show resolve to defend against threats. “References to nuclear war by Defense Secretary Mattis are also troubling. The Administration should not speak flippantly about nuclear war. “To confront North Korea, we do not need hot tempered remarks from our Commander in Chief. We need a clear strategy that includes stronger economic and political pressure, and the key to that would be to get China fully on board. “Despite his promises, President Trump has largely failed to take action against China for allowing its companies to continue to conduct business with the North Korean regime. We need to impose secondary sanctions on China if it continues to serve as the lifeline for the regime in Pyongyang. “It is also critical that current U.N. and U.S. sanctions on North Korea are strictly enforced. Those who violate these sanctions should be penalized; those that do so are endangering Americans and our allies. “At the same time, we need a willingness to engage in compromise. We will not get what we want anytime soon – there will be no denuclearization in the foreseeable future. But we can achieve intermediate steps, such as a freeze.” Additional Background: On August 2, 2017, Ranking Member Sherman and Chairman Ted Yoho (R-FL) of the House Foreign Affairs Asia Pacific Subcommittee sent a letter to the Secretary of Treasury Mnuchin and Secretary of State Tillerson regarding the sanctioning of Chinese businesses that provide hard currency to the North Korean regime’s illicit weapons programs and the enforcement of U.S. and other sanctions in place on North Korea.

07.28.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressmen Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Peter King (R-NY) introduced a bipartisan House Resolution expressing support for the home mortgage interest and property tax deductions. Reps. Sherman and King were joined by Representatives Nanette Barragan (D-CA), Paul Cook (R-CA), Dan Donovan (R-NY), Sheila Jackson-Lee (D-TX), Gregory Meeks (D-NY), Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH), Eric Swalwell (D-CA), and Dina Titus (D-NV). The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that the mortgage interest deduction and income tax deduction should not be further restricted. “The home mortgage deduction provides benefits for everyone by spurring economic activity and the property tax deduction ensures communities can continue to provide vital services,” said Rep. Sherman. “A change in these tax deductions will undercut home values for all homeowners even those without a mortgage—a disaster for our economy.” “The mortgage interest deduction and the property tax deduction are essential to stabilizing our housing market and safeguarding home values. These deductions make homeownership more affordable in regions with higher costs of living such as Long Island,” said Rep. King. “Any changes made to scale these deductions back will disproportionately hurt middle-income families. It makes no sense to require hardworking taxpayers to pay income tax on money that was spent on property taxes. The effect of eliminating the deduction is a tax upon a tax.” As Congress considers tax reform this year, Rep. Sherman will continue working to ensure that these critical deductions are preserved.
07.27.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, CPA, senior member of the Financial Services Committee, and former Chair of the nation’s second largest tax agency introduced the Tax Filing Simplification Act of 2017 with Representatives Don Beyer (D-VA), Grace Napolitano (D-NY), Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-DC), Jamie Raskin (D-MD), Tim Ryan (D-OH), and Tom Suozzi (D-NY). The bill is based on legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate by Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The bill would direct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to develop a new program to provide taxpayers with a pre-prepared tax return with their income tax liability or refund amount already calculated. For most taxpayers the IRS already has all the relevant information from their W-2 and 1099s. For other taxpayers the IRS has almost all the information needed—the taxpayer could simply add a deduction or two, and then press submit. “Under the Tax Filing Simplification Act, most Americans would receive a tax return already prepared by the IRS. They could hit ‘submit’ and they’re done. Or they could make changes and then hit ‘submit’,” said Rep. Sherman. “Or they could simply ignore the IRS pre-prepared return and submit their returns just as they do now.” The legislation also makes two other common-sense changes to assist all taxpayers with preparing and filing their taxes. First, the bill requires the IRS to create new software to allow all taxpayers to prepare and file their taxes directly through the IRS. Additionally, the bill would also allow taxpayers to download information the IRS already has (like their W-2 and 1099 forms) directly from the IRS’s website.
07.27.2017	Washington, DC – On July 21 during Friday prayers, Imam Ammar Shahin, delivered a sermon at the Islamic Center of Davis, CA where he prayed to Allah to "liberate the Al-Aqsa Mosque from the filth of the Jews" and to "annihilate them down to the very last one." Congressman Sherman released the following statement in response: It is unacceptable for anyone, anywhere, and at any time to call to annihilate Jews or any other religious or ethnic group. Imam Shahin’s rhetoric was nothing short of a call for genocide. “I call upon the Islamic Center of Davis to terminate the employment of Mr. Ammar Shahin, to declare that he is ineligible for any future employment, and to permanently bar him from attendance at the mosque or at any of its facilities. I further call upon every organization to permanently bar Mr. Shahin from all of their activities and disassociate itself from the Islamic Center of Davis until it permanently disassociates itself from Mr. Shahin. “In particular, I have contacted the following organizations and urged them to inform me when Mr. Shahin would be barred from participation in their activities and whether the Islamic Center of Davis would be likewise barred until it completely severs its relationship with Mr. Shahin. The organizations contacted are as follows: the University of California, Davis (the Islamic Center is located across the street from its campus), the Council on American Relations (CAIR), The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC), The Islamic Society of North America, The American Muslim Council, and all interfaith organizations in the greater Sacramento area including Celebration of Abraham (A local Yolo County interfaith organization, of which the Islamic Center of Davis is a member). “I commend Mrs. Shireen Qudosi, the Director of Muslim Matters at America Matters for starting a petition urging the Islamic Center of Davis to terminate Mr. Shahin’s employment.” Note: the website of the Islamic Center of Davis lists Mr. Ammar Shahin as the sole Imam of said mosque.
07.20.2017	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement following the announcement by the California’s Department of Conservation that SoCalGas can resume injections of natural gas into the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility: SoCalGas is going to begin injecting additional natural gas into the Aliso Canyon storage facility, the site of the world’s largest methane leak. “They refuse to commit to subsurface safety valves. Not now. Not later. “One of the tragic ironies of the Aliso Canyon leak is that the broken well, SS25, had previously been equipped with a subsurface safety valve that was removed in 1979 and never replaced. “The state should require deep subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all active wells at subsurface natural gas storage facilities. “They insist on using Aliso Canyon as the ‘Too Big To Fail’ lynchpin of natural gas storage. So if there’s a future problem at Aliso Canyon, residents of Porter Ranch will be told that operations must continue or all of Southern California will be without natural gas. “No one natural gas storage facility should be so large that its closure can adversely affect the statewide economy or cause a significant portion of the state to be without heating, cooking, or electricity. “Just because California’s standards for the storage of natural gas are stronger than those in other states or the federal government, does not mean they are sufficient.” Background: Sherman’s home was as close as any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.
07.18.2017	Washington, D.C. – The House Appropriations Committee approved the FY 2018 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill that includes $2 million in funding for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement and $4 million in funding for the development of the U.S.-Israel Energy Center. In April, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) led a bipartisan group of 102 members of Congress in sending a letter to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development requesting funding for these programs (to view the letter click here.) Sherman wrote the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act which was enacted in 2007. “This is the highest level of funding for joint U.S-Israel energy programs in our countries’ histories. Funding these two programs will further assist our countries in achieving energy independence, and will improve our environment and national security,” Sherman said. “When people think of Israel, they think of tsuris, but what they should think of is science,” said Sherman. “In the past, when someone heard that something big had happened in Israel, they may have asked: where was the terrorist attack and how many people died? In the future, when somebody hears that something big has happened in Israel, they will ask: what did the Israelis invent and how many lives will it save?” Background: To date, the U.S. government has provided $15.7 million for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement, matched dollar-for-dollar by the Israeli government. The program has already leveraged over $37 million in private sector investment. This is a competitive grant program for early-stage companies that is designed to connect the U.S. and Israeli private sectors. Its mandate was expanded in 2014 to cover collaborative Research and Development (R&D) into renewable technologies, natural gas, and water – key areas of interest for the United States. Funding for the U.S.-Israel Energy Center (“Center of Excellence”) will bring to fruition a project that Congress, the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Government of Israel have worked on for the past two years. The Center of Excellence will include joint R&D and academic and technology transfer ventures in areas such as thermal power, wastewater treatment, desalination, clean energy, produced water, natural gas, and protection of critical infrastructure through cyber security.
07.13.2017	Sherman Oaks, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) sent a letter to the Department of Conservation (DOC) advocating for improvements to the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR)’s proposed regulations of natural gas storage facilities in California. Sherman is urging DOGGR to add even stronger regulations to their current proposals. First, he urges the requirement of deep subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all active wells at subsurface natural gas storage facilities. Second, the state must address the “too big to fail, too big to exist” issue by mandating that when any major metropolitan area is reliant on one facility for over 25% of its power, additional gas storage facilities be developed. From October 23, 2015, to February 18, 2016, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest methane gas leak in U.S. history. Sherman states in his letter, “My family lives about as close as any to the source of the leak. The leak continued for nearly four months. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate because they experienced adverse health symptoms. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.” Sherman’s proposed changes include: Proposed Changes Subsurface Valves One of the tragic ironies of the Aliso Canyon leak is that the broken well, SS25, had previously been equipped with a subsurface safety valve that was removed in 1979 and never replaced. Subsurface safety valves can protect against ruptures along the length of the well where valves located at the surface would be insufficient. Moreover, subsurface safety valves with “positive pressure” ensure that if there is any interruption of pressure (due to a malfunction, earthquake, power outage, etc.) subsurface safety valves will close. This would add an additional layer of protection to the current proposed tubing and casing requirements. The state should require deep subsurface positive-pressure safety valves on all active wells at subsurface natural gas storage facilities. Only permanently sealed wells should be excluded. Too Big To Fail Additionally, there must be a commitment to address the overdependence upon very large natural gas storage facilities like Aliso Canyon, a problem endemic in the state’s natural gas storage system. The residents of Porter Ranch, many of whom remain engaged in a legal battle with So Cal Gas over injuries suffered during the blowout, are currently being told that injections must resume at Aliso Canyon or we run the risk of blackouts to the entire Los Angeles metropolitan area. There should be a more redundant natural gas storage system. The state should mandate that when any major metropolitan area is reliant on one facility for over 25% of its power, other facilities are developed. So by the implementation deadline, none of our major metropolitan areas should be dependent on any one facility for more than 25% of its natural gas storage. Implementation Deadlines I recognize that neither of these recommendations can be implemented immediately. The foregoing two standards should be implemented by 2025, or another date that the Department of Conservation determines to be appropriate. Then California residents would have proof that the State is doing everything in its power to ensure that a disaster like Aliso Canyon never happens again.
07.12.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), joined by Congressman Al Green (D-TX), introduced an Article of Impeachment (H. Res. 438) against President Donald J. Trump for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. The Article is based on Article 1, dealing with “Obstruction of Justice,” which was passed by the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan vote on July 27, 1974, regarding Richard M. Nixon. Sherman circulated a draft Article on June 12, 2017, and has been conferring with colleagues and legal experts from around the country since then. Click HERE to see Congressmen Al Green and Brad Sherman’s press conference on Impeachment on June 7, 2017. Statement of Congressman Brad Sherman I am pleased that Congressman Al Green (D-TX) has joined me in filing Articles of Impeachment against Donald J. Trump. We now begin the effort to force the House Judiciary Committee to hold hearings on Obstruction of Justice and Russian interference in our election. Recent disclosures by Donald Trump Jr. indicate that Trump’s campaign was eager to receive assistance from Russia. It now seems likely that the President had something to hide when he tried to curtail the investigation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and the wider Russian probe. I believe his conversations with, and subsequent firing of, FBI Director James Comey constitute Obstruction of Justice. Every day Democrats, Republicans, and the entire world are shocked by the latest example of America’s amateur President. Ignorance accompanied by a refusal to learn. Lack of impulse control, accompanied by a refusal to have his staff control his impulses. We’re no longer surprised by any action, no matter how far below the dignity of the office—and no matter how dangerous to the country. But the Constitution does not provide for the removal of a President for impulsive, ignorant incompetence. It does provide for the removal of a President for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. As the investigations move forward, additional evidence supporting additional Articles of Impeachment may emerge. However, as to Obstruction of Justice, as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (b)(3), the evidence we have is sufficient to move forward now. And the national interest requires that we do so. Introducing Articles of Impeachment will have two possible outcomes. First, I have slight hope it will inspire an ‘intervention’ in the White House. If Impeachment is real, if they actually see Articles, perhaps we will see incompetency replaced by care. Perhaps uncontrollable impulses will be controlled. And perhaps the danger our nation faces will be ameliorated. Second, and more likely, filing Articles of Impeachment is the first step on a very long road. But if the impulsive incompetency continues, then eventually—many, many months from now—Republicans will join the impeachment effort. I author Articles of Impeachment not to change our national policy. I served with Mike Pence in Congress for twelve years and I disagree with him on just about everything. I never dreamed I would author a measure that would put him in the White House. I am introducing Articles of Impeachment to begin a long process to protect our country from abuse of power, obstruction of justice, and impulsive, ignorant incompetence.”​ Click HERE to see the Article of Impeachment (H. Res. 438) filed by Congressman Brad Sherman and co-sponsored by Congressman Al Green (D-TX).
07.10.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that financial institutions, such as Wells Fargo, will no longer be allowed to force consumers to use arbitration to settle group disputes. Currently, banks and credit card companies insert arbitration clauses in their contracts to prevent customers from filing class-action lawsuits in the case of wrongdoing. This practice often discourages consumers from filing lawsuits because of the necessary expense of time, money, and effort. On March 7, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) Ranking Member on the Senate Banking Committee introduced the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act. The legislation would prevent Wells Fargo from using forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of contracts of legitimate accounts to stop customers from suing over fraudulently opened accounts. From at least 2011 to 2015, Wells Fargo opened millions of fake accounts in its customers’ names. Now, Wells Fargo is using mandatory arbitration clauses to prevent these customers from getting their day in court. “The CFPB’s arbitration rule is great news for consumers looking to open a bank account in the future. But, to ensure that millions of defrauded Wells Fargo customers have their day in court, Congress must pass the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act,” said Congressman Sherman. “If customers did not authorize the opening of a phony credit card or checking account, there is no reason they should be bound by an arbitration agreement they signed when they set up a legitimate account.”
06.30.2017	Sherman Oaks - On Thursday evening, over 5,000 Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the district called in and participated in a two-way conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed constituents’ questions and concerns on a wide variety of topics, including health care, student loan debt, U.S. foreign policy in North Korea, infrastructure funding, the environment, and more. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to constituents,” said Sherman. “These types of Town Halls allow me to easily interact with thousands of Valley residents. With Donald Trump in the White House my constituents have more questions than ever. Residents across the Valley are understandably concerned about the state of affairs in the White House, and voiced that opinion throughout the event.” Sherman’s next Town Hall Meeting will take place Sunday, August 20th from 3:00 to 4:30 PM at Reseda High School. Last April, he held a Town Hall at the same location attended by 1,300 Valley residents. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, he elicited the input of his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: Should the House Judiciary Committee hold hearings to debate whether or not to impeach President Trump? Yes: 62% No: 22% Undecided: 16% Do you agree with President Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord? Yes: 13% No: 80% Undecided: 7% Republicans in the House and Senate have introduced legislation to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Which statement best describes you opinion of these proposals? Obamacare is working, but some changes ought to be made: 84% We must fully repeal and replace Obamacare: 12% No Opinion: 4% Do you support the legislative agenda of the National Rifle Association? Strongly Support: 14% Not So Much: 82% No Opinion: 4% Do you support the legislative agenda of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence? Strongly Support: 72% Not So Much: 11% No Opinion: 17% Do you support the legislative agenda of the AFL-CIO? Strongly Support: 36% Not So Much: 18% No Opinion: 46% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct constituents to his district office (818) 501-9200 for further assistance in regards to personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the ninety-minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail.
06.12.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today Congressman Brad Sherman, a twenty-year veteran of the House, circulated an Article of Impeachment to all Members of the House, Democrat and Republican, seeking their input and support. Sherman said, “as set forth in my letter to my colleagues: As the investigations move forward, additional evidence supporting additional Articles of Impeachment may emerge. However, as to Obstruction of Justice and 18 U.S.C. § 1512 (b)(3), the evidence we have is sufficient to move forward now. And the national interest requires that we do so.” Sherman continued, “I act not for partisan advantage. Having served with Mike Pence in the House for twelve years, I disagree with him on most issues of public policy. But we must move forward as quickly as possible to ensure a competent government that respects the Constitution and the rule of law, even if we end up with a President who is effective and dedicated to regressive policies.” Sherman concluded, “I have no illusions. Articles of Impeachment will not pass the House in the near future. But given the risk posed to the Republic, we should move things forward as quickly as possible.” View the Draft Article of Impeachment: here. View my Dear Colleague: here.
06.09.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, released the following statement in response to the House of Representatives passage of the CHOICE Act: The Republican Financial CHOICE Act is a highly partisan bill that guts consumer protections and will put America at risk of another economic meltdown. This bill aims to wipe out the policies Congress put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, prioritizing the profits of Wall Street over the needs of hard-working American families. "The Financial CHOICE Act does contain some good provisions. In fact, it includes twelve bills which have passed the Committee with strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, these twelve bills are held hostage, buried in a pharmacy of poison pills. I hope we can work in a bipartisan way to address concerns raised by our community financial institutions and improve financial regulation in this country.”
06.07.2017	Washington, DC – Recent events require members of the House of Representatives to consider whether President Donald J. Trump should be impeached. This matter needs to be analyzed regarding preserving the constitutional rule of law.

05.23.2017	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), who worked with former U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer and others in securing federal funds for the new northbound lane on the 405 freeway, issued the following statement on the 3-year anniversary of the opening of the new lane: “The success of this project is more evident than ever. With lower gas prices and increased employment, there are now more cars on the road than ever before. If we hadn’t built the lane, travel through the Sepulveda pass would be far worse. A study from last year showed that without the new lane, motorists would spend 6,000 more hours each day creeping through the Sepulveda Pass.[1] “Los Angeles voters voted to increase the local sales tax to finance dozens of projects, most notably the Sepulveda Pass subway. The project can be built sooner with an infusion of federal dollars. If President Trump is truly committed to improving America’s infrastructure, I can think of no greater place to start than with the nation’s most congested roadway.” Background: Congressman Brad Sherman and his colleagues were instrumental in securing funding for these projects at both the state and federal level. In 1998, Sherman secured federal funds for planning improvements to the Sepulveda Pass bottleneck. In 2003, Senator Barbara Boxer, and Congressman Brad Sherman worked together to secure a $117 million federal earmark to construct an additional northbound lane on the 405 Freeway. Sherman and then Congressman Howard Berman both testified for the 405 project on April 1, 2003, before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee. Sherman lobbied his colleagues intensely until the final bill was passed in July of 2005. Sherman then worked with several prominent advocates of the project, including Mayor Villaraigosa and Supervisor Gloria Molina (then Chair of the Metro Board), to secure $614 million in state bond funding. On February 20, 2007, Congressman Sherman traveled to Sacramento with Mayor Villaraigosa and local officials in a successful effort to persuade the California Transportation Commission to provide $614 million, the largest piece of the project’s funding. Sherman was the only member of Congress to testify at this critical hearing of the California Transportation Commission. [1] I-405 Spevulda Pass Improvements Project Evaluation, May 26, 2016
05.09.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), released the following statement in response to yesterday’s Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the ongoing investigation into possible collusion between Russia and Donald Trump’s presidential campaign: On January 26, Donald Trump learned that his National Security Advisor, Former General Michael Flynn, had indeed talked to the Russian Ambassador about sanctions against Russia. Since Flynn had previously lied about these conversations to the administration and the American people, Russia could have blackmailed him by threatening to publish the transcripts or tapes of the phone calls. Yet Trump retained Flynn as his National Security Advisor knowing that he was subject to Russian blackmail and we have every reason to believe that Flynn would have continued to hold his job had additional events not transpired. On February 9, the Washington Post reported that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian Ambassador, contrary to his repeated statements. Only after the Administration was embarrassed, was Flynn fired.Trump was happy to have a National Security Advisor who was potentially subject to Russian blackmail and had lied to the American people. For Trump, the unforgivable sin was embarrassing the Administration, and that did not occur until on February 9th. Trump did not attack Flynn for lying, but he did attack the Washington Post for telling the truth.”
04.24.2017	Sherman Oaks – Over the weekend, Congressman Brad Sherman hosted a Valley Town Hall at Reseda High School. An overflow crowd of over 1,300 people was in attendance at the Valley’s largest High School auditorium to listen to Sherman answer questions covering health care, social security, foreign policy, and many questions surrounding President Donald Trump. In the crowd were a few Trump supporters, but the vast majority of attendees ranged from those against Trump to those vehemently against Trump. Sherman invited several local elected officials including L.A. County Assessor Jeffrey Prang, L.A. City Councilmember Bob Blumenfield, and L.A. City Controller Ron Galperin who all spoke about the work they're doing to offset some of what Trump is doing in Washington. Sherman’s next Town Hall will be a Facebook Live Town Hall on Wednesday, May 24 at 7 PM PDT. The event will give participants the opportunity to hear from Sherman from Washington, more information can be found at Sherman’s Facebook page.
04.24.2017	Washington, D.C. – In recognition of the anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 1915, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has called on the Administration and Congress to recognize this tragic event properly: In 1915 the Ottoman government began implementing its plans to expunge the Armenian people from its territory – an event which meets all the definitions of the word ‘genocide.’ An estimated one and a half million people perished. I have called on Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, and now call on President Trump and my colleagues in the House and Senate to recognize the genocide formally – we cannot afford to wait. I am disappointed that no recent President or Congress has given the Armenian genocide appropriate recognition. Genocide denial is the last act of genocide and the first step in the next genocide. 102 years since the first acts of the Armenian genocide, it is our duty to honor and dignify those who lost their lives, to pay respect to their living relatives, and to ensure that these horrible events never happen again.” Today, Sherman signed a letter, along with 84 colleagues, to President Trump demanding that the Administration mark April 24 as a day of American remembrance of the Armenian Genocide.
04.21.2017	VAN NUYS – As taxpayers rushed to file last-minute returns by tonight’s midnight deadline, Congressman Brad Sherman is helping Californians uncover over $250 million in old refunds that are just waiting to be delivered to over 97,000 Californians. Nationwide there’s an estimated $3 billion in unclaimed refunds for the 2013 to 2015 tax years. Three individuals each stand to receive more than $150,000. Last year, the California FTB could not locate thousands of taxpayers due refunds – refunds which remain undelivered. In Los Angeles County, those taxpayer refunds average more than $600. “Tax refunds belong in your pocket, not stowed in a cob-webbed corner of a dark safe at the IRS,” Sherman said at a press conference outside the IRS offices in the San Fernando Valley. “If there is any chance you have an unclaimed refund, check our website to see if you’re on the list.” How to Get Your Refund For more information about how to claim an undelivered or unclaimed tax refund, visit my website at BradSherman.house.gov. Trump’s Tax Returns Sherman also addressed the ongoing controversies surrounding the disclosure of President Donald Trump’s tax returns and all the business entities he controls. Trump is the first president since President Richard Nixon to refuse to release his tax information to the public. We cannot know if Donald Trump is indebted to Russian oligarchs or Russian banks without seeing his tax returns. And we cannot evaluate Trump’s tax reform proposals without knowing how it will affect him. He has already made one proposal, repeal of the Estate Tax, which would save his family over $1 billion, increase the national debt by $270 billion—all while saving not one cent for any couple with assets under $11 million. “In 2011, Mr. Trump said he would release his tax returns if he ran for president, yet the American people are still in the dark on what conflicts of interest this President is hiding,” Sherman said. In Congress, Sherman has voted once a week (six times) to bring resolutions to the House floor that would force Trump to release his tax returns. Sherman is a Certified Public Accountant. Before he was elected to Congress in 1996, Sherman was chairman of the California State Board of Equalization; the nation’s only elected tax commission and America’s second largest tax agency. BACKGROUND Unclaimed Refunds “Unclaimed Refunds” refers to people who never filed their tax returns, but would get a refund if they did. For folks who have not filed, the law allows a three-year window for claiming a return before that money becomes the property of the US Treasury. Refunds totaling over $3 billion may be waiting for Americans who did not file a federal income tax return for 2013, 2014 and 2015. In California, there is an estimated $250 million in unclaimed refunds. Many people don’t file returns because they had too little income to require filing a tax return, even though they had income and /or social security taxes withheld from their wages. However many of these people are due significant refunds. Many low-and-moderate income workers qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which can be worth more than $6,000. So even if you had zero federal income tax withheld from your paycheck, you may be entitled to a refund. “I encourage all eligible workers to file a return, said Sherman. “This is your money, and you should take advantage of it.” Extending the April 18th Deadline If you need extra time to prepare your return, you can file a 6-month extension using IRS form 4868 and California FTB form 3519. Your new deadline to file personal income tax returns with the IRS and the California FTB will be Monday, October 16, 2017.

04.07.2017	Sherman Oaks –Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee released the following statement in response to Syrian chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun and the American response on Shayrat Air Base. “We should have three goals in Syria: Protect the Syrian people Destroy ISIS Preserve the Chemical Weapons Convention that bans poison gas and chemical weapons. “All while limiting the risks of U.S. causalities or a wider war with Russia. “Our recent attack was a reasonable and prudent effort to achieve the third objective. Assad must realize that his use of illegal weapons will not further his objectives. Other tyrants will realize there is a heavy price to pay for employing chemical weapons. “Even if we stop Assad from using chemical weapons, this will do only a little to protect the Syrian people. Only a very small portion of the nearly 500,000 civilian deaths caused by Assad resulted from his use of chemicals. “Since the House adopted the Sherman amendment on July 7, 2011, I have been a leader in protecting the role of Congress in authorizing the use of force. However it seems that, under the War Powers Act, the President could undertake yesterday's action without congressional authorization. In contrast, Obama's many months of bombing Libya without a congressional AUMF (Authorization for Use of Military Force) probably did violate the War Powers Act. “We owe a debt to President Obama. Under his leadership 1,300 tons of chemical weapons agents were turned over by Assad to international authorities and destroyed in 2013-2014.” ###
04.05.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, joined Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA) in introducing legislation to increase transparency for homeowners who take out loans to make environmentally-focused home improvements. The bipartisan Protecting Americans from Credit Entanglements Act of 2017, or PACE Act, amends the Truth in Lending Act, to ensure that PACE lenders are subject to the same basic disclosure requirements that apply to traditional lenders, including providing to consumers the annual percentage rate, a schedule of payments, and the total cost of the loan. Homeowners will also be notified that they will be taking a lien on their home. "PACE programs provide an important source of financing for consumers looking to make energy-efficient changes to their homes. But the current process presents homeowners with many challenges and can result in homeowners being misled about the terms of their loan,” said Congressman Sherman. “We must ensure that homeowners concerned with promoting energy efficiency, conservation, and a cleaner environment are given the tools to be successful.” Very similar legislation was introduced in the California Legislature and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on September 25, 2016.
03.13.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, the Congressional Budget Office released its report on the House Republicans’ health care plan. Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement in response to the report: The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) Director was handpicked by former Republican Speaker John Boehner, and recommended by Republican Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price. Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) is chaired by Republican Congressman Kevin Brady and Republican Senator Orrin Hatch. “By 2018, according to the report issued by the CBO and the JCT, 14 million Americans will lose health care coverage as a result of the House Republicans plan to make America sick again. By 2026, the Republican plan will increase the number of uninsured by 24 million compared to current law. “Additionally, the Republican plan will increase average premiums over the next three years, and will substantially raise premiums for older Americans. “Republicans can’t run from the facts or create alternative ones. The proof is in the report.”
03.07.2017	Sherman Oaks, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement after the passing of Congressman Tony Beilenson. “I was saddened to learn of the passing of Congressman Tony Beilenson. He was a champion for our area and will be remembered for his ability to debate tough issues of the greatest controversy and importance with civility and respect. “It is fitting that Tony left Congress just as partisanship and gridlock began to be such pervasive problems in Washington in the late 1990s. Nevertheless, far beyond his bi-partisan spirit, he left an incredible legacy in Congress and in Southern California. I was fortunate to succeed him in the House to represent the San Fernando Valley and, at that time, Malibu, the Las Virgenes area and the Conejo Valley. “I was honored to have his support, friendship, and advice. He had an incredibly dedicated staff that helped thousands of his constituents over the years, and I was very luck to inherit some of those people when I first came to Congress. “He was a liberal champion for women’s choice and the environment nationally. Californians and people from across the country owe Tony a great deal – and they can literally see it every time they drive up the PCH. He was essential to the creation of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which is the most frequently visited national park in the country. I was pleased to continue his efforts to acquire and set aside parkland in the Santa Monicas and elsewhere. Without his efforts we would not have all the open space we currently enjoy in the Mountains, the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, and other places. “Tony’s character and intellect were so respected that his colleagues made him the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee. He was also a very humble man. When we dedicated Anthony C. Beilenson Park in the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area, in 1998, he went out of his way to give credit to so many others that had helped bring about that park and said he was embarrassed by the honor. “I was pleased to be with Tony in 2012 when we dedicated the visitor center of the Santa Monica Mountains Natural Recreation Center. The Santa Monica Mountains Anthony C. Beilenson Interagency Visitor Center will continue to teach Southern Californians about our environment and the need to protect it. “My condolences go out to his friends and relatives, especially Dolores, Adam, Peter, Dayna and grandchildren.”
03.07.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), senior member of the Financial Services Committee and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) Ranking Member on the Senate Banking Committee introduced the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act. Joining Sherman in introducing the House bill are Ranking Member of the House Financial Services Committee Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee Congressman John Conyers (D-MI). The legislation would prevent Wells Fargo from using forced arbitration clauses in the fine print of contracts of legitimate accounts to prevent customers from suing over fraudulently opened accounts. From at least 2011 to 2015 Wells Fargo opened millions of fake accounts (two million bank accounts including 565,000 credit card accounts) in its customers’ names. Now Wells Fargo is preventing these customers from seeking justice in court through mandatory arbitration clauses. “I want to thank Senate Banking Committee Ranking Member Sherrod Brown for working with me to introduce the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act. This bill will give defrauded Wells Fargo customers the opportunity for their day in court,” said Congressman Sherman. “If customers never authorized the opening of a phony credit card or checking account, there is no reason they should be bound by the arbitration agreement they were forced to sign when they set up a legitimate account.” “Forced arbitration is shielding Wells Fargo from being held accountable for harming its customers, directly and indirectly,” said Sen. Brown. “Wells Fargo’s customers never agreed to sign away their right to fight back against fraud and deceit. We need to give customers back their ability to seek justice in court so they can be made whole again.” The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Patty Murray (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Jack Reed (D-RI), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Robert Casey (D-PA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Mark Warner (D-VA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Al Franken (D-MN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). The bill is cospondored by U.S. Reps: Maxine Waters (CA-43) , John Conyers (MI-13), Hank Johnson (GA-4), Suzanne Bonamici (OR-1), Steve Cohen (TN-9), Matt Cartwright (PA-17), Raul Grijalva (AZ-3), Colleen Hanabusa (HI-1), Sheila Jackson-Lee (TX-18), Pramila Jayapal (WA-7), Ted Lieu (CA-33), Zoe Lofgren (CA-19), Stephen Lynch (MA-8), Sean Patrick Maloney (NY-18), Eleanor Holmes Norton (DC-AL), Donald Payne Jr. (NJ-10), Jamie Raskin (MD-8), Rep. Jan Schakowsky (IL-9). The bill has been endorsed by Americans for Financial Reform, Public Citizen, NAACP, American Association for Justice, Allied Progress, Center for Responsible Lending, Economic Policy Institute Policy Center, California Reinvestment Coalition, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, National Consumers League, Public Justice, Franciscan Action Network, Media Voices for Children, Woodstock Institute, Tennessee Citizen Action, National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income clients), National Association of Consumer Advocates, The Impact Fund, Consumer Watchdog, Alliance for Justice, Workplace Fairness, Homeowners Against Deficient Dwellings, Consumer Action, Consumers Union, and Communications Workers of America (CWA).
03.02.2017	Washington, D.C. – Six weeks ago, Congressman Brad Sherman first called for a Special Counsel in a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. See his letter from January 13, 2017. On January 16, Lynch denied Sherman’s request in an interview with MSNBC: Host Tamron Hall: “Congressman Brad Sherman from California, senior Foreign Affairs member, that sent a letter to you asking for a special counsel to be appointed to investigate Russia’s interference in this election four days before the inauguration of Donald Trump, will you be able to name or appoint a special counsel to investigate Russia’s interference in our election?” Lynch: [No.] Right now the matter is being handled by the career agents and lawyers in the Department of Justice and the bureau. I have the utmost confidence in them. Now, Congressman Darrell Issa has called for a special prosecutor to look into Russian involvement in the 2016 Presidential election. While Congressmen Kevin McCarthy, Jason Chaffetz, and many other top Republicans are calling for Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from any investigation. “Sessions must recuse himself from any investigation involving Russia’s involvement in 2016 presidential election. And it’s not enough to assign this investigation to a Deputy Attorney General who works with Sessions every day,” said Sherman. “So I am renewing my call for a Special Counsel to investigate the matter.” Sherman continued, “Even if Sessions resigns, Trump’s new Attorney General cannot provide the independent investigation the public rightfully demands. Only independent Special Counsel will have the independence to determine whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russian intelligence.”
03.01.2017	Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, joined Congressman Peter King (R-NY) in introducing legislation which aims to protect the safety and security of America’s credit unions. The bipartisan Capital Access for Small Businesses and Jobs Act would repair a 1998 bill that discourages credit unions from continuing to grow to meet community demand and enhance their ability to react to economic conditions. “This bipartisan legislation simply gets the government out of the way, allowing credit unions to expand consumer access to their affordable financial services while improving the overall safety and soundness of the credit union system,” said Sherman. “The bill makes a simple fix to current law to boost economic growth without spending a dime of taxpayer dollars or adding to the deficit.” “Credit unions are a vital source of affordable financial services and provide access to capital to small businesses across the country,” said King. “This legislation ensures that credit unions can grow and continue to serve their communities.” Credit unions, which currently serve nearly 110 million Americans, are not-for-profit and locally owned and managed by members. This Act would give those credit unions access to additional forms of capital to help them weather economic downturns.
02.17.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement in response to the deadly terrorist attack on a Sufi shrine in Pakistan’s Sindh Province, ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack on peaceful religious gatherers: “My sympathies are with the peaceful Sufi worshipers and the people of Sindh, who were attacked at the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar shrine in Sehwan on Thursday. The shrine, dedicated to the Saint Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, is an important site for the Sufi faith and attracts many thousands of pilgrims each year. “Including today’s attack, over a hundred innocent Pakistanis were killed in multiple attacks around the country this week. “As the Chairman of the Sindh Caucus and Ranking Member of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am well aware of the proliferation of terrorist organizations within Pakistan, and the need for more concerted efforts to combat terrorism in South Asia. “I know that we will continue to work with Pakistan to combat terrorism. We should especially support those in Pakistan that are most affected by terror and those forces in Pakistan that are on the front lines of our efforts to defeat militant groups. “However, Pakistan’s intelligence services have for too long supported some terrorist organizations while combating others. It is impossible to get a handle on fanatical and violent groups when you play this double game. Unfortunately, we have a situation where ISIS can operate within Pakistan and carry out attacks as it did this week.”
02.15.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Sherman released the following statement in response to President Donald Trump’s comments on a one-state solution between Israelis and the Palestinians: “Today’s comments by Donald Trump regarding Israel show that he is dangerously uninformed and professedly undecided. “There is no viable solution to the conflict other than a two-state solution. “I don't know what formulation President Trump believes he can get the Israelis as well as the Palestinians to agree to short of an independent Palestinian state, but suffice it to say that a single state that encompasses all of the Palestinians, as well as Israel, will not be Jewish and democratic for long. One-state solutions are either delusional or dangerous. “Nobody believes that a two-state solution will be easy to bring about. It has eluded successive administrations since the Oslo process began in the early 1990s. But given the demographic realities, and the desire for Israel to be a pluralistic democratic homeland for the Jewish people, there is no other option but two states for two peoples. “The now-deceased Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi once proposed a one-state solution he coined “Isratine,” by which was his proposal to eventually end the Jewish state. Now, President Trump stated that he could “live with” a one-state solution; this would be the end of the Jewish and democratic state as we know it. “The problem is not solved without a legal status for Gaza and any one-state solution including Gaza is not a Jewish state.”
02.15.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement: “The American people deserve to know the truth. The firing of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn is just the tip of the iceberg. “A now famous 35-page dossier on President Trump compiled by Christopher Steele alleged that Trump’s attorney Michael Cohen met with Russian officials in Prague in August. Cohen tweeted the front of his passport in an attempt to prove that the meeting never happened, which is incredibly unconvincing. Even the inside of the passport would not bare a Czech Republic stamp if Cohen first flew to most any other European country. “I am renewing my request for the appointment of a Special Counsel to specifically focus on whether this meeting happened in Prague. Also, we’ve now learned that U.S. intelligence is aware of conversations between Trump’s staff and Russian officials, Congress, in a classified setting, must be able to read the transcripts of those conversations to the extent available. The key issue here is whether the Trump campaign coordinated or encouraged: Russian government paid operatives to work on trumps behalf posting comments and “fake news.” the cyber burglary of John Podesta and DNC “The continued release of information about Russia’s cyber-burglary of the DNC and the potential for Russian collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia could be the beginning of Watergate 2.0.”
02.08.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman, who lives about as close as anyone to the Porter Ranch gas leak site, issued the following statement following the announcement of the Aliso Canyon gas leak settlement: “Today the Southern California Air Quality Management District (AQMD) announced a settlement under which SoCal Gas will pay $8.5 million to cover costs associated with the massive blow out at their Aliso Canyon facility last year, resulting in the largest methane leak in US history. “The settlement calls for SoCal Gas to pay $8.5 million, but only one million of that sum will be spent on the health study to determine the full extent of injuries caused by the leak. “An appropriate study of the injuries caused, and particularly the long-term effects caused by the methane leak cannot be completed for one million dollars. One million dollars is enough for a whitewash that declares that everyone is fine and no one should bother SoCal Gas again. “After SoCal Gas covers the costs of current air quality monitoring and AQMD’s legal fees, the remaining approximately $6.65 million should be entirely dedicated to fund a truly thorough health study. If the initial health study can be completed for less and does not show a need for a follow-up study, only then should the remaining funds be used for other purposes. “Those affected by the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history deserve answers about the leak’s long-term health impacts, and a fully-funded health study remains the best hope for obtaining such answers. “The settlement from the massive gas leak should help the victims first. Only when we are sure that we have studied, and done follow-up studies to help the victims in the North Valley, should AQMD consider using funds elsewhere. “I am disappointed that it has taken SoCalGas more than a year since the January 26, 2016, AQMD Order of Abatement only to reach a settlement that now under- funds the health study. In the meantime, the residents of Porter Ranch have continued to suffer from unexplained nosebleeds, headaches and other symptoms[1].” [1] On February 6, 2017, the Los Angeles Daily News reported anecdotal information from Porter Ranch physician Dr. Jeffrey Nordella, who “said he’s seeing abnormal pulmonary functions among some of [the almost 50 patients he’s followed since last year’s Aliso Canyon natural gas leak] and low red blood cell counts in others.
02.07.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, joined Congressman Mark Sanford (R-SC) in introducing legislation that would permanently prohibit the use of guarantee fees (g-fees) as a budget offset. The bipartisan Risk Management and Homeowner Stability Act, would add a section to the Budget Act of 1974 permanently prohibiting the use of g-fees to offset unrelated spending. Government-sponsored enterprises, like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, buy mortgages from lenders and bundle them into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that they then sell. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee the payment of the principal and interest on these securities and charge g-fees on mortgage lenders in order to protect against losses from faulty home loans. “Past proposals have attempted to use g-fees to pay for unrelated government spending on the backs of homeowners,” said Sherman. “G-fees are a critical risk management tool, and they should continue to be used only for that purpose.” Typically lenders pass on the cost of these g-fees to consumers, so the use of these fees for anything other than their intended purpose amounts to a tax on homebuyers. “Using g-fees to pay for unrelated spending means that homeowners become a de facto national piggy-bank for Congress, which neither works for the taxpayer nor the homeowner. This bill simply ensures that the promise that came when these fees were created is the promise kept,” said Sanford.
02.02.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, will join the following Subcommittees for the 115th Congress: (1) Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment; (2) Housing and Insurance; (3) Monetary Policy and Trade. “Just this week President Trump doubled down on his plan to dismantle Dodd-Frank calling it a disaster, I will be a strong opponent of Republican rollbacks of consumer protection,” Sherman said. The Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment Subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Securities and Exchange Commission and all capital market activities. On Housing and Insurance, Sherman will oversee home mortgages, homeless assistance, and insurance. Sherman’s third Subcommittee, Monetary Policy, and Trade will have oversight of interest rates and the Export-Import Bank. Sherman was among the leaders behind the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, which protects consumers from unfair banking and lending practices, such as deceptive overdraft practices. In 2009, he helped successfully defeat a Treasury Department proposal that would have put taxpayers permanently on the hook for risky Wall Street behavior.
02.01.2017	Washington, D.C. – Tonight, the Department of Conservation’s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) will hold a public meeting regarding the well safety review at the Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility. Below is Congressman Brad Sherman’s statement prepared for delivery. Due to votes Sherman is in Washington, D.C., the statement will be delivered by staff: “SoCalGas is responsible for the largest methane leak in U.S. history. Now they want to resume injections into the storage facility before the investigation into the cause of the leak is complete. This confirms my concern that the “too big to fail, too big to exist” issue at Aliso Canyon remains unresolved. “No one natural gas storage facility should be so large that its closure can adversely affect the statewide economy or cause a significant portion of the state to be without heating, cooking, or electricity. And yet, the residents of Porter Ranch, many of whom remain engaged in a legal battle with SoCalGas over injuries suffered during last year’s blowout, are now being told that injections must resume at Aliso Canyon or else run the risk of blackouts throughout the Los Angeles region. “California should mandate that when any metropolitan area like Los Angeles is too reliant on one facility for all of its power, other facilities should be developed. I am encouraged by the state’s efforts to build a more diversified grid and maximize the use of battery technology in order to alleviate dependence on Aliso Canyon. But these efforts have not eliminated the current need for alternative facilities. “We must proceed with extreme caution. Until the strongest possible safety measures are in place and the case of the 2015 leak is fully understood, the Aliso Canyon facility should operate at the minimum usage necessary to ensure reliability for the Los Angeles region. “We are informed that of the 114 wells, 79 have been temporarily sealed and 34 have passed a series of testing. You should not consider giving SoCalGas what they want now – unless you also act simultaneously to require the expeditious implementation of the toughest, reasonable mandatory safety standards, including deep sub-surface safety valves. “Additionally, each well should have appropriate live gauges and monitors that report their findings electronically for utilities, state officials, and the public online. "I look forward to working together to improve the safety at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility so that a disaster like this never happens again to my constituents in the San Fernando Valley or anywhere else.”
01.30.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement regarding President Donald Trump’s controversial travel ban that was signed on January 27, 2017: The President’s executive order on travel and the refugee program is largely unconstitutional, immoral, and is ineffective. What is particularly outrageous is that the order was applied to people who are legal permanent residents of the United States, commonly called “green card holders.” The order was drafted in such a way that it could, but need not, be read to apply to these people, many of whom have been in the United States for years, have already been vetted, have jobs, businesses, families, and lives in the United States. When officials at the DHS wisely decided that it should not be applied to green card holders, they were reportedly overruled by presidential advisor Steve Bannon. Unless the well-documented reports[1] are untrue, Bannon should be fired. I also call on the appropriate committees to hold hearings on this fiasco and for legislative action to reverse the executive order, even if it faces a veto. While last night the DHS stated that the order will no longer apply to legal permanent residents and that those people will be allowed into the country, many had been detained at airports over the weekend for as many as 20 hours, and not provided access to counsel. Many others decided not to travel back to the U.S. given the uncertain welcome that awaited them. So Bannon’s decision was even more extreme than current Trump administration policy. Most people working on counterterrorism policy inside and out of our government would never recommend this bar on visitors or immigrants from the listed countries, or for suspending the refugee program. This is purely a political move designed to appeal to some of the worst instincts in our country. It is also a propaganda gift to our real adversaries. We should remember that this poorly worded and hastily implemented order has aggrieved many people residing legally in the United States, including U.S. citizens, not just the intended visitors and immigrants; U.S.-based family members who have worked to obtain permission for their loved ones to come to the United States will be separated from them for many more weeks and months. But the decision to apply the ban to legal permanent residents accused of no criminal activity is beyond all limits. This was Bannon’s decision and he needs to go.” [1] CNN: Inside the confusion of the Trump executive order and travel ban; https://www.cnn.com/2017/01/28/politics/donald-trump-travel-ban/
01.24.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, the second-ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, announced new Foreign Affairs Subcommittee roles for the 115th Congress. Sherman will remain the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Asia and was named the second-ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats, where he will focus on Russia and President Trump’s relationship with Russia. The Subcommittee on Asia, which has jurisdiction over foreign relations with over half the world’s population, will remain important as Congress and the Trump administration focus on the region. From this post, Sherman will tackle an array of issues including U.S.-China relations, large-scale economic policy in Asia, U.S. relations with our allies and partners in Asia, developing our critical relationship with India, and advancing our ties with countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia. “It is a great privilege to be the Ranking Member on Asia,” said Sherman. “As this administration continues to ramp up interest in Asia, I hope to help shape better trade policy and scale back the free trade agreements which have increased our trade deficit, outsourced jobs and rewarded countries that have not traded fairly with the United States.” The Europe and Eurasia Subcommittee will have jurisdiction over foreign relations concerning the post-Soviet states, in particular, Russia, and the Central Asian republics. Also, the subcommittee has oversight related to emerging foreign threats to the national security and interests of the United States. “Given President Trump’s close relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Eurasia Subcommittee will be an integral part of ensuring that the administration’s relationship with the Russian government does not threaten our nation’s security or our values,” Sherman said. Sherman is also the Chairman Emeritus on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.
01.13.2017	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement in response to his conversations and correspondence with the Government of East Timor: “In my role as Ranking Member of the Asia Pacific Subcommittee of the House of Representatives, I use every opportunity to try to persuade Asian nations to improve their voting records in the United Nations on Middle East issues. This is consistent with the goals of U.S. foreign policy and the U.S.-Israel Alliance. “I’ve had conversations directly with the Founding President and Current Prime Minister of the Southeast Asian nation Timor-Leste (East Timor) and spoken on the phone with Timor-Leste’s Foreign Minister; I have received a commitment that they will review their approach to Middle East issues. Only time will tell if this leads to appropriate actions.” Find Sherman’s letter to Prime Minister Rui Maria de Araújo following his meeting with Founding Father Xanana Gusmao and the Prime Minister here, and the Prime Minister’s response here.
01.13.2017	Washington, D.C. – Following this morning’s classified bipartisan briefing on Russian interference in U.S. Elections, Congressman Brad Sherman sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch requesting the appointment of a Special Counsel on interference with the U.S. democratic process. The purpose of the Special Counsel is to investigate whether U.S. persons encouraged or paid Russian or Eastern European hackers to cyber-burglarize American citizens and institutions, including the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, or otherwise criminally interfere with the 2016 election. Sherman sent two letters to President Barack Obama. The first on December 19, 2016, and the second on January 10, 2017. In both letters, Sherman formally requested a classified high-level Intelligence Community briefing for all House of Representatives Members regarding foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. This morning’s briefing team included the directors of the U.S. intelligence community. You can find the text of Sherman’s letter to Attorney General Lynch here and below. Additionally, you can find Sherman’s letter sent to President Obama on December 19, 2016, here, and a follow-up letter sent on January 10, 2017, here. ----- January 13, 2017 The Honorable Loretta E. Lynch Attorney General U.S. Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530 RE: Appointment of Special Counsel on Interference with the U.S. Democratic Process Dear Madam Attorney General: I am writing to request your appointment of a Special Counsel[1] on interference with the U.S. democratic process to investigate whether U.S. persons encouraged or paid Russian or Eastern European hackers to cyber-burglarize American citizens and institutions, including the Democratic National Committee and John D. Podesta, or otherwise criminally interfere with the 2016 election. Given the incoming Trump Administration’s possible lack of interest in investigating whether or not Russia interfered in our election, a Special Counsel is necessary to ensure that any American persons involved in such an effort be prosecuted if warranted. This is especially critical due to the facts in an Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) unclassified report released on January 6, 2017, that appear to confirm Russian interference. I requested from President Obama in December 2016 and January 2017 a classified high-level Intelligence Community briefing for all House of Representatives Members regarding foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections. Today, we received that briefing, but many questions are still left unanswered. In addition, I have read the classified ODNI report on Russian interference in its entirety; it is clear that this matter cannot be put to rest. The contention of foreign interference in the United States democratic process must not be ignored; this is a matter of national security and a threat to our democratic process. With a week left until the next administration takes office, it is vital that you appoint a Special Counsel that is independent of the incoming administration as soon as possible. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN Member of Congress [1] 28 C.F.R. Part 600, §§600.1 to 600.10
12.23.2016	Washington, D.C. – Today, the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), with U.S. abstention, passed a one-sided resolution on Israel’s settlement activity. Congressman Sherman, a senior Democratic Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following statement: The UNSC resolution against Israel marks an unfortunate change in U.S. policy in support of Israel at the United Nations; we vetoed a similar resolution in 2011. Opponents of Israel took advantage of America’s democratic transition to pass a resolution that the U.S. vetoed in 2011, and American would veto in the next Administration. This is a sneaky maneuver to pass a one-sided resolution on Israel just before a new Administration takes office. Yesterday, Congressman Sherman sent a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to direct the U.S. Ambassador to the UN to veto the anti-Israel resolution. Before today’s vote, Congressman Sherman spoke with New Zealand’s ambassador to the U.S., urging New Zealand to abandon its co-sponsorship of the one-sided UNSC resolution.
12.20.2016	Washington, D.C. – In a letter sent to President Barack Obama, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, requested a classified briefing for all members of the U.S. House Representatives at the start of the 115th Congress on Russian hacking, selective email leaks, falsified media reports, and other activities that affected the 2016 U.S. election. Sherman writes, “It is important that all Members can fully comprehend the potential damage these attacks may have caused to U.S. institutions and processes, and be able to properly assess policy moving forward.” “The way forward can only be decided once the severity of what happened is understood,” Sherman said. “We need to be focused on analyzing and understanding the facts rather than playing politics.” Specifically, Sherman requested that top officials of the Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and State Department, provide information on the following points: How the U.S. Intelligence Community is aware that Russia was involved in cyber-attacks on U.S. institutions and federal elections An outline of methodologies used by Russian-backed cyber attackers How we can be sure of the level of coordination between the highest levels of the Russian government and those conducting the attacks Prospective targets of future cyber attacks How Russia uses cyber-attacks on other democracies How the U.S. can respond to cyber-attacks You can view the letter here.

12.14.2016	Sherman Oaks, CA – Following through on a promise made by President Barack Obama to Congressman Brad Sherman last January, PHMSA, the relevant federal agency, issued a proposed Interim Final Regulation which will become binding on the industry before January 20, 2017. Congressman Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch, about as close as anyone to the site of the world’s largest natural gas leak said: “Never again should any community in America face what we faced in Porter Ranch. “This proposed regulation is a major step forward in preventing future massive leaks from underground natural gas storage facilities. This isn’t partisan, and the Trump Administration should enforce this regulation vigorously. The regulation is based on the recommendations of the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group that usually sides with Republicans on regulatory issues.[1] “For the first time, natural gas storage facilities will be subject to federal standards and inspections. Also, for the first time, violators will be subject to federal civil and criminal penalties, and possible shut-down. The Porter Ranch leak, which spanned from October 23, 2015 to February 18, 2016, showed that leaks at natural gas storage facilities could pose a health risk for tens of thousands of local residents while emitting nearly 5.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas which predominantly consists of methane, a greenhouse gas 84 times as potent as carbon dioxide. “PHMSA has stated that this regulation is a “first step” and will be followed by additional regulations. Future regulations should: (1) require that natural gas is injected and withdrawn only through the interior tubing, not through the casing; (2) require surface and sub-surface shut-off valves; and (3) require that no region of the country is dependent on a single too-big-to-fail style natural gas storage facility.” See the complete regulation here. See PHMSA press release here. ________________________________________________________________________ Background From October 23, 2015 to February 18, 2016, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest methane gas leak in world history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year. Using the Tubing, Not Casing Rather than allowing natural gas to travel through both the interior and exterior casing of pipelines where a single corrosion or crack can lead to a leak, there should be stronger standards for well construction. PHMSA should require that tubing be used for all injections and removal of natural gas. This means that natural gas would only be permitted to travel through the interior casing of pipelines, creating a double barrier system. Safety Shut-Off Valves The leaking well, known as SS25, was drilled in the early 1950s and was not subject to sophisticated testing thereafter. In the 1950s, the well had a subsurface safety valve, which was removed in 1979 and never replaced. PHMSA should require both a deep sub-surface positive pressure safety valve and a surface safety valve on every well. A sub-surface safety valve is needed because a rupture in the tube or casing somewhere along the length of the well may not allow it to be shut off by a valve located at the surface of the well. Every well should also have a safety valve at the surface. That way, if the sub-surface safety valve does not work, at least the valve could be closed at the top. Too Big To Fail, Too Big To Exist No one gas storage facility should be so large that its closure would adversely affect the statewide economy or cause a significant portion of the nation to be without heating, cooling, or electricity. Never again should the residents of Porter Ranch or any other community be told that an impaired natural gas storage facility cannot be shut down without risking the reliability of utility service to hundreds of thousands of other residents.

12.02.2016	Legislation Allows Cheated Customers Their Day in Court Sherman Oaks, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D- Sherman Oaks) and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act of 2016. The bill will close a Wells Fargo forced arbitration loophole by preventing Wells Fargo from applying its mandatory arbitration clauses to the millions of fake accounts created without customer consent. “If a customer never authorized the opening of a credit card or checking account, that same customer should not be bound by an arbitration agreement for a separate, legitimate account,” said Sherman. “Cheated customers should have the choice to opt out of phony contractual arbitration provisions and seek justice in court.” The bill also clarifies that a judge should make a decision in public about whether an account was fraudulently opened, rather than a determination being made by an arbitration panel behind closed doors. “Forced arbitration is shielding Wells Fargo from being held accountable for tanking customers’ credit scores and charging them fraudulent fines,” said Brown. “Wells Fargo’s customers never intended to sign away their right to fight back against fraud and deceit. We need to give customers back their ability to seek justice in court so they can be made whole again.” Sherman is a senior member of the Financial Services Committee. He questioned former Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo John Stumpf in a Committee Hearing on September 29, 2016 about whether the bank will apply its mandatory arbitration clauses intended for real accounts to the fraudulent accounts. “The cheated Wells Fargo customers deserve their day in court. Are you going to hold them to these forced arbitration clauses and screw them again out of their day in court, or are you willing to waive those clauses and say if you're caught up in this, you get your choice whether you have arbitration or not?” asked Sherman. In his response, Stumpf refused to waive forced arbitration for the victims. Sherman has also called attention to Wells Fargo’s deception. He documented how Stumpf bragged about the bank’s credit card cross penetration rates to shareholders well after the firing of thousands of employees for falsifying accounts. “Wells Fargo took 5,300 good Americans and turned them into felons with a system that its executives created and benefited from,” said Sherman. The bill has been endorsed by the American Association for Justice, Consumers Union, the National Association of Consumer Advocates, the National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income clients), Americans for Financial Reform, the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Media Voices for Children, Allied Progress, the Woodstock Institute, the Franciscan Action Network, the Economic Policy Institute Center, California Reinvestment Coalition, Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, National Consumers League, and Public Justice. In introducing the Justice for Victims of Fraud Act of 2016, Sherman and Brown were joined by Representatives Conyers (Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee), Capuano, Cartwright, Chu, Danny Davis, Edwards, Grijalva, Lawrence, Napolitano, and Norton and Senators Leahy, Franken, Durbin, Tester, Murray, Merkley, Warren, Hirono, Casey, Warner, Menendez, Blumenthal, Heitkamp, and Reed. Sherman has been a longtime advocate of breaking up the big banks. He introduced the Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act with Senator Bernie Sanders. “Wells Fargo’s deceptive and fraudulent practices demonstrate that it’s too big to fail, too big to manage, too big to regulate, and too big to exist. It’s time to break these giant banks up,” said Sherman. ##

11.01.2016	SoCalGas Should First Commit Itself to Tough Specific Safety Measures Congressman Brad Sherman issued the following statement after SoCalGas announced it completed testing or sealing all 114 wells and has requested authorization from the State of California to resume injections in the underground gas storage facility at Aliso Canyon. “If California’s Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) allows SoCalGas to begin reinjecting gas into Aliso Canyon, it must require the strongest possible safety measures: require that only tubing be used for all injections and removal of natural gas and prohibit injection or removal through the casing, strict maximum injection pressure for each well and corresponding maximum capacity limits for the facility, constant monitoring of the wells and air quality surrounding the facility, both a deep sub-surface positive pressure safety valve and a surface safety valve on every well. Until the toughest measures are in place and until the studies of the cause of the leak are finished, the Aliso Canyon facility should operate at the minimum usage necessary to ensure power reliability for the Los Angeles region. Since the multiple investigations into the cause of the leak have not been completed, we must proceed with extreme caution. Aliso Canyon is not ready to resume normal operations. Starting operations cautiously is the best way to balance safety with reliability. I remain concerned that we have yet to address the too big to fail, too big to exist issue: no one gas storage facility should be so large that its closure would adversely affect the statewide economy or cause a significant portion of the state to be without heating, cooking, or electricity. Never again should the residents of Porter Ranch or any other community be told that an impaired natural gas storage facility cannot be shut down without risking the reliability of utility service to millions of other residents. We should mandate that when any metropolitan area like Los Angeles is too reliant on one facility for all of its power, other facilities are developed.” Background Sherman’s home was as close to any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest methane leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.
10.18.2016	Pushes Tougher Standards for Safety Valves and Energy Reliability Sherman Oaks, CA – The Interagency Aliso Canyon Task force on Natural Gas Safety released its final Report on Natural Gas Storage Safety today. The Pipeline and Hazardous Safety Materials Administration (PHMSA) will be moving forward with federal regulations for natural gas storage based on the Task Force’s recommendations. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) has advocated for PHMSA to expeditiously implement tough nationwide standards. Sherman spoke to both the President and Vice President in January about implementing natural gas storage safety standards in the calendar year. Sherman issued the following statement after the Interagency Aliso Canyon Task Force on Natural Gas Safety unveiled its official recommendations this morning: “This is an important first step in protecting communities like Porter Ranch that suffered from the largest methane leak in U.S. history. “I am concerned the Report fails to call for sub-surface safety shut-off valves on every well. Additionally, the Report neglects to include a too big to fail analysis on whether some gas storage facilities are so large that their closure could adversely affect a major metropolitan area. “I am pleased that the Report has strong recommendations on well integrity, including proposing that tubing be used for all injections and removal of natural gas. “I want to thank Department of Energy Under Secretary for Science and Energy Franklin Orr and PHMSA Administrator Marie Therese Dominguez for their hard work on assessing how to better ensure the safe storage of energy resources following the natural gas leak at Aliso Canyon. “I have had discussions with the President, Vice President, Secretary of Energy, Secretary of Transportation, and the Office of Management and Budget, and have been led to believe that PHMSA will issue proposed gas storage safety regulations this year.” Background Sherman’s home was as close to any residence to the Aliso Canyon gas leak. For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest methane leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Two schools in the area were closed for the duration of the school year.
10.12.2016	Sherman Oaks, CA – Congressman Sherman, Senior Democrat on the Financial Services Committee issued the following statement. "Stumpf resigning is not enough. It was not just the mistakes of one person that caused massive fraud at Wells Fargo. The big banks in this country are too big to fail, and they are also too big to manage. It’s time to break up the big banks in this country. It’s time to pass the Sanders-Sherman bill.” The Sanders-Sherman bill to break up the too-big-to-fail banks is H.R. 2600 in the House and S. 1206 in the Senate. Congressman Sherman and Senator Bernie Sanders have introduced this legislation in the current and previous sessions of Congress.

09.19.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, released the following statement following news of terrorist attacks against India. “I strongly condemn the terrorist attack on India’s Uri army base on Saturday September 17, which led to the deaths of 18 Indian soldiers. This attack is yet another reminder of the threat international terrorism poses.” “I strongly encourage the governments in the region to make every effort to find the terrorists that carried out these attacks and bring them to justice. The United States should continue to assist these governments and ensure they can eliminate terrorist threats.” -30-
08.16.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), praised the unveiling of a new pedestrian underpass connecting the Redline to the Orange line at Metro's North Hollywood Station. The passage runs under Lankershim Boulevard between the platforms of the existing Orange Line Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) station on the west of Lankershim Boulevard, to the mezzanine level of the existing North Hollywood Red Line subway station at the east of Lankershim Boulevard. “I’m very pleased to see new construction on the Orange Line,” said Congressman Sherman. “I’m confident this new underpass will help decrease crowding by giving pedestrians a safe way to cross Lankershim. These underpasses are much safer for families, particularly those with small children, and they save time for commuters connecting between Metro’s Red Line and Orange Line Stations in North Hollywood.” “Our next priority should be to build a subway through the Sepulveda Pass, from the Valley to LAX, with a connection in West Los Angeles to the Purple Line, now under construction,” Sherman continued. “Well-designed projects not only provide jobs for those who build them, but improve our regional economy and competitiveness, and thus help create jobs in all economic sectors.” The Orange Line now carries a daily average of 30,000 riders along a dedicated bus way from Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the North Hollywood Red Line Station. Over the years, Congressman Sherman has helped secure federal funds for many Orange Line projects. -30-
07.19.2016	Washington DC – Today the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a notice that residents affected by the Porter Ranch Gas leak will not be required to pay income tax on money they received from Southern California Gas Company (“SoCalGas”) as reimbursement for their relocation and other expenses incurred as a result of the gas leak. This announcement came at the urging of Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Porter Ranch), who worked with the Treasury Department over the last six months to reach this result. Many Porter Ranch residents had heard from their tax advisers that the IRS might classify the reimbursements they received from SoCalGas as taxable income – for living expenses, air filtration, etc. As the IRS notice stated, “Questions have been raised concerning the taxability of these expenses paid on behalf of or as reimbursements to affected area residents.” “My neighbors in Porter Ranch have been through enough. They shouldn’t have to worry that the IRS would seek to tax them on the reimbursements they received from SoCalGas. Those who evacuated didn’t get a windfall – they left their homes to live in smaller quarters. Those who got air filters got no windfall – they got to continue breathing air. I’m pleased that after months of working with the Treasury Department and the IRS, the tax authorities have reached the correct decision and provided some clarity for taxpayers in the North-West San Fernando Valley,” said Congressman Brad Sherman, CPA. Background: For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Schools in the area were also closed. Congressman Sherman lives with his family in the Porter Ranch community, and his home was as close as any to the leak.

06.13.2016	Washington, DC – The House of Representatives passed the PIPES Act, legislation that will require federal regulation of natural gas storage, including the Aliso Canyon Storage facility in Porter Ranch which recently experienced the largest natural gas leak in US history. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), whose home is as close as any to the recent leak, issued the following statement: Watch Congressman Sherman discuss the PIPES Act and the Porter Ranch gas leak on the House floor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-65fEMuMGbI “This is a step for increased safety, and regulation of natural gas storage. After the Valley was subjected to the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history, I have been urging tough federal regulations of natural gas storage facilities to make sure this never happens again. In January, I raised this issue with both the President and the Vice President, both of whom promised to work with me in developing safety regulations this year. “This bill is a backstop. If PHMSA (Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration), the federal agency that regulates pipelines, doesn’t adopt regulations using its existing authority, this bill would compel them to act within two years. Existing law gives PHMSA the legal authority to adopt regulations for natural gas storage safety, but for decades they simply haven’t bothered to use that authority. My discussions with the President, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget lead me to believe that this agency will use its authority this year. “But it’s not enough to rely on promises from the administration. I am pleased the House has adopted this legislation that would require PHMSA to use its existing power, and issue natural gas storage safety regulations. It is my hope that PHMSA will act immediately. I am also pleased the bill includes language that I championed allowing states like California to adopt higher standards. “This legislation also establishes the Department of Energy’s Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Task Force and requires PHMSA to consider their recommendations when establishing the federal standards. I have been working with my California colleagues Senators Boxer and Feinstein, as well as the Department of Energy to determine how the Task Force can most efficiently determine the cause of the leak, explore potential preventative measures, assess the impact of the leak, and analyze the federal, state, and local response.” Background: For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Schools in the area have been closed. Currently, there are no federal regulations for gas storage facilities. -30-
06.08.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement after India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke before a joint session of Congress. “In 2014, I led an effort of 80 of my colleagues to encourage Congressional leadership to invite Prime Minister Modi to speak before a joint session of Congress. I’m glad he was able to give that address today. “He delivered a very insightful speech, which laid out the mutual benefits of our growing relationship with India. “Since India’s independence in 1947, the relationship between the United States and India, while at times warm, has not always lived up to its potential. Over the last several years, it has improved markedly. I look forward to continuing that progress as Ranking Democrat on the Asia Subcommittee. “The United States and India have a unique bond based on shared democratic values. The Prime Minister’s visit is an opportunity to build on the U.S-India strategic partnership to the benefit of both our nations. “The Prime Minister has played an important part in improving relations on issues as varied as alternative energy development, defense and security cooperation, counter-terrorism, and climate change. “As things stand, our current trade relationship amounts to around $110 billion. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Modi’s reform efforts and hope we can work together to make it easier for U.S. companies to export to India, and achieve the goal of a $500 billion balanced trade relationship. ” -30-
06.06.2016	Congressman Sherman celebrates the completion of the Backbone Trail with the National Parks Service, Betty Weider, and former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger Sherman Oaks – On Saturday, June 4th Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) along with the National Parks Service and several elected officials, including former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, celebrated the completion of the 67-mile backbone trail which traverses the Santa Monica Mountains. The celebration took place at Will Rogers State Park, where Congressman Sherman delivered a speech discussing his work to help secure funds for the project, as well as his efforts to preserve and protect national park lands. The National Park Service is also seeking designation of the Backbone trail as a “National Recreation Trail,” one of 1,500 in the country acknowledged for their value in promoting health, conservation and recreation. The title will make the trail more of a national destination and help the park service secure additional funding for maintenance and other acquisitions. “The Backbone Trail provides thousands of hikers, bicyclists and other outdoor enthusiasts with an unparalleled recreational experience through the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains,” said Congressman Sherman. “I want to thank the Parks Department for their tireless work as well as Governor Schwarzenegger and Betty Weider for their unbelievable generosity. The completion of this project is a major milestone for Southern Californians who have envisioned an uninterrupted trail from Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu for nearly 50 years.” Congressman Sherman led the effort to acquire remaining parcels of land along the Backbone Trail for the National Park Service. During his time in Congress, Sherman has secured nearly $20 million for land acquisition, trail construction, and other park related amenities – much of the funding has gone to construction of the 65-mile long Backbone Trail from Will Rogers State Park in Pacific Palisades, across the Los Angeles-Ventura County line, and through Point Mugu State Park near Oxnard. Funding secured by Sherman in 2003 helped acquire land and new trail construction including the Sandstone Peak trailhead, the Kanan Road trailhead, the Mishe Mokwa to Yerba Buena segment, and the Trancas segment. Later in 2011, funding secured by Sherman helped acquire land in Zuma Trancas and Etz Meloy to complete trail segmnets from Encinal to Etz Meloy and Rogers Road at Will Rogers State Park. Sherman has worked with the National Park Service to maximize every dollar for over a half-dozen projects including land acquisition for the Backbone Trail, Backbone Trail rehabilitation projects, Backbone Trail improvements in Topanga State Park, and trailhead enhancements at Cheeseboro Canyon. In 2008 Sherman worked to persuade Governor Schwarzenegger and his business partner, Betty Wieder, to allow the National Park Service to acquire or otherwise grant an easement of their parcel in the Santa Monica Mountains for the completion of the Backbone Trail In 2009, Sherman helped allocate 9.5 million in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act to build the Anthony C. Beilenson Visitor Center which opened in 2012. “I will continue my work in Congress to ensure that the Backbone trail is preserved for generations to come, and receives its proper designation as a National Recreation Trail. We have a responsibility to preserve our national parks and keep them accessible to the millions of urban residents in Greater Los Angeles, many of whom have never visited a national park.” -30-

06.02.2016	Washington DC – In a letter to Chancellor Howard Gillman, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) condemned recent anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist events on the University of California, Irvine campus, and called for stronger protections for university students. On May 18, the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and affiliates disrupted an assembly of students viewing a movie about the Israel Defense Forces. Protesters were filmed yelling “long live the Intifada”, a reference to periods of terrorism in Israel marked by immense human suffering. Additionally, May 2-5 was “Anti-Zionism Week 2016” at UCI, sponsored by SJP and the Muslim Student Union (MSU). The Neturei Karta Rabbi - Yisroel Dovid Weiss was invited to speak on campus. Rabbi Weiss previously met with the former President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an avid supporter of terrorism and denier of the Holocaust. Rabbi Weiss’s commentary on campus likened Zionism to a “corrupt movement” and “terrible sickness” that is “destroying G-d’s world”. “The UC Board of Regents adopted the Principles Against Intolerance in March of this year, an important step towards combating anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry” said Congressman Sherman. “I urge Chancellor Gillman and the UC system to enforce the Principles Against Intolerance in an effort to foster a productive and welcoming campus environment that is safe for everyone.” See Sherman’s full letter to Chancellor Howard Gillman below. June 1, 2016 Chancellor Howard Gillman The University of California, Irvine 510 Aldrich Hall Irvine, CA 92697-1900 Dear Chancellor Gillman, I am writing you to express serious concern over the recent anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic events at the University of California, Irvine. On May 18, the Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and affiliates disrupted an assembly of students viewing a movie about the Israel Defense Forces. Protesters were filmed yelling “long live the Intifada”, a reference to periods of terrorism in Israel marked by immense human suffering. It is appalling that the campus atmosphere has degraded to the point where students require armed security to assemble peacefully and watch a movie about life in Israel – a nation that is a strong American ally and the only true democracy in the Middle East. Additionally, May 2-5 was “Anti-Zionism Week 2016” at UCI, sponsored by SJP and the Muslim Student Union (MSU). The Neturei Karta Rabbi - Yisroel Dovid Weiss was invited to speak on campus. Rabbi Weiss previously met with the former President of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an avid supporter of terrorism and denier of the Holocaust. Rabbi Weiss’s commentary on campus likened Zionism to a “corrupt movement” and “terrible sickness” that is “destroying G-d’s world”. He also said that the Zionist movement is intimidating the media, a classic anti-Semitic stereotype. Due to the efforts of myself and others, in 2010 the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance to American universities indicating that they had an obligation to protect students from anti-Semitism. More specifically, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act requires universities to protect students from bigotry based on “race, color, or national origin,” including anti-Semitism. It is important that the University of California enforces Title VI and prevents anti-Semitism, not only because it is the right thing to do, but because failure to do so could affect eligibility for federal funds. This is especially necessary because there are those who claim that the most vicious and hateful anti-Semitic remarks are mere criticisms of the policies of the Israeli government. As you know, the UC Board of Regents adopted the Principles Against Intolerance in March of this year. This was an important step towards combating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. However, the inability of Jewish and pro-Israel students to assemble peacefully to view an Israeli film is counter to the Principles Against Intolerance, section H, which states that “Actions that physically or otherwise interfere with the ability of an individual or group to assemble, speak, and share or hear the opinions of others.” There was clearly interference with the ability of Jewish and pro-Israel groups to assemble and discuss very relevant topics during the May 18 incident. Furthermore, the remarks of Rabbi Weiss do not constitute open academic debate, but are inciting, and can only lead to increased anti-Semitism. Rabbi Weiss’s remarks breach section C of the Principles Against Intolerance which states that “stereotypical or prejudiced discourse, left unchallenged and uncontested, has led to enormous tragedy” and that “the university is best served when its leaders challenge speech and action reflecting bias, stereotypes, and/or intolerance.” Given the May events, it is clear that UCI has not yet enforced the Board of Regents’ ruling. How do you intend to protect the right of Jewish, pro-Israel, and other UCI students to assemble peacefully in the future? I note that in your letter to Professor Rossman-Benjamin regarding the May 18th incident, you stated “I announce that we are investigating the incident to determine whether disciplinary or legal actions are appropriate.” Please keep me apprised of the progress of the investigation and let me know whether you have determined to take disciplinary or legal actions. I urge you to enforce the Principles Against Intolerance in an effort to foster a productive campus environment that is safe for all. Sincerely, Brad Sherman Member of Congress -30-
05.23.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Congressman Patrick McHenry (R-NC) lead a bipartisan letter to European Union Ambassador H.E. David O’Sullivan, urging the European Union to designate a Mahan Air as a terrorist entity. Mahan Air, an Iranian airline which has already been designated a terrorist entity by the United States, provides material support to terrorist organizations and lethal aid to Assad’s regime in Syria. A designation by the European Union would prevent Mahan Air from flying to and from Europe. “Preventing Mahan Air from flying to Europe would send a clear message to Iran that the EU is committed to countering Iran’s support for terrorism and those that have caused such grave suffering in Syria,” reads a portion of the letter. “We urge you to work with European governments to promptly end Mahan Air’s operations in Europe, and to signal to European businesses that the EU will remain vigilant in acting against Iranian companies supporting terrorism and Assad’s regime.” Several key members of Congress signed the letter, including the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the Subcommittee on the Middle East, and the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation, as well as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Europe. The Chairmen of the Terrorism Financing Task Force and the House Homeland Security Committee also signed the letter. Read the full text of letter below, and attached: May 23, 2016 H.E. David O’Sullivan Ambassador of the European Union to the United States of America 2175 K Street, NW Washington, DC 20037 Dear Ambassador O’Sullivan: We are writing to urge the European Union to designate Mahan Air as an entity providing material support to terrorist organizations and lethal aid to Assad’s regime in Syria, and to take action to prevent it from flying to Europe. As European countries increase business ties with Iran, it is vitally important that the EU take a clear stand against any Iranian entity providing support for Iran’s continuing nefarious activities. Mahan Air was designated by the U.S. Treasury Department for providing material support to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF) in 2011. It has also been carrying weapons and personnel to support Hezbollah and the Assad regime in Syria. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Mahan Air often flies its planes to European destinations within hours of returning from an arms delivery to Damascus. Saudi Arabia recently announced it will ban Mahan Air from flying to its airports. Mahan Air’s status as a U.S. proscribed terrorist entity was not changed by the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and for good reason. Mahan Air currently flies to at least four countries in the EU, and it has announced plans to expand to additional countries within the EU this year. By designating and barring this airline, the EU will strike a serious blow against the Assad regime and help prevent continued suffering in Syria by weakening one of Assad’s vital links to his allies. By providing arms to the Assad regime and Hezbollah, Mahan Air is directly contributing to the dire humanitarian situation faced by the Syrian people, and the proliferation of terrorism across the Middle East. We greatly value our partnership with the European Union, the vital role that US-EU cooperation plays in countering terrorist financing, and our joint efforts to end the suffering in Syria. Preventing Mahan Air from flying to Europe would send a clear message to Iran that the EU is committed to countering Iran’s support for terrorism and those that have caused such grave suffering in Syria. We urge you to work with European governments to promptly end Mahan Air’s operations in Europe, and to signal to European businesses that the EU will remain vigilant in acting against Iranian companies supporting terrorism and Assad’s regime.

05.19.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Award of Excellence from the Republic of Vietnam War Veterans Association of the San Fernando Valley. Sherman received the award in recognition of outstanding service to the Vietnamese community and the American and South Vietnamese soldiers who fought in the Vietnam War. “It is with tremendous gratitude that I receive this award,” said Congressman Sherman. “I thank the Republic of Vietnam War Veterans Association for preserving the memory and dignity of the South Vietnamese. We owe a great debt to the South Vietnamese, and it is important that we never forget or overlook the sacrifices made by those who served alongside our soldiers against the spread of communism.” Congressman Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia. He has also been an active member of the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam. Through his work in Congress, Sherman has long advocated for the concerns of the Vietnamese-American community and fought for human rights in Vietnam. Sherman cosponsored the Vietnam Human Rights Act, which would prohibit increases in non-humanitarian aid to Vietnam above current levels unless the President reports to Congress that Vietnam has made serious improvements in human rights and religious freedom. Humanitarian aid would not be affected by the bill. The bill also allows the Administration to increase aid to Vietnam if that increased assistance is matched by U.S. funds to training programs on human rights and the rule of law in Vietnam. The legislation also expresses the sense of Congress that the U.S. should overcome the Vietnamese government’s jamming of Radio Free Asia and that bilateral education and cultural exchanges should promote freedom and democracy in Vietnam. Sherman has encouraged the Obama administration to call for improved human rights conditions in Vietnam. In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Sherman and his colleagues called for a more open society, and expressed deep concerns about our increasing trade partnership with Vietnam, including through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The position expressed to Secretary Kerry is that “any further economic ties, specifically trade agreements, should be contingent on the condition of human rights in Vietnam.” -30-
05.18.2016	Porter Ranch, CA – Yesterday, the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) defied a directive from the L.A. County Department of Public Health by announcing that SoCalGas will not clean homes of residents affected by the natural gas leak in Porter Ranch. Congressman Sherman, whose home is as close as any to the Porter Ranch leak, took to the floor of the House to condemn the actions of SoCalGas. Watch Here: https://youtu.be/DfT29y1zz1U “SoCalGas is attempting to pass through to Los Angeles area consumers the cost of the gas leak, which resulted from their own negligence,” said Congressman Sherman. “Many of us are working hard to protect consumers. Realizing they may have to bear the cost themselves, SoCalGas has decided to shortchange the residents who have evacuated. They have decided they don’t want to pay for the cleaning protocol that the L.A. County Public Health Department says is necessary to make homes safe. “When it comes to the L.A. County Department of Public Health, SoCalGas has a process of both relying and defying. They rely on LA County Department of Public Health when they say that Porter Ranch residents can safely return to their homes and should no longer receive relocation assistance. But they defy L.A. County Department of Public Health directive to pay for the cleaning protocol necessary to make Porter Ranch homes safe.” “SoCalGas is being penny wise and pound foolish. If they continue to refuse to pay for interior decontamination in Porter Ranch homes, some homes will not be decontaminated. Years from now a resident diagnosed with a health problem may sue. The fact that SoCalGas defied the order of County Public Health Officials will someday be put before the jury.” “SoCalGas has indicated that they will review the Health Department directive further. I urge them to do so, and announce that they will provide the safety cleaning as instructed by the county health department.” On May 13th, the Department of Public health issued a directive for SoCalGas to “immediately and unconditionally offer, and, if accepted by the resident/homeowner, implement comprehensive cleaning of homes,” that are affected by the leak. On May 15th, SoCalGas responded by saying, “SoCalGas is not offering cleaning…” Additionally SoCalGas announced their desire to end the temporary relocation program as early as Sunday, May 22nd. Initially Los Angeles Superior Court determined that SoCalGas would be ordered to provide temporary housing through June 7th. A court will decide this issue on Friday, May 20th, 2016.

05.03.2016	Washington DC –After reading the 28 classified pages of the 9/11 report, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, called for their public disclosure and for direct answers to questions raised in the report. Sherman will join with his colleagues in sponsoring a resolution that would call on the administration to declassify this chapter of the report. “There is no reason why this section of the 9/11 report should remain classified, and keeping it out of the public eye does real harm. I agree with my colleague, Congressman Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who says that the 28 pages can “be redacted to preserve sources and methods but released, by and large, to the public.” “Right now the public doesn’t know what to think. Releasing the information will give them relevant facts with which to work. Disclosure is often the best policy in public affairs and this is one of those cases. “The government should also be 100 percent forthcoming about the information that former Senator Bob Graham, co-chair of the Intelligence Committee at the time, believes was withheld from the Congressional inquiry and the 9/11 Commission, including the circumstances surrounding the Ghazzawi family, which rapidly left Florida after the terrorist attacks. “Those affected by 9/11, and the American people generally, need to know the whole truth about what happened. There is no good reason to hide this chapter of the story.” -30-
04.28.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement following news that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi was formally invited to speak before a joint session of Congress. “I am pleased that India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be able to address a Joint Session of Congress this year. In 2014, I led the effort, and was joined by more than 80 of my colleagues, in trying to encourage then-Speaker John Boehner to invite President Modi to give such an address shortly after he had assumed office. “Since India’s independence in 1947, the relationship between the United States and India has steadily grown. The United States and India have a unique relationship based on shared democratic values. The Prime Minister’s visit is an opportunity to build on the U.S-India strategic partnership to the benefit of both our nations. “As things stand, our current trade relationship amounts to around $110 billion. I am encouraged by Prime Minister Modi’s reform efforts and hope we can work together to make it easier for U.S. companies to invest in India and increase U.S. exports. I look forward to hearing directly from President Modi about this issue.” -30-
04.22.2016	Washington DC – In recognition of the anniversary of the Armenian genocide of 1915, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has called yet again on the administration and Congress to properly recognize this tragic event. “Beginning in 1915 the Ottoman government began implementing its plans to expunge the Armenian people from its territory—an event which meets all the definitions of the word ‘genocide.’ An estimated one and a half million people perished. “I have repeatedly called on the President and asked my colleagues in the House and Senate to formally recognize the genocide – we cannot afford to wait. I am disappointed that neither the President nor Congress has given the Armenian Genocide appropriate recognition. “Genocide denial is the last act of a genocide and the first step in the next genocide. It is our duty to honor and dignify those who lost their lives, to pay respect to their living relatives, and to ensure that these horrible events never happen again.” -30-
04.20.2016	Washington, DC – Today the House Transportation Committee passed the PIPES Act. This legislation will require federal regulation of natural gas storage, including the Aliso Canyon Storage facility in Porter Ranch which recently experienced the largest natural gas leak in US history. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), whose home is as close as any to the recent leak, issued the following statement: “After the Valley was subjected to the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history, I’ve been urging tough federal regulations of natural gas storage facilities. In January I had a chance to bring this up with the President and the Vice President, both of whom promised to work with me in developing safety regulations. “Existing law gives PHMSA, the federal agency that regulates pipelines, the legal authority to adopt regulations for natural gas storage safety. But for decades they simply haven’t bothered to use that authority. My discussions with the President, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Transportation lead me to believe that this agency will use its authority this year. “But it’s not enough to rely on promises from the administration. Legislation should be adopted requiring PHMSA to issue natural gas storage safety regulations. Accordingly I’m pleased that the Transportation Committee passed a provision requiring PHMSA to use its existing power, and adopt safety regulations. “I look forward to improving the legislative language as the bill goes through the legislative process.” Background: For nearly four months, the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch suffered from the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history. More than 7,000 families were displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Schools in the area have been closed. Currently, there are no federal regulations for gas storage facilities. -30-
04.19.2016	Washington, DC – The Metro Orange Line will receive a grant of 4.3 million dollars from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to be used toward five battery-operated, zero-emission buses, as well as eight charging stations. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) advocated for the grant last year in a letter to Transportation Secretary Anthony Fox. “I am pleased to have helped the Metro’s Orange Line secure federal funding for new buses and charging stations,” said Congressman Sherman. “The Orange Line is one of the busiest bus lines in the nation. Commuters in the San Fernando Valley will benefit greatly from an addition to the fleet that can help alleviate crowded buses and waiting times. And with the zero-emission technology, these new buses will help reduce smog and other harmful greenhouse gases.” The Metro Orange Line which serves the San Fernando Valley region has exceeded all ridership expectations with over 28,000 daily commuters.

04.13.2016	Congressman Sherman (center) Receives Humane Advocate Award from Wayne Pacelle (left), President of the Humane Society of the United States, and Chief Operating Officer Michael Markarian (right) Washington, DC – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Humane Advocate Award from the Humane Society of the United States. This is Congressman Sherman’s ninth consecutive award from the Humane Society. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on animal welfare issues and for his consistently perfect score on the Humane Society’s Legislative Scorecard. Since coming to Congress in 1997, Sherman has been a vigorous advocate for animals, working to ensure that they are not subjected to undue pain or suffering. Sherman has been a leader on many animal issues including the regulation of puppy mills, protecting endangered and exotic animals, halting experimentation on chimpanzees, protecting horses from slaughter and consumption, and stopping the disgusting sport of dog fighting by punishing animal fighting spectators. "We are tremendously grateful to Congressman Sherman for his work to protect animals from cruelty, and to stop abuses such as animal fighting, horse slaughter, and inhumane factory farming practices," said Wayne Pacelle, President of The Humane Society of the United States. "Congressman Sherman has always been a stalwart advocate for animal protection in Congress, and we applaud his advocacy for all creatures." -30-
04.12.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services and Foreign Affairs Committees, has called on the administration to negotiate a new tax treaty between the United States and Armenia. At a recent hearing before the Financial Service Committee, Sherman told Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew that currently, “we have a chicken and egg circumstance. You don't get the business investment because you don't have the tax treaty. Then you don't need the tax treaty because you don't have the business investment. “We have tax treaties with scores of countries around the world. We devote a substantial amount of money to trying to achieve our international development goals and can always provide foreign aid to Armenia. But we can also achieve those goals by having a tax treaty.” The Armenian National Committee of America applauded Sherman’s advocacy. “We join with Congressman Sherman in calling for a U.S.-Armenia Double Tax Treaty and thank him for his strong leadership in promoting expanded economic relations between the United States and Armenia," said ANCA Executive Director Aram Hamparian. "Beyond the powerful benefits in terms of business growth, such an accord would meaningfully build on the enduring friendship of the American and Armenian peoples, further anchoring Armenia to the West, and providing Yerevan with greater strategic options and independence in dealing with regional powers.”
04.11.2016	Sherman Oaks, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman, who lives in the Porter Ranch community, site of the largest gas leak in U.S. history, responded to reports that the Los Angeles basin may experience power outages if the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility remains offline: “There is a political dance happening here. I am concerned that SoCalGas may use these reports to build a case for business-as-usual operations with minimal safety improvements. “Before we even consider injecting more gas back into Aliso Canyon, all 114 wells in the facility should be sealed or be thoroughly tested. And there must be a plan in place to install sub-surface safety valves on all wells that remain in operation. “Additionally, no one facility should be too big to fail. 11 million customers in the Los Angeles region should not be reliant on one facility for electrical and gas service. “We cannot have just an energy reliability plan. We need a safe energy reliability plan. We cannot consider injecting new gas into Aliso Canyon until there is a mandatory plan to spend many hundreds of millions on safety – and until we know that the cost will be borne by the shareholders of SoCalGas, not consumers.” -30-

04.05.2016	Sherman Oaks –In a letter to the Chairmen of Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) called on Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV and all other providers to enter into binding arbitration to resolve the current dispute and air Dodgers games on all LA-area cable and satellite systems. “I am deeply troubled by recent reports in the Los Angeles Times that both parties have ceased efforts to reach a deal. We are entering the third straight season of this television dispute, which has deprived millions of fans the opportunity to watch the hometown team,” said Congressman Sherman. “I have pushed for binding arbitration on multiple occasions since the 2014 season when this dispute began. They have had two years to reach a compromise on their own, but enough is enough.” “When you have two or more parties that can’t reach an agreement, at great detriment to the public, binding arbitration may be the only option. This way an objective expert can negotiate a fair compromise.” “A community ought to able to rally around the home team. You can’t build a community if over half the residents can’t view the Dodgers.” Read Congressman Sherman’s letter below: April 1, 2016 Mr. John Stankey CEO, AT&T Entertainment Group 2260 E. Imperial Highway El Segundo, CA 90245 Mr. Robert D. Marcus CEO and Chairman, Time Warner Cable 60 Columbus Circle New York, NY 10023 John M. Dyer President and CEO, Cox Enterprises, 6205 Peachtree Dunwoody Rd Atlanta, GA 30328 Mr. Charlie Ergen CEO, Dish Network Corporation 9601 S Meridian Blvd. Englewood, CO 80112 Mr. Brian L. Roberts Chairman and CEO, Comcast Corporation 1701 JFK Boulevard Philadelphia, PA 19103 Mr. Daniel McCarthy President & CEO, Frontier Communications 401 Merritt 7 Norwalk, CT 06851 Dear Sirs, I write to express my continued concern about the ongoing dispute over how to provide residents of Los Angeles with access to Los Angeles Dodgers television broadcasts. Millions of Dodgers fans have been unable to watch the games for two seasons. The Dodgers are about to start a new season. We need to find a solution before opening day so that Angelenos do not miss a third Dodgers season in a row. I am deeply troubled by recent reports in the Los Angeles Times that all parties have ceased efforts to reach a deal. I wrote to Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV in 2014 and 2015, calling for Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV and all other TV providers to enter into binding arbitration, so that a neutral third-party could determine the right price and terms for the Dodgers network. On behalf of Dodgers fans throughout Southern California, I am reissuing that request. Binding arbitration is a fair and fast way to return programming to consumers. Two years of failed negotiations proves that mediation is not working. Binding arbitration would take place as follows. 1. Any satellite, cable or telco provider within the Dodgers home television territory that agrees to binding arbitration shall immediately launch SportsNet LA, commonly known as the Dodgers Network. Those satellite, cable or telco companies would be able to insert four 30 second commercials each hour (as the current format provides), and would otherwise be carrying the station’s feed. 2. SportsNet LA would be available to all cable, satellite and telco subscribers throughout the Dodgers home television territory. 3. All parties would enter into binding arbitration pursuant to the rules of the American Arbitration Association, which pursuant to its practices, would assist in the appointment of three qualified neutral arbitrators. 4. The arbitrators would determine the amount to be paid (carriage fee) by the cable, satellite and telco companies. 5. The arbitrators would take into consideration all relevant data regarding regional sports networks, not only in Los Angeles but across the country. The parties would cooperate in providing relevant information, and the arbitrators would keep proprietary information confidential. 6. The arbitrators would decide whether the terms should apply for one season, or three to six seasons. Time Warner Cable has repeatedly agreed to submit to binding arbitration. The Dodgers have spoken in support of binding arbitration as well. In 2015, DIRECTV released a statement to the Los Angeles Times saying it was open to compromise. “We continue to hope TWC and the Dodger front office will compromise with the rest of Southern California's providers so all Dodger fans can watch their games without burdening everyone else with significantly higher fees.” I am hopeful that all parties will submit to binding arbitration before the Dodgers start a third season, so that every Angeleno has access to the broadcasts. I look forward to assisting in any way I can to help resolve this impasse and return Dodgers programming to my constituents and the rest of Los Angeles. Thank you for your attention and consideration of this important request. Sincerely, Brad Sherman Member of Congress
04.05.2016	Congressman Sherman speaks to Valley Residents at Sunday’s Town Hall Meeting Sherman Oaks, CA – On Sunday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall meeting at Granada Hills Charter High School, fielding questions from some of the approximately 500 constituents who attended. Congressman Sherman gave an update on the recently capped gas leak in Porter Ranch, including details of how his office can help families and businesses affected by the leak. Over the past several months, Sherman’s office has helped families whose phone calls to SoCalGas weren’t being returned. His office continues to help those seeking reimbursement for air filters, school transportation, and living expenses while evacuated. Sherman also made local business owners aware that they may be eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the Small Business Administration – a benefit that came at the request of Sherman’s office. Sherman also discussed his efforts to ensure that this type of leak never happens again, including his introduction of the Gas Storage Safety Act – legislation designed to implement federal gas storage safety standards. Much of the time was spent responding to questions about the future of gas storage safety, and energy reliability. Other topics included terrorism, the economy, foreign policy in the Middle-East, veterans affairs, transportation, recreation in the Sepulveda Basin, as well as other matters facing Congress. “Town Halls are always an important part of my job, but that is especially true anytime there is a disaster that affects our region,” said Congressman Sherman. “My family and I live in Porter Ranch and our home is as close as any to the largest natural gas leak in U.S. history — which displaced over 7,000 families, shut down two schools, and hurt local businesses.” “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.” Sherman also took time to acknowledge Valley residents including First Class Petty Officer Milton Burdick, a veteran of World War II. On December 7th, 1942, (on the one-year anniversary of Pearl Harbor) Milton Burdick enlisted in the Navy and served the Allied forces for the better part of the next four years as a flight mechanic on the island of Espiritu Santo in the South Pacific. His father had sent a letter granting Milton permission to enlist at the age of just 17 years and 2 months. Burdick was honored with the “Philippine Liberation Medal” for his service in the Pacific theater, but never received his medal. As a result of Congressman Sherman’s constituent service staff, the medal was reissued and presented to Burdick at the Town Hall Meeting. Congressman Sherman presents First Class Petty Officer Milton Burdick, with the “Philippine Liberation Medal.” Burdick was honored for his service in the Pacific theater of World War II but did not receive his medal until it was reissued at the request of Congressman Sherman. Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies. Sherman also directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. --30--
04.04.2016	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement: "The Azerbaijani aggression we have seen over the last few days is deeply disappointing. There are a number of news reports indicating that more than 100 Armenians have been killed as a result. Chairman Ed Royce and I urged that Azerbaijan use the opportunity provided by the recent Nuclear Security Summit to advance the peace process. "Instead, it appears that Azerbaijan's President Aliyev launched new attacks against Nagorno-Karabakh. I strongly condemn this aggression and believe that U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan be cut off until it ceases its aggression, renounces violence, and commits to a purely peaceful resolution of the conflict." -30-

03.24.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee released the following statement on the Treasury Department’s sanctioning two entities and two individuals for supporting Iran’s ballistic missile program and Iranian airline Mahan Air. “I am pleased to see that the Treasury Department is still pursuing the Iranian missile program and Mahan Air. These designations are important steps. However, we need to continue these efforts and do more. “I have been very concerned that Mahan continues to fly to European destinations and has managed to evade our sanctions -- buying planes and obtaining spare parts and repair services. “We need to make grounding Mahan a top priority with European and Asian allies. It is linked to the IRGC Quds Force and helps bring Quds Force thugs and materiel to Syrian President Assad's brutal war machine. Our friends should not allow Mahan to land at their airports. The blood of 200,000 Syrian civilians is not only on the hands of Assad, but also on the hands of those in Iran who help him kill, including Mahan Air. “We need go after Mahan's business partners, especially any banks that serve it. Doing business with it will subject banks to very harsh secondary sanctions in the US. We should use every available law to hit Mahan.” Watch Congressman Sherman’s questioning of Office of Foreign Asset Control Director John Smith before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on February 11, 2016 HERE.
03.18.2016	Sherman Oaks - Metro unveiled its mass transit proposal for Los Angeles on Friday March 18, 2016. Congressman Sherman released the following response. “Since 2008, the Valley has been paying higher sales taxes to pay for trains and subways benefitting the rest of Los Angeles. While the Valley pays more than a fifth of the tax, we have only one mile of the trains and subways, just 1% of the county total. “Now, Metro is proposing to raise the sales tax an additional one half cent, while also extending the temporary sales tax increase adopted in 2008 for two more decades. “I am glad to see that the Metro plan allocates substantial funds for a subway through the Sepulveda Pass. I have repeatedly advised Metro that a subway through the Sepulveda Pass is the most critical project to the long-term transit needs of the San Fernando Valley “Only roughly half of the funds for the Sepulveda Pass project are guaranteed in Metro’s plan, with the rest dependent on other funding sources. “I look forward to working with Metro and others to make sure that before this proposal is put on the ballot, it assures funding for a subway through the Sepulveda Pass as well as substantial improvements to the Orange Line busway. “I am hopeful that we can improve the plan before the measure is finalized in June and put before voters in November.” -30-
03.16.2016	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) led a bipartisan group of 135 House members in a request of $2 million for the U.S.–Israel Energy Cooperation Program in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The appropriations request this year included the highest number of signatories – 130 members of Congress – since the creation of the program in 2008. The program is designed to leverage matching contributions from the Israeli government. It also leverages investments from the Israeli and American private sector; thus, for every dollar Congress appropriates, three dollars are invested, contributing to the economy in addition to energy security. Since its inception the program has received $27.4 million from the U.S. and Israeli governments ($13.7 from each government) and has also raised over $32 million from private sector investments. “The U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program continues to spur and advance new and innovative energy projects,” said Congressman Sherman. “This tremendous bipartisan support is a clear indication that Congress supports funding for this program from both sides of the aisle. Two years ago the House voted to expand this program into water technology, an important area for California and many other states. I will work with the Administration on further boosting funding for this program in future budgets.” Congressman Sherman wrote the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2005. Congress ultimately enacted the legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, in December 2007. The program funds research and development in energy technologies and energy efficiency in the American and Israeli private sectors. These projects include advancements in hydroelectric energy production, lowering energy consumption for water treatment, energy optimization for manufacturers, wind energy storage, reduced fuel consumption and carbon emissions for tractor trailers, and noise control for distributed power generation. See text of the letter below: March 15, 2016 Hon. Mike Simpson Chairman Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development House Committee on Appropriations Hon. Marcy Kaptur Ranking Member Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development House Committee on Appropriations RE: Support for U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program Dear Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur, We are writing to request that the subcommittee provide at least $2 million for the implementation of the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement in the FY2017 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This funding will be utilized to further implement Section 917 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, P.L. 110-140, and the May 2008 agreement between the U.S. and Israel on strategic energy cooperation. As you are aware, Congress passed in 2014, and the President signed into law, the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act (P.L. 113-296). Among other important provisions, the measure reauthorized the cooperative energy program through 2024 and expanded its mandate, covering collaborative R&D into renewable technologies, natural gas and water – key areas of interest for the United States. We greatly appreciate the support your subcommittee has provided for this program in the past. The U.S. government has provided $13.7 million for the program since its inception. The funding has been fully matched by the Government of Israel; this is not an aid program. During the same period, the program has also leveraged over $32 million in private sector cost-sharing. This program is an important tool in our efforts to achieve greater energy security and independence, and leverages small grant dollars to incentivize private sector innovation and new partnerships in the pursuit of a critical objective. U.S.-Israel projects currently underway include advancements in energy production over water reservoirs, lowering energy consumption for water treatment, energy optimization for manufacturers, wind energy storage, reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for tractor trailers, and noise control for distributed power generation. Continued funding for the program will provide for collaborative U.S. and Israeli research and development efforts in areas critical to both the United States and Israel and unite our countries in the pursuit of increased energy security, energy independence and water efficiency – an issue of growing importance to much of the U.S. West and Southwest, and an area where Israel is truly the world leader. Companies across the U.S. are working through this program to develop cutting-edge technologies with new partners in Israel in order to advance America’s energy security. Furthermore, the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement facilitates greater cooperation and sharing of knowledge between American and Israeli universities. Collaboration between the American and Israeli private sector and academia will significantly enhance U.S. efforts to develop new technologies to the benefit of our economic and national security. We thank you for your consideration and for your prior support of this program and request your continued support for FY2017. Sincerely, Adam B. Schiff Adam Kinzinger Al Green Alan Grayson Alan S.

03.16.2016	Washington DC - Today the University of California Regents released its Final Report of the Regents Working Group on Principles Against Intolerance. Congressman Sherman issued the following statement in response: “I am pleased to see that the final report explicitly condemns anti‐Semitism and anti‐Zionism. This is a significant victory for Jewish students who have faced multiple, unsettling incidents involving anti-Semitic epithets, slurs, obscenities, and even physical violence. “Since the ‘Principles Against Intolerance’ section fails to explicitly address the problem of anti-Zionism, it is critical that the report’s introduction – which condemns anti-Zionism – is adopted as part of the UC Regents’ policy. “I am disappointed that the report does not recommend the adoption of a definition of anti-Semitism. I wrote to the UC Regents, as well as former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, urging them to adopt the State Department definition. The State Department definition appropriately draws the line between normal criticisms of the policies of the State of Israel on the one hand, and disguised anti-Semitism on the other. “However, I applaud the report’s attempt to denounce anti-Zionism expressed in ways that are not simply statements of disagreement over politics and policy, but assertions of prejudice and intolerance toward Jewish people and culture. I will continue working with the University of California and universities across the county to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitism.” -30-
03.15.2016	Metro CEO Phillip Washington meets with Congressman Brad Sherman Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) met with Metro CEO Phillip Washington in his Washington, DC office to discuss Metro priorities and plans to build a subway tunnel through the Sepulveda Pass. “No project is more critical to the long-term transit needs of the San Fernando Valley than a subway tunnel through the Sepulveda Pass,” said Congressman Sherman. “My concern is that the Valley may be overlooked once more. We can’t have a repeat of what I heard 10 years ago: That we’re going to build this tunnel, just as soon as the private investors give us the money. The project should not be contingent on private investment. “Linking the Valley to the Purple Line in West Los Angeles, with the goal of a future connection to LAX, provides the best opportunity to decrease traffic on the 101 and 405 freeways. We also need to improve the Orange Line, first with grade separations, then with conversion to light rail. “If the San Fernando Valley was its own city, it would be the fifth largest in the United States and the only major city without a rail system – we should not be shortchanged. “Metro’s plan for extending the existing ‘temporary’ sales tax and increasing the sales tax rate by 0.5% to 9.5%, will be published at 4pm this Friday. I’m sure it will contain a Sepulveda Pass Tunnel with a subway and underground freeway lanes. The real issue is whether it guarantees the funds to build the tunnel sometime soon.” Last week Congressman Sherman wrote a letter to Metro CEO Washington urging prioritization of the tunnel. Sherman has been advocating for this project for many years. -30-
03.15.2016	Sherman Oaks – The House and Senate unanimously passed the bipartisan Taiwan INTERPOL bill (381-0), which will now be sent to the President. The legislation, which was originally introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), would urge President Obama to take the necessary steps required to have Taiwan accepted into the International Criminal Police Organization, INTERPOL. “This is not just a symbolic gesture, it’s a matter of international security,” said Congressman Sherman. “Taiwan functions as an independent country, and needs to function as an independent country inside international organizations. To date, Taiwan has been admitted to only one organization in the United Nations system, the World Health Organization, under the title observer status. We cannot allow Taiwan’s political status to prevent effective law enforcement against criminal gangs and international criminal organizations.” “As things stand now, Taiwan gets some information from the International Police Organization, Interpol, but it is neither consistent, nor reliable. Taiwan doesn't have real-time access to Interpol's networks and systems. This hurts not only the people of Taiwan, but people all over the world that are potentially the victims of criminals who cannot be apprehended because we don't have efficient sharing of information and efficient multinational law enforcement.” Taiwan was ejected from INTERPOL in 1984, when the People’s Republic of China applied for membership. In an effort to fill this gap, Congressman Salmon and Sherman introduced legislation, H.R. 1853, which directs the President to develop a strategy to obtain observer status for Taiwan at INTERPOL. The bill passed the House by a vote of 392 to 0 on November 2nd, 2015. The Senate passed its version of the Salmon-Sherman bill, and on March 14th the House voted to send that legislation to the President. -30-

02.18.2016	Washington DC –Congressman Brad Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch, issued the following statement: “We are all pleased to learn that well SS.25, from which we experienced the largest gas leak in history, has been sealed. “We should not be declaring victory, as the Aliso Canyon facility and the negligence of Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) continue to pose a threat to the community. “We now need tough new regulations regarding the other 114 wells in the Aliso Canyon facility. We need 24/7 monitoring of each well, shown on a website so the public can see for themselves. We need deep subsurface safety valves on every well. “The Aliso Canyon facility should continue to be shut down until we know it is safe. “Residents should not have to return home until the air at the facility, and in a representative sample of homes, has been certified safe by state authorities. SoCalGas just announced that residents need to return by next Thursday even though truly thorough testing, including indoor air testing, has not yet been completed. “This leak resulted from the negligence of SoCalGas. None of the costs should be passed through to customers. SoCalGas’s insurance rates will go up, and none of that increase should be passed through to customers. “Our office got the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to make Economic Injury Disaster Loans available to businesses that have been hurt by the leak. Loans of up to $2 million, at up to a 4% rate, are available to help businesses make payroll and pay operating expenses. Businesses can contact us at (818) 501-9200 or go to BradSherman.house.gov. “And finally, the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) should use its existing authority to regulate the storage of natural gas. If PHMSA does not exercise their authority, I have introduced legislation, the Gas Storage Safety Act, which would direct PHMSA to implement tough federal safety standards for gas storage.” See the attachment regarding testing the air before telling residents to return home. -30- Attachment SoCalGas has assisted the relocation of many affected residents and has agreed to give those families eight days to return to their homes. Congressman Sherman urged that the eight day time frame should not begin until the air is tested safe. On February 11th, Sherman wrote to the Department of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and the California Air Resources Board urging that the air quality in the Porter Ranch community be thoroughly tested to ensure that air quality, both around the well and in the Porter Ranch community, has returned to normal. February 12, 2016 Mr. Kenneth Harris State Oil and Gas Supervisor Department of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources 801 K Street, MS 18-05 Sacramento, CA 95814-3530 Dear Mr. Harris: I am pleased to see you have released a multi-step process to confirm that Aliso Canyon storage facility’s SS.25 is permanently sealed. I am particularly happy to learn that gas emissions at and around the surface of the leaking well will be measured to verify that the well has been sealed. It would be helpful if you could clarify if anyone will be monitoring air quality in the Porter Ranch community. It is not enough to just test around the surface of the well. Rather, tests of air quality should be run throughout the community. Most importantly, the beginning of the eight-day period for residents to return to their homes should not be triggered until the leak is permanently sealed and the air quality, both around the well and in the Porter Ranch community, returns to normal. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN Member of Congress cc: Dr. William A. Burke, Chairman, South Coast Air Quality Management District Ms. Mary D. Nichols, Chair, California Air Resources Board
02.17.2016	Washington DC – After several years of study, the National Park Service released a report recommending that 170,000 acres of land be added to the Santa Monica National Recreation Area, which would include the Rim of the Valley. “I am very pleased to see this recommendation from the Park Service which would protect the Rim of the Valley and more than double the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA). “I also commend Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA) for his leadership in moving to expand the Recreation Area.” “Now that the study is complete, we should heed the recommendations of the Park Service. I intend to work with Congressman Schiff and my colleagues in Congress to craft legislation that would implement this expansion. It is important that urban centers have access to unspoiled natural environments. “We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to protect the natural, cultural and historical resources of this diverse area, as well as expand recreational and educational opportunities for millions of park users throughout Southern California.” Congressmen Sherman helped pass legislation sponsored by Congressman Schiff in 2008 that directed the National Park Service to conduct this special resource study of the area known as the Rim of the Valley Corridor, generally including the mountains encircling the San Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi, and Conejo Valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. As the study was drafted Schiff and Sherman made further recommendations to secure the inclusion of the Rim of the Valley, and other areas which better connect urban populations with preserved recreational park land. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park providing a variety of outdoor activities for over 33 million annual visitors. Over the years, Congressman Sherman has secured over $20 million to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. There is a crucial need to preserve sensitive habitat and recreational trails in this treasured national park. Moreover, these lands are immediately accessible to millions of urban residents in Greater Los Angeles, most of whom have never visited a national park. -30-
02.12.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Sherman (D-CA), who lives in the Porter Ranch community (site of the largest natural gas leak in history), announced that 17 members of Congress now support his Gas Storage Safety Act. Sherman’s home is about as close as any residence to the leak, which has displaced over 6,400 families. “I am glad that 17 of my colleagues have joined me in introducing legislation to improve gas storage safety,” said Congressman Sherman. “My legislation is a backstop – if the relevant federal agency does not adopt regulations using its current authority, this bill will force them to act.” The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established federal safety regulations for natural gas transportation. However, PHMSA has yet to use its existing regulatory authority regarding natural gas storage. The Gas Storage Safety Act would direct PHMSA to implement tough safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. Among the 17 new sponsors of Sherman’s legislation are 15 members of Congress from California. What follows is the complete list of the co-sponsors: 1. Jared Huffman (CA-2) 2. John Garamendi (CA-3) 3. Mike Thompson (CA-5) 4. Doris Matsui (CA-6) 5. Anna Eshoo (CA-18) 6. Zoe Lofgren (CA-19) 7. Sam Farr (CA-20) 8. Julia Brownley (CA-26) 9. Judy Chu (CA-27) 10.

02.11.2016	Washington DC –Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) who lives in the Porter Ranch community (site of the largest natural gas leak in history), released the following statement after reports that SoCalGas will soon cap the leaking well (SS.25) at the Aliso Canyon storage facility: “Before residents return home, we must be sure that air quality levels have returned to normal. When the Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) determines that the leaking well has been capped, that does not necessarily mean it will be safe for displaced families to move back home. “I am asking the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to complete a thorough testing of the air around the roughly 3,600 acre facility and the surrounding neighborhoods. Once the air quality for the entire facility and the Porter Ranch community has returned to normal, residents can feel comfortable returning back to their homes and their normal routines. “I am pleased that SoCalGas has given residents 8 days to return to their homes as opposed to their initial time frame of 48 hours – however, I do not believe the clock should start until CARB has verified safe air quality levels. “It’s not enough to seal the leak; we must test the air to the highest safety standards. There should be no unacceptable levels of mercaptan, benzene, or any volatile organic compounds found in the air. Even if SS.25 has been capped, there are many wells in this facility, and we ought to be sure none of them are leaking noxious gas.” -30-
02.10.2016	Washington DC – Following urging from Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), the Small Business Administration (SBA) made businesses near Porter Ranch eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The natural gas leak in the Aliso Canyon storage facility, run by the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), is the largest known gas leak in U.S. history, displacing over 4,000 families and hurting local businesses. The SBA can now provide loans on favorable terms to businesses that incurred economic losses as a result of the leak. These unsecured loans may have terms up to 30 years, with interest rates below 4 percent, designed to cover operational expenses. “SoCalGas should be solely responsible for the costs associated with this leak, but I am glad to see that federal assistance is immediately available to the affected businesses,” said Congressman Sherman. “The SBA can now help alleviate some of the financial hardship with loans on favorable terms. Retail establishments and home-based businesses alike are suffering because of the leak. I have talked to several residents who were forced to shut down their home-based business as a result of the leak.” “I believe that many businesses have suffered substantial economic harm. Any business may have difficulty meeting its obligations when its customers disappear as a result of an environmental health disaster. This is especially the case when those businesses were already struggling before the leak.” “I want to thank the Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) for their leadership identifying businesses in need of assistance.” Those businesses affected by the gas leak and seeking loans on favorable terms can contact my office at (818) 501-9200. -30-
02.04.2016	Washington DC –Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) who lives in the Porter Ranch community (site of the largest natural gas leak in history), wrote a letter to the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) urging them to help research and develop a natural gas additive that is less toxic than mercaptan. Mercaptan is added to natural gas so that it can be detected by its odorant qualities. However, mercaptan has caused health consequence to residents in the vicinity of the gas leak at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. “Mercaptan has many benefits including its detectability by the human nose at very low concentrations, and the fact that it does not interfere with the clean and efficient use of natural gas,” said Sherman. “However the experience of the Porter Ranch community demonstrates that when exposure is prolonged, mercaptan has toxic effects that can lead to headaches, nausea, dizziness, nosebleeds, and may cause serious, lasting health consequences.” “I would like PHMSA to use its existing research grant programs to focus on the development of an additive to natural gas that has all the benefits of mercaptan without the harmful effects.” See Sherman’s letter to PHMSA below: February 4, 2016 The Honorable Marie Therese Dominguez Administrator U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration East Building, 2nd Floor 1200 New Jersey Ave., SE Washington, DC 20590 Dear Administrator Dominguez, My congressional district has just experienced the largest known natural gas leak in the history of our country. The ongoing gas leak includes not only methane and volatile organic compounds, but methanethiol (commonly known as mercaptan). Over 4,000 families have been evacuated for periods of many months. A significant portion of the health problems experienced to date have been caused by mercaptan. Mercaptan has many benefits including its detectability by the human nose at very low concentrations, and the fact that it does not interfere with the clean and efficient use of natural gas. However the experience of the Porter Ranch community demonstrates that when exposure is prolonged, mercaptan has toxic effects. At a meeting with senior officials of your agency on January 16, 2016, I was informed that PHMSA already administers existing research grant programs. I hope you will use your existing research grant programs to focus on the development of an additive to natural gas that has all the benefits of mercaptan without the harmful effects. Very truly yours, Brad Sherman Member of Congress cc: Honorable Anthony Foxx, Secretary of Transportation
02.02.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Sherman (D-CA), who lives in the Porter Ranch community (site of the largest natural gas leak in history), will introduce the Natural Gas Storage Safety Act, legislation designed to prevent future gas leaks. Sherman’s home is about as close as any residence to the leak, which has displaced over 4,000 families. The Department of Transportation’s Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) has established federal safety regulations for natural gas transportation. However, PHMSA has yet to use its existing regulatory authority regarding natural gas storage. The Natural Gas Storage Safety Act would direct PHMSA to implement safety standards for natural gas storage facilities. Last week, Sherman spoke separately to both President Obama and Vice President Biden. They agreed that White House staff would work with Sherman toward the adoption of natural gas storage regulations under existing statutory authority. “This bill is a backstop,” said Sherman. “If PHMSA doesn’t adopt regulations using its existing authority, this bill would compel them to act.” “The natural gas leak at the Aliso Canyon storage facility is the largest in U.S. history. This disaster could have been prevented. There are currently no federal regulations for most natural gas storage facilities. State regulations are weak or non-existent. The Aliso Canyon disaster proves that we cannot leave oversight to the gas industry.”Background: On October 23, 2015, a well in the Aliso Canyon storage facility in the northern portion of Los Angeles erupted. Three months later, the methane leaking into the atmosphere continues. The earliest estimates for capping the well are a month away. Damage to the public health and environment is still being assessed. More than 4,000 families have been displaced from their homes and forced to relocate. Schools in the immediate area have been closed.Sherman’s Efforts on the Aliso Canyon Leak: Since the leak began, Sherman has worked to find the most effective way to stop the leak and implement new safety measures. Initially, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the leading federal agency, did not get involved, citing regulations claiming they had no jurisdiction in this area. Sherman’s office conducted the legal research and found a statute that did in fact give the EPA jurisdiction. Subsequently, the EPA has been involved both providing technical assistance to stop the leak and investigating the cause of the leak to learn how to better protect the public health and environment. Additionally, at the urging of Congressman Sherman and others, Governor Brown issued an emergency declaration. The chief effect of which is to give the state agencies the power to order people to do what needs to be done. Congressman Sherman also urged that businesses near the gas leak be made eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA). These loans would provide relief for businesses who incurred economic losses as a result of the gas leak. -30-
01.29.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released a statement in support of an amendment introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer that would direct Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz to lead a broad federal review of the cause and the response to the natural gas leak at Southern California Gas Company's Aliso Canyon Natural Gas storage facility Congressman Sherman’s district includes much of the Porter Ranch area of California, which has been impacted by an ongoing natural gas leak that has displaced over 4,000 households. Sherman’s home is one of the closest houses to the leak, which has been dubbed the largest in U.S. history. “I commend Senators Boxer and Feinstein’s efforts to investigate the Aliso Canyon gas leak,” said Congressman Sherman. “This is the largest known natural gas leak in U.S. history and the more we learn from this incident the better we can prepare ourselves to prevent future disasters. “This leak occurred in part due to negligent operations and lack of regulatory oversight in natural gas storage. It is my hope that this investigation will help us craft legislation to safeguard our environment and protect American families. “I hopeful the amendment will be adopted in the Senate and the bill will move to the House floor. If the amendment is not added to the bill in the Senate, I will work to include similar language in the House version. I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Boxer and Feinstein to ensure another massive leak does not happen again – in Aliso Canyon or anywhere in the nation.” -30-
01.29.2016	Baltimore, MD – In response to a question posed by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) at the 2016 Democratic Caucus Issues Conference, President Barack Obama promised to have his staff work with Sherman on natural gas storage safety standards. Sherman’s district includes the Porter Ranch area of California which has been impacted by an ongoing natural gas leak that has displaced over 2,500 households. Sherman’s California home is one of the closest houses to the leak, which has been dubbed the largest in U.S. history. Earlier in the day, also in response to a question posed by Congressman Sherman, Vice President Biden agreed to personally work with Congressman Brad Sherman to use existing statutory authority to write new national natural gas storage safety standards. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an agency within the Department of Transportation, has the authority to adopt natural gas storage safety standards (49 U.S.C. § 60101 et seq.). The Interstate Natural Gas Association has urged PHMSA to use that authority for years. To date, PHMSA has yet to assert its federal authority to regulate natural gas storage facilities. Regulations for most storage facilities, including Aliso Canyon, were left under state regulation. “The Porter Ranch gas leak, the largest in U.S. history, occurred due to negligent operations,” said Congressman Sherman. “But apparently SoCalGas complied with the weak state regulations and nonexistent federal regulatory efforts. We do not want to see another massive gas leak in future – in the Aliso Canyon facility or anywhere in the nation.” The Vice President’s speech focused on his new role in coordinating efforts to eliminate cancer. The Aliso Canyon gas leak has included benzene, a known carcinogen. -30-
01.27.2016	Sherman Oaks - On Tuesday evening, just over nine thousand Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the district were able to call in and participate in a two-way conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed constituents’ questions and concerns on a wide variety of topics, including the Porter Ranch gas leak, domestic terrorism, combating ISIS, U.S. foreign policy in Syria and the Middle East, the Iran nuclear negotiations, healthcare, and the environment. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to constituents,” said Sherman. “These types of Town Halls allow me to interact with thousands of Valley residents in a very easy and relaxed manner. Residents across the Valley were understandably concerned about the natural gas leak disaster at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. We had a productive discussion about how residents can seek compensation and assistance, and how the government can play a role in preventing future disasters.” “We also had the opportunity to discuss foreign policy and combating terrorism at home and abroad,” added Sherman. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman elicited the input of his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: Should the government be doing more to regulate energy companies to prevent environmental disasters such as the Porter Ranch gas leak? Yes: 77% No: 10% Undecided: 13%Which statement best fits your views of the legislative program of the National Rifle Association? I strongly agree: 18% I strongly disagree: 60% I have no opinion: 22%Which statement best fits your view of the legislative program of Planned Parenthood? I strongly agree: 64% I strongly disagree: 21% I have no opinion: 15% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct constituents to his district office (818) 501-9200 for further assistance in regards to personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the ninety minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail. -30-
01.26.2016	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, praised a recent vote by the Council of Europe regarding violence in Nagorno-Karabakh. The resolution, which was voted down, would have called for a process to work on resolving the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute under the Council of Europe that did not include the U.S. Prior to the vote, Congressman Sherman sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry urging opposition to the resolution. “I was pleased to see the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe rejected a proposed resolution that would have sidelined the United States in the effort to bring peace to the Caucasus,” said Congressman Sherman. “I was on the phone over the weekend with our diplomats including the Acting Assistant Secretary for European Affairs John Heffern, and the ambassadors to the U.S. from a number of European countries. I commend the State Department for working to oppose this resolution. “The resolution would have called for the substitution of the existing Minsk Group with a process under the Council of Europe that did not include the U.S. “The United States remains invested in the Minsk Group process, co-chaired by the United States, France and Russia, which remains the best forum to work towards a peaceful and equitable solution for the people of Nagorno-Karabakh.” “I will continue to stand by Artsakh and Armenia in their ongoing quest for peace and security.” A copy of a letter sent to Secretary Kerry from Congressman Sherman can be viewed here : January 22, 2016 The Honorable John F. Kerry Secretary of State U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street NW Washington, DC 20520 Re: Council of Europe – January 26 Vote – Nagorno-Karabakh Dear Secretary Kerry: The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe intends to vote January 26 on a Resolution entitled “Escalation of violence in Nagorno-Karabakh and the other occupied territories of Azerbaijan.” I urge you to oppose any move by the Council of Europe to declare the Minsk Group a failure and call for the Council of Europe to take over. The Minsk Group is a much better forum to mediate the dispute. This attempt to destroy the Minsk Group is bad for the course of peace in the Caucasus. Doing away with the Minsk Group is not only bad policy but an insult to the American people and to the hard working and dedicated diplomats at the State Department. For generations, the people of Europe have urged America to be involved in Europe. In the twentieth century, hundreds of thousands of Americans died to bring peace to Europe. Now we are being told that a group chaired by France, Russia, and the United States should be dislodged and a new group, without any involvement of the U.S., should take over. The United States has dedicated diplomats from Colin Powell and Ambassador Carey Cavanaugh, to Hillary Clinton and Ambassador Bill Burns, through John Kerry and Ambassador Jim Warlick, to bring peace to the Caucasus. Declaring that the United States State Department cannot be helpful in this effort is also an insult to the diplomats who have been involved in the Caucasus, and all of the diplomats in the United States State Department. In addition, the Resolution is terrible Caucasus policy. It was basically written by Azerbaijan. It is so far from balanced that it will set back the peace process. I know the U.S. has stated its opposition to the resolution being contemplated. I urge you to redouble these efforts over the next few days. Sincerely, Brad Sherman Member of Congress cc: Assistant Secretary Victoria Nuland
01.26.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) wrote a letter today urging Governor Jerry Brown to enforce his Aliso Canyon Gas Leak State of Emergency Proclamation in light of testimony delivered yesterday by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) contrary to that Proclamation. Yesterday, at a hearing of the Assembly Public Utilities Committee, CPUC Director Elizaveta Malashenko stated publicly that the CPUC has directed SoCalGas to hold an inventory of 15 billion cubic feet of working gas at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. As Congressman Sherman states in his letter, this falls short of Governor Brown’s order for SoCalGas to maximize daily withdrawals of natural gas. “Maximizing daily withdrawal from the storage facility is the only way to reduce pressure and thereby reduce the daily amount of the leak. Failure to withdraw natural gas from Aliso Canyon as quickly as possible creates unnecessary threats to public health,” wrote Congressman Sherman. What follows is the text of the letter:Sherman to governor re cpuc and drawdown.pdf January 22, 2016 The Honorable Jerry Brown Governor of California State Capitol, Suite 1173 Sacramento, California 95814 Dear Governor Brown, I am writing to make you aware of an alarming decision announced yesterday by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that threatens to extend the serious threat to public health already caused by the natural gas leak at the Aliso Canyon storage facility. In testimony before the Assembly Public Utilities Committee, CPUC Director Elizaveta Malashenko reported the following: Just earlier today, the CPUC notified SoCalGas that they are to withdraw working gas down to 15 billion cubic feet of working gas and then hold the inventory at that level until otherwise directed by the agencies. This decision to hold 15 billion cubic feet of working gas plus another 80 billion cubic feet of cushion gas in the Aliso Canyon storage facility as the leak continues directly contradicts your order to the CPUC in your Proclamation of a State of Emergency. As noted in my letter from January 15, the most important element of your Proclamation is paragraph 3 which directs the CPUC to ensure that SoCalGas maximizes daily withdrawal. Specifically, your Proclamation orders: 3. The California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission shall take all actions necessary to ensure that Southern California Gas Company maximizes daily withdrawals of natural gas from the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility for use or storage elsewhere. The CPUC is endangering the residents of the San Fernando Valley by violating your order. I recommend you direct the CPUC to immediately comply with the instructions in your emergency order. Maximizing daily withdrawal from the storage facility is the only way to reduce pressure and thereby reduce the daily amount of the leak. Failure to withdraw natural gas from Aliso Canyon as quickly as possible creates unnecessary threats to public health. If my office can be of any assistance, please feel free to reach out to me directly, or contact Lauren Wolman in my DC office or John Alford in my Sherman Oaks office. Thank you for your continued leadership and attention to this urgent matter. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN Member of Congress

01.21.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) wrote to the California Public Utilities Commission and California’s Independent System Operator calling for energy reliability in the Los Angeles Basin after the major gas leak at the SoCalGas Aliso Canyon storage facility. “The L.A. Basin relies heavily on the natural gas in Aliso Canyon for electricity, particularly in the summer months,” said Congressman Sherman. “Because of this leak, it is unlikely this facility will be able to play a similar role in the coming year. I am urging state officials and experts to undertake all steps and use the authority granted by the Governor’s Declaration of a State of Emergency to make sure that we do not face a choice between unsafe storage in Aliso Canyon on one hand, and a lack of electricity or reliability during the summer months on the other.” Read the full letter below: January 20, 2016 Mr. Stephen Berberich President and Chief Executive OfficerCalifornia Independent System Operator P.O. Box 639014 Folsom, CA 95763-9014 Mr. Michael Picker PresidentCalifornia Public Utilities Commission 505 Van Ness Avenue San Francisco, CA 9410 Re: Electricity Reliability After Aliso Canyon Gas Leak Dear Sirs: As you know, much of the electricity used in the Los Angeles Basin is generated by natural gas and we would expect substantial electric demand during the coming summer months. I write out of concern for power reliability for the Los Angeles Basin as a result of the Aliso Canyon gas leak. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility has in prior years played a critical role in ensuring that natural gas is available for electricity generation. It is unlikely that Aliso Canyon can play a similar role this coming summer, and it is important that we not engage in unsafe storage of natural gas at that facility. Time is short. We are limited in the number of planning steps that can actually be implemented prior to the summer 2016. Still, I urge you to undertake all steps and use the authority granted by the Governor’s Declaration of a State of Emergency to make sure that we do not face a choice between unsafe storage in Aliso Canyon on one hand, and a lack of electricity or reliability during the summer months on the other. Among the many things that you might look at are the following: correct bottlenecks and otherwise modernize electrical transmissions systems so that the Los Angeles Basin can most effectively import electricity: sweep away regulatory and red tape bottlenecks that would prevents such electric transmission; address bottlenecks that might occur in the importation of natural gas to Southern California electric generation facilities; and determine whether any electric generation facilities could be modified to burn oil or other fuel rather than natural gas without undue environmental degradation. The preceding paragraph lists several ideas some of which are mine, and some of which were brought to my attention by constituents and by those experts who briefed me on the situation. At this point, I cannot advocate for any of the alternatives set forth above, but I believe that you have the expertise to evaluate these and other ideas to make sure that the Aliso Canyon disaster does not have an adverse impact on electric reliability this summer. In the event that federal permits or any other federal action is necessary to implement any reasonable plan designed to deal with electric reliability, or any other aspect of the Aliso Canyon disaster, please let me know so that I can encourage federal agencies to take appropriate action on an expedited basis. Sincerely, Brad Sherman Member of Congress cc: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission

Following urging from Congressman Brad Sherman, the Small Business Administration (SBA) made businesses near Porter Ranch eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. The SBA can now provide loans on favorable terms to businesses that incurred economic losses as a result of the leak. These unsecured loans may have terms up to 30 years, with interest rates below 4 percent, designed to cover operational expenses. If you believe your business was impacted by the Porter Ranch gas leak please contact John Alford in Congressman Sherman’s office at (818) 501-9200. This may include individuals who work from home and opted to evacuate or individuals who lost revenue because they were unable to rent their property due to the leak. Sherman’s Actions on the Porter Ranch Gas Leak Since the leak began in October 2015, I have worked to find the most effective way to stop the leak, and implement new safety measures. Initially, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the leading federal agency, did not think that they should get involved. They cited regulations claiming they had no jurisdiction in this area. My office did the legal research and found a statute that did in fact give them jurisdiction. Since late last year, the EPA has been involved both to provide technical assistance from the federal level and hopefully to learn from this incident about how to better protect the public health and environment. Additionally, at my urging and the urging of many others, Governor Brown has issued an emergency declaration. The chief effect of which is to give the state agencies the power to order people to do what needs to be done. SoCalGas is digging a relief well and estimates that the gas leak will be resolved by late February. This time frame is unacceptable. I have recommended that SoCalGas maximize the withdrawal of gas to reduce pressure in the gas well. Extraction should not be limited to how much SoCalGas can sell. I have also urged Governor Brown to exercise his authority to ensure this is done. SoCalGas is reluctant to do this because they continue to regard the gas in the Aliso Canyon storage facility as an asset. For the people of Porter Ranch the natural gas is not an asset, it is a toxin. Learn more about Congressman Sherman's eforts on the Porter Ranch Gas Leak HERE Solutions for the Future: In this country the federal government has a natural gas transmission integrity protocol. We do not have an equally sophisticated natural gas storage protocol. And what this incident has proven is that natural gas and the mercaptan that is added to it and the volatile organic compounds that are traced in parts of it; collectively that’s a toxin. And it’s not just a matter of worrying about what might explode. We have to also worry about the effects this has on the human respiratory system. And that’s why we need to have a nationwide system that requires modern subsurface safety valves that are activated if there’s an earthquake or any other disturbance. We need to see the same level of sophistication used in dealing with a storage facility as we use for the transmission pipes. Along with my colleagues I plan to introduce and help pass legislation that will help better regulate the storage of natural gas.

01.16.2016	Washington DC –Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism released the following statement regarding the Iran prisoner swap: "This is a swap, not a gift. "This is a significant victory for those of us who care about the American hostages and their families. It is also a significant victory for an Iranian regime that has helped kill thousands of Americans and hundreds of thousands of Syrians "This deal will help Iran develop missiles and nuclear weapons in three ways: "Iran is subject to limitations on purchase of nuclear and missile technology and needs expertise to evade these controls. First Iran benefits from this deal by showing all those in its evasion network that if they get caught, they will be rescued.” "Second, the 7 individuals being released will provide Iran with significant expertise in how to evade missile and nuclear control sanctions and how not to get caught next time. "Third, this deal helps Iran's economy. European businessman will feel a little bit safer in flying to Tehran. Also, it will be harder to pass new sanctions in Congress on Iran because the hostages were the simplest and clearest reason to do so. "This prisoner swap may be part of a good foreign policy if we impose new sanctions designed to punish Iran for its illegal missile tests and dissuade Iran from killing thousands in Syria and Yemen." -30-
01.15.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) wrote a letter to Governor Jerry Brown urging him to direct the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) to maximize the daily withdrawal of natural gas, and not limit that extraction based on how much SoCalGas can sell. In the letter, Congressman Sherman noted that by declaring a “state of emergency,” the Governor now has the authority to instruct the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the California Energy Commission (CEC) to ensure that SoCalGas maximizes daily withdrawal. “I believe that maximizing daily withdrawal from the storage facility is one of the most efficient ways to ensure that the leak is stopped as soon as possible,” said Sherman. “Southern California Gas Company continues to regard the gas in the Aliso Canyon Storage Facility as an asset. For the people of Porter Ranch the gas is not an asset, it is a toxin.” “It is simply wrong to limit withdrawals of gas from the facility that can be sold in the ordinary course of business, or stored in other SoCalGas facilities. Failure to withdraw natural gas from Aliso Canyon as quickly as the infrastructure will allow creates unnecessary threats to public health and the environment.” Read Congressman Sherman’s full letter to the Governor here: sherman to governor withdraw gas.pdf
01.13.2016	Washington DC –Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) urged that businesses near the Southern California Gas Co.’s (SoCalGas) leak be made eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA). These loans would provide relief for businesses who incurred economic losses as a result of the gas leak. “SoCalGas should be solely responsible for the costs associated by this leak, but federal assistance should be made immediately available to the affected businesses,” said Congressman Sherman. “The SBA can help alleviate some of the financial hardship with loans on favorable terms. Retail establishments and home-based businesses alike suffer because of the leak. I have talked to several residents who were forced to shut down their home-based business as a result of the evacuation.” The decision to make this area eligible for loans is made by the SBA, but must come at the request of Governor Jerry Brown. In granting eligibility for these loans, the SBA can provide loans on favorable terms to affected businesses. These loans may have terms up to 30 years, with interest rates below 4 percent, designed for working capital. “I believe that many businesses have suffered substantial economic harm. Any business may have difficulty meeting its obligations when its customers disappear as a result of an environmental health disaster. This is especially the case when those businesses were already struggling before the leak.” See Congressman Sherman’s full letter the Governor Jerry Brown here: Sherman to governor re SBA.pdf
01.06.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) commended Governor Jerry Brown’s decision to declare a state of emergency regarding the leaking gas well at Southern California Gas Co.’s (“SoCalGas”) storage facility above Porter Ranch. Congressman Sherman’s staff informally urged Governor Brown’s office to help persuade Governor Brown to make this decision last week, and sent a formal detailed letter earlier today. “Governor Brown made the right call,” said Congressman Sherman. “By declaring a state of emergency, the Governor will now have the authority to direct SoCalGas to extract as much gas from the well as possible, and not limit that extraction based on how much SoCalGas can sell. The more gas extracted and incinerated, the less gas will leak into the environment and sicken residents.” “It is my hope that under new authority we can stop this leak, or diminish its damage before the completion of a reserve well in February,” Sherman added. The leak is releasing methane at a rate estimated at 110,000 pounds per hour. The noxious gas emanating from the leaking well has been sickening residents of the Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles, causing headaches, nose bleeds and dizziness. More than 2,000 Porter Ranch households have been forced to relocate, with 3,000 additional residents in the process of being relocated. The relief well, which is intended to intercept and kill the leaking well at some 8,000 feet below the ground, will not be complete until late February at the earliest.

01.06.2016	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) called on Governor Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency regarding the leaking gas well at Southern California Gas Co.’s (“SoCalGas”) storage facility above Porter Ranch. “I’m calling upon our Governor to do what is necessary to end this leak as soon as possible,” said Congressman Sherman. “Ultimately, SoCalGas should foot the bill for the repairs, but declaring a state of emergency would immediately free up resources and grant the necessary authority for state agencies to stop the leak in the most efficient possible way. There are thousands of Porter Ranch residents who wish to return to their homes immediately. For those residents, this is an emergency.” The leak is releasing methane at a rate estimated at 110,000 pounds per hour.

01.06.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, released the following statement following claims that North Korea detonated a hydrogen bomb. “Whether or not the event in North Korea was a hydrogen bomb test, it is abundantly clear that the Kim Jong Un regime has failed to live up to its international commitments and is a danger to international security. The U.S. government, regional powers—especially China—and the United Nations should exert the maximum possible pressure on North Korea to abandon its reckless nuclear program, and most importantly, prevent North Korea from proliferating to other countries.” -30-
01.05.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), sent a letter to six federal, state and local agencies, as well as the SoCalGas Company, calling for coordination and cooperation in finding a solution to the Porter Ranch gas leak. The letter is addressed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the California Department of Oil, Gas & Geothermal Resources, the California Public Utilities Commission, the South Coast Air Quality Management District, and the Southern California Gas Company. “I am asking that all parties put aside for the moment which agency has the appropriate jurisdiction here,” said Congressman Sherman. “This is not about blame or liability; this is about fixing the leak as quickly as possible. All the parties addressed in my letter have specific expertise that can help determine additional solutions to stop this leak more quickly than the relief well strategy.” “The relief well will not be complete until February, which is an unacceptable time frame. If they are not already doing so, I propose that SoCalGas withdraw as much gas from the facility as possible, and not limit that extraction based on how much they can sell. The more gas extracted and used to generate electricity, the less gas will leak into the environment.” Read Sherman’s Full Letter here:Cross Agency Letter.pdf -30-
01.04.2016	Sherman Oaks –The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responded to a request from Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) that the federal agency take action regarding a gas leak at the Southern California Gas Co. storage facility in Aliso Canyon. In a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy from December 10, 2015, Congressman Sherman urged the EPA to commence an investigation into the noxious gas leak responsible for sickening residents of the Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles, and to develop a plan to protect public health and require Southern California Gas Co. to implement that plan. Responding to Congressman Sherman’s letter of December 10, the EPA states that it sent an information request to Southern California Gas on December 18 and an investigation is currently under way. Additionally, the EPA has dispatched two on-scene coordinators to tour the site and is now participating in daily operational calls with state and local regulators “to stay abreast of developments in controlling the gas and assisting local residents.” “This leak has gone on far too long, and action needs to be taken,” said Congressman Sherman. “This is about more than just a bad smell; there are serious health and environmental concerns. I’m pleased that the EPA has recognized the urgency of this issue, and I am hopeful that a plan can be worked out with SoCal Gas to put a stop to this leak. Next year, I will begin the effort to adopt stronger national standards for the safe storage and transmission of natural gas.” The EPA says it stands ready to help in any way pending the results of their investigation. On Wednesday, Congressman Sherman will be receiving a briefing by David Bunn, State Director, California Department of Conservation and Al Walker, Senior Engineer, California Department of Conservation, Division of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources. Congressman Sherman will also be meeting with experts from Southern California Gas Co. Both Congressman Sherman’s letter and responseEPA Letter and Response.pdf:
01.04.2016	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, released the following statement following news of terrorist attacks against India. “I strongly condemn the terrorist attacks on India’s Pathankot military base as well as on the Indian Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. There is speculation that these attacks might be in reaction to positive outcomes from Prime Minister Modi’s recent visits Afghanistan and Pakistan.” “I strongly encourage the governments in the region to make every effort to find the terrorists that carried out these attacks and bring them to justice. These attacks are a stark reminder of the ongoing danger terrorism poses throughout much of the world. The United States should continue to assist these governments and ensure they can combat this scourge.” -30-
12.18.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the Asia Subcommittee, praised the Administration’s decision to sell $1.83 billion in arms to Taiwan, including two Navy Perry-class frigates. Last week, Congressman Sherman and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA) introduced The Taiwan Naval Support Act, legislation designed to cause this action. The bill, which unanimously passed the House Foreign Affairs Committee, would have required the President to submit a timeframe for the sale of arms to Taiwan, including two surplus U.S. naval vessels. The transfer was initially authorized by the Naval Vessel Transfer Act, but no action had been taken for over a year. “The purpose of the bill was to prod the Administration to transfer these important warships. I’m pleased the Administration has done just that. As I said in Committee, after all these delays, it was time to transfer the friggin frigates.” “The fact that China is responding with bluster and threats shows how important this transfer is. The more bellicose China’s rhetoric, the more clear it is we need to provide Taiwan with the tools it needs for its defense.” “If China takes any action against any American company involved in the arms transfer, we must impose tariffs on Chinese goods equal to at least ten times the effect of Chinese sanctions,” said Congressman Sherman.“Chairman Royce has been a forceful and tireless advocate for transferring the frigates and other defense items to Taiwan,” Sherman added. The Sherman-Royce legislation was introduced with the support of Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY), the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), the Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee.

12.18.2015	Washington DC –The Policyholder Protection Act introduced by Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) and Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) passed the House and Senate today and is expected to be signed into law as part of the Omnibus spending bill. “The bipartisan passage of this legislation proves that there is still room for common sense legislation that protects consumers,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is unfair to policy holders at risk, because of the actions of some Wall Street firm. That is why the assets of an insurance company should be walled off from the risky practices of their affiliated financial institutions. The assets of an insurance company are needed to pay claims of their policyholders, and those dollars should not be jeopardized by complex bets, risk taking, or poor management elsewhere within a large financial firm. I want to thank Congressman Posey for his great work and leadership on this bill.”The Policyholder Protection Act affirms that resources from an insurance company may not be used to bail out an affiliated financial institution from liquidation under Title II of Dodd-Frank – unless the state insurance commissioner consents. This bill clarifies Dodd-Frank to ensure that resources set aside to satisfy insurance policyholder claims cannot be used to satisfy non-insurance liabilities within a holding company system. -30-
12.16.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Los Angeles), former chair of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and senior member of House Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following statement: There are important differences between the email received by school officials in Los Angeles and those received by school officials in New York City – the New York City email was considerably less credible:: The Los Angeles email claims that the author had 32 accomplices ready to strike on Tuesday. In the New York email the author claims to have 138 accomplices. To think that there would be a conspiracy in the Los Angeles involving 33 individuals, including the email author, without the federal government having at least heard enough to raise the threat level is somewhat unlikely. To think that there would be a conspiracy in the New York area involving 139 active shooters ready to act on a single day, all without the federal government at least raising the threat level, is not credible at all. The email author claims to be a student of the “Los Angeles Unified district.” This is terminology that someone familiar with the Los Angeles schools would use. In the other email, the author claims to be a student of the “New York City School District.” Someone who is actually familiar with the New York would use the term “New York City Schools” or “DOE” (Department of Education). The email was received at roughly 10 pm Monday night in Los Angeles, meaning that Los Angeles officials had enough time to announce the closure of schools before they opened the next morning, thus forcing L.A. School Officials to make a decision. Apparently the New York email was received at 5am local time (and may not have been read until later) when it was too late to close the New York City Schools. A few hours later, New York City became aware that a near identical email had been sent to Los Angeles, thus indicating that both emails were not credibleThere are at least three reasons to believe that the author of the email may not be a Muslim: 1. The Los Angeles email says it is “from”an email name that includes an obscene word for a body part. No devout Muslim, nor a Muslim extremist claiming to be devout, would use such an email name. 2. The email contains several typos but most significantly fails on one occasion to capitalize the word “Allah.” A devout Muslim, or an extremist Muslim claiming to be devout, would be careful to capitalize the word “Allah.” 3. The email does not read like any of the missives from Islamic extremists. It does not quote any portion of the Quran nor allude to any incident in the life of Muhammad. The author of the email does not demonstrate any understanding of Islam. The following are comments on the credibility of the threats made in the attack: The claim by the author to have nerve gas agent is not credible. The claim by the author to have “32” Los Angeles accomplices in a conspiracy in which the federal government had not even detected an increase in chatter is not credible. The claim in the New York email to have a 138 accomplices is fanciful. Just because some portions of each email appear to be false does not mean that school officials could conclude that all of the assertions in the email are false, nor could they assume there was not some plot to kill some students at some schools.
12.10.2015	Sherman Oaks – Today Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) called on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take action regarding a gas leak at the Southern California Gas Co storage facility in Aliso Canyon. In a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, Congressman Sherman noted that the leaking facility has been emanating noxious gas for over six weeks, and has been sickening residents of the Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles. Sherman’s letter urges the EPA to commence an investigation, develop a plan to protect public health and require Southern California Gas Co. to implement that plan. “This gas leak is not just a smelly nuisance, it’s a public health concern,” said Congressman Sherman. “There have been reports of dizziness, headaches, and nose bleeds in the area – even causing some resident to relocate. The EPA should be investigating the cause of this leak and help propose action to fix the situation before more people become ill.” A preliminary Environmental Health Assessment by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed the health threat, noting the “neurological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms that may result from the inhalation.” Read Congressman Sherman’s Letter to the EPA Below: December 10, 2015 The Honorable Gina McCarthy Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, DC 20460 Dear Administrator McCarthy: I am writing to request that the Environmental Protection Agency immediately investigate the unresolved gas leak at the Southern California Gas Co. natural gas storage facility in Aliso Canyon. I ask that the Environmental Protection Agency investigate the cause of the leak, and propose action to mitigate the threat to public health, and expedite the leak’s repair. For over six weeks, noxious gas emanating from a leaking well has been sickening residents of the Porter Ranch neighborhood of Los Angeles, causing headaches, nose bleeds and dizziness[1][2]. A preliminary Environmental Health Assessment by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has confirmed the health threat, noting the “neurological, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms that may result from the inhalation.” More than 2,800 residents have inquired about relocation and over 1,200 have already relocated. The situation will only worsen, as Southern California Gas Co. estimates that the leak could continue for months. The California Air Resources Board estimates that the leak is responsible for nearly 25% of California’s daily methane emissions; as you know, methane is an important cause of global climate change. I am also concerned about reports of radon gas and benzene being released into the air. An immediate investigation has become necessary due to the prolonged period of the leak, the apparent health impacts, and the lack of certainty over when the leak can be stopped. I am aware that 40 CFR § 68.3 excludes storage facilities from regulation under the Risk Management Program. However, we believe that 42 U.S. Code § 7603, which allows the EPA to “issue such orders as may be necessary to protect public health or welfare or the environment,” controls the determination here. A statutory provision inherently trumps any regulation. To be even clearer, the statue explicitly states, “Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Administrator… may… take such other action as may be necessary.” Accordingly, it seems clear that you have the statutory authority to: Commence an investigation, Determine all necessary steps to protect the environment and public health, and Require Southern California Gas Co. to implement all such steps.

12.09.2015	Washington DC – Today the Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed the Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act, legislation introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, and Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), current Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism. The legislation would require the President to submit to Congress a strategy to combat terrorists’ use of social media and a policy to enhance collaboration between the federal government and social media companies to counter terrorist activities online. “The State Departments current strategy of combating terrorist propaganda online is not working – this is not my opinion, it is the opinion of the State Department’s internal review. ISIS and other terrorist groups continue to use social media to spread their hateful rhetoric and recruit new fighters. We are losing a popularity contest to people who behead women. They boast their heinous acts, and prey upon vulnerable individuals who may become radicalized by their message. This legislation mandates the creation of a new and sophisticated plan to identify how terrorists are using social media, disrupt that activity, and disseminate counter messaging. “Social media companies also have a role in this. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have made changes to take down harmful content, but that won’t work unless the State Department is identifying the harmful content. The only thing worse than playing whack-a-mole, is to not whack the moles. Every time we see a terrorist operating on social media we should be taking it down before it is seen by the intended audience.” “It is also my hope that this legislation will prompt the State Department to hire experts in Islamic theology and in Islamic jurisprudence to combat the ISIS message,” said Congressman Sherman. Without a comprehensive plan, the presence and sophistication of terror groups on social media will continue to grow. The Wilson Center estimates that 90 percent of online terrorist activities occur over public social media platforms. The Brookings Institution found that ISIS supporters used an estimated 46,000 Twitter accounts between September and December 2014 alone. The legislation was also sponsored by Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Elliot Engel (D-NY), Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and eight other members.

12.09.2015	Washington DC – Today the House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously passed The Taiwan Naval Support Act. The bill was introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the second ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The bill would require the President to submit a timeframe for the sale of two surplus U.S. naval vessels to Taiwan. Once enacted the bill would give the President 30 days to provide a timeline for the vessel transfer which has stalled for nearly a year since the initial authorization was enacted by the Naval Vessel Transfer Act. “Taiwan faces real threats from China, and we should provide them the tools to defend themselves,” said Congressman Sherman. “They are not asking for U.S. troop deployment or funding, they are asking to buy two frigates that have been authorized for transfer. The time has come to transfer the friggin frigates.” “The administration has failed to notify Congress of its intent to transfer these vessels, which are critical to bolstering Taiwan’s defense and ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait,” added Chairman Royce. “This nearly year-long delay has caused unnecessary setbacks, complicating planning for the U.S. and Taiwan Navy. It is well beyond time for the administration to make good on our commitment to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership.” The Sherman-Royce legislation was introduced with the support of Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY), the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), the Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee.

12.02.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the second ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Asia, along with Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA), Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced the Taiwan Naval Support Act, legislation that would force the Administration to comply with existing law and send authorized naval defense articles to Taiwan. The bill comes after the Administration has delayed sending two frigates from the United States to Taiwan for nearly two years. The bill would direct the President to submit a timeframe for the transfer of U.S. naval vessels to Taiwan. Once enacted the bill would give the President 30 days to provide a timeline for the vessel transfer which has stalled since the initial directive was enacted by the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2013. “The Administration ought to recognize the laws and directives passed by Congress to provide Taiwan the military equipment it needs to help secure our shared security objectives,” said Congressman Sherman. “The United States should not delay in securing the safety of our democratic allies around the world.”“It is time for the Obama administration to act,” said Chairman Royce. “Ensuring the transfer of these frigates to Taiwan is critical to bolstering its defense and ensuring peace in the Taiwan Strait. That’s why I led the House in passing naval vessel transfer legislation last year, and visited one of the ships – the USS Gary – in San Diego in June. Our Democratic allies in Taiwan have been waiting for more than a year for these frigates. This important bill will press the administration to make good on our commitment to strengthen the U.S.-Taiwan partnership.” The Sherman-Royce legislation was introduced with the support of Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY), the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), the Chairman of the Asia Subcommittee. -30-
11.23.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement on the killing of Dr. Anwar Leghari, a leader of the Sindh United Party (SUP). "I wish to express my sympathy to those who lost loved ones in the violence that accompanied local elections in the Sindh and Punjab provinces," said Congressman Sherman. "Among the five killed was Dr. Anwar Leghari - a leader of the Sindh United Party (SUP) - whose brother, Munawar (Sufi) Laghari, is a close personal friend with whom I have worked together on human rights issues concerning the Sindhi people in Pakistan. I know that Dr. Leghari, a physician, was a man of peace who sought to improve the lives of the Sindhi people." "While it is not certain at this point who carried out these murders, I call on the Government of Pakistan to conduct a thorough investigation that brings the perpetrators to justice. The Government of Pakistan, from the highest levels down, must ensure that violence is not part of their elections processes, and must protect all election participants from violence, whatever its motivation."
11.17.2015	Washington DC –The Policyholder Protection Act introduced by Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) and Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) passed the House. “The bipartisan passage of this legislation proves that there is still room for common sense legislation that protects consumers,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is my hope that the Senate will take up this legislation with similar success. It is unfair to policy holders at risk, because of the actions of some Wall Street firm. That is why the assets of an insurance company should be walled off from the risky practices of their affiliated financial institutions. The assets of an insurance company are needed to pay claims of their policyholders, and those dollars should not be jeopardized by complex bets, risk taking, or poor management elsewhere within a large financial firm. I want to thank Congressman Posey for his great work and leadership on this bill.”The Policyholder Protection Act affirms that resources from an insurance company may not be used to bail out an affiliated financial institution from liquidation under Title II of Dodd-Frank – unless the state insurance commissioner consents. This bill clarifies Dodd-Frank to ensure that resources set aside to satisfy insurance policyholder claims cannot be used to satisfy non-insurance liabilities within a holding company system. -30-
11.17.2015	Congressman Brad Sherman responds to questions at his most recent Town Hall Meeting Sherman Oaks, CA – On Sunday, November 15th, 2015, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall meeting at Millikan Middle School in Sherman Oaks, fielding questions from some of the approximately 400 constituents who attended. Congressman Sherman has held over 200 Town Hall Meetings. Much of the Town Hall was spent discussing concerns that have arisen as a result of the tragic terrorist attacks in Paris. Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions from constituents regarding a wide range of topics including immigration, terrorism, the Syrian refugee crisis, veteran’s issues, airport noise in the Valley, American foreign policy in the Middle-East and many other matters facing Congress. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. Many residents were understandably concerned and upset by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. This meeting provided a good forum to reflect on those attacks, and discuss its impact on American foreign policy,” said Sherman regarding the town hall. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs and reflect Valley values in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.” Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies. Sherman also directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.
11.16.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade released the following statement on the terrorist attacks in Paris. "My deepest sympathies go out to the victims and families of these senseless attacks. The American people stand by the people of France and remain steadfast in our commitment to a world free from terror. These attacks were carried out by extremists who must be found and brought to justice."

11.09.2015	Washington DC – November 10th marks the 37th anniversary of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. “The Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area has been of tremendous benefit to Valley residents who can enjoy hiking and other outdoor activities in this pristine environment.” said Congressman Sherman. “It’s important that we preserve the natural environment for future generations. That is why I support expanding the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor. We have an once-in-a-lifetime chance to protect the natural, cultural and historical resources of this diverse area, as well as expand recreational and educational opportunities for millions of park users throughout Southern California. There are so many valuable resources within the study area that are suitable additions to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, including the significant wildlife corridor linkage through the Simi Hills, the Chatsworth Reservoir, the Santa Susana Mountains range, and Griffith Park.” The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park providing a variety of outdoor activities for over 33 million annual visitors. Over the years, Congressman Sherman has secured over $20 million to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. Congressman Sherman believes there is a crucial need to preserve sensitive habitat and recreational trails in this treasured national park. Moreover, these lands are immediately accessible to millions of urban residents in Greater Los Angeles, most of whom have never visited a national park. -30-
11.04.2015	Washington DC –The Policyholder Protection Act introduced by Congressman Bill Posey (R-FL) and Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) unanimously passed the House Financial Services committee by a vote of 57-0. “The unanimous passage of this legislation in Committee proves that there is still room for common sense legislation that protects consumers from the greed and overreach of large financial institutions,” said Congressman Sherman. “The assets of an insurance company should be walled off from the risky practices of their affiliated financial institutions. The assets of an insurance company are needed to pay claims of their policyholders, and those dollars should not be jeopardized by complex bets, risk taking, or poor management elsewhere within a large financial firm.

11.04.2015	Sherman Oaks – October 29th marks the 10th anniversary of the Metro Orange Line. “I am very pleased with the success of the Metro Orange Line which has served commuters in Valley for the last decade,” said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). “However, much work is still needed to alleviate congestion and improve transit service throughout the San Fernando Valley. Our next priority should be to build a subway through the Sepulveda Pass, from the Valley to LAX, with a connection in West Los Angeles to the Purple Line, now under construction. Well-designed projects not only provide jobs for those who build them, but improve our regional economy and competitiveness, and thus help create jobs in all economic sectors.” The Orange line has rapidly become one of the nation’s most successful Bus Rapid Transit Lines, accommodating 74 million boardings in the last decade, according to LA Metro. Congressman Sherman secured federal funds for construction of the Orange Line, which now carries a daily average of 30,000 riders along a dedicated bus way from Warner Center in Woodland Hills to the North Hollywood Red Line Station. That project also included a bicycle and pedestrian path, as well as the Warner Center Transit Hub. In 2012 the Orange Line was extended from the Warner Center area to the Chatsworth Metrolink Station. -30-
10.30.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement after news of rocket attacks at Camp Liberty in Iraq. “I am deeply troubled by the recent, deadly attacks on civilians at Camp Liberty in Iraq.” “The Iraqi government should take immediate action to aid those wounded, and assist the families of those who lost their lives. As threats and attacks continue from neighboring Iran, the Iraqi government should improve safety for Camp Liberty. Any additional funds provided by the United States to Iraq should be contingent upon the Iraqi government’s promise to provide safety for the camp.”
10.15.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement regarding recent violent attacks in Israel: “The loss of life in Israel is tragic and it must be stopped. We must call on Palestinian officials to cease the incitement to violence. I support Israel’s right to defend itself and all its citizens from attacks, and I urge that the Palestinian Authority, from President Abbas on down, to do everything in its power to prevent attacks from areas that it controls. No one can justify terrorist-style attacks on any basis – but it is particularly outrageous when, as in this case, the violence is being incited by false rumors about holy sites.”
10.08.2015	Washington DC – Today, The Homebuyers Assistance Act, a bill introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Congressman French Hill (R-AR), passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 303 to 121. Sherman, a senior member of the Financial Services Committee, designed the bill to assist smaller title and escrow companies as well as small lenders in complying with the a complicated new regulation issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB now requires new disclosure forms for every home sale occurring after October 3, 2015. Smaller companies have said that they may be out of business if they were required to comply with all 1,888 pages of this regulation immediately. This bill will make sure that homebuyers will have a wide variety of lenders, title and escrow companies to rely on. “These new forms and regulations are complicated,” said Congressman Sherman. “Smaller lenders and title companies are complying in good faith with a 1,888 page regulation that is only now being tested in real life home closings. The Hill-Sherman bill tells these smaller lenders, title and escrow companies to implement the new forms immediately. However, if they act in good faith but make unintentional mistakes, they will not be subject to retribution for those mistakes made prior to February 1, 2016. “When a ship is first launched, it's typical to take it out on a ‘shakedown cruise’ to make sure that everything is working as it should,” Sherman added. “These regulations are at least as complicated as the most complex sea-worthy vessel. This bill says there is no retribution for good faith efforts. This is especially important for smaller companies that do not have the resources to quickly comply with new government regulations. This grace period will allow smaller lenders and mortgage companies to better compete in the market place and will ultimately benefit the consumer.” -30-
10.07.2015	Washington DC – Following news of an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and former chairman of the Subcommittee on Trade, released the following statement: “If our previous free trade deals are any indication of what we can expect from the TPP, American workers are in serious trouble. “I opposed NAFTA, CAFTA, KORUS, MFN for China, and a host of other trade deals we have adopted over the last two decades. These trade deals were sold on the premise that they would expand U.S. job growth and boost American exports; instead we’ve seen massive trade deficits and enormous job losses. “Now we are confronted with TPP - a partnership between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries, and one of the largest so-called ‘free trade’ agreements ever negotiated. “I was one of the first to oppose the ‘fast track’ negotiating authority which allowed the administration to expedite TPP, and deny Congress adequate review time or the ability to make changes to the deal. Worse yet, whoever is elected to be the next president will have the same authority until 2021 to negotiate bad trade policies. “Many aspects of the deal concern me, including the risk of major job loss in America, an expanding U.S. trade deficit, as well as serious challenges to Buy American provisions, food safety, environmental protection, and intellectual property rights. “This deal will not require major changes from countries that have poor labor records and commit major human rights abuses, particularly Vietnam. Further, currency manipulation, a major contributor to the global U.S. trade deficit, is not adequately addressed by the TPP agreement. “In particular, I am deeply concerned about the effect TPP may have on our trade balances with Japan, China and Vietnam. “Some have falsely argued that TPP would help contain China’s growing economic influence and power in the Pacific Rim. In reality, this agreement would expand Chinese exports to the United States. Goods made mostly in China and finished in another Asian country would have duty-free access to the U.S. market. It would actually further encourage multinationals to move production to China. “We must abandon the failed, so-called ‘free trade’ policies of the past and take a new direction. We need a trade policy that creates and keeps good paying jobs here for American working families. We need balanced trade.” “Once the President submits the TPP agreement, Congress will have to review it. I will do everything in my power to encourage my colleagues to support American workers and reject the TPP.” -30-
09.22.2015	Congressman Sherman reponds to questions at his most recent Town Hall Meeting Sherman Oaks, CA – On Sunday, September 20tht, 2015, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall meeting at Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa, fielding questions from some of the approximately 500 constituents who attended. Congressman Sherman has held over 200 Town Hall Meetings. Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including immigration, the Iran Nuclear Deal, foreign policy, taxes, the economy, budget, Social Security, and Medicare, as well as other matters facing Congress. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress.

09.02.2015	Washington D.C. - Congressman Sherman delivered a speech concerning his views on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran’s nuclear program at a Valley Beth Shalom, a synagogue in the San Fernando Valley. A slightly edited version of this address is attached below. Valley Beth Shalom, Encino CA Delivered August 15, 2015; Edited August 31, 2015 I’m Brad Sherman from America’s best named city, Sherman Oaks. Rabbi, thank you for inviting me here. Thank you for allocating 45 minutes -- believe it or not I have a lot of difficulty cutting this speech down to 45 minutes. Other Matters First, a few Middle East issues aside from Iran. Last year I joined with others to introduce The Emergency Iron Dome Replenishment Act, and we provided wherewithal for Israel to replace those expensive but very valuable weapons. This year I cosponsored The Jerusalem Embassy Act because America’s embassy in Israel should be in the eternal capital of the Jewish people. Now some of you are aware that there’s occasionally some miscommunication between our government and the government of Israel; clearly communication would be better if our embassy was in Jerusalem, the eternal capital of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years. I wrote the US Israel Energy Cooperation Act [1] to provide support for joint Israeli-American efforts to foster inventions and improvements to existing technology to help end the world’s addiction to petroleum. This is not only a critical environmental issue, it is a critical national security issue for both countries, because for reasons only the greatest rabbis understand, HaShem put the oil in all the wrong places. Of course those of you following the details of energy policy know that HaShem seems to have put some natural gas in some of the right places, but that still needs to be developed. And finally there’s the issue that Jewish students face on campuses throughout this country. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act is designed to protect all students from bigotry, but its words say “race or national origin.” I worked with others for several years, and we got a clear determination from the U.S. Department of Education that Jews are not just a people who follow a religion, we are a people. Am Yisrael. But this distinction doesn’t work without a definition of anti-Semitism, because every anti-Semite simply claims to be merely anti-Zionist. And that’s why we have to work both locally at UCLA and nationwide to get them to adopt for Title VI purposes a definition of anti-Semitism-- one that recognizes that it is indeed anti-Semitic to say that Jews are the only people in the world not entitled to self-determination and not entitled to their own state. We have united behind the State Department’s definition of anti-Semitism, which does draw that distinction, and has the additional advantage of being written more than anyone else by my wife Lisa, who was Deputy Envoy for Global Anti-Semitism at the State Department. Iran Deal – The Background Now a little background about the Iran agreement, because without understanding the international finance, nuclear physics, constitutional and international law at play, the pieces don’t fit together. First, international finance: what are sanctions? People throw around sanctions as if it’s something we can turn up or turn down at will. And that’s true as to “primary sanctions.” Americans cannot buy any Iranian oil, and we haven’t since the mid-1990s. Unless you have an old Corvette, your car has never tasted Iranian oil. Those are primary sanctions. That’s not nearly enough. Sanctions are effective only when, through pressure and persuasion, we get European and Asian oil companies and banks to suspend their profitable business relationships with Iran. Now other countries can get a little insulted when the United States Congress tells their companies what to do. And presidents have been reluctant to go eyeball to eyeball and say “we’ll shut down ultimately the entire international finance system if your companies don’t do what we tell them to do.” So we haven’t really sanctioned major foreign oil companies who have done business with Iran. What we’ve done more recently is persuade and pressure countries around the world to forgo business with Iran (I will get to how we did that in a while). The bottom line is sanctions are useful only if Europe and Asia are participating. And it requires not only tough sanctions written by Congress, but good persuasion by President Obama and his team. They have done a better job than any of the prior administrations in persuading European and Asian governments to be on our side with this. And remember, no matter what Congress does, the Obama team will be telling European and Asian companies that now they should do business with Iran, subject to the deal.Nuclear physics. Three things you need to be a nuclear power: fissile material, weaponization, and a delivery system. The big one is fissile material. I’ll explain why. What is fissile material? You start with uranium ore, you go up to Yellowcake, you go to low enriched uranium by spinning centrifuges, which separate the uranium 235 from uranium 238 and other impurities, and you’ve got to get up to 3% or so to have fuel for a nuclear power plant; you’ve got to get up to 90% or more to have the components for a nuclear weapon. So people think they draw some solace from this saying “well, you go up to 3%, that’s a long way from 90%.” It doesn’t work that way. To get from natural uranium up to 3% is actually most of the effort. Going from 3 percent to 90 percent takes less time and effort than going from natural uranium to 3-5 percent, what is referred to as low enriched uranium suitable as fuel for a nuclear reactor. So what do we learn from this: a robust “peaceful” program gets you almost to nuclear weapons grade uranium. Weaponization is the process of taking that enriched uranium, building it into a ball, and having a system to implode it to bring it to critical mass. I’d like to think that we can stop weaponization, but Iran is already much of the way there. It is easier to do the weaponization piece than to get the fissile material, and weaponization research can be done in a much smaller facility and is much harder to catch. Weaponization will take a few additional months after Iran has the fissile material, but it is not the way to stop them from becoming a nuclear power. Finally, Iran wants intercontinental ballistic missiles. That is the symbol of being a great tyranny. But the fact is, you can smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana. Iran will always have a nuclear delivery system, as long as there are a couple of guys who want 72 virgins apiece. So you’ve got to focus on the fissile material, and the discussion about centrifuges and stockpiles is about the fissile material, mostly enriched uranium and, to a lesser extent, plutonium, the other fissile material that can be used to create nuclear weapons.[2] Now when we talk about the fissile material, it’s counter intuitive, but what you need for a robust peaceful electronic generation program is much larger than what you need for a weapons program. In fact, to electrify a city or two and have enough fuel to do so dwarfs the amount of fissile material you need for a robust nuclear bomb program. So if you allow Iran to have a complete and robust peaceful program, you’re allowing them to grow a forest. And where else would you hide a single tree? And the one tree in this example is enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon.Now as to law. Under U.S. law, the only thing that’s binding on the U.S. is a treaty that’s designed as a treaty, says its’ a treaty, is submitted to the Senate for ratification and gets a 2/3 positive vote. This Deal is not a treaty. It has no standing under U.S. law except as a handshake from our President. As a man of honor we’d expect him to follow it. What’s confusing is that much of the talk here is about whether there will be a 2/3 vote against the agreement to override a veto. And this confusion is our enemy; I’ll explain why in a bit. But the Deal is not going to get a 2/3 positive vote, the issue is whether it gets a 2/3 negative vote. But the issue is how do you explain to the general public that this Deal is not the same thing as a treaty? Especially if it gets a one-third positive vote; that sounds like the two-thirds vote needed to ratify a treaty. International law. The Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties provides a hierarchy of agreements. This Deal is not a ratified treaty, it is not an unratified treaty, it is not an executive-legislative agreement; it is the lowest form of international handshake. But appearances matter. We are the good guys and we feel we must follow international law. You can be sure that Iran will violate this agreement, or not, based on whether it’s in its interest or whether they think they will get caught. No one around the Ayatollah will say “Oh, that would be in violation of international law.” But the good guys are constrained by international law. And if it appears in the mind of the publics in the United States and countries around the world that we are bound to this agreement, it will be more difficult for us to view ourselves as free to take action. History of Sanctions Now a little brief history of our use of sanctions against Iran. In 1996 we passed the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which we enforced against Libya. We stopped Libya’s program. We never applied it against Iran. Not in the tail end of the Clinton Administration, not a day during the entire George W. Bush Administration, not at the beginning of the Obama Administration. You think I’m crazy, because I just said George W. Bush violated U.S. law to avoid sanctioning Iran. But the law didn’t impose sanctions on Iran. The law mandated sanctions on the multinational oil companies that did business with Iran. American presidents have been reluctant -- as a matter of fact they’ve refused -- to sanction international oil companies, in part because of their connections there, and in part because their foreign governments regarded it as offensive. Only as the prospect of an Iranian nuclear bomb grew near have we gotten other countries on our side. Now when I got to Congress in 1997 I went on the record after a few months and said the Iranian nuclear program was the number one threat to American national security. It has been my number one issue for 19 years. Many of you think that under this yarmulke I am afflicted with male-pattern baldness. This is not the case. This is what happens from banging my head into every wall in Washington trying to pass additional sanctions legislation and getting them to enforce the sanctions we already have. Some of you are aware that although I continue to have this hair loss, it hasn’t increased since about 2012, because that’s when we finally got effective sanctions. Three administrations fought Congress. We finally passed banking sanctions, and to the credit of this Administration, although they opposed them, once we passed them, they enforced them. We put some real pressure on Iran. We’ve used what turns out to be the most effective economic lever of the United States, our indispensable position with regard to the international banking system, and the fact that international transactions have to go through our system. Continuing with that history, 21 months ago we entered into an agreement to negotiate an agreement. During that time we had the preliminary Joint Plan of Action, which was the first time we even slowed Iran’s efforts to accumulate fissile material. (Actually, we did one other thing and that was the CIA and Mossad had a computer virus that slowed them down for about a year, but that’s not something we can repeat.) During these 21 months, the Administration put more time and effort and gave a higher priority to stopping Iran’s nuclear program -- not only more than any Administration before it, they actually put more time and effort into this than any other international issue. More time than the Ukraine, more effort than stopping ISIS, a higher priority than the big Asian trade deal. As a Jew and supporter of Israel, I’m appreciative of the prioritization and the time and the effort that the Administration has put in. They’ve been willing to impose sanctions that other administrations have not, and as I said they enforced the sanctions that they once opposed. And they brought us a deal. Examination of the Deal: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly So let’s take a look at the deal. It is the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good and the bad are particularly pronounced in the first year or two; next decade it gets ugly. And I realize this is a controversial deal, and there are very few things everyone agrees on. But everybody agrees that the deal is at least better in the first year or two, and worse next decade. The Good. A lot of people hate this deal so much they don’t even acknowledge there is some good in it. Iran has to give up 97% of its current stockpile of low enriched uranium and it has to decommission 2/3 of its centrifuges. Its current stockpile of low enriched uranium is enough to create roughly 10 bombs if they convert it from low enriched to highly enriched uranium. And their centrifuge arrays are sufficient to enrich enough uranium for about one bomb every four months. Getting rid of those stockpiles and decommissioning those centrifuges is no small thing, and we can verify what happens to the stockpile and centrifuges. The Bad. Iran gets its hands on at least $56 billion of its own money (others estimate the amount is much higher). Now there are reports that it’s a larger sum. These are the briefings we get from the Treasury Department; $56 billion is a lot of money. What’s Iran going to do with it? First, they’re going to help their own people. They’ve made a lot of promises. They are dancing in the streets. They’ve got to come through to some degree. Second, graft and corruption. This is the Iranian government we’re talking about. Third, they’re going to kill a lot of Sunni Muslims, some of whom deserve it, most of whom do not. Iran has done more to kill ISIS fighters than we have, and they will do even more as this deal goes through. And Iran is also the mainstay of the Assad regime in Syria, which is killing thousands of innocent people every month. They will kill Sunni Muslims. And what’s left over will be used for terrorism against Americans and Jews. And it’s not just the $56 billion they get up front. Iran will be increasing its oil sales; once they get going, we’re talking about another $20 billion a year that they would not have otherwise had. So the deal is good and bad. You could make an argument that that balances out and that we should accept the good with the bad in the first two years. But then next decade it gets ugly.The Ugly. 13 to 15 years from now, Iran under this agreement is allowed to have as many centrifuges as it wants and has a perfect excuse to have well over 100,000 centrifuges; remember this deal initially limits them to about 6,000. This President will sleep well during the rest of his term because Iran will have only 6,000 centrifuges, and they’re only IR-1 centrifuges. But a future President is going to be asked to try to get to sleep knowing Iran has 100,000 centrifuges and they’re not the IR-1’s, they’re the IR-8’s which are ten times more efficient. So you’re talking about more than ten times the number, and more than ten times the efficiency. And Iran has a near perfect excuse to have a 100,000 IR-8s, as I said that’s what you need to electrify a city or two. In addition, Iran will have no limits on having a heavy water reactor or a reprocessing facility. And I won’t go into the details here, but anybody who’s focused on nonproliferation goes crazy if you hear about a country doing either one of those things -- reprocessing or building heavy water reactors.[3] Breakout and Sneak-Out So, Iran will be in a position next decade for “sneak-out” and “breakout.” “Sneak-out” is the ability of Iran to get enough fissile material for a weapon without the international community knowing that it’s in violation of its international agreements. I think that next decade (and it may be very late next decade), Iran will have such a large industrial facility that it will be very difficult to prevent them from sneaking out. It’s very hard if a man is allowed to plant a forest to prevent him from stealing one tree. The other issue is breakout. Breakout is a critical term in this whole debate. The President’s argument is he’s taking Iran from a 4-month breakout to a 12-month breakout, and he is in fact accomplishing that for at least several years. What is “breakout”? Breakout is the amount of time between when Iran kicks out the inspectors, goes rogue, to the point at which they have enough material for a nuclear weapon. Under the Deal during its first two years, breakout time is lengthened to at least 12 months. But 15 years from now, breakout time will be measured in days. If you have a hundred thousand centrifuges, IR-8s, you can go from uranium ore to fissile material rather quickly. The Mediocre: The Inspection Regime So we’ve discussed the good, the bad, and the ugly. Now: the mediocre. That’s how I would describe the inspection regime. It’s not porous, it’s not blind, but it’s not what you’d want it to be. First, the proponents tell you, you get 24/7 inspection. Yes, of the declared facilities. So with Natanz, Fordow[4], the IAEA will be in there 24/7. But what really worries most people is the undeclared sites. If we have a rumor that Iran is violating the deal at a particular location, what do we do? It’s not 24/7, it’s a 24-day process. First, we have to lay all our cards on the table. Why do we think we’ve got probable cause? Now in doing that, we reveal what we know, and implicitly reveal our sources, our methods. This might result in the execution of our informant. So we’ll be reluctant to even come forward. If we do come forward, there’s a 24-day appeals process. You can clean up a lot of stuff in 24 days. I think I can clean my garage in 24 days. When it comes to most of the work Iran would do, they could clean it up. But the most important work that they would do involves using uranium which would leave a radioactive signature. And if we go through the process, if we get the inspection, we’ll be able to catch them if they use uranium that will leave a trace at an undeclared site. In addition, we do get monitoring of their uranium mining and milling process which is important looking at the front end. The Side Deal: Exposing Past Weaponization Research The next part of the inspection deal has gotten way more attention perhaps than it deserves -- the so-called “side deal” on inspections at a place called Parchin. This side deal is between the IAEA and Iran and governs a part of the process for how the IAEA, which is the UN agency that enforces nuclear deals, is going to be able to write a report by December about Iran’s previous work on weaponization, on turning enriched uranium into a bomb. No American has a copy of this side deal and no member of Congress can read it; this drives us crazy. Everyone knows that Iran conducted weaponization research in a particular building at their large military base at Parchin. While I have not been allowed to read the document, I have had its contents described to me in-depth in the secret basement room of the Rayburn Building by the Under Secretary of State, perhaps the only American who has read the side deal. I’ll tell you the side deal is not terrible, but it’s not what it should be. But the side deal relates only to how the IAEA is going to write a report on Iran’s past activities. I could write that report now. It’s going to say, beyond a shadow of a doubt for all sane people, that Iran has worked on weaponization in violation of its international agreements and its own Supreme Leader’s fatwas. But the report will contain a few weasel words. If you love the Iranian regime you can grab onto one of those words and say, “I think they didn’t do anything wrong.” So while the report has in-effect already been written, the process for gathering the information for the report is subject to a side deal. Congress doesn’t get to read this side deal, but we already know what’s in the report. What Should One Congressman Do? So good, bad, and ugly: what do we do? What now? The press is all over me, “Sherman, is it a good deal, is it a bad deal? What grade do you give the president? Could somebody else have gotten a better deal?” These are questions for historians. We don’t vote in Congress on what grade to give the President. What’s done is done. The question is what do we do now. Then there are foreign policy writers who say “well, now that the deal is signed, what should America do?” And they fantasize that they themselves are in control of all of American foreign policy. Well that’s an interesting fantasy. The fact is no one person is in control of all of American foreign policy, least of all the scholars who write these articles. The President is in the major position to control American foreign policy. And I’ll tell you a secret. He loves this deal. I spent an hour with him one-on-one earlier this month. I can judge the feelings of the person I’m talking to. President Obama loves this Deal. He would have accepted a lesser deal. He will do everything possible to defend it, and he will do everything possible to implement it. So the question is not what should America do, it’s what should Congress do. What should Congress do in a world where the President loves the deal and the rest of the world is supportive of the deal as well. But I’m not all of Congress. The real question is: what should Sherman do within Congress? Well what does Congress look like right now? 55% to 65% of Congress is opposed to this deal and ready to vote against it. That means all the Republicans, and a smattering of beleaguered Democrats. There are those who think that maybe you could get to 67.7% of each house, enough to override the certain veto. I don’t think so. So then what is the long term and short term effect of what one Congressman does, knowing that we’re in that 55% to 65% range. First, let’s examine what happens if Congress votes with the President or votes with his critics. Well, here’s an area rarely where both sides are pretty much in agreement. You ask the President, what happens if you win? “If I win, I, President Obama will carry out this deal, down to the letter, and future presidents will be free to do what they do because after all, as much as I love this deal, it’s not legally binding on my successors.” So, the President wins, the President says we do the deal for a year and a half, and then maybe we do something else. But what happens if the President loses? You talk to the strongest opponents of this, especially AIPAC, the American Israel Political Affairs Committee, that is the central organizer of opposition, and they will say, if Congress votes against this overwhelmingly, beyond our wildest hopes, it will still go into effect, pretty much, for the first year and a half, maybe two years, because Iran will get what it expects and needs in the first couple of years, and in order to do that, Iran will do what they’ve agreed to do upfront. Why? Because from Iran’s standpoint, this is mostly a deal between them and Europe. Most of the benefits come from Europe, and the Iranians have to make the Europeans happy to get those benefits. The key term defined in the Agreement is “implementation day.” In order to reach that day, Iran has to deliver. They have to decommission their centrifuges and give up their stockpile. And only then the European sanctions relief begins. So either way, you’re going to get the good and the bad. My objective is to prevent the ugly. That is to say to make sure that as we approach year 10 and year 15, and hopefully long before, American Presidents must demand that this deal be modified. It doesn’t sound reasonable to say we want to shred the deal, put it in a wood chipper, or something like that. Want to sound reasonable? We just want to extend the safeguards contained in the deal. After all, Iran expects sanctions relief to continue, well how about requiring that the inspections and the limitations continue as well? Preventing the Deal From Being Viewed as a Binding Treaty One of the threats to that outcome, one of the impediments, would be a belief among the American people: that we sign the deal, Congress voted on the deal, we agreed to the deal, we have no right to blow up the deal, unless we can prove that Iran is cheating on the deal. My fear and expectation is that Iran will at least appear to be in compliance. So I spent weeks trying to get a vote on what’s called Concurrent Resolution: we would have only one vote, we show the world that Congress isn’t behind this deal, and then we stop. I tried to persuade my fellow skeptics to offer only one Concurrent Resolution, which would not go to the President for signature or veto. This would simply express the opinion of the majority on Congress that the agreement is not approved by Congress and is therefore non-binding on the American people or future administrations. After three fruitless weeks, I joined the other skeptics in supporting what’s called the “Joint Resolution of Disapproval,” which we will vote on next month. It involves two votes. A Resolution of Disapproval will pass the House, it will probably pass the Senate, it will go to the President’s desk, he will veto it, and in all likelihood, in the second vote, the veto will be sustained. If that happens, the headline will be “Proponents of Iran Deal Win Crucial Victory in Congress”, the picture will be the proponents in the White House opening the champagne. Then we skeptics need to go to the American people and say: What the proponents were celebrating is that they got 34% of the support in one of the two houses of Congress. Contrary to that picture, Congress voted against this deal, it is not binding on the American people, we are not legally, diplomatically or morally bound by this deal. Future Presidents are legally free to act before this deal gets ugly. So in conclusion, the deal is good and bad in the first year; no matter what we do, it’s probably going to be followed by the parties for the first two years. The deal gets ugly next decade. My job is to do all I can to prevent Americans from believing that this deal is morally binding on future administrations. That’s why I will join other skeptics and vote for the Joint Resolution of Disapproval. But our work does not end with the votes this Fall.The Months to Come Many of you have been worried about Iran for a long time. Win, lose or draw, this thing doesn’t stop. We will be having to work the American people and the world for a long time to say that if the world is safe when Iran has only 6,000 IR-1s, then let’s keep the world safe. If the world is safe when they only have 300 kilograms of low enriched uranium as their entire stockpile, let’s keep the world safe. And the idea that Iran bargained for and is entitled to a giant nuclear forest, well they didn’t. They bargained for a handshake deal that will last as long as this administration.The North Korea Danger Now I’ll go into one other thing very briefly. There is one part of this deal, one issue that wouldn’t have been solved even if the Iranians had signed the deal proposed by Bibi Netanyahu. Bibi’s deal would have gotten rid of all of Iran’s centrifuges and its plutonium producing reactors. But there’s one other place to look. I am the chief Democrat on the Asia subcommittee, and I look to North Korea. North Korea was told by America they couldn’t have a nuclear weapon; they went and got one anyway. They think they made the right decision because Gaddafi’s people are dead, Saddam Hussain is dead, and Pyongyang’s leaders are still alive, except to the extent they kill each other. North Korea now has roughly a dozen nuclear weapons. They need roughly a dozen nuclear weapons to protect themselves from us. They’re going to be creating enough fissile material for roughly four additional nuclear weapons every year. I don’t think they’re going to put the 13th bomb up on Ebay, but they may conduct a transaction with Iran. This is not unprecedented. North Korea has already done extensive nuclear business with Iran and Syria. Most of you are aware that in 2007 Israel destroyed a Syrian nuclear reactor at al-Kibar. That was a North Korean-style reactor. The open sources speculate that Syria, or more likely, Iran, paid North Korea roughly (nobody really knows) a billion dollars for help with that reactor, not for any fissile material nor for a bomb itself. This is because last decade North Korea had a very limited supply of fissile material and completed nuclear weapons. They wanted to hold on to their own bombs back then when they didn’t have enough to deter us. North Korea only gave the instruction manual -- okay there were a few component kits, whatever, but basically an instruction manual. So you’ve got to wonder, now that North Korea is soon reaching a point where they have more than enough fissile material than they absolutely need, and now that Iran can spend a lot more than a billion dollars at the North Korean store, what happens? I got considerable attention from the administration over the last two or three weeks, and the one thing I have put all my effort into is to try to get increased intelligence of what is happening between Tehran and Pyongyang, and that will be an issue we will have to continue to focus on. Because it’s not just about what goes on in Parchin, Natanz, Fordow, and the hidden sites, it’s also whether one country will sell fissile material, or a completed bomb, to another country. Iran’s Non-Nuclear Wrongdoing As we focus on Iran’s nuclear program, we cannot ignore Iran’s support for the brutally murderous regime in Syria that is killing thousands of people every month. Nor can we ignore their support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, and Hamas and the Houthi rebels. Nor can we forget about the four American hostages Iran is holding. No matter what the status of the nuclear Agreement, Congress must adopt sanctions designed to force Iran to change its “non-nuclear” behavior—to stop supporting Assad and terrorist groups, and to free the American hostages. Next month I will introduce legislation to impose sanctions on Iran designed to change its non-nuclear behavior. Under the Deal, it is clear that Congress can impose additional sanctions designed to change Iran’s behavior in areas other than nuclear research. The bill I submit will not use a feigned concern for Iran’s non-nuclear activities to simply re-enact the old sanctions abated under the Nuclear Deal. Rather, it will contain new sanctions and be targeted to specific non-nuclear behavior.Conclusion I look forward to working with you in the months to come to force Iran to release our hostages and stop support for terrorists and murderous regimes. And I look forwards to working with you in the years to come to force changes in this Deal before it gets ugly. Thank you. Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks, CA) is the second ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where he has served for 19 years. [1] The U.S. Israel Energy Act was first introduced in 2004 (H.R. 5342) by Congressman Brad Sherman and Congressman John Shadegg. It ultimately became law as part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, P.L. 110-140. [2] Iran was in the process of constructing a heavy water nuclear reactor at Arak. That reactor would have produced enough plutonium for a few bombs every year. However, as far as we know, Iran had never begun to produce a plant that could extract the plutonium from the reactor’s spent fuel, known as a reprocessing plant. Iran has agreed to alter the Arak reactor so that it will not produce significant quantities of plutonium and has agreed to ship the spent fuel out of the country. Like most of Iran’s commitments concerning uranium enrichment, their commitments concerning the production of plutonium last only 15 years. [3] See Footnote 2 above. [4] i.e., the known, declared facilities where Iran will enrich. The same goes for Iran’s existing and planned nuclear reactors and several other nuclear-relevant facilities that Iran has declared.
09.01.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) issued the following statement: “I am thrilled that Los Angeles will be the American city bidding for the 2024 Olympics.” “The Valley is 40% of Los Angeles and a significant portion of the Olympic competition should be held in the San Fernando Valley. In the 1984 games, the San Fernando Valley was snubbed. I don’t remember a single facility built or sports venue used in the San Fernando Valley in 1984. Of course the Olympic torch passed through the Valley, but it passed through much of America as well.” “If a swimming stadium or other venue needs to be constructed, it should not be constructed in parts of the city that already have Olympic venues. It ought to be built in the San Fernando Valley.” “I know that Mayor Garcetti is well aware of my view, and the view of so many Valley residents, that the Valley should not be snubbed when it comes to Olympic events and Olympic facilities. I look forward to making sure that the Valley gets its fair share of newly constructed facilities.” “I’m not certain that 40% of the Olympic events will be hosted in the Valley, but I’m sure we’ll do far better than we did in 1984.” -30-

08.07.2015	Washington D.C. – The House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is the “Committee of Jurisdiction,” will consider a Resolution of Disapproval of the Iran Nuclear Agreement next month. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), who is the second Ranking Democrat on the Committee, released the following statement: For 19 years, I have focused on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Since November of 2013, I have been briefed at every stage of the negotiations. For the last week, I stayed in Washington to devote myself to studying this Agreement. I met one-on-one with the President at length, and had numerous meetings and phone conversations with Secretaries Kerry and Moniz, and received classified briefings from our chief negotiator in Vienna and experts from the intelligence community and the Department of Energy. This Agreement is the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. It contains the good and the bad in the first year, and gets ugly in the years thereafter. The Good: Iran gives up 97% of its stockpile of enriched uranium and decommissions 2/3 of its existing centrifuges. The Bad: Iran gets access to at least $56 billion of its own currently-frozen funds, and free access to the international oil markets. The Ugly: In 15 years or less, Iran is permitted to have an unlimited quantity of centrifuges of unlimited quality, as well as heavy water reactors and reprocessing facilities. I might be willing to accept the good with the bad during the first year of the Agreement. But we must force modifications of the Agreement, and extensions of its nuclear restrictions, before it gets ugly. My efforts have one purpose: Make it clear that future Presidents and Congresses are not bound by this Agreement—not legally, not morally, not diplomatically. Under International Law and the U.S. Constitution, the Agreement is a mere “executive political agreement” and is not binding on America, Europe or Iran. However, if the Agreement was not only signed by the President, but also supported by Congress, it may appear binding. Appearances matter. In future years, many would argue as long as Iran appears to be complying with the Agreement, America cannot insist on modifications or extensions of nuclear restrictions. A strong Congressional vote against the Agreement is the best way to make it clear that the Agreement is not binding on Congress, the American people or future administrations. I appreciate the incredible efforts President Obama and his Administration have made to address the threat of Iran’s nuclear weapons program. This President has worked far harder, taken more diplomatic and political risks, and accomplished far more than the previous administration. As someone who has fought since 1997 for tough sanctions against Iran to address the threat it poses to our country, and as someone who strongly supports our deep relationship with Israel, I am grateful that the Obama Administration has made Iran a high priority at a time when there are so many foreign policy and economic issues facing our country. Additional Comments I also have serious concerns with many other aspects of the Agreement including: the 24 day wait before suspicious sites are inspected; the very limited inspection regime at Bushehr and at the unlimited number of future light water nuclear reactors Iran may construct; and the fact that the Agreement provides Iran with all the funds it will need, should it choose to purchase nuclear weapons (or fissile material) from North Korea. The Agreement does not contain any provisions helping us to monitor shipments or financial transactions between Iran and North Korea. As we focus on Iran’s nuclear program, we cannot ignore Iran’s support for the brutally murderous regime in Syria that is killing thousands of people every month. Nor can we ignore their support for terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, and Hamas and the Houthi rebels. Nor can we forget about the four American hostages Iran is holding. No matter what the status of the nuclear Agreement, Congress must adopt sanctions designed to force Iran to change its “non-nuclear” behavior—to stop supporting Assad and terrorist groups, and to free the American hostages. Next month I will introduce legislation to impose sanctions on Iran designed to change its non-nuclear behavior. As to legislative specifics, I will vote for the Royce Resolution, H.J.Res. 64. Previously, I had urged opponents of the Agreement to pursue a different procedural strategy. It is now clear that Democratic and Republican opponents of the Agreement have united behind Royce’s procedural approach, and I will join them. The President reminds us that many prominent critics of the Agreement supported the invasion of Iraq. It should be noted that many supporters of the Agreement also supported the invasion of Iraq, including: Vice President Biden, Secretary Kerry and Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
07.31.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, joined with his colleagues to commemorate the Simele Massacre and announce a resolution to protect religious minorities in Iraq and Syria. “Assyrians and Armenians, along with other minorities in Iraq and Syria, have been persecuted for generations because of their faith and ethnicity,” said Sherman. “The recent violence in the Nineveh Plains, Khabor, Aleppo, and Kobane underscore the need for a more robust US and international policy to protect these communities and support them in their struggle for self-preservation. That is I am joining with Rep. David Trott (R-MI) to introduce a resolution that not only expresses our concern for the Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac and Armenians in Iraq and Syria, but formally recognizes the Simele massacre of 1933, and calls on the President and international community to put an end to the suffering of these innocent people and allow them to live peacefully in their ancestral homeland.” The resolution, which will be introduced when legislative business resumes in the House, already has the support of additional Members, including Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) and Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R-NE). “With our friends at the Armenian National Committee of America and A Demand for Action we have crafted a resolution that does justice to the gravity of the violence which has befallen the Assyrian and Armenian people in Iraq and Syria,” Sherman continued. “While no resolution can ever fully grasp the barbarity of the violence, or extent of the suffering, it does not mean the US Congress should remain silent while the Christian people of Iraq and Syria suffer. We encourage our friends in Congress to join this important resolution, and will be working with the leadership in Congress to ensure it is adopted without delay.” August 7th marks a tragic day for the Assyrian/Chaldean/Syriac people. In 1933, in the northern Iraqi town of Simele, over 3,000 Assyrian Christians were massacred in cold blood, being forced to flee their homes in droves. Many of the surviving victims of Simele were relocated along the Khabor River in Syria, which this year experienced a series of brutal attacks, and saw the descendants of the massacre displaced once again, this time due to the brutality of ISIS. -30-
07.17.2015	Washington DC –Due to the work of Congressman Sherman and others, the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance to American universities indicating that they had an obligation to protect students from anti-Semitism. More specifically, the guidance indicated that anti-Semitism was prohibited by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which applies to discrimination by colleges and universities that receive federal funds. Unfortunately, efforts against anti-Semitism have stalled. University administrators find it difficult to define anti-Semitism. Accordingly those making the most vicious and hateful anti-Semitic remarks seek to excuse and disguise their comments as mere criticisms of the Israeli government. Today, Congressman Sherman wrote to dozens of major universities urging them to adopt the definition of anti-Semitism promulgated by the U.S. Department of State. The State Department’s definition of anti-Semitism includes, “applying double standards by requiring of it [Israel] a behavior not expected or demanded by any other democratic nation.” It also brands as anti-Semitic; “delegitimizing Israel—denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination and denying the right of Israel to exist.” Congressman Sherman is also urging the U.S. Department of Education to adopt this definition of anti-Semitism for all of its enforcement actions nationwide. See the letter below from Congressman Sherman sent to the University of California Los Angeles and other major universities. July 17, 2015 RE: Preventing Anti-Semitism at UCLA I am sure that the University of California, Los Angeles wants to prevent anti-Semitism on campus. In addition, as a recipient of federal funds, you are required to prevent violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which requires you to protect students from bigotry based on “race, color, or national origin.” On October 26, 2010, responding to my strong suggestions and those of others, the United States Department of Education Office for Civil Rights issued a “dear colleague,” which informed universities around the country that anti-Semitism qualifies within the term “race, color, or national origin,” and accordingly students should be protected from anti-Semitism pursuant to Title VI. It is important that UCLA enforces Title VI and prevents anti-Semitism, not only because it is the right thing to do, but because failure to do so could affect eligibility for federal funds. In order to make meaningful efforts to prevent anti-Semitism, you must adopt a definition of anti-Semitism. This is especially necessary because there are those who claim that the most vicious and hateful anti-Semitic remarks are mere criticisms of the policies of the Israeli government. There may also be others who claim that reasonable criticisms of the Israeli government should be regarded as anti-Semitism. Thus you need a definition of anti-Semitism which distinguishes between reasonable criticism of a government and its policies on the one hand, and bigoted invective aimed at Jews and Israeli-Americans on the other hand. To date, the U.S. Department of Education has not authored a thorough definition of anti-Semitism. However, the U.S. Department of State has promulgated such a definition relatively recently. Since both the U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Education are executive agencies of the federal government, there is every reason to believe that the U.S. Department of State definition provides reasonable guidance to those seeking to comply with Title VI. In fact, it would be hypocritical for the U.S. government to apply weaker standards against anti-Semitism domestically than it demands of other countries. I urge you, as the Chancellor, to adopt a definition of anti-Semitism based upon the U.S. Department of State definition. That U.S. Department of State definition can be found at https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/156684.pdf, and a copy is enclosed for your convenience. On many California campuses, Jewish students have faced bigotry, slurs, and a hostile environment. It is up to the University to enforce policies against anti-Semitism, and this can be done effectively only by adopting a reasonable definition of anti-Semitism. The U.S. Department of State definition is the only definition issued by the United States government, and your adoption of it would constitute the best practice in complying with Title VI. Very truly yours, Brad Sherman Member of Congress U.S. Department of State Defining Anti-Semitism “Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.” Contemporary Examples of Anti-Semitism Calling for, aiding, or justifying the killing or harming of Jews (often in the name of a radical ideology or an extremist view of religion). Making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews as such or the power of Jews as a collective—especially but not exclusively, the myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions. Accusing Jews as a people of being responsible for real or imagined wrongdoing committed by a single Jewish person or group, the state of Israel, or even for acts committed by non-Jews. Accusing the Jews as a people, or Israel as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel, or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide, than to the interest of their own nations. “EXAMPLES of the ways in which anti-Semitism manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel, taking into account the overall context could include: DEMONIZE ISRAEL: Using the symbols and images associated with classic anti-Semitism to characterize Israel or Israelis Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis Blaming Israel for all inter-religious or political tensions DOUBLE STANDARD FOR ISRAEL: Applying double standards by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation Multilateral organizations focusing on Israel only for peace or human rights investigations DELEGITIMIZE ISRAEL: Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, and denying Israel the right to exist” However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as anti-Semitic.

07.15.2015	NPCA President Clark Bunting, Congressman Brad Sherman and NPCA CEO Craig D. Obey Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his commitment to preserving America’s national parks for future generations. “I am honored by the National Parks Conservation Association’s award, and I thank them. I will continue to work hard to protect our treasured national parks and natural space,” said Sherman. The National Parks Award is for Members of Congress who lead efforts to protect and enhance the National Park System. The NPCA, which has 600,000 members and supporters, works to protect the park system to preserve the nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage. One of Sherman’s major accomplishments is working to protect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. This area is the most visited unit of the National Park System, with over 33 million annual visitors. “Protecting our environment – especially our pristine national parks – is one of my top legislative priorities. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park, providing a variety of outdoor activities for Valley families.” Over the years, Congressman Sherman has taken the lead in securing over $20 million to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. He has also been a longtime advocate of adding the Rim of the Valley lands to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. -30-
07.14.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee released the following statement on the Iran Nuclear Agreement: “This deal includes the good, the bad, and the ugly. The good and the bad are in the first year, but after year ten the deal gets ugly. Good (Year 1): Iran ships more than 90% of its stockpile of low enriched uranium abroad and mothballs over two thirds of its centrifuges. Bad (Year 1): Iran gets its hands on over $120 billion of its own money. It will use the money to supplement its own people, fund graft and corruption of its own leaders and to kill Sunni Muslims. The remainder will be used to support groups that kill Americans and Israelis. Ugly (After Year 10): End of restrictions on quality and quantity of centrifuges. Even President Obama says this reduces break-out time to virtually zero. Our goal must be to prevent what happens after year ten. We must act this decade to demand that the restrictions on Iran’s centrifuges be extended for decades to come. We must put all options on the table to achieve this extension. Perhaps the best part of the deal is that it is not binding on future Congresses and Presidents under international law. This is particularly true if Congress refuses to approve the deal, and a Congressional vote of approval is highly unlikely.” Watch Congressman Sherman in the House Foreign Affairs Committee, July 14, 2015: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMdSaRhNkw4&feature=youtu.be
07.08.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement “As the negotiators enter the final days in their attempts to reach a comprehensive deal on Iran’s nuclear program, the Administration must be very tough in order to be successful in bringing home an acceptable deal. At a minimum the Lausanne framework, at least as it was described by the Obama Administration, must be reflected in the final agreement. Any ambiguities and gaps in that framework must be resolved in favor of tougher controls. “Iran must agree to allow snap inspections at any suspected site, not just those sites currently known or declared, and Tehran must provide an accounting of past work on nuclear weapons. Sanctions relief should only be granted after the Iranians have demonstrated compliance and should be limited: the floodgates for investment in Iran should not be opened. Therefore, the Iran Sanctions Act should not be suspended. “Many of our statutes, including the Iran Sanctions Act, which provides for sanctions against firms that invest in Iran’s energy sector, are not limited to, or even primarily focused on, Iran’s nuclear program (see sections 2 and 3 of the Act, PL-104-172, which set out the rationale for the law). The Iran Sanctions Act was enacted in 1996 to combat Iranian terrorism, missile development, and the development of other “Weapons of Mass Destruction,” things well outside the scope of these talks. “A comprehensive agreement, even if it is a better-than-expected agreement, does not end our problem with Iran’s nuclear program, to say nothing of Iran’s other nefarious activities. An agreement with Iran will only buy us time. We will need both constant focus on enforcement, as well as continued efforts to stop Iran’s support for terrorism and its efforts to undermine allies and friendly countries in the Middle East. “If the deal does not provide fully adequate safeguards for decades to come, then Congress must make sure that it is not binding on future Congresses and future Administrations.” -30-
06.17.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) met with Griffin Armstorff of Burbank to congratulate him on winning the Congressional Gold Medal Award. Pictured: Mrs. Theric Armstorff, Griffin Armstorff, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and Mr. Roland Armstorff in Congressman Sherman’s Washington DC office. “Griffin Armstorff is one of the many exceptional young people whose selfless contributions to our community are worthy of praise and gratitude,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am always proud to see young people in the Valley taking an initiative to improve the environment and work with the less fortunate in our area. Griffin is greatly deserving of this award, and we look forward to seeing what the future holds for him.” The Congressional Award Gold Medal honors our nation’s outstanding young people. Each recipient must spend two years or more completing at least 400 hours of community service, 200 hours of both personal development and physical fitness activities, and a four-night Expedition or Exploration. For this achievement, Gold Medalists are recognized at the Capitol with the presentation of the Congressional Award Gold Medal, which is struck by the United States Mint. Griffin Armstorff attends John Burroughs High School, and is an active member of the Boy Scouts of America. Read Griffin’s personal statement summarizing his remarkable accomplishments: “To complete my Voluntary Public Service goals, I worked to remove invasive species from the San Gabriel River area. I also worked with nonprofit groups on service projects involving the military, dog shelters, and the homeless. For my Personal Development, I attended ground school to learn how to fly a plane. I also taught children how to swim. The Physical Fitness component of the Congressional Award was enjoyable because I was able to swim almost every day. I was also able to improve on all of my swim strokes and beat my own personal records during swim meets. For my Expedition, I went backpacking through Philmont, New Mexico. While backpacking we went burrow racing, rock climbing, built trails, and explored mines. Overall, I was able to develop my own skills, help people, and improve my community.” -30-
06.04.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) issued a statement regarding news that Charter Cable will begin carrying SportNet LA, a station that airs LA Dodger’s baseball games and Dodgers related programing. “I am pleased that Charter Communications will begin carrying SportNet LA, but the work is not done yet. Too many Angelenos still won’t have access to the Dodgers because of a 14 month dispute between cable companies over how to provide Los Angeles residents with access to Los Angeles Dodgers television broadcasts. “I am reissuing an earlier request for Time Warner Cable into enter binding arbitration with DirecTV and others. This would be a fair and fast way to return programming to consumers. Time Warner Cable has agreed to enter into the arbitration process. They have offered to make SportsNet LA available immediately to all fans upon the initiation of binding arbitration. Immediate binding arbitration is the only mechanism that will get the Dodgers games on the air now.” In July of last year, six Los Angeles area members of Congress, led by Congressman Brad Sherman (D - Sherman Oaks) called on Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV and all other providers to enter into binding arbitration to resolve the current dispute and air Dodgers games on all LA-area cable and satellite systems. -30-
05.29.2015	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), who was instrumental in securing federal funds for the new northbound lane on the 405 freeway, issued the following statement on the 1-year anniversary of the opening of the new lane. Two studies, one from Inrix and the other from Metro (released today) analyze the effectiveness of the additional lane. Previously, some commentators used the Inrix study to argue that the new lane did not reduce travel times. Sherman said: “The northbound lane on the 405 freeway through the Sepulveda Pass, which opened a year ago, was an important investment in our transportation system and a good use of both federal and state funds.” “Major construction work began in January 2010 during the depth of the recession, when fewer people had jobs. While the recession reduced traffic delays, we needed another lane for when the economy improved.” “Today, the northbound 405 freeway carries 15% more vehicles through the Sepulveda Pass than it did in 2009. And because the new diamond lane attracts carpools, the freeway carries 30% more people. If we hadn’t built the lane, traffic would be much worse as more people than ever are driving home through America’s most crowded highway bottleneck. In fact, without the new lane, motorists would spend 6,000 more hours each day creeping through the Sepulveda Pass.” “Now it’s time to build public support for a subway through the Sepulveda Pass, from the Valley to LAX, connecting in Westwood with the Purple Line, now under construction.”Background: Congressman Brad Sherman and his colleagues were instrumental in securing funding for these projects at both the state and federal level. In 1998 Sherman secured federal funds for planning improvements to the Sepulveda Pass bottleneck. In 2003 Senator Barbara Boxer, Congressman Howard Berman and Congressman Brad Sherman worked together to secure a $117 million federal earmark to construct an additional northbound lane on the 405 Freeway. Sherman and Berman testified in favor of the 405 project together on April 1, 2003, before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and both lobbied their colleagues intensely until the final bill was passed in July of 2005. Sherman then worked with several prominent advocates of the project, including Mayor Villaraigosa and Supervisor Gloria Molina (then Chair of the Metro Board), to secure $614 million in state bond funding. On February 20, 2007, Congressman Sherman traveled to Sacramento with Mayor Villaraigosa and local officials in a successful effort to persuade the California Transportation Commission to provide $614 million, the largest piece of the project’s funding. Sherman was the only member of Congress to testify at this critical hearing of the California Transportation Commission. -30-
05.28.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a Senior Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement upon the news that an independent team of election observers from the University of California deemed the May 3, 2015 Republic of Nagorno Karabakh parliamentary elections transparent and fair. “Despite remarkably difficult challenges, the people and government of Nagorno Karabakh have managed to develop a democratic society and a vibrant civil society in a relatively short period of time. “As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have been a strong supporter and consistent advocate for this democracy from its inception. The people of Artsakh have embraced democratic ideals from the time their government was established. “The election observers, comprised of professional non-partisan academics, researchers and experts in the fields of electoral processes and human rights, found that the election process was consistent with international standards and noted the involvement of women throughout the process as equal participants. “I look forward to continued efforts to support Artsakh and strengthen the ties between the United States and the Republic.” -30-
05.06.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) will reintroduce the “Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act,” in the House and Senate respectively. Under the legislation, any institution that is too big to fail will be broken up and reorganized to avoid more government bailouts and future risk to the economy. This legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to identify and break up institutions that are deemed too big to fail. This is the third time Congressman Sherman has introduced similar legislation in the House, and the third time Senator Sanders has introduced such legislation in the Senate. The only thing that has changed is the biggest banks have gotten even bigger – 38% bigger than 2008. “Too big to fail should be too big to exist,” said Congressman Sherman who has advocated this position since 2009. “Never again should a financial institution be able to demand a federal bailout. Today they can claim: ‘if we go down, the economy is going down with us.’ By breaking up these institutions long before they face a crisis, we ensure a healthy financial system where medium-sized institutions can compete in the free market.” “These medium-sized and smaller banks will be more inclined to make loans to small- and medium-sized businesses – which are the backbone of our economy. The legislation is endorsed by the Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA), which represents over 6,000 of our nation’s 6,589 banks.” Sherman continued, “Every financial institution should compete for funds based on the soundness of its balance sheet, and no financial institution should be able to claim that there is a special federal safety net available to its investors because of the institution’s sheer size.” “In my view, no single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis,” Senator Sanders said. “At the very least, no institution, no CEO in America should be above the law. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.” Richard Fisher, former President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, argued that when markets presume a systemically important institution has implicit government backing, access to capital is easier. A study by International Monetary Fund researchers showed a potential advantage of these firms as high as 80 basis points (.8%).[1] Building on that estimation, Bloomberg News calculates taxpayers could be creating a subsidy of $83 billion dollars annually, roughly equal to the bank’s annual profits.[2] This legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit to Congress a list of all banks and other financial institutions that the Secretary believes have become too big to fail. Those entities deemed too large would then be broken up in a managed process of reorganization, so a single failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without a taxpayer bailout. “Too Big to Fail” refers to any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance. -30-
04.29.2015	Congressman Sherman Receives Humane Advocate Award from Wayne Pacelle, President of the Humane Society of the United States Washington, DC – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Humane Advocate Award from the Humane Society of the United States. This is Congressman Sherman’s seventh consecutive award from the Humane Society. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on animal welfare issues and for his consistently perfect score on the Humane Society’s Legislative Scorecard. Since coming to Congress in 1997, Sherman has been a fierce advocate for animals, working to ensure that they are not subjected to undue pain or suffering. Sherman has been a leader on many animal issues including the regulation of puppy mills, protecting endangered and exotic animals, halting experimentation on chimpanzees, protecting horses from slaughter and consumption, and stopping the disgusting sport of dog fighting by punishing animal fighting spectators. "We are tremendously grateful to Congressman Sherman for his work to protect animals from cruelty, and to stop abuses such as animal fighting, horse slaughter, and inhumane factory farming practices," said Wayne Pacelle, President of The Humane Society of the United States. "Congressman Sherman has always been a stalwart advocate for animal protection in Congress, and we applaud his advocacy for all creatures." -30-
04.28.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, released the following statement upon the arrival of Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan. “I am very pleased to see the Prime Minister visiting the United States and look forward to his speech before Congress. Since the end of World War II, nearly 70 years ago, relations between our countries have flourished. With Japan as our partner, we’ve promoted democracy and fought terrorism, and also developed advanced technologies that are used around the world today. Our continued alliance in the Asia-Pacific is critical to the growth, safety and security of both our nations. “However, as the United States negotiates the Trans Pacific Partnership, which I strongly oppose, I am concerned that the agreement’s failure to deal with currency manipulation and Japan’s barriers to agriculture and automobiles might hurt American workers. “I hope that we can explore other ways to deepen the US-Japan relationship rather than by negotiating a trade agreement that will increase America’s trade deficit and depress American wages.” -30-
04.23.2015	Washington DC – Thursday April 24, 2015 marks the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. In recognition of those atrocities Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) held a special order on the house floor calling for U.S. recognition. Video of the Special Order on the House Floor can be viewed here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L86N6Yua6so Congressman Sherman also released the following statement: “Beginning in 1915 a planned-out government destruction of an estimated one and a half million Armenian people occurred - an event which meets all the definitions of the word ‘genocide.’ “It is our duty to honor and dignify those who lost their lives, to pay respect to their living relatives, and to ensure that these horrible events never happen again. “While President Obama has done a lot of good work to improve relations between the United States and Armenia, I’m disappointed that he will not give the Armenian Genocide appropriate recognition as a sitting President, as he did while serving in the Senate. “Genocide denial is the last act of a genocide and the first step in the next genocide – just as the Armenian Genocide, in part, prepared the world for the Holocaust. When Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of the Jewish people, those around him wondered how he could get away with it. Hitler pointed out that the Ottoman Empire had gotten away with it because no one remembered the genocide of the Armenians. “That is why I have repeatedly asked my colleagues in the House and Senate to formally recognize the genocide – we cannot afford to wait another century.” -30-
04.22.2015	Sherman Oaks - On Tuesday evening, just over nine thousand Valley residents participated in an interactive “Telephone Town Hall” hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Residents from all over the district were able to call in and participate in a two-way conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed constituents’ questions and concerns on a wide variety of topics, including U.S. trade policy, the Iran nuclear negotiations, foreign terrorism, healthcare, and the environment. “Telephone Town Halls are a regular part of my outreach to my constituents,” said Sherman. “These types of town halls allow me to interact with thousands of Valley residents in a very easy and relaxed manner. These days, we are all so busy. The technology that we use allows my constituents to participate from home without having to drive in traffic. Many who participated in this town hall had a chance to talk with me, one on one,” added Sherman. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman elicited the input of his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: What is your view on Congress granting Fast-Track Authority and approving the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) Trade Deal? Oppose Fast Track and TPP: 43% In Favor of Passing Fast-Track and then the TPP: 10% Undecided: 47% Which statement best fits your views on gun control? I strongly believe we need tough new controls on guns: 58% We should enforce the gun laws we have: 27% We should repeal some existing gun laws: 12% Don’t have a strong opinion on gun control: 3% Which statement best fits your views on the Middle East conflict? We should strongly support Israel: 51% We should support Palestinians at least as much as we support Israel: 28% We should just stay out of the conflict: 13% None of the Above/Other: 8% Which statement best fits your view of the legislative program of the Humane Society? I strongly agree: 35% I strongly disagree: 6% I have no opinion: 59% Should the U.S. be doing more or less on programs which assist low-income Americans? Less, it is more important to balance the budget, including deep cuts to public assistance programs: 18% More, the U.S. has a moral obligation to help those less fortunate: 38% Congress should avoid cutting these programs, but there needs to be a balanced approach: 44% In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct participants to his district office (818) 501-9200 for further assistance in regards to personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the ninety minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voicemail. -30-

04.03.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the second ranking Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following statement. In his first year in office (1997), Sherman identified Iran as the chief threat to American national security and he has been involved in every Congressional effort to stop Iran’s nuclear program for the last 18 years: No Iranian Official has publicly agreed to the President’s description of the Framework Agreement [Read Framework]. Foreign Minister Zarif criticized the United States for issuing the Framework document [Read Here] and has said it is inaccurate in at least one respect [Read Here]. If Zarif can not publicly present the four page description of the Agreement to the Iranian people and elites, how will he gain approval for perhaps a thousand pages of agreement text and annexes that will be needed for a comprehensive agreement by June 30? Are the contents of the Framework Agreement something both parties have agreed to, or is the document merely for Congressional pacification? Negotiations may be on track to create a “Temporary Tolerable” Agreement by June 30. Congressional inaction may be our best policy. Even critics of the Framework tacitly admit that it will at least prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon before January 2017, if it results in a final agreement that is adhered to by Iran. Such an agreement would give us some time, and Congressional inaction now leaves all options on the table for a future President or Congress. Of course, Congress will hold hearings and demand answers regarding the ambiguities in the Framework, and to demand that a final accord be as strong as possible. If Congress does not enact a statute now, we allow this and future Congresses and Presidents to abide by, or renounce, any comprehensive agreement. Also, in the event a final agreement is not working as it should to prevent Iran’s nuclear ambitions in 2017 or beyond, a future Congress or President could renounce it, or threaten to revive and strengthen sanctions, or even threaten to take military action, unless Iran agrees to additional limitations and more intrusive inspections. A future President could also insist that limitations and inspection regimes be continued long after their agreed expiration dates. This President can periodically waive U.S. sanctions, as can the next President, in order to implement an agreement over the next several years. In fact, the negotiators did not envision any action by Congress – they expect President Obama to veto any new sanctions. Congressional decisions after the June 30 Agreement: As to the substance of a final accord, there are a host of ambiguities in the Framework which must be resolved specifically and favorably: Enrichment. The Agreement provides specific limits on 3.67% LEU. We do not know yet if these limits would just apply to LEU stored in gas form, and therefore whether Iran will be able to retain LEU in oxide form. What will happen to Iran’s remaining 20% enriched uranium? The framework Agreement does not seem to specify any limits on mining and milling uranium, yellowcake, or on the amounts that may be converted to uranium hexafluoride. Large stockpiles of these precursors may not shorten the time to Iran’s first bomb, but could help pave the way to bombs 2 through 20. Inspections. The Agreement says “Iran will be required to grant access to the IAEA to investigate suspicious sites.” On this, we will need immediate access. In 2007, the MEK revealed credible evidence of undeclared nuclear activity at Fordow, and Iran was in fact secretly pursuing its nuclear program there. However, the IAEA was not given access to Fordow until 2009. “Our Middle East allies have not been so angered by the Agreement that they have announced actions unacceptable to the Administration. In response to the agreement, Israel has not threatened military action. Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have not announced plans for massive new nuclear efforts. The final Agreement must be sufficiently strong to cause Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey to abstain from moving toward a nuclear weapon. Preventing a breakdown of the Non Proliferation Treaty is a major objective of the Agreement.” -30-
04.03.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement after news of the Iranian Nuclear negotiations. “The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has embraced the statement read by the European Union representative on nuclear negotiations, which is very vague. An hour later, President Obama issued a much longer, more detailed fact sheet of the agreed framework.” “The most important thing the President can do is get the Iranians to agree in public to what they have agreed to in private.” -30-
03.25.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) led a bipartisan group of 106 House members in a request of $2 million for the U.S.–Israel Energy Cooperation Program in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. Co-leaders of the letter include Congressmen Bill Johnson (R-OH), Peter King (R-NY), Peter Roskam (R-IL), Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Ted Deutch (D-FL). The appropriations request this year included the highest number of signatories – 106 members of Congress – since the creation of the program in 2008. The program is designed to leverage matching contributions from the Israeli government. It also leverages investments from the Israeli and American private sector; thus, for every dollar Congress appropriates, three dollars are invested, contributing to the economy in addition to energy security. Since its inception the program has received $23.4 million from the U.S. and Israeli governments ($11.7 from each government) and has also raised over $27 million from private sector investments. “The U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program continues to spur and advance new and innovative energy projects,” said Congressman Sherman. “This tremendous bipartisan support is a clear indication that Congress supports funding for this program from both sides of the aisle. Just last year the House also voted to expand this program into water technology, an important area for California and many other states. I will work with the Administration on further boosting funding for this program in future budgets.” Congressman Sherman wrote the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2005. Congress ultimately enacted the legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, in December 2007. The program funds research and development in energy technologies and energy efficiency in the American and Israeli private sectors. These projects include advancements in hydroelectric energy production, lowering energy consumption for water treatment, energy optimization for manufacturers, wind energy storage, reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for tractor trailers, and noise control for distributed power generation. The request comes at a time when Congress and the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, on which Sherman is a senior member, are focusing on U.S. energy security. See text of the letter below: March 18, 2015 Hon. Mike Simpson Chairman Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development House Committee on Appropriations Hon. Marcy Kaptur Ranking Member Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development House Committee on Appropriations RE: Support for U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Dear Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur, We are writing to request that the subcommittee provide at least $2 million for the implementation of the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement in the FY2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This funding will be utilized to further implement Section 917 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, P.L. 110-140, and the May 2008 agreement between the U.S. and Israel on strategic energy cooperation. As you are aware, Congress recently passed, and the President signed into law, the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-296). Among other important provisions, the measure reauthorized the cooperative energy program through 2024 and expanded its mandate, covering collaborative R&D into renewable technologies, natural gas and water – key areas of interest for the United States. We greatly appreciate the support your subcommittee has provided for this program in the past. The U.S. government has provided $11.7 million for the program since its inception. The funding has been fully matched by the Government of Israel; this is not an aid program. During the same period, the program has also leveraged over $27 million in private sector cost-sharing. This program is an important tool in our efforts to achieve greater energy security and independence, and leverages small grant dollars to incentivize private sector innovation and new partnerships in the pursuit of a critical objective. U.S.-Israel projects currently underway include lowering energy consumption for water treatment, energy optimization for manufacturers, wind energy storage, reduced fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for tractor-trailers, and noise control for distributed power generation. Continued funding for the program will provide for collaborative U.S. and Israeli research and development efforts in areas critical to both the United States and Israel and unite our countries in the pursuit of increased energy security, energy independence and water efficiency – an issue of growing importance to much of the U.S. West and Southwest, and an area where Israel is truly the world leader. Companies across the U.S. are working through this program to develop cutting-edge technologies with new partners in Israel in order to advance America’s energy security. Furthermore, the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement facilitates greater cooperation and sharing of knowledge between American and Israeli universities. Collaboration between the American and Israeli private sector and academia will significantly enhance U.S. efforts to develop new technologies to the benefit of our economic and national security. We thank you for your consideration and for your prior support of this program and request your continued support for FY2016. Sincerely, Brad Sherman (D-CA) Eliot Engel (D-NY) Ted Deutch (D-FL) Peter Roskam (R-IL) Peter King (R-NY) Bill Johnson (R-OH)
03.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. -- This week, Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) and Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA), senior members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee sent a bipartisan letter to Twitter CEO Dick Costolo urging him to increase efforts to combat foreign terrorist organizations who are using the American social media company to fundraise, spread their propaganda and recruit new jihadists. Recently Twitter shut down 2,000 accounts. However, according to the Brookings Institution, there are approximately 46,000 active ISIS accounts on Twitter. The letter calls on Twitter to set up new streamlined procedures to counter the efforts of terrorists using social media and urges Twitter to treat terrorist content the same way they treat other objectionable content. Congressman Poe said, “Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations should not be allowed to use private American companies like Twitter as a free and instant tool to radicalize thousands of young impressionable minds throughout the world and recruit new jihadists. Groups like ISIS have successfully used social media as a way to broadcast their barbaric acts and propaganda to the world, not to mention to fundraise millions of dollars for their reign of terror. Twitter is far behind other social media companies that are combatting this threat. Twitter needs to do more. It’s time to put a stop to this cyber jihad.” Congressman Sherman said, “I recognize that Twitter has recently removed many accounts associated with terrorists, but they need to put forward a more consistent and systematic effort. Twitter has systems in place to rectify copyright and trademark infringement. The least they can do is to have similar systems in place to address terrorism. At times this may be like a game of whack-a-mole – with the moles being terrorist operatives that pop up here and there online. But, it’s far better to play the game than ignore the moles altogether.” Congressman Royce: “ISIS is recruiting on its virtual caliphate at an unprecedented and very disturbing rate. Companies need to ensure that their social media services are not being hijacked for terrorist use.” Congressman Engel: “Times have changed and so have the means by which terrorists incite violence and recruit membership. The Internet, while facilitating many revolutionary accomplishments, has also created a terrorist breeding ground that cannot be ignored. Our efforts to combat this trend requires dedication, adaptation, and cooperation. While I applaud Twitter’s recent removal of over 2,000 accounts believed to be associated with terrorist activity, this can only be considered a first step. Twitter can, and must, do more to deny groups like ISIS a forum to promote their nefarious activities.” See text of letter below: Dear Mr. Costolo, We are concerned that designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) and their supporters actively use Twitter to disseminate propaganda, drive fundraising, and recruit new members—even posting graphic content depicting the murder of individuals they have captured. We applaud your removal of some terrorist content, which has provoked serious threats against Twitter and its employees. However, we urge Twitter to treat all terrorist activity in the same way it treats other objectionable content. Users should have the option to report terrorist content in a streamlined manner, allowing Twitter to quickly block content and accounts that support terrorism, and Twitter should have a dedicated team to review such reports in a timely fashion. As you know, there is precedent in the social media industry for such a response. As Members of Congress, we are strong advocates for the right to free speech as protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. We commend Twitter’s strong commitment to promoting free speech in the United States and around the world. However, when Twitter accounts are used to support terrorism, such content does not deserve protection. It is our hope that this voluntary action will help prevent violent extremists from using social media and the Internet to advance their hateful ideology.
03.03.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a selected member of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s escort Committee, released the following statement after Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a speech to a joint meeting of Congress. “I disagree with the House Democratic Leader, whom I hold in high regard, in one respect. Prime Minister Netanyahu’s speech was not condescending.” “Every speech contains passages which remind the audience of facts they already know, and conclusions with which they already agree. That’s not condescension; that’s oratory." "The Prime Minister’s speech did contain some new insight that Congress should carefully consider, though it did not contain a clear roadmap of to how to force Iran to accept a reasonable deal.” -30-
03.02.2015	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) withdrew from Rabbi Shmuley Boteach’s roundtable discussion event “The Meaning of Never Again: Preventing a Nuclear Iran,” following a distasteful advertisement placed in the New York Times showing National Security Advisor Susan Rice and a pile of skulls. The bottom of the advertisement invited the public to a “bipartisan” forum today in the Dirksen Senate Office Building which was to feature “a Noble Laureate, a Senator, and a Congressman [Sherman].” “Since 1998, I have taken advantage of every opportunity to urge the toughest sanctions on Iran, including nearly twenty presentations at AIPAC policy conferences,” said Congressman Sherman. “I cannot appear at a forum which was advertised using an unwarranted incendiary personal attack. I will be working with Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel, and others, to create appropriate forums to focus on the danger posed by Iran.” “Nothing has done as much to unify the Jewish community, and nothing has done so much to bring the Jewish community in agreement with the Obama administration, as this ad,” said Congressman Sherman. “Everyone is unified in rejecting this abhorrent ad: J Street and AIPAC, the Obama Administration and Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the leading organizations in the Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jewish communities all agree --- this ad is harmful distraction from efforts to combat Iran's nuclear program.” “I have the utmost respect and admiration for Professor Wiesel, and his advocacy in remembering the Holocaust and supporting the state of Israel have been instrumental. Senator Cruz and I both share concerns about a nuclear Iran. I am saddened that this advertisement has preempted what could have been a productive conversation.” -30- Everyone United Opposing the Outrageous Ad Netanyahu and Obama Netanyahu's Office: "We condemn these ads and oppose personal attacks of every kind.” White House: A senior administration official "This ad is being widely met with the revulsion that it deserves.” AIPAC and J Street AIPAC: “Ad hominem attacks should have no place in our discourse.”J Street: “This advertisement amounts to a scurrilous scapegoating.” All Three Branches of Judaism Union for Reform Judaism: “What did Ambassador Rice do to merit such opprobrium?” Rabbinical Assembly of the Conservative Movement: “Today’s ad attacking National Security Advisor Susan Rice is beyond the pale.” Orthodox Union: “Inappropriate ad hominem attack doesn't advance discourse on key issue of Iran.” Anti-Defamation League Abraham H. Foxman, ADL National Director: “There is no justification for this incendiary personal attack. The spurious and perverse association of criticism of Israel’s prime minister with ignoring genocide not only poisons the discourse on a vital global security issue, it trivializes the horrific nature of genocide and the memory of its victims. Neither the security of Israel, nor the debate on Iran, are served by this ad.”
02.26.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – With another government shutdown looming in Washington, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) pledged to refuse any pay so long as the Department of Homeland Security is also shut down. If a funding bill is not agreed upon by February 27th, the Department will run out of funding and “essential” personnel will have to go to work while not receiving their paychecks. They won’t be paid until Congress appropriates funds. “As long as the employees of the Department of Homeland Security including Border Patrol, Coast Guard, and TSA are working while not receiving paychecks, I will ask that my paycheck be withheld,” said Congressman Sherman. “House Republicans should pass a clean funding bill and end this political gamesmanship that compromises our national security.” Congressman Sherman, along with every other House Democrat, has cosponsored a funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security introduced by Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Homeland Security Lucille Roybal-Allard and Appropriations Committee Ranking Member Nita Lowey for a stand-alone funding measure at levels agreed to by both Democrats and Republicans. -30- -30-
02.12.2015	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, released the following statement regarding President Obama’s proposal for the authorized use of military force. “I applaud the President for coming to Congress for authorization for the continuing operations against ISIS. However, I oppose the draft he has put forward. First, the limitation on ground troops is not strong enough – ‘enduring offensive ground operations’ is a highly elastic phrase which the next president may interpret broadly. President Obama has taken a very expansive view of his powers under the War Powers Act of 1973 and the AUMFs dealing with al Qaeda and Iraq. By failing to repeal the 2001 AUMF, his 2015 proposal reaffirms that AUMF and President Obama’s very broad reading of his authority. The 2001 legislation provides virtually unlimited authority for the President to do anything he wants to fight al Qaeda and associated groups, including commit ground troops, without any limits in scope or duration. The President asserts that the 2001 AUMF also authorizes unlimited military actions against ISIS. We should repeal and replace the 2001 AUMF, not reaffirm it. I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues to draft an AUMF that allows us to combat ISIS and Al Qaeda, and their allies, but that has sufficient and effective limits on the use of ground forces.” We need to make sure that the next president cannot commit hundreds of thousands of ground troops to the Middle East without congressional approval.
01.29.2015	Washington DC - Today, it was reported that the U.S. Department of Justice is near a settlement agreement that would require Standard and Poor's to pay $1.37 billion in fines for deceptively rating mortgage back securities. This now puts real pressure on the Securities and Exchange Commission to implement the Franken-Sherman amendment, which was passed as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill nearly five years ago. Up to this point, the SEC has refused to implement the amendment, using a loophole that allows them to avoid changing the system if they determine that conflict of interests will not lead to deceptive ratings. Now the DOJ will share in a $1.37 billion fine because the current system does not work. As it was in the past, the current method allows the issuer selling mortgage-backed bonds to select the credit rating agency. Of course they select the one likely to give them the highest rating. During the run up to the financial crisis, major credit rating agencies gave their highest ratings to pools of highly questionable mortgages. Credit rating agencies competed for clients because they could earn multi-million dollar fees on each assignment. The Franken-Sherman amendment requires the SEC to adopt a new system in which the SEC would select the credit rating agencies based on the integrity of the ratings. No longer with the home team be able to select the umpire. Congressman Sherman said in response to the potential settlement, “In December of 2013, the SEC issued a report saying all was fine with the credit rating system, so they didn't need to implement Franken-Sherman. Now the SEC must implement a new system. They can no longer claim that the old system avoids conflict of interest, unless they are willing to give back the $1.4 billion fine. You can't just say everything is fine, and then keep the fine.” The proposed $1.37 billion settlement includes fines that will go to the federal government and a number of states, including $100 million to California.
01.22.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the second ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, announced new Subcommittee roles for the 114th Congress. In the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sherman will serve as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Asia, and will continue to serve on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, as the Chairman Emeritus (former Chairman). In the House Financial Services Committee, Sherman will join the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit, and continue to serve on the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. “It is a great privilege to become the ranking member on Asia,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “As this administration continues to ramp up interest in Asia, I hope to help shape better trade policy and scale back the free trade agreements which have increased our trade deficit, outsourced jobs and rewarded countries that have not traded fairly with the United States. Under the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership goods made in Vietnam, where workers are paid 40 cents per hour, will enter America duty-free. That’s not the way to raise wages in America. “I’m also pleased to be joining the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions where I can focus on keeping in place many of the important protections we enacted that Republicans are eager to dissolve.” The Asia Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction on foreign relations with over half the world’s population, has become increasingly important as Congress and the Obama administration has shifted focus to the region. From this post, Sherman will be able to tackle an array of issues including U.S.-China Relations, large scale economic policy with the surrounding region, developing our critical relationship with India and Pakistan, overseeing the U.S. response to maritime disputes in Southeast Asia, and deepening long-term alliances with Korea and Japan. -30-
01.21.2015	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) made the following statement after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address. Sherman is Co-Chair of the House CPA Caucus and serving his tenth term in Congress. “I was generally pleased with the President’s remarks this evening,” said Congressman Sherman. “I support the President’s actions and proposals dealing with lowering mortgage insurance premiums, free community college tuition, cyber security for consumers, paid sick leave for workers and families, and limiting methane gas emissions.”Iran “I have to disagree with the President on his approach to Iran sanctions. Like the President, I believe that we should work towards a comprehensive negotiated solution. I believe that enacting additional sanctions, that would not take effect unless Iran fails to agree to a reasonable deal by July, will increase the President’s leverage and make a good deal more likely.Taxes “I agree with the President that investment gains should not escape capital gains tax merely because the asset is passed from a deceased family member upon death. However, the family should pay capital gains tax when the asset is sold. Unfortunately, the President proposes that capital gains tax be paid at the time of death, rather than when the asset is sold. When will the family have cash to pay a capital gains tax? (The capital gains taxes the President proposes are on top of the estate tax due under current law. Estate taxes are due upon death and apply to assets of a decedent over $5.3 million). Of course, the President’s tax proposals are more a part of our party platform than anything that will likely become law in the next two years.Trade “I strongly disagree with the President’s position on trade. Congress should not give the President “Fast Track” authority to force into place job killing legislation such as the Trans-Pacific-Partnership. These policies are increasing our trade deficit, taking American jobs and rewarding countries that commit gross human rights violations. Under the Trans-Pacific –Partnership goods made in Vietnam, where workers are paid 40 cents per hour, will enter America duty free. That’s not the way to raise wages in America.War Powers Act “I agree with the president that Congress should vote on a War Powers Resolution to clarify any authority the president may have to use military force in the fight against ISIS and other terrorist groups around the world. Congress should not authorize ground combat operations, except for raids to free American hostages.
01.20.2015	Sherman Helps Secure Funding For Early Earthquake PreparednessEncourages Preparedness on 21st Anniversary of Northridge Quake Washington, D.C. – On the eve of the 21st anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake, Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is highlighting new Congressional funding for earthquake detection. Passage of the 2015 Funding Bill now includes 5 million dollars for the West Coast Earthquake Early Warning System. Developed by Caltech, UC-Berkeley and University of Washington, the new system will use the funds to build additional stations, install new sensory equipment and help develop new warning technology. With advanced notice, people can take cover, trains can slow down, and doctors can pause surgeries – it can save lives and reduce the economic impact of an earthquake. Sherman was an early advocate of this funding along with his colleagues Rep. Adam Schiff (D -CA) in the House and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) in the Senate. In light of the anniversary, Sherman is also reminding residents of the San Fernando Valley and metropolitan Los Angeles how they can prepare for a future seismic event. “This is a day of solemn tribute to the tragic events in Northridge, and a reminder to be vigilant and prepared for future earthquakes,” said Congressman Sherman. “Twenty-one years ago, over 60 lives were lost, and nearly 2000 more injured in one of the largest earthquakes in our nation’s history. The memory of physical damage and the cost of human life should remind us to prepare ourselves and our families for when Los Angeles is struck again – whether it is an earthquake, a fire, or another natural disaster. While much work is still needed to improve our early warning and detection system, I am pleased my colleagues and I were able to secure this new funding.” The Northridge Earthquake was one of the most costly federal disasters in history, with damages in excess of $20 billion. It was the 11th largest earthquake recorded in California since 1769, measuring higher on the “Richter Scale” than any other North American earthquake in an urban area. PREPAREDNESS Sherman encourages all residents to prepare themselves by taking the following steps before, during, and after an earthquake: Before an earthquake: (1) Check for hazards in the home, (2) identify safe places indoors and outdoors, (3) educate yourself and family members, (4) have disaster supplies on hand, (5) develop an emergency communication plan, and (6) help your community get ready by talking to your neighbors or participating in your neighborhood council. During an earthquake: Take cover indoors in a safe place such as under a sturdy table or within a doorway. If outdoors, stay in a safe open area away from buildings, streetlights and utility wires. After an earthquake: Expect aftershocks, listen to a battery-operated radio or television for emergency information, use the telephone for emergency calls only, stay away from damaged areas; inspect your home for damages, and inspect gas lines and electrical systems, as well as sewage and water lines. For more information about earthquake preparedness, visit the following websites: www.fema.gov, https://www.usgs.gov, www.oes.ca.gov, orwww.lacity.org/emd. Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley constituents may contact him directly with questions or additional concerns at (818) 501-9200. HISTORY OF NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE On January 17, 1994, at approximately 4:30 a.m., the San Fernando Valley and much of Southern California awoke to a massive earthquake that shook the nerves of residents for one minute followed by hundreds of unnerving aftershocks. When the shaking stopped, the 6.7 magnitude earthquake damaged 114,000 residential and commercial structures spread over 2,100 square miles. The Northridge Earthquake killed over 60 people, injured nearly 12,000, left thousands temporarily homeless, and significantly impaired Los Angeles’ infrastructure network. President Bill Clinton reacted quickly, deploying personnel and resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake to assist public agencies in the recovery effort. President Clinton declared a federal disaster within hours of the earthquake, enabling individuals to apply for federal disaster assistance. Nearly 700,000 Southern California residents registered for federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA disbursed $7.8 billion in Individual, Public and Mitigation Assistance program funds. In all, the Federal government expended $13.2 billion toward the recovery.
01.08.2015	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D–CA) released the following statement following news that Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) will not seek another term in the U.S. Senate. "I'm saddened to learn that Barbara Boxer will not be seeking another term in the U.S. Senate. She is a superb representative of California and a tenacious and effective Senator. Although her time in this body has not yet run out, she has established a tremendous legacy as a champion of environmental protection, women’s rights, and strong progressive values. I look forward to continuing our work together, particularly on legislation to protect the Soledad Canyon region from invasive mining operations that would compromise clean air and local quality of life. I know that Senator Boxer’s good work will not end with her time in the Senate, and I wish her luck in all her future endeavors." -30-
01.07.2015	October 3, 2013 International Accounting Standards Board First Floor 30 Cannon St. London EC4M 6XH United Kingdom Financial Accounting Standards Board File Reference No. 1850-100 401 Merritt 7 PO Box 5116 Norwalk, CT 06856-5116 Re: Comments on Proposed Accounting Standards Revision (Leases, Topic 842) FASB File Reference No. 2013-270 Dear Board Members and Staff, For 17 years, I’ve been the loudest voice on the relevant House Committee (The Committee on Financial Services) in favor of independence for the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). A few years ago I also co-founded the CPA Caucus in Congress. To some extent, my credibility with my colleagues on that Committee is dependent on the FASB making reasonable decisions. My arguments in favor of FASB independence will seem impractical, even delusional, if the FASB adopts the current Exposure Draft on leases. The harm to the economy, and particularly to small and medium-sized businesses, is far greater than you can imagine. Congress has urged you not to adopt the Exposure Draft at different times, including: • Letter dated May 14, 2013 signed by myself and a bipartisan group of 12 others: John Campbell, Peter King, Jim Matheson, Gary Miller, Eliot Engel, Steve Stivers, Bill Owens, Dennis Ross, Mike Quigley, David Schweikert, Dana Rohrabacher, Ken Calvert • Letter dated May 17, 2012 signed by myself and a bipartisan group of 60 others: Jim Matheson, Pedro Pierluisi, Wm. Lacy Clay, Joe Baca, Bill Owens, Collin Peterson, Dennis Kucinich, Grace Napolitano, Ed Pastor, Russ Carnahan, Robert Brady, Sam Farr, Marcy Kaptur, Gwen Moore, Janice Hahn, Dan Boren, Ed Perlmutter, Jim Moran, John Carney, Zoe Lofgren, Mike Ross, Maxine Waters, Suzanne Bonamici, Judy Chu, Mike Thompson, Gerald Connolly, Peter DeFazio, Albio Sires, Carolyn Maloney, Ted Deutch, Leonard Boswell, Shelley Berkley, Jerry McNerney, Ron Kind, Eliot Engel, Charlie Gonzalez, John Campbell, David Schweikert, Paul Broun, Jim Gerlach, Rob Bishop, Tom Petri, Lynn Westmoreland, Peter King, Nan Hayworth, Robert Dold, Peter Roskam, Ed Royce, Scott Garrett, Bill Posey, Ken Calvert, Dana Rohrabacher, Bill Johnson, Walter Jones, Charles Dent, Bill Flores, Michael Grimm, Steve Stivers, Donald Manzullo To my knowledge, virtually all the members of Congress aware of your Exposure Draft have urged you not to adopt it. The only reason you haven’t received a letter signed by hundreds of members is that not many of my colleagues have yet focused on it. To adopt the Exposure Draft when the FASB’s own Investor Advisory Committee (IAC) has determined that the proposed change is not needed by the users of financial statements would be mystifying. Economic Harm I particularly urge you to carefully review the comment letters from people in the real estate industry, which repeatedly make the factually accurate point that all real estate leases are not financings, and should not be treated as if they were. Current GAAP correctly draw a distinction between a capital lease on the one hand and an ordinary lease on the other. American law, including bankruptcy law, treats leases as dramatically different from financed ownership of an interest in real estate. Under virtually every lease which is not regarded as a “capital lease” under current accounting principles, the lessee does not substantially obtain all of the economic rights of ownership of the lease property. As detailed in the comment letters, a study by the Equipment Leasing and Finance Foundation indicated that capitalizing operating leases would add $2 trillion of debt to the balance sheets of U.S.-based corporations, dramatically increasing the cost of capital, and perhaps stalling our fragile economic recovery. Accounting rules should not have such dramatic effects on economic activity; they are meant to be neutral means of scorekeeping. Another study highlighted in several comment letters, commissioned in 2012 by the National Association of Realtors, the Real Estate Roundtable, the Business Owners and Managers Association International, and others, shows as follows: • In its “best case scenario” the Exposure Draft would destroy 190,000 U.S. jobs and reduce U.S. GDP by $27.5 billion annually. • In the worst case scenario the cost would be 3.3 million jobs and a reduction of U.S. GDP of $478.6 billion annually. This study bases it conclusions on the effect that the Exposure Draft would have in reducing spending by companies necessitated by de-leveraging in order to deal with the apparent increase in liabilities; increased borrowing costs for lessees because they have higher debt ratios; and the reduced value of real estate resulting from contraction in the economy. The study did not include all of the following which would further exacerbate the harm done to the American economy, all of which are predicted in the comment letters you have already received: higher rents; shortened lease terms; downward pressure on real estate values from shortened lease terms; and increased administrative costs. As noted by many commenters, there will be a shift to shorter lease terms, which will raise the cost of (or possibly make unavailable) the construction and permanent financing that lessors must obtain in order to successfully build and lease commercial and industrial real estate. Tenants will have strong incentives to opt for shorter-term real estate leases in order to both reduce their reported liabilities, and to avoid the complexity of constantly estimating and re-estimating whether and when future real estate lease options will be exercised. They will also be incented to avoid real estate renewal options and to compensate lessors with contingent rather than fixed payments. Social Effects In addition to these egregious problems identified by numerous commenters, Congress has a substantial national interest in community continuity. Distorting the economic behavior of lessees and lessors is not only bad for both parties to the transaction, it is bad for the communities we represent. Closed down factories, even if they are relocated to some other location in the U.S., creates a social cost. Our tax policy favors continuity in community, homeownership, and continuity of ownership of real estate, which is subject to capital gains tax only upon a change of ownership. My state and many others have adopted property tax laws designed to assure community continuity. I doubt that this is an issue that the Board has even considered. Penalizing the long-term lease will do great social harm. Adherence to the Role of Accounting Principle Authorities The proposed exposure draft violates a number of the principles for creating new accounting standards. First, it will not merely measure financial behavior, it will distort financial behavior. It will certainly push toward short term leases. It will disincentivize lease renewal options. It will encourage lessees to compensate lessors using those forms of contingent lease payments that are not required to be capitalized. Financial statements should be comparable over time. Individual investors have made mental notes as to what balance sheet ratios they would like to see. Will these investors mentally recalculate their rules of thumb? I have not reviewed to what extent lessees will be required to restate all their prior balance sheets. If they do so, this will be at substantial cost. If they do not, then comparing a company over time will be difficult. Even if they do restate their balance sheet, comparing the company over time will be difficult because many investors have already analyzed the balance sheets when originally issued. Under the Exposure Draft it will be almost impossible to compare two businesses in the same industry, if one tends to sign fixed-rate leases and the other tends to sign contingent-rate leases. A tenant that decided to compensate the lessor by providing valuable contingent rent, together with a lower fixed rent, could capitalize far less. This might distort economic behavior and will certainly make it impossible to compare one retailer with another. Process No Member of Congress can devote even 1% of their time to following the FASB. Few are able to allocate even close to that. Most of my colleagues will be shocked when they see the economic impact of this exposure draft if it is adopted, and how the process failed to listen to the real estate industry and how it excluded small business from participation. Fighting for FASB independence will be much tougher in the decade to come than it has been in the decade just completed. This is because the behavior of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have created a strong ideological abhorrence for organizations that are part governmental (whether they choose to admit it or not) and partly private. The FASB is funded by fees which most would regard as taxes, in the sense that they are not voluntary and are paid by those who do not want the service provided. The FASB promulgates “principles” affecting our economy and every bit as significant as regulations issued by a host of government agencies. While most of the ideological abhorrence of entities that are part-governmental is focused on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, over the coming years a host of other entities that have both governmental and non-governmental characteristics will face increasing scrutiny. Accordingly, it is necessary that FASB issue reasonable principles after a fair process. It is important that FASB show that it is focused on the potential harms of the Exposure Draft, as detailed by the studies mentioned above. In addition, the IAC has determined that this exposure draft does not improve financial statements from the standpoint of users. The failure of FASB to do full-blown field testing of this proposed change in accounting for leases dramatically undermines its credibility in Congress and elsewhere. It’s almost as if the Board wishes to remain oblivious to the implementation cost, practicality, consistency of results, negative impacts and unintended consequences of this ill-conceived change. The FASB believes it has done a reasonable job of reaching out to the public. This is because the FASB and 99% of lessees are oblivious to the impacts this rule will have. As noted below, this rule will put hundreds of thousands of small businesses in violation of their loan agreements. These hundreds of thousands of businesses don’t have the money to pay lawyers and accountants to speak for them. They have not been heard. While you are having two meetings in the U.S., only persons specifically invited are allowed to speak. Less than a tenth of a percent of the hundreds of thousands of businesses that will be affected are even aware of the hearing. This is less due process than is afforded even the most inconsequential actions taken under the Administrative Procedure Act, which affects federal agencies whose rules are far less consequential than yours. Likewise, those who will lose construction jobs, those whose communities will lose continuity, and many others who will be adversely affected are shut out of the process both because of your limited outreach to ordinary America, and by your restricted approach to who may address even the minority of board members who are hearing public testimony. The FASB is aware of its own process, and judged by that standard, believes that its efforts to seek input have been more than adequate. My colleagues, however, are not so much aware of the FASB history, and are more familiar with the process that city councils, administrative agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and state and federal legislative bodies follow before making an important decision. Measured by these standards, your outreach has been woefully inadequate and your refusal to field-test your proposal conflicts with the due process expectations of my colleagues in Congress. Under such circumstances defending FASB independence will become increasingly difficult. Violations of Loan Covenants As you well know, the Exposure Draft standard would, when it takes effect, immediately trigger the violation of many loan covenants. I’ve discussed this matter on several occasions with FASB staff. They’ve assured me that there really is not much to worry about because loan covenants contain provisions such that the balance sheet ratios are to be calculated according to the accounting principles in force when the loan is extended. Even for the largest companies, however, this will not always be true. My concern, however, is for the rest of American business. The FASB staff has shown a phenomenal disconnect with the world outside of the Fortune 1,000 companies. The Fortune 1,000 companies play a very substantial role in drafting their loan documents. When they issue bonds in the public market, the issuer (borrower) drafts the documents. When these large companies negotiate major loan agreements, they’re represented by an experienced legal counsel. When the borrower drafts the loan document, care is often taken so that a change in accounting principles does not trigger a loan default. What about the rest of American business? These businesses borrow from banks and other lenders pursuant to loan documents drafted by the lenders. They may on occasion be able to change a paragraph or two here or there, but all the standard provisions are drafted by, and for, the lender. In virtually all of these cases, the borrower does not have the acumen to suggest that loan covenants are calculated according to then-existing accounting principles, nor does the borrower have the bargaining strength to insist that changes in such technical provisions of the loan documents be effectuated. Thus, the adoption of this exposure draft would cause a large percentage of American businesses to be in violation of their loan covenants. Your staff has also put forward the idea that the banks will simply waive the violation of the loan covenants, or negotiate new provisions calling for different balance sheet ratios. This also shows an absurd lack of connection with the business reality faced by most small and medium sized businesses. Some banks will want to be generous, kind and reasonable to their borrowers. They may want to voluntarily waive or modify the loan covenants, even if the value of the security pledged for the loan has declined (as is true for virtually all pre-2009 loans). In those cases, they face federal and/or state bank examiners who will penalize them for their generosity. Even performing loans that are modified are subject to new banking-examiner analysis. A bank that decided to be reasonable and waive loan covenants might find itself disadvantaged by bank examiners. This is particularly true if the value of the security for the loan has declined. In the majority of cases affecting perhaps millions of small businesses, lenders will demand any of the following: immediate payment of the loan; higher interest rate; or a personal guarantee from the business owners. You could of course provide that the new accounting principle is not applicable to businesses with pre-existing loan covenants. Then you would have two identical businesses reporting according to two different accounting principles based only on whether or not their loan documents contain requirements that they maintain certain balance sheet ratios. Transition Rules Can’t Solve Loan Covenants Problem This problem cannot be solved by a transition rule of less than thirty years, and of course a translation period of that length would make the accounting principle nonviable. Many of the bond indentures provide for terms of thirty years or even longer in length. While some of the bond agreements applicable to publicly-traded debt contain a provision stating that the balance sheet ratios are to be calculated according to accounting principles in existence when the bonds are issued, some do not. Virtually none of the loan agreements signed by non public and especially smaller companies contain such an “out” for the borrower, and many long-term lease agreements, the very object of your concern, may be voided at the lessors’ option if the lessee (often a small business with little bargaining power) fails to maintain certain balance sheet ratios. Conclusion The fact that there will not be 500 business owners and their employees marching in front of your Los Angeles-area hearing is not because you will destroy fewer jobs and fewer businesses than you imagine. It is only because the owners of these businesses and their employees do not have the time, resources, or inclination to study FASB exposure drafts—and your outreach efforts have been so inadequate that they remain unaware of the tsunami that is about to hit them. The change in accounting rules that are proposed by the Exposure Draft is simply too important to be left to those very few Americans who regularly read FASB exposure drafts. It is time to field test. It is time to have real public outreach. Very Truly Yours, Brad Sherman, CPA
12.22.2014	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the second Ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee issued the following statement: “Kim Jong-un has used vandalism and threats of violence to suppress speech in the United States. The North Korean government has prevented millions of Americans from seeing a particular movie, at least during December. Importantly, these threats are now causing movie and television producers to delay or abandon “sensitive” projects. “It is time to give North Korea a double dose of free speech. Currently Radio Free Asia and Voice of America reach North Koreans eleven hours each night, at a cost to American taxpayers of $8 million annually (or roughly one tenth of what it cost Sony to make and advertise “The Interview”). We should ramp this up to $16 million. “Dictators like Kim Jong-un fear nothing as much as the truth and it is time to bring a maximum supply of truth both to the North Korean people, and to the elites which form the core of the regime’s support. “We also maintain websites aimed at North Korea, but we do not provide television broadcasts. Our web efforts should be aimed at undermining Kim Jong-un among these elites, who have internet access. “The BBG Report on North Korea (issued December 8, 2014) shows that our current eleven hour per day stream of broadcasting to North Koreans falls a bit short of our own 12 hour per day goal. Though nighttime hours are more effective than daylight hours, we should be broadcasting 24 hours a day into North Korea. (The BBG, Broadcasting Board of Governors, is the US government agency which oversees the Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.) “The Report also indicates that for medium wave (AM) we are dependent on leased transmission sites (usually leased from South Korean radio broadcasters). The Broadcasting Board of Governors is seeking to construct its own medium wave transmitter in South Korea at a location optimally suited to reach the North Korean people. This effort should be funded and expedited. “We should explore using satellite television broadcasting. If television broadcasting into North Korea is practical, then later next year we should broadcast “The Interview” dubbed in Korean.” _____________________________________________________ Congressman Sherman also chairs the Entertainment Industry Caucus in the House of Representatives. He has also called for re-listing North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism and he has asked Sony to provide a copy of “The Interview” for screening in the Capitol to Members of Congress. See Letter Here. Attached is the Report of the Broadcasting Board of Governors (which oversees both Voice of America and Radio Free Asia) issued December 8, 2014, pursuant to the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act. Final Fact: Freedom House ranked North Korea dead last (out of 197 countries surveyed) for 11 years in a row in its annual Freedom of the Press Report.
12.22.2014	December 22, 2014 Mr. Michael Lynton CEO Sony Pictures Entertainment 10202 West Washington Boulevard Culver City, CA 90232 Re: Invitation to screen The Interview at the U.S. Capitol Dear Mr. Lynton I am extending an offer to screen The Interview in the U.S. Capitol facilities. As Chairman of the Entertainment Industries Caucus, I believe we should stand in solidarity with Sony Pictures and the American film industry. Threats from a dictator in North Korea should not stop Americans from seeing any movie. We have a responsibility to stand up against these attempts at intimidation. This is also about educating Members of Congress. Everyone is talking about The Interview. I think it’s important for Congress to know, and see, what we are talking about. Screening The Interview will demonstrate the U.S. Congress’s support of the freedom of speech. This is about our right to live without fear, and knowing that our values will not be compromised by the idle threats of a despotic regime. Good or bad, Americans should not be deprived of the opportunity to see this movie. It is now the responsibility of the U.S. government to allocate the necessary resources to ensure moviegoers’ safety. We must help Sony Pictures, movie theater owners, and moviegoers regain the confidence to go see The Interview. If you have any questions please contact Lauren Wolman at lauren.wolman@mail.house.gov or (202) 225-5911.

12.18.2014	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman issued the following statement after news of the passing of Rabbi Harold Schulweis. “I am deeply saddened by the loss of Rabbi Schulweis. He was my Rabbi and I’ve been a member of his congregation at Valley Beth Shalom since the mid-1990s. As a leader in the community for over 45 years, he was an innovator that transformed the synagogue beyond a place of worship into a true community that fostered activism, counseling, and charity. My wife and I had the honor of listening to his sermons on many occasions; he was a moving speaker and constant inspiration. My mother, wife and I also had the privilege of joining him and his wife for dinner from time to time where he shared his insight and wisdom. Rabbi Schulweis was one of the preeminent Jewish thinkers, scholars and intellectuals of our time and the author of many books including “For Those Who Can't Believe: Overcoming the Obstacles to Faith” and “Evil and the Morality of God.” His leadership taught us the importance of reaching beyond our borders. Jewish World Watch, an organization he founded, brought schools, churches, and synagogues together to combat hunger and genocide across the globe. ‘Do not stand idly by’ was his frequent refrain – referring to the work we all must do together to overcome injustice. He was also a reformer, who was among the first Conservative rabbis to welcome openly gay and lesbian Jews into his synagogue. His legacy and his writings leave a lasting impact here in Los Angeles and in communities everywhere. My wife Lisa and I send our sincerest condolences to his wife Malkah and his children Seth, Ethan, and Alyssa and the entire Schulweis family.” -30-
12.11.2014	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced the introduction of legislation that would eliminate so-called “right-to-work” laws, which was applauded by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. Sherman has a strong record of supporting working men and women, having introduced this same legislation in the 110th, 111th, and 112th Congress, and consistently earning a 100% rating from the AFL-CIO. “We now have 24 states with ‘Right-to-Work’ provisions,” said Sherman. “Their stated goal: take jobs from other states by offering a more business friendly climate. In other words: weaker unions and lower wages. Only by ending so-called ‘Right-to-Work’ nationwide can we stop the race to the bottom.” Right-to-work laws require unions to represent non-dues-paying employees, thereby undermining the basic premise and promise of union membership and creating free riders – people who are exempt from paying their fair share. Right-to-work laws create different standards for union membership in different states. This results not only in confusion over the regulation of union membership, but also places a higher cost on worker representation in labor rights states. Right-to-work laws have come to be known as right-to-work-for-less laws, because employees in states with these laws average about $5,680 a year less than workers in labor rights states. “I do not believe that there should be a right to be treated unfairly or to endure unnecessary restrictions. Right-to-work laws strip unions of their legitimate ability to collect dues, even when the worker is covered by a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. This forces unions to use their time and members’ dues to provide benefits to free riders who are exempt from paying their fair share,” Congressman Sherman continued. “These laws are harmful to states like California, which allows labor unions to organize, because now we have to compete with the race to the bottom, as our companies have to compete with those where the workers would like better wages, working conditions and benefits but are unable to organize to get them.” “With the introduction of legislation banning so-called right-to-work, Congressman Sherman has once again demonstrated his strong commitment to working families,” said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. “Right-to-work laws undermine the economy and weaken workers' ability to bargain for better working conditions, which translates into lower pay and fewer benefits for everyone.” In 1947, Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act stripped the federal government of its role in protecting the American workers’ right to freedom of association by allowing states to pass legislation that eliminates the ability of unions to collect dues from their members. The result is a confusing web of labor laws that encourages a race to the bottom. The list of original cosponsors includes: Karen Bass (D-CA) Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) Robert A.

12.11.2014	I yield myself so much time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Soledad Canyon Settlement Act. This act is a testament to bipartisanship, fiscal responsibility, environmental stewardship, local consensus building and tireless tenacity for the public good. Bipartisanship: Here in this House the bill is introduced, carried and written by our colleague Buck McKeon. In the Senate the same language has been introduced by Senator Barbara Boxer and is supported by Senator Feinstein. You can’t get anymore bipartisan than that. Fiscal responsibility: CBO says this bill cost the government zero dollars and zero cents. You can’t get a lower cost estimate on a bill than that. Environmental stewardship: this bill is supported by the Sierra Club and this land will become the gateway to the new San Gabriel Mountains National Monument Local consensus building: this bill has the support of local leaders and legislators, governor Jerry Brown, Semex the local lease owner and virtually everyone involved in public life in Santa Clarita which is Los Angeles County’s third largest city. Tireless Tenacity: Mr. Speaker, tireless tenacity for the public good is exemplified by our friend Buck McKeon. 22 years in congress and I believe 22 years focused on this problem and now on what may very well be his last legislative day, we have a chance to solve this problem in a way that I think exemplifies what we should be trying to do here in Congress. In addition to Bucks’ tireless tenacity I want to commend the city leaders of Santa Clarita, many time mayor Loraine West who I believe is now a City council member and has been mayor of that city so often. Bob Keller now the mayor pro-tem, Ken Striplen the city manager and the hundreds and thousands of people in Santa Clarita and the immediate area. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that’s needed because it will stop the mining of 56 million tons of sand and gravel which is now incompatible with a city that has grown to more than double its size when the project was originally planned and now constitutes an area of well more than a quarter million people. This sand and gravel mining operation is incompatible with the new population of the area and it is also incompatible with the roads and traffic which is busy not only at rush hour but throughout the day. So I want to commend the gentleman from Santa Clarita for his decades of work for his district, his town and all the people of California. I want to urge an ‘aye’ vote on the Soledad Canyon Settlement Act and I reserve the balance of my time.
12.10.2014	Congressman Sherman Presents Congressional Gold Medal Recipient with Congressional Flag. From Left: Lt. Col. Jeri Truesdell, Capt. Jenny Lynn Burnett, Congressman Brad Sherman Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA) was pleased to join Lieutenant Colonel Jeri Truesdell, a 100-year-old Winnetka resident, as she was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal for her participation in the Civil Air Patrol during World War II. The Congressional Gold Medal, which is one of the highest civilian honors, is bestowed by Congress to recognize individuals who have performed an achievement that has had a major impact on American history and culture. This year, following legislation cosponsored by Congressman Sherman, the medal collectively honored the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol in recognition of their military service and exemplary record during the war. “Lt. Col. Truesdell is an American hero,” said Congressman Sherman. “During the war she was a pioneer for women in service whose courage and bravery make her exceptionally worthy of this high honor. Her piloting ability and continued service to our country is inspirational.” Born with a passion to fly, Lt. Col. Truesdell joined the Civilian Air Patrol in 1942, shortly after its formation during WWII. In 1944 Truesdell joined the Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), where she helped train other female pilots. Truesdell eventually moved to California after joining the Navy Reserve. She has been listed in the Women in Military Service for America registry in The Women’s Memorial at Arlington in Washington D.C. She has also earned a WWII Victory Medal, which is awarded to members who served honorably in active duty.BackgroundThe Legislation: H.R.755 - To award a Congressional Gold Medal to the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol. The legislation, cosponsored by Congressman Sherman, which passed the House and Senate directs the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives to arrange for the award of a single Congressional Gold Medal to honor collectively the World War II members of the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) in recognition of their military service and exemplary record during World War II. It also requires the Medal's display at the Smithsonian Institution, and expresses the sense of Congress that the Medal should be made available for display elsewhere, particularly at locations associated with the CAP. Recipients will also awarded bronze duplicates of the gold medal.About Congressional Gold Medal Recipients: Since the American Revolution, Congress has commissioned gold medals as its highest expression of national appreciation for distinguished achievements and contributions. Each medal honors a particular individual, institution, or event. Although the first recipients included citizens who participated in the American Revolution, the War of 1812 and the Mexican War, Congress broadened the scope of the medal to include actors, authors, entertainers, musicians, pioneers in aeronautics and space, explorers, lifesavers, notables in science and medicine, athletes, humanitarians, public servants, and foreign recipients. In addition to the requirement that all Congressional Gold Medal legislation must be cosponsored by at least two-thirds (290) of the Members of the House, specific standards are set forth by Rule X, 2 (h) of the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic Policy and Technology when considering such legislation. Additionally, the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee requires that at least 67 Senators must cosponsor any Congressional Gold Medal legislation before the committee will consider it.About the Civilian Air Patrol: In the late 1930s, more than 150,000 volunteers with a love for aviation argued for an organization to put their planes and flying skills to use in defense of their country. As a result, the Civil Air Patrol was born one week prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Thousands of volunteer members answered America's call to national service and sacrifice by accepting and performing critical wartime missions. Assigned to the War Department under the jurisdiction of the Army Air Corps, the contributions of Civil Air Patrol, including logging more than 500,000 flying hours, sinking two enemy submarines, and saving hundreds of crash victims during World War II, are well documented. After the war, a thankful nation understood that Civil Air Patrol could continue providing valuable services to both local and national agencies. On July 1, 1946, President Harry Truman signed Public Law 476 incorporating Civil Air Patrol as a benevolent, nonprofit organization. On May 26, 1948, Congress passed Public Law 557 permanently establishing Civil Air Patrol as the auxiliary of the new U.S. Air Force. Three primary mission areas were set forth at that time: aerospace education, cadet programs, and emergency services.
11.24.2014	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman issued the following statement on the announcement today that the P-5+1 group of countries and Iran have agreed to an additional extension for the talks aimed at ending Iran’s nuclear program until the end of June, 2015. After one year of negotiations, a final accord to limit Iran’s nuclear program remains elusive. With this second extension, a disturbing pattern has emerged, one that provides the Iranian regime too much breathing room on sanctions while allowing it to continue to enrich uranium. President Obama misspoke yesterday when he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos: “The good news is that the interim deal that we entered into has definitely stopped Iran’s nuclear program from advancing...” Throughout the interim deal, Iran's centrifuges have been spinning at full speed, enlarging Iran's dangerous stockpile of enriched uranium oxide.* With each passing day, Iran’s centrifuges continue to spin and its economy improves. I am disappointed that we have been required to pay again for an extension that was necessary due to Iranian intransigence. Over the 7 months of this extension, Iran will continue to enjoy access to approximately $700 million per month in funds that have been effectively frozen in foreign bank accounts. The IAEA investigation into Iran's weapons development program has been stonewalled by the Iranians, further demonstrating that Iran will not be honest with the international community and has been, and continues to be, set on developing nuclear weapons. We should work to pass tough sanctions now, and these sanctions should go into effect immediately. In the months ahead, if the President submits a final agreement to Congress to verifiably and permanently end Iran’s nuclear weapons program in return for sanctions relief, it should receive immediate consideration by Congress. I am certain that Congress would approve a good agreement. And I am certain that immediate strong new sanctions give us the best opportunity to negotiate a good agreement. Modest sanctions have achieved modest results. It’s clear now we need strong sanctions to achieve a good deal. *Technical note: Turning uranium ore into low enriched uranium constitutes the most significant part in creating the fuel for a nuclear bomb. This process has continued unabated since the original interim deal was announced a year ago, and during the last year Iran has added about one bomb’s worth of low enriched uranium to its stockpile. While Iran has been obliged to oxidize this additional stockpile, this is a process the can be reversed in weeks. -30-
11.18.2014	WASHINGTON, DC—Representative Brad Sherman, Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, released the following statement on the terrorist attack on the Kehilat Bnei Torah synagogue in Jerusalem, Israel, that killed five people including including three American citizens, and an Israeli police officer: “I cannot condemn strongly enough this horrific act in which four worshipers were taken from their families by terrorists. My thoughts are with their families and the communities in which they lived. “As three of the five victims are American citizens, I know our government will do everything it can, alongside our ally Israel, to ensure justice is done. While those who conducted this attack were killed by Israeli police, we need to ensure that anyone who planned or helped these attacks is brought to justice. “This despicable act reminds us once again that incitement to violence is a powerful and destructive force. Palestinian officials must address incitement to violence within their society rather than help fan it. Violence will not bring about a Palestinian state or any other political goal. Incitement must stop once and for all.”
11.17.2014	Washington DC - Congressmen Ted Poe and Brad Sherman, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, released the following statement laying out their position on the broad contours of an acceptable final deal on Iran’s nuclear program in advance of a hearing they have called this week. The hearing, to be held tomorrow on Tuesday, November 18 at 2:00 pm in 2200 of the Rayburn House Office Building, will provide the opportunity to hear from experts in detail regarding what an acceptable deal would look like and what an effective verification and compliance regime would entail. “We hope that the P5+1 will reach a durable agreement that will permanently end Iran’s nuclear weapons program in a way that is 100% verifiable. “Iran must not be left with the ability to either break out or sneak out of a final agreement. Any final agreement must not just freeze but work to dismantle Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Any agreement must also withhold sanctions relief until the Iranian side has demonstrated that they are complying with the terms of the agreement. This may take many years, but it is critical that the international community maintains leverage to ensure compliance and punish transgressions. Staged sanctions relief should only come in the event that Iran meets clear milestones in dismantling its nuclear program set out in an acceptable final agreement.” “Compliance with any agreement will be nearly impossible without knowing the extent of Iran’s past activities with “potential military dimensions,” the efforts to manufacture a bomb, as distinct from the fissile material that would fuel a bomb. Iran must not only end efforts to produce bomb fuel, it needs to let the world know what efforts it has undertaken to actually design and manufacture nuclear weapons; otherwise, the world will not be able to fully verify that these efforts have also ended.” “Those who desperately want a deal with Iran say that a good deal is better than no deal. We believe it is also true that no deal is better than a bad one. If we cannot get the Iranians to sign a good deal, we will be ready to dramatically increase the pressure on Iran through additional sanctions and diplomatic isolation.” -30-
10.29.2014	Sherman Oaks – Congressman Brad Sherman (D- Sherman Oaks) released the following statement in reaction to an article published by Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic titled, “The Crisis in U.S.-Israel Relations Is Officially Here.” Goldberg’s article included reports of pejorative terms used by Administration officials to describe Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. “Obviously the comments made by unnamed administration officials about Prime Minister Netanyahu are outrageous,” said Sherman. “They are beyond inappropriate and counterproductive. There is no doubt that President Obama and Netanyahu have not agreed on a number of issues, but referring to a leader of a friendly country in such terms is unacceptable. “I know that the White House has already publically disavowed the comments. The author of the Atlantic article uses the term ‘Administration officials.’ The White House assured me that the pejorative statements were not made by anyone at the White House. I hope that both the Obama Administration and the Netanyahu Government take this opportunity to reaffirm the close relationship between the United States and Israel, and that the two governments continue to work through legitimate disagreements. Personal attacks against leaders of allied countries have no place in our foreign policy.” -30-
10.24.2014	I am outraged by the attack that occurred in Jerusalem on Wednesday and deeply saddened by the death of an infant girl, Chaya Zissel Braun. There is an added measure of sadness to this tragedy for us in Los Angeles because the girl’s family is from LA. Our thoughts and prayers are with them. I also hope for a quick recovery for those hurt in this terrorist attack, including Shmueli Braun, the girl’s father.
10.20.2014	Washington DC – A new survey released by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) shows that veterans living in the San Fernando Valley area reported moderate satisfaction with their healthcare and benefits when seeking care at local VA facilities. The survey, which included nearly 150 local Valley veterans, found that 71% of respondents reported receiving timely and adequate healthcare. Regarding benefits other than health care such as disability benefits, vocational rehabilitation, or education and training, 64% of respondents reported being satisfied with the time it took to receive treatment and the quality of service. Those veterans who reported dissatisfaction with care were referred to Congressman Sherman’s constituent services staff who are now working to help resolve their healthcare and benefits issues. “I conducted a Valley survey because official VA records in Arizona and elsewhere had been manipulated and falsified to give the appearance of shorter wait times,” said Congressman Sherman. “Our nation’s veterans deserve the best healthcare available. I am working to ensure that facilities in the LA area are suitable to fit the needs of veterans in our area, including helping allocate funds to the Sepulveda Ambulatory Health Care Center, and the West LA Health Care Center. There is much work to be done to correct these alarming trends in long wait times and backlogs at VA facilities, which is why I am working to help pass reforms that ensure greater transparency and better management of the VA.” The survey was conducted by mail and sent to veterans living in the South and West Valley. Some veterans also responded through an online survey, and through questionnaires distributed at public events. Only those entitled to veteran benefits were surveyed. Nearly all of the respondents to Sherman’s survey sought treatment at either the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center in North Hills or the VA West Los Angeles Health Care Center. These facilities faired equally well, each reporting about a 70% rate of satisfaction with regard to timely and adequate care. Regarding benefits other than healthcare, both facilities reported about a 62% rate of satisfaction regarding the time it took to receive treatment and quality of service. Background Sherman’s survey comes after disturbing news reports on the Veterans Administration which revealed massive backlogs, insufficient care, and even systematic cover ups to conceal long wait times at veteran care centers. The VA initially reported average wait times of new patients to be around 24 days, but a review by the inspector general found those numbers to be far worse. An audit of the VA released earlier this year found that veterans who are new patients experienced an average wait time of 42 days to see a primary care doctor. Veterans who are already in the system waited an average of 5.7 days to see a doctor . However reports across the country show that thousands of veterans are experiencing wait times of over 90 days . In the LA, area veterans who hadn't used the VA in more than two years had to wait an average of 56 days for a primary care appointment and 55 days for specialty care. Patients who were already in the VA system in LA waited an average of four days to see a primary care doctor, six days for a specialist and two days for a mental health appointment . It took an average of 39 days for new patients in the LA system to see a mental health specialist. That was typical of facilities nationwide, where the waits for mental healthcare for new patients ranged
09.23.2014	Sherman Oaks, CA - Today Congressman Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) commended the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) announcement to set up a complaint system that would track helicopter noise in the Los Angeles area. “I am relieved to see the FAA is taking a constructive step towards helping Los Angeles residents find relief from helicopters buzzing over their homes,” said Rep. Sherman. “Due to growing concerns over helicopter noise and safety, I introduced, with Congressman Adam Schiff, the Los Angeles Residential Helicopter Noise Relief Act to restrict helicopter flight paths and set minimum altitudes for helicopter operators in residential areas in Los Angeles County.” The legislation proposed by Rep. Schiff and Rep. Sherman includes exemptions for law enforcement, emergency responders and the military. In addition to this legislation, Congressman Sherman sent a letter with his Los Angeles colleagues to the FAA urging them to examine potential remedies to the longstanding problem of helicopter noise. “I plan to remain vigilant so that my constituents can finally have peace and quiet,” Sherman added. -30-
09.18.2014	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) along with many colleagues wrote a letter to Speaker Boehner urging him to keep Congress open for legislative business from September 29th through October 2nd as was originally scheduled. The 2014 House schedule which was set by the House Speaker and Majority Leader included voting days on September 29th through October 2nd. Republican leadership subsequently announced that they would cancel those voting days. “Congress neither needs nor deserves a vacation, especially at a time when the country is facing significant issues,” said Congressman Sherman. “If we recess today, as speaker Boehner intends, it means that we would be in session for only eight days during the 104 day period between August 1st and November 11th. We should at least adhere to what is already a light legislative schedule.” Sherman’s letter was cosigned by 21 additional members including Rep. Tim Bishop, Rep. Tony Cárdenas, Rep. Susan Davis, Rep. Elizabeth Esty, Rep. Sam Farr, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Rep. Pete Gallego, Rep. Janice Hahn, Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, Rep. Rush Holt, Rep. Mike Honda, Rep. Jared Huffman, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, Rep. George Miller, Rep. Gloria Negrete McLeod, Rep. Rick Nolan, Rep. Scott Peters, Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, Rep. David Scott, Rep. Mike Thompson, Rep. Juan Vargas. Read the full letter below: Don’t Cancel Votes Sept. 29 – Oct. 2 Re: Don’t Cancel Votes Sept 29 - Oct 2 Dear Mr. Speaker, The current House of Representatives’ schedule provides that the House will be in session thirteen days between August 1st and November 11th, a 104 day period. Although we are scheduled to be in session for those thirteen days, for many of the days we will only be in session a few hours. There are widespread reports that you are considering cancelling votes from September 29th through October 2nd. This would mean that we would theoretically be in session for only nine days during a 104 day period. We urge you to at least adhere to the already light legislative schedule which you and Mr. Cantor published early this year. Congress should be in session September 29th to October 2nd. Very truly yours, Brad Sherman
09.15.2014	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D- Sherman Oaks) released the following statement after news that Time Warner Cable will telecast the final week of the LA Dodgers regular season on a local broadcast station KDOC: “I am pleased that Time Warner Cable has agreed to allow SportsNet LA to be telecast for the last week of the Dodgers season,” said Congressman Sherman. Now millions of Angelinos will finally be able to enjoy the games telecast on KDOC.” Time Warner bought the rights to telecast Dodgers Games throughout the Los Angeles area for $8.3 billion for 25 years. The various cable and satellite companies involved agree that the telecast should be available on all the cable and satellite systems in the greater Los Angeles area, and that Time Warner should be paid by the companies for the telecast rights. Unfortunately they have not agreed on a price and the Dodgers have been blacked out on virtually every system except for those operated by Time Warner Cable. This price dispute has deprived over 60% of Dodgers fans the ability to watch the Dodgers for the entire season, save only the last week of the season. On July 28, Congressman Sherman and five of his congressional colleagues urged the satellite and cable telecasters to enter into binding arbitration, so that a neutral third party can determine the price and terms of the Dodgers network. “We must act now to assure that the Dodgers are not blacked out for the 2015 season,” Sherman added. “I will continue to discuss this matter with Tom Wheeler, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), in the hopes that the FCC will use its authority to push all the parties into binding arbitration so that a panel of three neutral arbitrators can determine the price– and let Dodgers fans see the 2015 season.” -30-
09.04.2014	Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs committte released the following statement regarding ISIS and the situtation in the Middle East.

However we can contain, degrade, and punish ISIS through air strikes, coalition building and military assistance."
09.04.2014	Sherman Oaks, CA – On Sunday, August 24th, 2014, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall meeting at Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa, fielding questions from some of the nearly 400 constituents who attended. Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including immigration, veterans affairs, foreign policy, taxes, the economy, budget, Social Security, and Medicare, as well as other matters facing Congress. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Sherman regarding the town hall. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.” Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies. Sherman also directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. --30--
09.03.2014	Sherman Oaks, CA – On Friday August 29th Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, received the “Congressman of the Year Award” from the Federation of Bangladeshi Associations in North America. Sherman, who is a member of the Congressional Bangladesh Caucus, received the honor for his efforts to improve US-Bangladeshi relations, increase aid, and protect religious minorities from persecution. “I’m proud to have taken an active role in developing stronger ties between our two nations,” said Sherman. “I have met with members of Bangladesh’s political leadership to work on ways to boost cooperation on key issues.” “In recent years, Bangladesh has made important strides by growing its economy, which has helped to greatly reduce poverty. The people of Bangladesh deserve credit for these remarkably positive steps. With Congressional support, the United States is working to help Bangladeshis reduce corruption, improve working conditions and promote the rule of law.” “I have focused on international economic issues as a legislative priority, and one of the greatest success stories in economic development is indeed microfinance – in Bangladesh and around the world.” “While Bangladesh has seen remarkable economic growth and has greatly reduced its dependency on foreign aid, the country still needs aid in critical areas including public health and environmental safety. I look forward to continuing my work to increase ties between our two great countries.” --30--
08.06.2014	Washington DC – On June 5th, 2014, President Barack Obama stated, “There is a referendum process in place and it is up to the people of Scotland… we obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies we will ever have remains a strong, robust, united and effective partner.” Now a Congressional Resolution, H.Res.713, has been introduced, with wide-ranging Democratic and Republican support, expressing the same sentiment. The Resolution states that the House of Representatives, “Respects the right of the Scottish people to make their decision regarding their status in the September 18th referendum” and “expresses support for united, secure, and prosperous United Kingdom.” The Resolution was authored by Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman of California who said, “The people of Scotland have an important decision to make and they will consider many factors, most of them domestic. However, some in Scotland may be interested in how we can work together most effectively for a secure, prosperous and peaceful world. It’s clear from this side of the Atlantic that a United Kingdom, including Scotland, would be the strongest possible American ally. A wide range of my colleagues involved in the Foreign Affairs Committee, from some of the most conservative Republicans to the most liberal Democrats, have joined with me in introducing a Resolution that echoes President Barack Obama’s statement in favor of a strong, robust, united and effective partner.” Those joining Congressman Sherman in introducing the House Resolution include Republican Ed Royce, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eliot Engel, Ranking Member (Chief Democrat) on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Republican Dana Rohrabacher, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Europe, and William Keating, Ranking (Chief Democrat) Member of the Subcommittee on Europe. The list of 27 members of Congress introducing the Resolution also include Congressman C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and Steve Israel, who heads the political arm for House Democrats. “Our ‘Special Relationship’ with the United Kingdom is unparalleled,” said Republican Foreign Affairs Chairman Royce. “It is crucial for both our nations to continue our close cooperation on key diplomatic, security, economic, and human rights concerns. A strong, unified United Kingdom has been a leader in the world and I look forward to continuing our valuable partnership.” Congressman Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Chief Democrat on its Subcommittee on Trade continued, “America’s multi-faceted alliance with the United Kingdom spans two centuries. Together we have worked to prevent conflict and respond to disasters around the world. America needs a strong ally which maintains its military, intelligence, and cyber defense capacities.” The following members of Congress have joined in introducing the Resolution: Sherman (sponsor), Ed Royce, Eliot Engel, Dana Rohrabacher, William Keating, C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, Gerald Connolly, Trent Franks, Gregory Meeks, Paul Cook, Steve Israel, Steve Stockman, Robert Brady, Billy Long, Karen Bass, Michael Turner, Lois Frankel, Alan Lowenthal, Juan Vargas, Tony Cardenas, Jim Costa, Janice Hahn, Grace Napolitano, Mike Thompson, Jackie Speier, David Scott, and Loretta Sanchez.

08.04.2014	Sherman is Chief Democratic Proponent of House Bill Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the terrorism subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, applauded the unanimous passage of H.R. 5041, the Naftali Fraenkel Rewards for Justice Act of 2014 in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. Sherman is the chief democratic cosponsor of this bipartisan bill to offer a reward of up to $5 million under the U.S. Rewards for Justice program for information leading to the capture of the Hamas terrorists who kidnapped and murdered Naftali Fraenkel, the Israeli teen who was also an American citizen. Congressman Doug Lamborn is the chief sponsor of the house bill. Senator Ted Cruz sponsored the bill in the Senate with the support and cosponsorship of Senator Robert Menendez. The bill was passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 21, 2014. Last night, the full Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent. “I thank my House and Senate colleagues, including Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, for advancing this bill. We should pass this bill into law. While Israeli security forces look for those who not only perpetrated but organized and aided this horrendous killing, we should do our share in the effort to bring these murderers to justice as Naftali Fraenkel was a U.S. citizen.” Under the Rewards for Justice program, the Secretary of State “may offer rewards for information that leads to the arrest or conviction of anyone who plans, commits, or attempts international terrorist acts against U.S. persons,” according to the State Department. On June 12, 2014, three Jewish teens were kidnapped and killed by Hamas terrorists. One of the boys, Naftali Fraenkel, was a dual American-Israeli citizen. -30-

Time Warner Cable immediately accepted the proposal. Sherman was joined in his proposal by five Los Angeles area Congressional colleagues including Rep. Janice Hahn, Rep. Gloria Negrete McLeod, Rep. Alan Lowenthal, Rep. Grace Napolitano and Rep. Karen BassListen to the audio of Dodgers CEO Stan Kasten at the Inaugural Dodgers Access Event at Dodgers Stadium on Monday Evening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSv1Ec0I99Q&feature=youtu.be Transcript of Dodgers CEO Stan Kasten comments on the evening of July 28: Stan Kasten: “Well today I am very excited to tell you that Congressman Brad Sherman and five of his colleagues have today called on both sides, on Time Warner Cable and DirecTV and other cable subscribers to submit binding arbitration. This, if agreed upon, would end this blackout right away, today, and we would be on the air literally tomorrow night in the entire area. I want to thank Congressman Sherman and his colleagues for their diligent work and concern for Dodgers fans everywhere, and I think it’s a very useful and productive step that he made. I can tell you within the last hour, I have learned that Time Warner has accepted the invitation to submit the binding arbitration. You know we’ve heard a lot of things on both sides of this equation, this is the way to cut through all that we’ll let an arbitrator decide who’s right who’s wrong and we can move on. And we don’t need to wait for the outcome of the arbitration, once both sides agree to submit we can turn the games on right away and they [the arbitrators] can figure out the price later. So that’s where we stand tonight, I want to again thank Congressman Sherman and his five colleagues, I want to tell Time Warner how appreciative I am to them for accepting this proposal right away, and I hope DirecTV and the other cable subscribers agree to this quickly as well, so that in fact if they do agree the games will be on in every TV home in Los Angeles tomorrow night and that’s certainly what we want. And so that is pretty exciting news.” -- Announcer: “It’s very exciting news, and I know that a lot of you who don’t know Rob Manfred, basically Commissioner Selig’s right hand man and possibly going to be his successor, but we’ll talk about that later. But Rob, what is your take from Major League Baseball on the developments here?” -- Rob Manfred, COO of Major League Baseball: “When we learned of this proposal I had an opportunity to talk to Commissioner Selig and we’re in complete agreement that this is a very positive development. We think the most important thing that can happen here is that we can get the games on TV for the fans of Los Angeles.” [For Sherman’s letter (signed by a total of six Los Angeles area members of Congress) to Time Warner Cable and DIRECTV, CLICK HERE] -30-
07.28.2014	Washington DC – Six Los Angeles area members of Congress, led by Congressman Brad Sherman (D - Sherman Oaks) called on Time Warner Cable, DIRECTV and all other providers to enter into binding arbitration to resolve the current dispute and air Dodgers games on all LA-area cable and satellite systems. The letter directed to DIRECTV CEO Michael White, and Time Warner CEO Robert Marcus reads, “Now, on behalf of Dodgers fans throughout Southern California, we urge that Time Warner Cable, DirecTV and all other TV providers enter into binding arbitration, so that a neutral third party can determine the right price and terms for the Dodgers network. This will be a fair and fast way to return programming to consumers.” The letter also requested that SportsNet LA be made available immediately to all fans before an agreement is reached, beginning with tomorrow night’s game against the Atlanta Braves. The arbitration would determine the amount payable for tomorrow’s game and all subsequent games The letter builds on a letter signed by LA Congress members urging for mediation. Unlike mediation, binding arbitration would impose a deal on the parties and could be effective immediately, whether or not all the parties thought the deal was fair. Reporters are invited to seek comment from the Los Angeles Dodgers. See the full text of the letter below: July 28, 2014 Mr. Michael White CEO, Chairman, and President, DIRECTV 2230 E Imperial Hwy El Segundo, CA 90245 Mr. Robert D. Marcus CEO and Chairman, Time Warner Cable 60 Columbus Circle New York, NY 10023 Dear Mr. White and Mr. Marcus: America loves baseball. Los Angeles loves the Dodgers. Everyone loves television. We write to express our continued concern over the ongoing dispute on how to provide residents of Los Angeles with access to Los Angeles Dodgers television broadcasts. Despite negotiations, the dispute continues and there is no indication that your companies are making progress on reaching a resolution. The season is more than midway through and millions of Dodgers fans are still unable to watch the games. Last week, eight members of Congress, led by Tony Cardenas, sent a letter to the FCC asking Chairman Wheeler to mediate this dispute and ensure that consumers in Los Angeles can watch their home team. But while such mediation would be helpful, it would not be binding or certain to resolve the dispute. Now, on behalf of Dodgers fans throughout Southern California, we urge that Time Warner Cable, DirecTV and all other TV providers enter into binding arbitration, so that a neutral third party can determine the right price and terms for the Dodgers network. This will be a fair and fast way to return programming to consumers. Additionally, as you enter into the arbitration process, fans should no longer be left in the dark. We are requesting that SportsNet LA be made available immediately to all fans, beginning with tomorrow night’s game against the Atlanta Braves. The arbitration would determine the amount payable for games aired both before and after the arbitration is complete. We look forward to assisting in any way we can to help resolve this impasse and return Dodgers programming to our constituents.

06.30.2014	“I am deeply saddened by the death of the three Israeli teens, one of whom was also an American citizen. There is substantial evidence that this murder is the responsibility of Hamas. We must bring to justice, not only the murderers, but their commanders. Earlier this month, I attended a press conference with my colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee calling for the safe release of these boys. We met with family of Israeli-American teen Naftali Frenkel. My deepest sympathies go out to the all the families and loved ones of the three boys.”
06.27.2014	Bob Hope Airport Unveils New Transportation Center Congressman Sherman Helped Secure Funding For Project Sherman Oaks – Today Bob Hope Airport unveiled a new Regional Intermodal Transportation Center (RITC) located along Empire Avenue, across from the Bob Hope Airport Train Station. Congressman Brad Sherman was instrumental in securing approximately $1.5 million in federal funds to construct the project. This center will integrate transportation services from Metrolink, MTA, Burbank Transit, and the Bob Hope Airport into one center for the convenience of San Fernando Valley residents. The RITC is a 520,000 square-foot facility that connects air, rail, bus, car and bike travelers in one location. The structure hosts rental car services, airport parking, a bus transit station, shuttle service to the airport terminal, bike storage areas, and connects to the Ventura County Line Metrolink station. This connection to the Metrolink station is via a pedestrian bridge over Empire Avenue. “I have fought for funding for the transportation center for over a decade. I am pleased to see it open,” said Congressman Sherman. “This transportation center has the ability to transform San Fernando Valley transit, linking travelers of car, rail, bus, bike, and plane.” -30-
06.24.2014	Sherman and Colleagues Express Deep Concern to Prime Minister Sharif over Human Rights Violations against Sindhis in Pakistan Sherman, Bentivolio, Schiff, Gabbard, and Petri Urge Prime Minister Sharif to Take Action Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, was joined by four Members of Congress – Kerry Bentivolio, Adam Schiff, Tulsi Gabbard, and Tom Petri – in sending a letter to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to express deep concern over human rights violations in the Sindh province of Pakistan. Sindhi activists have been regularly persecuted and detained, and even violently targeted through enforced disappearances and brutal murders. Religious minorities in Pakistan, including Hindu Sindhis, have faced discrimination and attacks by extremists on their houses of worship. The letter urges the Prime Minister to “address the situation accordingly by strongly countering these actions and policies throughout the Pakistani government.” “We are urging Prime Minister Sharif to do everything in his power to protect the Sindh community, as well as religious minorities, from attacks,” said Congressman Sherman. “The Sindhi community includes tens of millions of people in Pakistan who are striving to preserve their language and culture, but Sindhi activists are subject to enforced disappearances and sometimes targeted killings.” “Violence against minorities everywhere is an unacceptable violation of human rights,” said Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who serves on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “ In Pakistan, we've heard reports of torture, executions and disappearances of peaceful and politically active Sindhis and Balochs who are Hindu, Christian, Shi’a and other religious minorities. These religiously and politically motivated attacks are abhorrent, and I strongly urge Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to take action to address these troubling offenses. The Government of Pakistan must stand up for human rights, and against violent radicals who seek to persecute and kill those with differing beliefs.” The text of the letter is below, and a signed PDF is attached. His Excellency Nawaz Sharif Prime Minister Islamic Republic of Pakistan Islamabad, Pakistan Dear Honorable Prime Minister Sharif, We share your desire for a peaceful, stable, and free Pakistan where all citizens can prosper. We write with deep concern for the declining human rights situation in the Sindh province of Pakistan. Sindhi activists are regularly persecuted for voicing their concerns about government policies. We are greatly troubled by reports of repression and attacks on nonviolent, politically active Sindhis -- attacks that include enforced disappearances, torture, and executions. One horrific example includes the case of Maqsood Qureshi and Salman Wadho who were allegedly shot and then burned alive inside of their car while traveling to a political rally in Karachi. We stress the need for those responsible for ordering these killings, and similar attacks, to be held accountable for these appalling violations of basic human rights. There are similar reports regarding Baloch political activists, with mass graves being discovered in the province of Balochistan. The human rights violations are not only political, but also religious in nature. Hindu Sindhis experience increasing encroachments on their ability to freely practice their religion. Accounts of Hindu temples in Sindh being forcibly entered and desecrated represent an affront to the rule of law and basic tenets of religious tolerance. Christians, Shi’a, and other religious minorities in Sindh have also deeply suffered. Scores of Pakistani Shi’a and Christians have been killed or injured in attacks, many of them in Karachi and Hyderabad. Christians are regularly detained, tried, imprisoned, and even sentenced to death for allegedly violating blasphemy laws. Houses of worship have been attacked, as well. We believe that all persons should be free to practice their religion and should not be immersed in fear because radicals deem them to be blasphemous. We fear that certain radical and violent groups are allowed to act with impunity by elements of Pakistani security forces. If this is true, we urge you to address the situation accordingly by strongly countering these actions and policies throughout the Pakistani government. We believe that the basic provisions of human rights can and should be provided by the Government of Pakistan to Sindhis and the Baloch alike. We urge you to seriously address these concerns and work to make Pakistan a free and fair country for all to live in, where religious minorities are not persecuted and differing political beliefs are not met with violence. Thank you for your attention this critical matter. -30-
06.19.2014	Congressman Brad Sherman Issues Statement on President’s Announcement to End Discrimination Against LGBT Federal Contractors Washington DC – Following an announcement by President Barack Obama that he would sign an Executive Order to ban workplace discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender federal contractors, Congressman Sherman released the following statement: “Earlier this year, I joined with my colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to ban federal contractors from engaging in employment discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) Americans by signing an Executive Order. “I applaud the President’s announcement Monday that he will sign an Executive Order to end taxpayer-funded discrimination against LGBT employees. “This announcement is an important step toward ending discrimination against LGBT employees. However, when implemented, this will only protect employees of federal contractors. In 29 states it is still legal to be fired simply for being gay. That is why I joined with colleagues to introduce the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, which prohibits all employers from basing employment decisions on sexual orientation or gender identity. “My colleagues on the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus and I continue to press for a vote in the House on ENDA, which passed in the Senate with bipartisan support earlier this year. “It is time that Congress acts to reinforce the most basic of protections for all workers regardless of sexual orientation and uphold the American tradition of fairness in the workplace.”
06.11.2014	Washington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement following the narrow defeat of an amendment to allow nighttime curfews at Bob Hope Airport. "Since coming to Congress, I have worked to reduce noise for those living near Burbank Bob Hope Airport. Noise restrictions have helped improve the quality of life for many Valley residents, but more is needed to balance the needs of the community with those of the airport, particularly during evening hours. There is no reason that those who live near the Burbank Bob Hope Airport should have to endure uncomfortable noise levels when remedies exist. That is why I joined with my colleague Congressman Adam Schiff today in introducing an amendment that would allow nighttime curfews on flights at Bob Hope Burbank Airport between 10:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. This amendment aims to help balance the needs of aviation and those residents seeking peace and quiet in their communities. While the amendment failed by four votes, with a vote of 208 to 212, this is a tremendous improvement from a similar effort in 2011 (when it failed by 65 votes). We are closer to making progress and will rededicate our efforts to reducing airport noise at both Burbank Bob Hope and Van Nuys Airports."
06.04.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, released the following statement in response to United States authorities investigating BNP Paribas for alleged violations of U.S. sanctions against Sudan and Iran: “BNP Paribas has been under investigation for allegedly processing illegal transactions through the bank’s American operations for sanctioned entities in Sudan, Iran, and other blacklisted countries from 2002 to 2009. The scope of the alleged wrongdoing is deeply worrisome: the allegations include willfully deleting information in wire transfers that could tie payments to sanctioned entities. I strongly support efforts to fully enforce U.S. sanctions laws against banks, whether they are based in the U.S., Europe, or anywhere, including through criminal charges where appropriate. Based on the allegations against the bank in this case, criminal charges against BNP Paribas would be appropriate. BNP Paribas is not the first large bank to be accused of violating U.S. or international sanctions, and unfortunately may not be the last. We need to work in Congress with the Obama Administration to strengthen our government’s ability to effectively enforce U.S. sanctions laws.” -30-
05.22.2014	405 Carpool Lane OpensCongressman Sherman and Colleagues Played Critical Role in Funding Construction Sherman Calls for Subway through the Sepulveda Pass Sherman Oaks – On Friday, May 23rd Los Angeles County Metro, in partnership with Caltrans, will announce the grand opening of the 10-mile northbound carpool lane on the 405 Freeway. After five years of construction, this milestone represents a major achievement in the $1 billion-plus endeavor to improve the 405 Sepulveda Pass. “It is terrific to finally see this project come together,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “Valley residents are long overdue for traffic improvements, and the new northbound lane will relieve some of the busiest traffic through the Sepulveda Pass. Congressman Brad Sherman and his colleagues were instrumental in securing funding for these projects at both the state and federal level. In 1998 Sherman secured federal funds for planning solutions to the Sepulveda Pass bottleneck. In 2003 Senator Barbara Boxer, Congressman Howard Berman and Congressman Brad Sherman worked together to secure a $117 million federal earmark to construct an additional northbound lane on the 405 Freeway. Sherman and Berman testified in favor of the 405 project together on April 1, 2003, before the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, and both lobbied their colleagues intensely until the final bill was passed in July of 2005. Sherman then worked with several prominent advocates of the project including Mayor Villaraigosa, and Supervisor Gloria Molina (then Chair of the Metro Board), to secure $614 million in state bond funding. On February 20, 2007, Congressman Sherman traveled to Sacramento with Mayor Villaraigosa and local officials in a successful effort to persuade the California Transportation Commission to provide $614 million, the largest piece of the project’s funding. Sherman was the only member of Congress to testify at this critical hearing of the California Transportation Commission. Sherman continued, “Now is not the time to celebrate one new lane. Now is the time to intensify the effort to build a subway through the Sepulveda Pass, from the Valley to LAX, with a connection in West Los Angeles to the Purple Line, now under construction.” -30-

04.15.2014	LA County Has $60 Million in Undelivered & Unclaimed ReturnsPlus Tips to Avoid to Tax Scams & Fraud Sherman Oaks, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D - Sherman Oaks) announced that 4,176 taxpayers in Los Angeles County are owed $6,722,735 in tax refunds.* In many instances, the United States Postal Service was unable to deliver refund checks due to mailing address errors. In an effort to assist taxpayers in collecting their tax refunds, Congressman Sherman directed taxpayers to his website www.BradSherman.house.gov. Taxpayers can also contact the IRS directly on the “Where’s My Refund?” hotline by calling 1-800-829-1954. “For a struggling family, a thousand or even a few hundred dollars can help” said Congressman Sherman. “If there is any chance you have an unclaimed refund, check out our website to learn how to contact the IRS to collect your refund.” Undelivered Refunds In California, the top three undeliverable refunds average over $36,000. The average undelivered refund check was $1,610 for Los Angeles County. The Internal Revenue Service owes refunds to over 800 residents in the San Fernando Valley, but their checks were returned to the U.S. Postal Service because some families moved without leaving a forwarding address or the IRS found errors in the taxpayers’ favor, but could not locate the people owed the unexpected windfalls. If a taxpayer moves after filing his or her tax return and doesn’t leave a forwarding address, the Postal Service returns the check to the IRS. If a person changes his or her name, perhaps after marriage, and doesn’t notify the Social Security Administration of the name change, then their Social Security number will not properly match in IRS computers. This can slow or prevent the transfer of old refund checks to them. And, in the case of deceased taxpayers, some families and executors of estates may not know that they had an unclaimed refund. Unclaimed Refunds The paragraphs above focus on “undelivered refunds” – taxpayers who filed their returns but never received their refund. A second category is “unclaimed refunds” – people who never filed their tax returns, but would get a refund if they did. For folks who have not filed, the law allows a three year window for claiming a return before that money becomes property of the US Treasury. Refunds totaling over $2 billion may be waiting for Americans who did not file a federal income tax return for 2010, 2011, 2012. In California there is an estimated $200 million, and in LA County there is an estimated $60 million in unclaimed refunds payable to roughly 22,000 Angelinos. That is an average of $1,713 dollars per person nationwide. Many people don’t file returns because they had too little income to require filing a tax return, even though they had income and /or social security taxes withheld from their wages. However many of these people are due significant refunds. Many low-and-moderate income workers qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit, which can be worth nearly $6,000. So even if you had zero federal income tax withheld from your paycheck, you may be entitled to a refund. “I encourage all eligible workers to file a return, said Sherman. “This is your money, and you should take advantage of it.” Extending the April 15th Deadline If you need extra time to prepare your return, you can file an extension on IRS form 4868 and California FTB form 3519. If you need extra time paying your taxes during these hard economic times, you have the option of filing an IRS Form 9465 to request a monthly installment plan (or apply online at https://www.irs.gov). You can also file a California FTB Form 3561 to request an installment plan for your state taxes. Scams & Frauds to Avoid: Identity left comes in many forms. Taxpayers who believe they are at risk of identity theft due to lost or stolen personal information should contact the IRS immediately so the agency can take action to secure their tax account. Taxpayers can call the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit at 800-908-4490. More information can be found on the special identity protection page at https://www.irs.gov/uac/Identity-Protection “Phishing” is scam carried out from an unsolicited email or phony website.

04.10.2014	Sherman & Grayson Debunk Geopolitical Arguments Raised to Promote TPP On Eve of Obama Asia Trip, Foreign Policy Members Warn Against Jobs-Killing Trans-Pacific Partnership (Washington, D.C.) – In advance of President Obama’s trip to Asia, Congressman Brad Sherman (D–CA), the Ranking Member of the trade subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Congressman Alan Grayson (D–FL) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, held a press teleconference to counter the geopolitical and foreign policy arguments raised by supporters of the jobs-killing Trans-Pacific Trade Partnership (TPP). The Representatives also highlighted key findings from a new report released by Public Citizen. The report chronicles the use of the same unfounded foreign policy, geopolitical and economic arguments to promote previous trade agreements. As noted by Congressman Sherman, the foreign policy arguments in support of TPP mimicked many false claims made to promote previous trade agreements.Highlights from Congressman Brad Sherman: “Even if the TPP were an effective foreign policy tool, which it is not, no geopolitical benefit could outweigh the massively detrimental effect that this agreement will have on American jobs and the American economy. If the past is any indication, this trade deal will contribute to our expanding U.S. global trade deficit and lead to enormous losses in U.S. jobs.” “Some have falsely argued that the TPP would help contain China’s growing economic influence and power in the Pacific Rim. In reality, this agreement would expand Chinese exports to the United States. Under the agreement, goods 50%, 60% or even 70%* made in China and then finished in Japan or Vietnam, would get duty free access to the U.S. markets. With a little fudging, goods 70%, 80% or 90% Chinese made will benefit from the agreement. China gets all this and doesn’t need to even sign the agreement or even pretend to make a concession.” “I have opposed NAFTA, CAFTA, KORUS, MFN for China, and a host of other trade deals we have adopted over the last two decades. These trade deals were sold on the premise that they would expand U.S. job growth and boost American exports; however, these trade agreements contributed to a massive U.S. global trade deficit and enormous losses in U.S. jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector.” Highlights from Congressman Alan Grayson: “These free trade agreements push us further and further into debt. Before NAFTA or any of these other free trade agreements went into effect, the United States often had trade surpluses. Since NAFTA went into effect, we have never had a trade deficit of less than $140 billion. In the past twelve years, we’ve had a trade deficit of at least $350 billion every single year. A $350 billion trade deficit means that foreigners have $350 billion to buy our assets. That number increases each year, with no end in sight. We are basically taking America and selling it off cheaply. The TPP will accelerate this process.” “So now we’re being told to vote for these “free trade agreements” for reasons that have nothing to do with trade. Proponents of TPP cannot promote these trade deals on their merits – because these trade deals take a bad problem, and make it worse – so instead, they try to change the subject. They string together words and phrases that allude to our foreign policy concerns, without providing any logical explanation as to how the TPP – or any other free trade agreement – would actually improve our foreign policy.”Highlights from Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch: “The same old foreign policy arguments get trotted out to sell trade agreements after the economic case fails. Repeatedly, Congress has approved bad deals based on dire predictions that failure to do so would mean diminished U.S. power, the takeover of important markets by competitors or foreign instability, only to find that many of those predictions came true in spite of, and sometimes even because of, pacts’ enactment.”* Those negotiating the agreement refuse to provide any information, or make any commitments regarding the ‘rules of origin’ provisions. We expect that 50%, 40% or 30% of a products benefiting from the TPP will need to be made (or at least claim to be made) in a TPP country. For example, under the Korea Free Trade Agreements, the importer must claim that at least 35% of the product was made in South Korea, and may admit that 65% of the product was made in China. -30-
04.03.2014	Washington, DC – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Humane Advocate Award from the Humane Society of the United States. This is Congressman Sherman’s sixth consecutive award from the Humane Society. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on animal welfare issues and for his consistently perfect score on the Humane Society’s Legislative Scorecard. Since coming to Congress in 1997, Sherman has been a fierce advocate for animals, working to ensure that they are not subjected to undue pain or suffering. Sherman has been a leader on many animal issues including the regulation of puppy mills, protecting endangered and exotic animals, halting experimentation on chimpanzees, protecting horses from slaughter and consumption, and stopping the disgusting sport of dog fighting by punishing animal fighting spectators. "We are tremendously grateful to Congressman Sherman for his work to protect animals from cruelty, and to stop abuses such as animal fighting, horse slaughter, and inhumane factory farming practices," said Wayne Pacelle, president of The Humane Society of the USA. "Congressman Sherman has always been a stalwart advocate for animal protection in Congress, and we applaud his advocacy for all creatures." -30-
03.27.2014	WASHINGTON, DC — Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement on the attacks on Armenian civilians in Kessab, Syria. “I am deeply concerned by the dire situation in Kessab, Syria. Extremist forces have reportedly crossed the border from Turkey into Kessab, an area inhabited mostly by Armenians. Hundreds of families have been forced to leave their homes for fear of their safety. There are reports that the forces entering Kessab are desecrating churches and pillaging Armenian homes. I have been in contact with the State Department and have urged them to take the necessary actions to assist the Armenians in Syria. Turkey must take immediate action to help prevent extremist attacks on Armenian civilians.”
03.24.2014	Sherman Oaks, CA – This past week, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted five town hall meetings in the San Fernando Valley. Rep. Sherman speaks to valley residents at a town hall meeting On Monday March 17th, Sherman held a meeting to discuss issues facing senior citizens at the Fountainview Jewish Home. Sherman highlighted his continued work to lower the cost of prescription drugs, as well as fight against any plan that privatizes Social Security or turns Medicare into a voucher program. Three of the town hall meetings were held at Valley high schools with a focus on issues related to students and younger citizens. During Congressman Sherman’s time in Congress he has met with students of nearly every public and private school in the San Fernando Valley. This week Sherman’s meetings were held at El Camino Real Charter High School in Woodland Hills, the Valley Academy of Arts and Sciences in Granada Hills, and Harvard-Westlake School in Studio City. During these town hall meetings, Sherman spoke about his work in the nation’s capital and answered questions from the students. He also presented a flag flown above the U.S. Capital to the student body president of each school. Sherman was also pleased to learn that after his visit, El Camino Real Charter High School went on to win first place in the State Academic Decathlon Championship on March 23rd. Finally, on Sunday March 23rd, Sherman hosted a general Town Hall meeting at Birmingham High School in Lake Balboa. Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including ObamaCare, taxes, the economy, budget, Social Security, and Medicare, as well as other issues facing Congress. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Sherman regarding the town hall. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents, helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.” Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at each meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies. His staff has already opened up inquiries on many constituents’ behalf. Sherman also directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. Rep. Sherman introduces three military service academy nominees who have now received appointments. --30--
01.28.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) made the following statement after President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address: “The President reiterated the positions he has had and expressed over the last few years. There were no major surprises. “The President put forward a strong economic program that includes immigration reform, raising the minimum wage, extending unemployment benefits, pre-kindergarten education, vocational education, higher education, infrastructure investments, tax reform, and low-carbon energy. “I regret that the President did not mention Pakistan, which is the greatest national security challenge we face. (Pakistan has close to 100 nuclear weapons.) The President barely mentioned the controversy over privacy and the National Security Agency. “Unfortunately, the President overstated the concessions made by Iran in the recent agreement, and chose not to mention concessions we made to the Iranian government. [For background see my opening remarks and questions at the Foreign Affairs Committee hearing held earlier today].”
01.24.2014	WASHINGTON, DC — Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement on the unprovoked killing of an Armenian soldier, Armen Hovannisyan, by Azeri forces along the border of Nagorno-Karabakh. “Just four days before a meeting scheduled between Azerbaijan’s and Armenia’s Foreign Ministers to discuss a peaceful resolution to the conflict between Azerbaijan and the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Azeri forces have tragically killed yet another Armenian soldier in an unprovoked attack on the Arstakh and Azerbaijan border. As I stated last December when an Armenian soldier was killed, Azerbaijan continues to show that it is not serious about establishing peaceful relations with Artsakh and repeatedly creates obstacles to the peace process. “Azerbaijan and its forces must be held accountable for these ruthless displays of violence. I have been a longtime advocate for a peaceful resol ution of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Karabakh and the recognition of the independent Republic of Karabakh.”
01.16.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) made the following statement in anticipation of the 20th anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake: “At 4:30 in the morning on January 17, 1994, families across the Valley and across the Southland woke up to shaking walls and collapsing houses. Fifty seven people were killed and thousands were injured in the immediate destruction. Ninety thousand homes and businesses were destroyed or damaged, leaving streets covered in ruin and rubble. Twenty years later, the fear and destruction has not been forgotten. Especially in my district, home to the earthquake’s epicenter, we remember all too well. “And yet as the disaster unfolded, our public servants displayed unparalleled bravery. Firefighters and police officers pulled victims out of the wreckage, including the collapsed Northridge Meadows apartment building. Firefighters managed to put out hundreds of blazes, despite faulty radios and no water pressure due to broken mains throughout the Valley. Caltrans worked with local contractors to immediately mobilize a team to reconstruct severe infrastructure damage. I’m so proud of the courage displayed following the Northridge Earthquake. “The Northridge Earthquake was one of the costliest disasters in American history. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) spent $14 billion in aid to rehabilitate the region. “California has taken significant steps to ensure that we will be more prepared in the event of another massive quake, both structurally and economically. Governor Brown recently announced a plan to map the dangerous earthquake faults in California, and Mayor Garcetti has announced that the city of Los Angeles will partner with the U.S. Geological Survey to create a more comprehensive plan to protect buildings and critical resources during an earthquake. I applaud their work, and pledge to do everything I can on a federal level to support these efforts. “I hope all my constituents and everyone in Los Angeles will make sure they are adequately prepared for an earthquake. I encourage everyone to look at FEMA’s guidelines for earthquake preparedness at www.ready.gov/earthquakes so that when another temblor comes, we will all be ready.” Congressman Sherman will speak at an event commemorating the Northridge Earthquake hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance this Friday, January 17 at Cal State Northridge at 11 am.
01.16.2014	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) met with the Ambassador of India to the United States, Dr. S. Jaishankar, in Sherman’s Washington office. Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and an active member of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans. “The Ambassador and I discussed U.S.-India civilian nuclear cooperation, ways to expand economic relations between India and the U.S., critical security issues in South and Central Asia, and cooperation on counterterrorism,” Sherman said following the meeting. “We discussed working with the Indian-American community to achieve common goals and pursue shared interests.” Sherman has established friendship with several of India’s ambassadors to the United States. In August 2013, Sherman hosted the previous Ambassador of India, Nirupama Rao, in the San Fernando Valley to celebrate India’s Independence Day. Sherman also hosted another former Indian Ambassador to the United States, Meera Shankar, in August 2010 in the San Fernando Valley at Canoga Park High School to celebrate India’s Independence Day. Both former Ambassadors commended his successful efforts to expand U.S-India ties. “India is the world’s largest democracy and a fast growing economic power,” Sherman added. “The U.S.-India relationship is based on the shared values of democracy, individual freedom, religious pluralism, and economic prosperity. I will continue to work very closely with the Indian American community to strengthen the relationship between the two nations.”
01.14.2014	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on trade, released the following statement today on the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, legislation introduced on January 9th, 2014, by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Hatch as well as House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Camp: “I am opposed to the so-called Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities Act of 2014, legislation introduced in the House and Senate last week, also known as the Camp-Baucus Fast Track bill. Like previous Fast Track provisions passed into law, the bill effectively deprives Congress of its trade oversight role over the Executive Branch and requires an up or down vote for passage on the final implementing bills without amendments. I note that the bill does not have a House Democratic cosponsor. “The Trans-Pacific Partnership between the U.S. and 11 other Pacific Rim countries – one of the largest free trade agreements ever negotiated – goes far beyond tariffs and market access. “There are many aspects of the TPP that deeply concern me, including the risk of major job loss in America, an expanding U.S. trade deficit, as well as serious challenges to Buy American provisions, food safety, environmental protection, and intellectual property rights. “The TPP would not require major changes from countries that have poor labor records and commit major human rights abuses, particularly Vietnam. Further, currency manipulation, a major contributor to the global U.S. trade deficit, is not adequately addressed by the TPP agreement. “In particular, I am deeply concerned about the effect TPP may have on our trade balances with Japan and Vietnam. “I have opposed NAFTA, CAFTA, KORUS, MFN for China, and a host of other trade deals we have adopted over the last two decades. These trade deals were sold on the premise that they would expand U.S. job growth and boost American exports; however, these trade agreements contributed to a massive U.S. global trade deficit and enormous losses in U.S. jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector. “We were told that the U.S.-Korea FTA (KORUS) would benefit U.S. businesses and boost job growth, but instead imports from Korea steadily increased while U.S. exports to Korea have remained stagnant, and even fallen in some months, since the implementation of KORUS in March 2012.”
12.17.2013	WASHINGTON, DC — Representative Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement on the unprovoked killing of an Armenian soldier, Hrant Poghosyan, by Azerbaijani forces along the border of Nagorno-Karabakh. “Azerbaijan has yet again shown that it is not serious about establishing peaceful relations with Armenia and Artsakh. Despite the request for a ceasefire during the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group negotiations between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Azeri forces have killed an Armenian solider, Hrant Poghosyan. The shooting was unprovoked and Armenian forces have respected the request for a ceasefire. “Azerbaijan’s actions continue to harm the cause of peace. Last year, Azerbaijan celebrated a murderer, Ramil Safarov, who violently killed an Armenian soldier during a NATO Partnership for Peace exercise. Azerbaijan and its forces must be held accountable for this latest display of violence towards Armenia and lack of respect for the OSCE’s settlement negotiations. I will continue to stand by Artsakh and Armenia in their ongoing quest for peace and security.” ###
12.12.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) today released the following statement today concerning a new round of designations of companies and individuals for conducting proliferation-related activities in or with Iran. The Treasury Department announcement can be found here.“I commend the Treasury and State Departments for the action they took today to designate for sanctions several entities related to Iran. “During yesterday’s hearing with Secretary Kerry, I had lamented the fact that this type of announcement—which had been routine prior to Rouhani’s election—had not happened in the last several months. This is the type of activity that needs to continue during the period covered by the preliminary agreement. It should never have been paused.“Over the next six months plus, the U.S. needs to strictly enforce existing sanctions that are not affected by the agreement. I look forward to today’s action being repeated several times in the coming months.” ###
12.12.2013	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today Rep. Brad Sherman (CA-30) announced he will vote in favor of the House amendment to H.J. Res. 59, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. Sherman’s statement on the legislation is below: “This past year, Congress lurched from one fiscal crisis to another. The federal government was shut down for 16 days and we came uncomfortably close to defaulting on our debt. Not only did this foolishness cost tens of billions in government inefficiency, it created an ongoing spectacle that undermined business and consumer confidence, and delayed an economic recovery. “The Bipartisan Budget Act is an imperfect compromise that establishes federal spending levels for 2014 and 2015. The agreement does not solve most of the big fiscal crises we face over the coming decades. But it is bipartisan and will be adopted in a timely manner. Most importantly, it allows government agencies to plan their operations and it reduces the risk of another government shutdown.”
11.26.2013	“Temporary” Agreement Allows Repair of Iran’s So-Called “Civilian” Aircraft WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the following statement concerning aspects of the sanctions relief contained in the Geneva agreement between the P5+1 group of countries and Iran regarding Iran’s nuclear program. “The preliminary agreement concerning Iran’s nuclear program includes sanctions relief for Iran’s state airline, Iran Air, allowing the repair of its aging fleet of jets. This unwarranted concession goes unmentioned in most descriptions of the Agreement. “In the past, I have opposed licensing parts and services needed to repair Iran’s American-made planes because they have been used to support some of Iran’s worst activities. “Iran Air was designated by the Treasury Department in June 2011 for providing support to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In September 2012, the Treasury Department identified Iran Air and other ‘civilian’ air carriers as key parts of Syria’s military procurement network. “Iran Air planes have been used to ferry lethal aid, IRGC thugs, and other assistance for Syria’s Bashar Assad, all to be used against opponents of the regime, resulting in the deaths of innocent civilians and helping to prolong the civil war. Iran Air is a key part of the Iran-Syria-Hezbollah axis, providing the Lebanese terrorist organization military equipment from Iran via Syria. “A May 2011 UN report noted that Iran Air jets have been used to ship missile parts and other illicit trade between North Korea and Iran. Iran’s “civilian” airlines have even been used in successful missions to assassinate Iranian dissidents living abroad. In one particularly infamous incident from the early 1990s, Iranian agents killed a dissident in Geneva, then escaped from Swiss authorities on a waiting Iran Air 747. “Iran should ground its unsafe planes until they are properly repaired, which requires American parts and service. American corporations should not repair these until a final deal is reached. America should exploit some of the vagaries in the agreement’s language and prevent Boeing from repairing Iranian aircraft until we have a final deal. Otherwise we will have made a permanent irreversible concession in a “temporary" agreement.
11.24.2013	Quick Congressional Action NeededWASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), Ranking Democrat of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee, released the following statement today concerning Iran: “Despite many positive elements, the deal reached in Geneva has a significant flaw, namely that it allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium up to a level of 3.5-5 percent, as long as it converts this from gas to uranium oxide metal. “Six months from now Iran will have its current stock of gaseous 3.5 percent enriched uranium and an additional stockpile of 3.5 percent enriched uranium oxide, which it could convert back to gas relatively easily. “The United States negotiators in Geneva would have been in a much better position had Congress passed and the President signed the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act earlier this year. The more penalties and the more significant impact on Iran’s economy, the more concessions they could have secured. “Congress should act in December to pass two pieces of legislation concerning Iran. The first bill would improve the administrative effectiveness of existing sanctions. One example of this effort would be to make every company doing business with the federal government or any state or city certify that they and their affiliates conduct no business that violates any of our sanctions laws. “Second, we need to enact a bill providing for massive new penalties on Iran. These penalties would go into effect on June 1 unless the President submits, and Congress adopts, a joint resolution that suspends the penalties because Iran has signed a reasonable permanent agreement. “Our negotiators need more leverage, not less. I look forward to working to enact that leverage next month.”
11.19.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, released the following statement regarding the laying down of arms by the militia group M23: “I am pleased that M23—a militia based in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo responsible for countless brutal attacks—has made a declaration to lay down its arms and pursue its goals through political means. This disarmament serves as a step towards the implementation of the February 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework agreement, and is an important development as the U.S. works with the Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbors toward security and development in the region. I urge neighboring states to halt support for armed groups and militias in an effort to work towards peace in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Now, M23 must follow through on its commitments. This development will afford the Democratic Republic of Congo an opportunity to move the country forward in a positive direction.”
11.14.2013	Democrats and Republicans urge Senate leaders to tighten sanctions against the Islamic Republic WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today a bipartisan coalition of House lawmakers launched an effort aimed at getting the Senate to increase sanctions on Iran. House Homeland Security Committee Chairman and Foreign Affairs Committee member Michael McCaul (R-TX), Foreign Affairs Committee member Brad Sherman (D-CA), Chief Deputy GOP Whip Peter Roskam (R-IL), and Foreign Affairs Committee Member Grace Meng (D-NY) – joined by 59 members of the House – led a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) urging them to take up legislation that would tighten sanctions on Iran’s energy and financial sectors. The measure, designed to force Iran to abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, passed the House in July by a vote of 400-20. But the bill has stalled in the Senate. “As negotiations in Geneva are underway, we feel it is important to keep the pressure on Iran to maximize U.S. leverage,” said the House lawmakers. “Indeed, it is because of tough U.S. sanctions against Iran that Tehran has come to the negotiating table. Security in the Middle East and around the world depends on strong U.S. leadership against a nuclear Iran.” Text of the letter is below. November 14, 2013 The Honorable Harry Reid Majority Leader United States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510The Honorable Mitch McConnellRepublican LeaderUnited States SenateWashington, D.C. 20510 Dear Majority Leader Reid and Republican Leader McConnell: We urge you and your colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly to continue consideration of rigorous Iran sanctions legislation. We believe that as the United States negotiates with the P5+1 group and Tehran, it is critical to maximize U.S. leverage against the Iranian regime. The possibility of tighter sanctions will enhance our leverage in the nuclear standoff between the Iran’s Supreme Leader and the international community. Despite Hassan Rouhani’s attempt to portray Iran’s government in a new light, the objective of the Iranian regime remains the same: the pursuit of a nuclear weapons capability. The House has already passed legislation with the support of 400 bipartisan Representatives to increase economic pressure on the Iranian regime as it develops its nuclear weapons program. For more than three months this legislation, the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act, has been pending in the Senate. Meanwhile, the Iranian government presses forward and each day the world becomes less safe. While recent assessments of the progress of Iran’s nuclear program vary—with some estimating that Iran is only weeks away from producing weapons-grade uranium—what is clear is that time is running short. Protracted negotiations may give Iran more time to spin its centrifuges, while the threat of enhanced sanctions holds the promise of compelling Iran to give up its ambitions. While we support diplomatic efforts toward an Iran free of nuclear weapons and free of nuclear weapons breakout capability, the sanctions pressure must be maintained. Every day, existing sanctions may be weakened as Iran finds loopholes and business partners willing to evade existing sanctions. Even Hassan Rouhani, the country’s new president, bragged in 2006 that Iran had deceived European negotiators into talks while it continued to develop its nuclear program. We should ensure that tougher penalties be available should Tehran be found to be using the negotiations for stalling tactics. The deliberative process in Congress is lengthy, and many steps remain before legislation on Iran would be sent to the President. We believe, therefore, that the Senate can continue the work necessary to develop sanctions legislation without fear of short-circuiting diplomacy. Sincerely, Michael T. McCaul Brad ShermanPeter J.

10.25.2013	Washington, D.C. – At a meeting between the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Tuesday, October 22, 2013, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) raised the prospect of a Voice of America broadcast into Pakistan in the Sindhi language. In response to Sherman’s question, Prime Minister Sharif said, “I would welcome it.” The Prime Minister went on to list efforts of his own government to communicate in the Sindhi language. Sherman, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is the chair of the Congressional Sindh Caucus. “The response from the Sindhi community in Pakistan to U.S. public diplomacy in their language has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Sherman. “The Prime Minister of Pakistan welcomes this outreach.” In a Foreign Affairs Committee markup on July 21, 2011, Sherman offered an amendment to the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012. The amendment required that, of the funds made available to Voice of America, $1.5 million be used only for Sindhi language programming. The Committee considered and unanimously approved Sherman’s amendment. However, that bill never became law.
10.16.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the following statement in anticipation of tonight’s vote to reopen the government and avoid default: “Today marks a major victory for sensible governmental decision making and a repudiation of hostage taking. Because of President Obama’s strong stance, it is unlikely that an extremist faction will again demand legislation changes in order to allow the government to function and the country to pay its bills. “This is a clean CR and a clean suspension of the debt limit. The minor provisions dealing with verifying income of those who will receive subsidies to buy health insurance simply restate current law. Obamacare has not been diminished, delayed, defunded, or even adjusted. “Over the last 16 days, enormous harm has been done to our standing in the world, our business climate, consumer confidence, and the economy in general. Harm has been done to our federal employees and to those who need to do business with the federal government. “We need to resolve that never again will our country and our economy be taken hostage by a political faction seeking to accomplish through illegitimate means what they could not achieve through the legislative process.” -30-
10.10.2013	Joined by 13 House Foreign Affairs Committee Colleagues in Bipartisan Letter to President Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), respectively the Ranking Member and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, led 13 of their House Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues in a letter asking the President to deem all, or most, of the employees of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) as essential. Due to the federal government shutdown, the Treasury Department has furloughed most of the employees enforcing sanctions on the Iranian regime. The Department has furloughed nearly all of the staff of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which implements a large portion of the U.S. government’s financial sanctions. OFAC is unable to effectively issue new sanctions guidance, issue new designations against individuals and entities enabling Iran, Syria, North Korea, and terrorist organizations, or investigate and penalize sanctions violators at this time. “Nothing is more essential to national security than working to stop the Iranian nuclear weapons program,” said Sherman. “There are always difficult choices to make during a federal shutdown. We urge the President and Secretary Lew to deem most if not all of OFAC’s staff essential. For maximum U.S. leverage, the sanctions pressure must be kept on Iran especially as Hassan Rouhani attempts to present Iran’s government in a new light.” The letter notes that the “Lapse of Appropriations Plan” issued by the Department of Treasury on October 1st, 2013 contains several core functions that are to continue during a shutdown, including a number of key sanctions enforcement and anti-terrorism finance activities. The 15 House Foreign Affairs Committee Members who signed the letter were Brad Sherman, Ted Poe, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Albio Sires, Michael McCaul, Gerry Connolly, Paul Cook, Karen Bass, Tom Cotton, Juan Vargas, Randy Weber, Alan Lowenthal, Ron DeSantis, Ami Bera, and Steve Stockman. A copy of the final letter is attached. 10.10.13 Letter to President Obama on OFAC Shutdown.pdf
10.10.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Rep. Brad Sherman (CA-30) along with Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (NY-12), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSE), and Rep. Gary G. Miller (CA-31), Vice Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to Edward DeMarco, Acting Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), opposing any FHFA action to reduce loan limits. The letter was signed by a bipartisan group of 66 House Members. “Higher Federal Housing Administration conforming loan limits are critical to supporting current housing prices and our overall economic recovery,” Congressman Sherman said. “In the Los Angeles area, these limits are not at the level of a mansion; they afford a middle class home. We cannot allow the FHFA to go against what Congress has put into law and what Director DeMarco has said previously.” “This is a continuation of my work on conforming loan limits for high cost areas,” Sherman continued. “I am glad to see that even in this current political environment we had a bipartisan group of cosigners. This is an issue many on both sides can agree on.” Congresswoman Maloney said, “The simple fact is that reducing the maximum for conforming loans from the current—and inadequate—$625,000 cap will hurt high cost areas such as my district and, indeed, all of New York City. To even consider doing so after saying you won’t is a classic bait-and-switch, and I hope the FHFA doesn’t go down that road.” Congressman Miller added, “Congress did not give FHFA the authority to reduce the loan limits. In fact, we included language in statute explicitly stating that the loan limits could not be reduced. Congress is currently working on housing finance reform and this larger conversation is the appropriate place to discuss the definition of conforming loans.” “Housing prices are on the rise, but lowering the loan limits could put the housing market’s fragile recovery at risk,” Miller continued. “This is not consistent with FHFA’s role as conservator. Lowering the limits would place taxpayers at greater risk due to a decline in home values, ultimately harming the GSEs’ financial positions. While we need to attract more private capital participation in the mortgage market, a reduction in the loan limit is not the right way to achieve this goal.” This action is consistent with Sherman’s continual support of increasing conforming loan limits for high-cost areas. In 2008, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and Congressman Gary Miller (R-Brea) were successful in a bipartisan effort to create a high-cost area conforming loan limit capped at $625,500 in high cost areas that have median home prices above $417,000. Those limits were later temporarily increased to $729,750, thanks to the ongoing advocacy of Reps. Sherman and Miller, and their partners in Congress from both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, the temporary $729,750 limits were allowed to expire on September 30, 2011, and the loan limits dropped overnight from $729,750 to $625,500 in high-cost areas. Sherman kept up the effort to maintain higher loan limits however, and in response Congress passed an amendment through the Fiscal Year 2012 appropriations process that restored the Federal Housing Administration conforming loan limits to the $729,750 for two years, until December 31, 2013. The text of the letter follows: Edward DeMarco, Acting DirectorFederal Housing Finance Agency400 7th Street, SouthwestWashington, DC 20024 Dear Acting Director DeMarco, We are deeply concerned by your recent statement that “FHFA has been analyzing approaches for reducing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan limits across the country and any such change would be announced with adequate advance notice for implementation on January 1, 2014.” Such action by a single regulator would serve only to further tighten credit availability and thereby erode progress in our fragile housing recovery. Currently, homeownership rates are at an historic 18-year low. Mortgage credit is virtually nonexistent for middle class Americans with less than stellar credit. Unless borrowers have a credit score of 760, conventional mortgage financing will simply be out of reach. Moreover, housing is the cornerstone of our economy, and arbitrary regulatory reduction of the conforming loan limit will further disrupt our overall economic recovery. We think you said it best yourself, when you testified before the House Financial Services Committee on May 25, 2011 that the Director of FHFA, as conservator, has not unilaterally set the maximum loan rate, proclaiming, “That essentially has never been done. And as I testified before, I don’t intend to act unilaterally in lowering the loan limit because the Congress of the United States has been so actively and repeatedly involved in adjusting the conforming loan limit. I believe that is an important issue of national policy.” You further articulated our shared concern, “I think for me to do this unilaterally would risk some disruption in the marketplace. It could be inconsistent with my responsibilities as conservator. I really and truly believe that the Congress of the United States is the body that should make the determinations about the future path of the loan limit if it is going to be something other than what current law provides.” We could not agree more. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 contains specific language prohibiting the conforming loan limit from declining. It states that if the “annual adjustment is a decrease, then no adjustment shall be made.” This is a clear indication of Congressional intent to retain stability for housing markets. We urge you to continue to defer to the United States Congress on whether the conforming loan limits should be reduced and allow our delicate recovery in housing to continue.

09.30.2013	Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, on ABC's “This Week,” host George Stephanopoulos asked the Iranian Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, about a statement appearing on the website of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, which refers in English to “the myth of the massacre of the Jews known as the Holocaust.” Zarif, asked by Stephanopoulos to explain, said no one in the Iranian government claims the Holocaust is a myth and that this was likely a translation error on Khamenei’s website. Zarif told Stephanopoulos if the word ‘myth’ indeed appeared, “It's a bad translation.” Attached is the exact language appearing on the website of Ayatollah Khamenei on September 30, 2013 – in both English and Farsi. It is correctly translated into English by the Iranian Government. The English and the Farsi match.* Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “Khamenei is lying about the Holocaust today on his website in both English and Farsi. Yesterday the Foreign Minister of Iran lied about his Supreme Leader’s webpage. If they lie about the Holocaust, and they lie about what’s on the Supreme Leader’s webpage today, can we trust what they say about their nuclear weapons program?” *Aryanpour Persian-English Dictionary shows “Afsaaneh” means myth, tale, legend, fiction, or fable. On his English website today, the Supreme leader refers to the Holocaust as a “myth” and on his Farsi website he refers to the Holocaust as Afsaaneh.Supreme Leader English Page.pdfSupreme Leader Farsi Page.pdf
09.10.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) met with Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak today in Sherman’s office to discuss the Russian proposal for the disposal of Syrian chemical weapons. Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Sherman’s statement on the proposal and his meeting with Ambassador Kislyak follows: “I commend the Russian proposal and the efforts of the Russian government to avoid a wider conflict in Syria, as well as prevent the further use of chemical weapons or their transfer to terrorists. Ambassador Kislyak and I held an informative meeting today, and I believe that the Russian proposal deserves very serious attention to develop the details needed to carry it out. “Russia and the rest of the international community need to develop a much longer, detailed proposal to be presented to Assad. Ambassador Kislyak assured me that his government is working on such a detailed proposal. Assad has agreed to give up his chemical weapons in principle, but this undertaking – collecting, securing and ultimately destroying a large stockpile of chemical weapons in a war zone – needs to be spelled out in painstaking detail. Only when Assad accepts a detailed proposal will we know that he is serious. “That said, Assad giving up his chemical weapons through an inspection and verification process would go further toward ensuring the security of the United States, and would do more to prevent the future use of chemical weapons than we could hope to achieve through airstrikes.” -30-
09.06.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) sent a letter today to all Senate and House Members with suggested improvements to the Senate Resolution on Syria, which passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 4, 2013. Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. The text of the letter follows: September 6, 2013 TO: Senate and House Members RE: Need to Strike Last Eight Words of Section 3 of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Resolution. Dear Colleague: Senators Menendez and Corker are to be commended for their bipartisan efforts. The purpose of this letter is to propose an improvement to Section 3 of the Resolution (S.J. Res 21) which passed the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 4, 2013. Section 3 currently reads as follows: “The authority granted in Section 2(a) does not authorize the use of the United States Armed Forces on the ground in Syria for the purpose of combat operations [emphasis added].” The words “for the purpose of combat operations” should be stricken from the Resolution. The Resolution should not authorize American armed forces on the ground in Syria, even if they are there only to advise or train the Free Syria Army or other dissident elements. The Resolution must be drafted carefully so that we are not asking our colleagues to authorize the Armed Forces of the United States to be on the ground in the territory of Syria for any reason. The words “in Syria” should also be stricken. We should not be asking our colleagues to authorize ground operations in Lebanon or any other country to which Syrian chemical weapons might be taken, or to which Syrian command and control, delivery systems, or other assets relevant to chemical weapons might be taken. The purpose of this letter is to focus on the exact text of the Resolution we will consider this month. Some who are reading this letter will believe that the President should have the authority to send trainers or advisers on the ground in Syria, or to send our ground forces into other countries to which Syrianchemical weapons might be taken. Even if you believe that the President should have such broad authority, such authority should not be granted by the text of this resolution. The President already has the inherent authority to take such emergency action without Congressional approval for up to sixty days under the War Powers Resolution of 1973. Nothing in this Resolution should add to the President’s existing authority to deploy ground forces. Those who would draft a resolution so as to give the President more than the absolute minimum authority he needs to carry out the plan he has described risk that the House will vote against providing any authority at all. I look forward to discussing these issues with you. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN -30-
09.02.2013	Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Terrorism and Non-Proliferation Subcommittee, released the following statement concerning Syria. [Background: On July 7, 2011, the Sherman amendment to prevent funds from being used for military operations in Libya without Congressional approval passed the House 316 to 111.] “In marked contrast to the U.S. involvement in Libya, the President has decided to seek a Congressional resolution before using military force. I commend the President for seeking such an authorization. “I support doing what the President has said he would like to do in Syria, namely, a limited military action against the Assad regime designed to punish and deter the use of chemical weapons. I cannot support the text of the resolution the President has proposed. “While the President makes the case for limited action, the resolution he proposes is without limits. The proposed resolution would give the President the authority to act with no limit on the duration of our involvement and it would authorize all types of military action, including boots-on-the-ground. We cannot give the President a blank check. “Congress should not choose between doing nothing and passing the blank-check resolution the President has submitted. “Congress should authorize action for up to sixty days and provide expedited consideration of any further Presidential request for further authorization. Congress should also consider limiting its authorization to air and naval action, prohibiting boots-on-the-ground, except as necessary to rescue U.S. servicemen. Sherman has proposed two amendments to the President’s draft (below).Sherman Amendments to Syria ResolutionAmendment INothing in this resolution authorizes any military action undertaken more than sixty days after enactment. Congress shall consider a resolution to authorize the use of force, beyond that authorized by this Resolution, pursuant to the procedures described in Section 6 of the War Powers Resolution of 1973.Amendment IINothing in this resolution authorizes the deployment of ground forces in Syria, except for limited efforts to rescue American personnel. -30-
08.30.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) made the following statement regarding intervention in Syria. Sherman is a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Trade, and Nonproliferation.“While supporting democracy abroad we should respect the rule of law at home. The President should comply with the War Powers Act and at this stage he is doing so by conferring with Congressional leaders.“Under the War Powers Act the President may not put American forces into hostilities for more than 60 days without Congressional approval. I led the effort in 2011 to use Congress’ power over appropriations to enforce this provision with respect to Libya. [Specifically, in July 2011, during the Libya campaign, the House passed a Sherman amendment to the Defense Appropriations bill, prohibiting the use of funds in violation of the War Powers Act.]“The Syrian opposition includes al-Qaeda affiliated elements. However, the Assad regime poses a greater threat to U.S. national security interests as is illustrated by Assad’s alliance with Iran and Hezbollah.“We should demonstrate to Assad, and dictators who come after him, that they will pay a significant military price if they use chemical weapons—particularly if they use chemical weapons on a large scale against civilians.”-30-
08.27.2013	Sherman Oaks, CA – On Sunday, August 25th, 2013, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall meeting at El Camino High School in Woodland Hills, fielding questions from some of the approximately 450 constituents who attended. 0 0 1 408 2330 US House Of Representatives 19 5 2733 14.0 Normal 0 false false false EN-US JA X-NONE /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:"Table Normal"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-priority:99; mso-style-parent:""; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including the economy, jobs, Social Security, Medicare, the budget, the deficit, immigration, the Middle East, as well as other issues facing Congress. There were many questions from those who identified themselves as members of the Tea Party and related groups. In discussing the U.S. economy and foreign policy, Sherman called for tough action on China on trade issues, while cautioning against an expensive major naval deployment to the South China Sea. Sherman argued that Beijing’s currency manipulation and unfair business practices have been fueling our massive, growing trade deficit with China and have kept U.S. unemployment high. While some have called for a massive realignment—a “pivot”—of American military forces to Asia, Sherman warned of committing U.S. taxpayers to billions of dollars over confrontations regarding various disputed islands between East and Southeast Asian nations. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Sherman regarding the town hall. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents, helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.” Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies. Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. On Sunday, September 15th, 2013, Congressman Brad Sherman will host another town hall meeting at El Camino High School in Woodland Hills from 3:00 pm to 4:30 pm.
08.20.2013	GRANADA HILLS, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman joined Indian Ambassador Nirupama Rao this past weekend at a festival in Granada Hills celebrating the 66th anniversary of India’s Independence. Thousands of Valley residents participated in the celebration at Granada Hills High School. Congressman Sherman invited Ambassador Rao to the San Fernando Valley and hosted her over the weekend at a number of events. “I was deeply honored to welcome Ambassador Rao to the San Fernando Valley,” Congressman Sherman said following the event. “At this weekend’s celebration, Ambassador Rao and I discussed the importance of the U.S.-India relationship and the substantial role of the Indian-American community in strengthening this partnership.” Addressing the gathering at Granada Hills, Ambassador Rao spoke of the shared values and interests between the two great democracies of India and the United States, and praised the role played by the Indian-American community in strengthening and transforming the relationship between the two countries. She thanked Congressman Sherman for his leadership and personal commitment to the promotion of India-U.S. strategic partnership. Congressman Sherman, an active member of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans, has met with a wide range of Indian leaders over the years. Earlier this year he welcomed Ambassador Rao to his Washington, D.C. office, where they explored ways to enhance economic and cultural ties between India and the U.S. and to expand cooperation on counterterrorism, homeland security, and defense.
07.31.2013	House Passes New Iran Sanctions Bill Major Provisions Authored by Sherman Washington, DC - Today the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act, bipartisan legislation introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA) and Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-NY) in February 2013, passed the House of Representatives. “Iran’s recent election of a so-called ‘moderate’ President has done nothing to change two important facts: Iran is still pursuing nuclear weapons capability, and the Supreme Leader is still the leader and decision-maker of Iran’s military and nuclear program,” said Congressman Sherman following the vote. “I am urging my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation and send it to the President for his signature.” The Nuclear Iran Prevention Act expands current sanctions against the Central Bank of Iran for oil purchases and third party transfers of Iranian crude oil, which have sometimes allowed Iran to side-step sanctions. On May 22, 2013, the House Foreign Affairs Committee marked up the new sanctions bill and passed it unanimously. Congressman Sherman contributed provisions through four amendments that were adopted unanimously that: Add the knowing transfer of uranium mining and milling equipment to Iran to current sanctions law. Require a certification from prospective federal contractors that they (and affiliates) conduct no business with Iran that is sanctionable under this bill. · Expand sanctions on individuals who transfer technology used to repress dissidents in Iran by imposing harsher sanctions beyond just government procurement contract prohibitions and expanding the scope of sanctions to include affiliates of these individuals. Strengthen current nonproliferation law under which the President must designate countries that allow a substantial diversion of certain sensitive goods, services, or technologies to Iran as “Destinations of Diversion Concern” (DDC) – and authorize harsher sanctions on such countries. “This bipartisan Iran sanctions bill will broaden economic sanctions, strengthen human rights sanctions, and increase oversight of the enforcement of current sanctions,” Sherman added.

07.24.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) made the following statement after a House Financial Services Committee markup on the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act. To watch a video of his full remarks, click here. “Yesterday I participated in a House Financial Services Committee markup on legislation intended to reform our country’s housing finance system. Unfortunately the legislation under scrutiny—the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act—would in fact hurt taxpayers and homeowners and significantly threaten our nation’s economic recovery. “The PATH Act would end the affordable 30-year fixed rate mortgage for four-fifths of all home buyers, leaving many Californians with higher cost mortgages and causing housing prices to plummet as a result. The legislation would also hurt community banks and credit unions, limit the supply of rental housing, and put taxpayers at undue risk. “During consideration of the PATH Act, I offered an amendment to prevent reduction of conforming mortgage loan limits for high-cost areas like the San Fernando Valley. Unfortunately the amendment did not pass. Despite resistance from my colleagues, please be assured I will continue to fight to protect Valley homeowners, our housing market, and our economy. As I mentioned at yesterday’s markup, no one is defending the status quo, but that doesn’t mean we should go back to the dangerous policies of the 1930s.”
07.23.2013	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, met with the President of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Rajnath Singh. Sherman is an active member of the Congressional Caucus on India and Indian-Americans. Over the years, Congressman Sherman has met with a wide range of Indian leaders from many organizations, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party. Congressman Sherman and BJP President Singh discussed enhancing economic, security, and cultural ties between India and the U.S. “I am pleased to continue to work with Indian leaders and the Indian American community to strengthen ties between the world’s largest democracies, India and the United States,” said Sherman. “India is a strategic ally of the United States.”
07.17.2013	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his commitment to preserving America’s national parks for future generations. “I am honored by the National Parks Conservation Association’s award, and I thank them. I will continue to work hard to protect our treasured national parks and natural space,” said Sherman. The National Parks Award is for Members of Congress who lead efforts to protect and enhance the National Park System. The NPCA, which has 600,000 members and supporters, works to protect the park system to preserve the nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage. One of Sherman’s major accomplishments is working to protect the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. This area is the most visited unit of the National Park System, with over 33 million annual visitors. Sherman spoke on the importance of the Santa Monica Mountains for residents of the Valley. “Protecting our environment – especially our pristine national parks – is one of my top legislative priorities. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park, providing a variety of outdoor activities for Valley families.” Earlier this year, Sherman worked to persuade the Obama administration to include funding in its Fiscal Year 2014 Budget for land acquisitions in the Santa Monica Mountains. The President’s budget included $3.7 million to acquire and protect up to 317 acres of land in Zuma and Trancas Canyons near Malibu in the Santa Monica Mountains. Over the years, Sherman has helped to secure nearly $20 million to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. -30-
07.11.2013	Sherman Leads Bipartisan Effort to Secure Funds for U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation House Passes Energy and Water Spending Bill with $2 Million for U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program Washington, DC – The U.S. House of Representatives passed federal spending legislation late last night that includes $2 million for the U.S.–Israel Energy Cooperation Program, a program championed by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA). Congressman Sherman, along with Congressman Eliot Engel (D-NY) and Congressman Michael Grimm (R-NY), led 50 other colleagues in a request to the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development for $2 million for the program in the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The appropriations request this year included the highest number of signatories – 53 members of Congress – since the creation of the program in 2008. Sherman noted the importance of the House passing this appropriation. “This is another significant step in our efforts to cooperate with our ally Israel, which has a proven record of innovation in the field of energy research,” said Sherman. “Our national security depends on the development of alternative energy. Funding for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program has already advanced innovative new energy projects. I look forward to working with the Obama administration on further boosting funding for this program in future budgets.” Congressman Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2005 with Congressman Engel and former Congressman John Shadegg (R-AZ). Congress ultimately enacted the legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, in December 2007. The Israeli government has committed to match U.S. appropriations dollar for dollar. The program is also designed to leverage matching contributions from both the Israeli and American private sectors; thus for every dollar Congress appropriates, three dollars are invested, contributing to our economy and our energy security. Through the funding from this program, cooperative research and development projects are underway in various fields: advanced regenerative fuel cells, high-energy magnesium batteries, an advanced photovoltaic system for solar panels, and windows that produce electricity from solar energy. “Israel and the United States already have a long track record of successful, cooperative research in several fields such as medicine, biotechnology, computer programming and hardware, and agriculture,” Sherman added. “This program is a great way to leverage a modest investment in alternative energy and efficiency, to the benefit of both countries. We will continue to work together to promote energy security and job creation.” -30-
06.26.2013	Washington, DC – Following today’s historic Supreme Court rulings, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) made the following statement: “Today the Supreme Court of the United States declared the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional and invalidated California’s Proposition 8. “I applaud the Court’s decision to strike down these laws and defend equality. “I believe that government should allow all consenting adults, regardless of sexual orientation, to enjoy the benefits of legally-recognized marriage. I will continue the fight for marriage equality. “DOMA allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages and deny same-sex couples the benefits and protections of marriage, including spousal support, the ability to file joint taxes, and the right to take unpaid leave to care for an ill spouse. In a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court deemed DOMA unconstitutional, declaring it discriminatory and in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The federal government does not have the authority to invalidate marriages protected by the states. “I also applaud the Supreme Court for honoring the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision to find California’s Proposition 8 unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that the California opponents of same-sex marriage did not possess the standing to sue. We should reject any law that denies certain citizens legal rights and protections that are available to others, simply because of their sexual preference. In America rights should be granted equally to all citizens across the board. Gay marriage is now legal in California, as it should be. “This is an historic step forward for the state of California, America, and same-sex couples everywhere. I look forward to the day that our entire nation recognizes and celebrates these unions.”
06.03.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) welcomed today’s announcement by Farmers Insurance CEO Jeff Dailey that the company will move its headquarters to Woodland Hills in the San Fernando Valley. As the only Los Angeles area Congressman on the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of the House Committee on Financial Services, Congressman Sherman is well acquainted with Farmers Insurance and the valuable services they provide to millions of Americans.“I am pleased to welcome Farmers Insurance to the San Fernando Valley. More people working in the Valley means a more robust economy,” Congressman Sherman said. There are currently 1,490 employees working at the Woodland Hills facility. Farmers Insurance will be moving roughly 1,400 jobs from their mid-Wilshire facility to the Valley over the next five years. In discussing their decision to move, the company highlighted many of the benefits Valley residents know well. With better access to the freeways, this will provide shorter commutes for a large number of their employees. Also,with the newer facilities in Woodland Hills, Farmers will have an enhanced work environment that will help attract and retain talented Californians.
05.21.2013	72 Members of Congress Urge State Department to Prioritize Release of Kidnapped Archbishops in Syria Sherman, Bilirakis, Maloney, Sarbanes, Franks, and Pompeo Lead Effort in House of Representatives Washington, DC – 72 Members of Congress, led by Representatives Brad Sherman (D-CA), Gus M. Bilirakis (R-FL), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), John Sarbanes (D-MD), Trent Franks (R-AZ), and Mike Pompeo (R-KS), urged the State Department to prioritize the release of two kidnapped Archbishops in a letter to Secretary Kerry. Metropolitan Boulos Yazigi, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Aleppo, and Metropolitan Yohanna Ibrahim, the Syriac Archbishop of Aleppo, were abducted by unknown assailants while carrying out humanitarian work in the northern province of Aleppo on April 22, 2013. Their driver, Fatha’Allah Kabboud, a deacon in the Syriac Orthodox Church, was shot dead. Pope Francis has called for the release of these Archbishops. “I am pleased that 72 bipartisan Representatives in the House joined together in urging the Secretary of State to make this issue a priority,” said Rep. Sherman, a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and a member of the International Religious Freedom Caucus. “We must do everything we can to ensure that Christians and other religious minorities have a safe future in Syria. I am deeply alarmed about the safety of the Archbishops and call for their immediate and safe release.” “It has been almost a month since Metropolitan Ibrahim and Metropolitan Yazigi were kidnapped,” said Rep. Bilirakis. “I am deeply concerned about their safety and demand their immediate return. These men of God faithfully served the Orthodox community during the ongoing conflict in Syria and their kidnapping highlights the troubling rise in abductions. This type of tragedy only heightens the need for the Assad regime to step aside. The United States needs to identify pro-democracy elements within Syria, so the country may work to establish a new government based on democratic institutions that promote and respect human rights and religious freedoms for all. I thank my colleagues in the House for joining us on this important letter urging Secretary Kerry to prioritize the safe return of the Archbishops to Aleppo.” “I am deeply concerned for the safety of Metropolitan Boulos Yazigi, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Aleppo, and Metropolitan Yohanna Ibrahim, the Syriac Archbishop of Aleppo, who were kidnapped as they carried out humanitarian work near the Turkish border of Syria,” said Rep. Maloney. “Not only were these religious leaders abducted, but their driver, an innocent victim, was murdered by these armed individuals. It is a travesty that weeks have gone by since the Archbishops were initially captured, and we have still heard nothing on their release. These Archbishops have nothing to do with the Syrian civil war, and I call on their immediate and safe release.” “The kidnapping of Metropolitan Ibrahim and Metropolitan Yazigi is part of an alarming trend of violence directed at religious minorities, especially Christians,” said Rep. Pompeo. “I am glad to be joined by 71 Members of the House of Representatives to demand the release of the Archbishops and to reaffirm our commitment to religious freedom around the world.” “We urge the State Department to make Metropolitan Yazigi and Metropolitan Ibrahim’s immediate release and safe return to Aleppo a priority in our efforts in the region,” said the Members in the letter. “As Members of Congress committed to religious freedom in the Middle East and around the world, we believe the United States must do everything it can to ensure that all the diverse religions and ethnicities of Syria have a safe future.” Full text of letter: The Honorable John Kerry Secretary of State U.S. Department of State Washington, D.C. Dear Secretary Kerry, We write to express our grave concern over the kidnapping of Metropolitan Boulos Yazigi, the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of Aleppo, and Metropolitan Yohanna Ibrahim, the Syriac Archbishop of Aleppo. The two Archbishops were abducted by unknown assailants while carrying out humanitarian work in the northern province of Aleppo on April 22, 2013. We mourn the murder of Fatha’Allah Kabboud, a deacon in the Syriac Orthodox Church, who was serving as the Archbishops’ driver at the time of their abduction. We urge the State Department to make Metropolitan Yazigi and Metropolitan Ibrahim’s immediate release and safe return to Aleppo a priority in our efforts in the region. Metropolitan Yazigi and Metropolitan Ibrahim had previously made public pronouncements that religious tolerance and diversity was under threat from the two-year conflict in their country. The kidnapping of Metropolitan Yazigi and Metropolitan Ibrahim reflects the troubling rise in abductions in Syria, the expanding chaos and brutality of the civil war that has killed more than 70,000 Syrians, and an increasingly dangerous environment for religious minorities. As Members of Congress committed to religious freedom in the Middle East and around the world, we believe the United States must do everything it can to ensure that all the diverse religions and ethnicities of Syria have a safe future. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Sincerely, The Honorable Brad Sherman The Honorable Gus M.

04.09.2013	WASHINGTON, DC – Today Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) reintroduced the “Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act,” in the House and Senate respectively. Under the legislation, any institution that is too big to fail will be broken up and reorganized to avoid more government bailouts and future risk to the economy. If passed, this legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to identify, then later break up, institutions that are deemed too big to fail to avoid the potential for a future government bailout and undue risk to our nation’s economy. “Too big to fail should be too big to exist,” said Congressman Sherman who has advocated this position since 2008. “Never again should a financial institution be able to demand a federal bailout. They claim; ‘if we go down, the economy is going down with us,’ but by breaking up these institutions long before they face a crisis, we ensure a healthy financial system where medium sized institutions can compete in the free market.” Sherman continued, “No longer should giant financial institutions be able to get low-cost funds by telling large depositories that even if the institution is mismanaged and faces financial default, by virtue of its sheer size it will be able to obtain a bailout from the federal government. Every financial institution should compete for funds based on the soundness of its balance sheet, and no financial institution should be able to claim that there is a special federal safety net available to its investors because of the institution’s sheer size.” “In my view, no single financial institution should have holdings so extensive that its failure could send the world economy into crisis,” Senator Sanders said. “At the very least, no institution, no CEO in America should be above the law. If an institution is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.” Richard Fisher, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, argued that when markets presume a systemically important institution has implicit government backing, access to capital is easier. A recent study by International Monetary Fund researchers showed a potential advantage of these firms as high as 80 basis points (.8%). Carrying out that estimation, Bloomberg News asserts taxpayers could be creating a subsidy of $83 billion dollars annually. This legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit to Congress a list of all commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies that the Secretary believes have become too big to fail. Those entities deemed too large would then be broken up in a managed process of reorganization, so a single failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without a taxpayer bailout. The Senate recently passed an amendment unanimously to its budget resolution to end subsidies or funding advantages for institutions over $500 billion in assets. Unfortunately, the Budget is still a resolution, not law. “Too Big to Fail” refers to any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy without substantial government assistance.”
02.26.2013	Washington, DC – Today, at a hearing on “The Rebalance to Asia: Why South Asia Matters” in the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), warned of excessive U.S. military commitment toward the Japan-China dispute over the islands known as Diaoyu Islands in China and Senkaku Islands in Japan. Sherman supported the U.S. “pivot” toward the Asia-Pacific region, where nearly 100,000 U.S. troops are already deployed. However, he warned of the costs of excess military confrontation over an island dispute. “Confronting China over the islands it disputes with Japan could involve many tens of billions of dollars,” said Sherman. “Japan itself spends only a very small portion of its budget on defense.” -30-
02.20.2013	CANOGA PARK, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, received the “Friend of Affordable Housing Award” from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco for his long-standing support of affordable housing and preserving and increasing homeownership opportunities in the San Fernando Valley. Sherman also helped announce the recipients of the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) funding competition. “I am pleased with this honor and the partnership we have developed over the years to create much-needed affordable housing for low-income residents and veterans with families. For nearly a decade, I have worked with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and other partners to help increase and preserve homeownership opportunities for hundreds of Valley families,” said Congressman Sherman. During his tenure in Congress, Sherman has been a strong advocate for legislation that increases affordable housing, advances homeownership opportunities and protects the housing market. He has also helped Valley families avoid foreclosure through his constituent services program and foreclosure prevention workshops. The ceremony took place at New Economics for Women’s Tierra del Sol community, which received a $595,000 AHP award from the Bank in 2000. The development features 119 units of affordable housing, a K-5 charter school, the Dennis P. Zine Community Center and space for nonprofit service organizations. Sherman also helped announce the results of the Affordable Housing Program funding competition. In 2012, FHLBank of San Francisco awarded $35 million in grants through dozens of member financial institutions. The funds will support 72 projects that will create or preserve nearly 3,600 units of affordable housing in 11 states, including 927 units in Los Angeles County and a 12-unit housing development under construction by Habitat for Humanity-San Fernando/Santa Clarita Valleys in Sylmar for veterans with families. “We applaud Rep. Sherman for his efforts to expand housing opportunities for working families during his time in Congress,” said Lawrence H. Parks, Senior Vice President of Legislative and External Affairs at FHLBank of San Francisco. “We are pleased to make these grants available to expand the supply of affordable housing and give families and individuals more housing options. “At a time when it is very difficult for community developers to finance affordable housing projects, our AHP grants are making a difference by helping to fill the void.” FHLBank of San Francisco’s Friend of Affordable Housing Award is presented annually to a valued supporter of affordable housing in the region and throughout the nation. The Affordable Housing Program provides grants to support the creation of rental or homeownership opportunities for lower-income households. *For more information about the 2012 AHP Grant Recipients, please click on the links below: https://www.fhlbsf.com/community/docs/2012a-ahp-projects.pdf https://www.fhlbsf.com/community/docs/2012b-ahp-projects.pdf -30-
02.14.2013	Introduction Follows House Bill Introduced by Representatives Sherman and PoeWashington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) lauded Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) for introducing the Visa Waiver for Israel Act, S. 266, in the Senate on February 7, 2013. The bill would pave the way for Israel’s entrance into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. The Senate legislation follows the introduction of the House version of the bill, H.R. 300, introduced on January 15, 2013, by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) with lead co-sponsor Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX). 66 Representatives are currently cosponsoring the House bill. “Israel is an important trading partner and ally with a well-educated and versatile workforce,” Senator Wyden said. “Including Israel in the Visa Waiver program will open up opportunities for collaboration and investment that will benefit both countries.” Senator Wyden is the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Senator Hatch is the most senior Republican in the Senate and is a senior member and former Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Visa Waiver for Israel Act was referred to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. “I commend Senator Wyden and Senator Hatch for introducing the Visa Waiver for Israel Act in the Senate,” said Sherman. “The widely bipartisan, bicameral support for this bill demonstrates the strength of the U.S.-Israel relationship and the positive prospects for this bill’s passage into law. Adding Israel to the Visa Waiver Program will stimulate innovation and growth in our economy and greatly enhance cultural ties between our nations.” The Senate bill is nearly identical to the Visa Waiver for Israel Act in May 2012 along with lead cosponsor Ted Poe and 11 other colleagues; 34 members of Congress cosponsored Sherman’s bill in 2012. The Visa Waiver Program allows travelers from 37 countries to enter the United States for business or leisure as visitors for up to 90 days without first getting a visa. Visitors from other countries must obtain a visa from U.S. consular posts before traveling to the United States. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Daniel Ayalon, released the following statement about the Visa Waiver for Israel Act: “The proposed waiving of the visa requirement for Israeli tourists visiting America is a true reflection of the special, deep and mutually advantageous relations between Israel and the U.S. and between the Israeli and American peoples, and reports of the legislative initiative were received with great warmth in Israel. I strongly commend Congressmen Brad Sherman and Ted Poe for all their efforts and also the many representatives that have co-sponsored the Visa Waiver for Israel Act.” Israelis entered the U.S. as temporary visitors about 320,000 times annually in recent years and that number is expected to increase significantly if Israel enters the program. In 2011, Israelis spent over $1.6 billion in U.S. tourism, travel, and airfare. -30-
02.13.2013	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) wrote to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) urging the agency to approve the lease proposal from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to continue to operate the North Valley Occupational Center-Aviation Center at Van Nuys Airport.“The Aviation Center’s Aircraft Mechanics Program is one of the top ranked programs in the nation for high school and adult students seeking much sought after skills to gain high-paying jobs in the aviation and aerospace industry for aircraft operators at Van Nuys Airport and across the country,” said Congressman Sherman.Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) is working with LAUSD to draft a new long-term lease at the rate of $1.00 per year. The FAA is required to review and approve the lease to ensure the terms meet current federal guidelines and policies. Congressman Sherman is urging the FAA to expedite the review and approval process so that LAUSD and LAWA can negotiate a new lease before the current lease term expires on June 30, 2013. Under the financial terms of a new lease, LAUSD is committed to continuing to operate the program at Van Nuys Airport. The full letter to the Federal Aviation Administration is below.

Box 92007Los Angeles, CA 90009 Re: LAUSD Aviation Center at Van Nuys AirportDear Mr. Soumi:I am writing to strongly urge the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to review and offer its consent to the proposal from the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to remain a tenant at Van Nuys Airport and continue to operate the North Valley Occupational Center-Aviation Center under the terms of a new lease agreement.The Aviation Center’s Aircraft Mechanics Program offers invaluable skills and training to dozens of students each year who ultimately receive FAA certification and get placed in high-paying jobs in the aviation and aerospace industries, including businesses at Van Nuys Airport.On February 1, 2013, Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) submitted an inquiry to the FAA regarding the specific request by LAUSD to occupy the same property for a $1.00 per year rent for a 15 year term under a new lease with LAWA. This request is consistent with existing FAA policy and other similar arrangements that have been made for educational institutions at LAWA-owned facilities. LAWA wants to retain the LAUSD and it needs guidance and consent from the FAA before the agency can negotiate and approve a new lease.I am confident the FAA can address the issues brought to your attention in LAWA’s letter and allow the agency to immediately draft a new lease before the existing LAUSD lease expires on June 30, 2013. Thank you for your urgent assistance in this matter. Sincerely,BRAD SHERMANMember of Congress-30-
02.07.2013	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – Congressman Adam Schiff (D-Burbank), Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and other colleagues made recommendations to the National Park Service in response to the proposed alternatives for the Rim of the Valley Corridor Special Resources Study.“We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to protect the natural, cultural and historical resources of this diverse area, as well as expand recreational and educational opportunities for millions of park users throughout Southern California. There are so many valuable resources within the study area that are suitable additions to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, including the significant wildlife corridor linkage through the Simi Hills, the Chatsworth Reservoir, the Santa Susana Mountains range, Griffith Park, and much more,” said Congressman Sherman. Congressmen Schiff and Sherman helped pass legislation in 2008 to direct the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study of the area known as the Rim of the Valley Corridor, generally including the mountains encircling the San Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi, and Conejo Valleys in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The legislation also directed the NPS to determine whether any portion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor study area is eligible to be designated as a unit of the national park system or added to an existing national park unit (Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation); and to explore other ways that private and governmental entities can protect resources and provide more outdoor recreation opportunities. The National Park Service will further analyze the proposed alternatives through an Environmental Impact Analysis and finalize their recommendations to the U.S. Department of the Interior and Congress in 2014. The public will have an opportunity to submit comments on the findings and recommendations of the draft report before it is finalized next year. The public can also stay involved and up-to-date with the process at www.nps.gov/pwro/rimofthevalley. The full letter to the National Park Service is below. February 6, 2013 Anne Dove National Park Service 570 W. Avenue 26, #175 Los Angeles, CA 90065 Dear Ms. Dove: We write to provide our view of the National Park Service’s ongoing Rim of the Valley Corridor Special Resources Study. We are pleased that the Study’s recently released Preliminary Findings and Alternative Concepts document found the study area to be a suitable addition to Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) and we have a series of recommendations to improve the alternatives in the document. We share the Study’s assessment that the study area contains nationally significant resources and would be a feasible addition to SMMNRA. The study area offers outstanding examples of geologic history, including the Transverse Ranges Province, and high levels of biodiversity, such as the rare San Fernando Valley spineflower at Laskey Mesa in the Simi Hills. The study area includes a superb example of the rare Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem. It also has enormous importance as a hiking, educational and recreational resource. These attributes and others should be protected for future generations to enjoy. Using the collaborative partnership-based park model, employed successfully by SMMNRA, will allow the boundary of SMMNRA to be expanded to include part or all of the study area and will ensure that NPS and its partners can protect natural and cultural resources in that area and provide recreational opportunities to the surrounding populations. While it is clear that the study area is a suitable and feasible addition to the SMMNRA, the alternatives put forward in the document offer different approaches to achieving this worthwhile and critical goal. And we believe that the best approach would be to draw from the strengths of two different alternatives. Alternatives C and D both expand the boundary of SMMNRA and would provide SMMNRA the authority to manage the new area in the same manner as the existing NRA, in partnership with existing land management agencies and organizations. But because the two alternatives have different focuses -- C on expanding recreational opportunities for urban audiences and D on promoting the long term resiliency of the natural resources within the area -- choosing only one of these alternatives would leave thousands of acres of nationally significant resources without adequate protection. The National Park Service should create a hybrid alternative that would include the boundary extensions of SMMNRA of both alternatives C and D. This hybrid alternative would provide comprehensive preservation of the region’s mountain ranges and trail systems and maintain habitat connectivity, while also ensuring that the objects of the two alternatives are realized. Alternative D also wisely recognizes the value in facilitating habitat connectivity between the Los Padres National Forest and Rim of the Valley Corridor by authorizing NPS to engage in cooperative conservation partnerships with public and private actors to the north of the study area. This Cooperative Conservation Partnership Area should remain in the hybrid alternative. A Cooperative Conservation Partnership Area should also be added to the hybrid alternative to connect the two portions of the Angeles National Forest in the Santa Clara River watershed. This inter-mountain range habitat linkage in the Angeles National Forest would ensure the preservation of this critical habitat. Although Alternative B would not expand the SMMNRA boundary and would not provide NPS the authority to acquire or manage lands outside of the current SMMNRA boundary, it does include one worthwhile proposal that should be included in the hybrid alternative. The Alternative recommends that SMMNRA provide continuing technical assistance to a partnership of public and private landowners, organization and institutions in the region. This technical assistance could take many helpful forms -- NPS staff participating in and lending guidance to national resource surveys, education activities focused on connecting people to the resources and stories of the study area and working on Rim of the Valley Trail planning. This idea should be incorporated into the hybrid alternative so that local residents can better interact with and obtain a stronger understanding of the beauty and history of the area. Additionally, both the Rim of the Valley Study and the San Gabriel Mountains and Watershed Special Resources Study include the western part of the Angeles National Forest. We request that that Rim of the Valley Study incorporate the findings from the San Gabriel Study, which is further along in the study process, into their analysis of this area. We further ask that that the San Gabriel Mountains in the western Angeles National Forest north of the Rim of the Valley trail are included in any future San Gabriel Mountains National Recreation Area, not in an expansion of the SMMNRA. Lastly, we believe that the hybrid alternative requires direct NPS management. Only NPS has the resources and expertise needed to protect the significant natural resources in the study area, ensure habitat connectivity between adjacent tracks of federally protected land, support trail and recreation efforts, and provide critical technical assistance to enhance residents’ experience with and connection to the study area. As this process moves forward, we strongly urge NPS to give full consideration to a hybrid alternative that includes the strengths of Alternatives B, C and D.

02.05.2013	Washington, DC -- Today Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) issued the following statement about the lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Standard & Poor’s Rating Services on Monday, February 4: “This action by the Justice Department against Standard & Poor’s regarding mortgage-backed bonds rated by S&P shines a light on slow action by the SEC to enforce the Franken-Sherman Amendment to the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, also known as Dodd-Frank. “The rating of bonds is the only arena where the umpire is selected and paid by one of the teams. When bond rating agencies are selected by those who are selling the very bonds they are evaluating, and when the bond rating agencies can earn millions of profits per contract, there is an incentive to try to please the bond issuers. That is why Senator Franken and I worked to change the system so that an independent body would select the bond rating agency and providing high ratings would not be the road to high profits for the rating agencies.” Congressman Sherman first offered a proposal in October 2009 to require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to end conflicts of interests in the selection of credit rating agencies by requiring an independent entity to assign credit rating agencies impartially.[1] Senator Al Franken (D-MN) then championed the idea in the Senate, and successfully passed an amendment through the Senate to require the SEC to create a Board to independently assign qualified credit rating agencies to rate issuances. In June 2010, Sherman appeared before the conference committee on financial regulatory reform to advocate for the proposal. The final version of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, required the SEC to conduct a study, and then implement the Franken-Sherman Amendment within two years, unless a credible alternative to ending conflicts of interests is identified. The SEC is now over six months behind in enforcing the Franken-Sherman Amendment. Senator Franken noted the importance of credit rating agencies in the statement he released yesterday: “Our nation’s financial meltdown happened in no small part because credit rating agencies had a perverse incentive to give triple-A ratings to financial instruments that turned out to be junk,” said. U.S. Sen. Al Franken. “In turn, investors in Minnesota and across the country relied on those ratings when making investments and were badly hurt financially.” Likewise, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission said the financial crisis “could not have happened without the rating agencies.”[2] “It is time for the SEC to implement the law,” Congressman Sherman said. “The present system has failed. Bond rating agencies like Standard & Poor’s gave triple A ratings to alt-A bonds. In the future, those selling mortgage-backed bonds should not select the credit rating agency that would evaluate those bonds. Bond rating agencies will be free to give tough grades, when warranted, without the fear of losing business and profits.” -30- [1] Amendment no. 21 by Mr. Sherman and Mr. Lynch; Full Committee Markup of H.R. 3890, the Accountability and Transparency in Rating Agencies Act before the H.

01.24.2013	Top Israeli Media Give Prominent Coverage to Bill to Add Israel to the U.S. Visa Waiver ProgramWashington, DC – The top publications in Israel, including front page articles in The Jerusalem Post and Israel Hayom, focused on the importance of Congressman Brad Sherman’s Visa Waiver for Israel Act. The two most popular television stations in Israel, Channel 2 and Channel 10, broadcasted coverage of a January 15, 2013, press conference on the bill to a national audience. “The prominent press coverage of this bill reflects a strong desire among Israelis to deepen their travel, business, and cultural ties with America,” said Sherman. “Israelis would like to invest much more in our economy and tourism sector. With increased cooperation and jobs in biotechnology, information technology, and green energy research and development, adding Israel to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program will help boost our economy.” The Visa Waiver Program allows travelers from 37 countries – but currently not Israel – to enter the United States for business or leisure as visitors for up to 90 days without first getting a visa. Today, Israelis must obtain a visa from the U.S. Embassy before traveling to the United States, often a time-consuming process that could take up to four months. Conferences and meetings in the U.S. are made difficult for Israeli businessmen, scientists, and other travelers. On Tuesday, January 15, 2013, Sherman introduced the Visa Waiver for Israel Act with 50 co-sponsors, including lead co-sponsor Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX). The bill would pave the way for Israel’s entrance into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) is introducing the same bill in the Senate. The bill is identical to the one Sherman introduced last year, which under House rules needed to be reintroduced in 2013. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Daniel Ayalon, expressed strong support for Sherman’s bill: “The proposed waiving of the visa requirement for Israeli tourists visiting America is a true reflection of the special, deep and mutually advantageous relations between Israel and the U.S. and between the Israeli and American peoples, and reports of the legislative initiative were received with great warmth in Israel.

Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) is introducing the same bill in the Senate. Sherman first introduced the Visa Waiver for Israel Act in May 2012 along with lead cosponsor Ted Poe and 11 other colleagues; 34 members of Congress cosponsored Sherman’s bill. The Visa Waiver Program allows travelers from 37 countries to enter the United States for business or leisure as visitors for up to 90 days without first getting a visa. Visitors from other countries must obtain a visa from U.S. consular posts before traveling to the United States.At a press conference today on Capitol Hill, several Members of Congress, including Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), Randy Weber (R-TX), Juan Vargas (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), Matt Cartwright (D-PA), Brad Schneider (D-IL), and Mark Takano (D-CA), joined Sherman and Poe to unveil the bill and promote its passage into law. The Deputy Foreign Minister of Israel, Daniel Ayalon, also gave remarks at the press conference in support of adding his nation to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. “I’m pleased to reintroduce the Visa Waiver for Israel Act with 50 bipartisan colleagues in Congress,” said Congressman Sherman. “U.S.–Israel cooperation in biotechnology and medical research, green energy, homeland security, and information technology generates jobs and much-needed economic growth. Adding Israel to the Visa Waiver Program will boost business here in the U.S. and enhance cultural ties between our two nations. Israelis can visit most of Europe, Latin America, Canada, and several other countries around the world, visa-free, but not the United States. It is time we add our closest friend and democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, to the U.S. Visa Waiver Program.” “It is time for the United States to let Israel know we are open for business,” said Congressman Poe. “Israel is the strongest ally America has in the Middle East. Allowing Israelis to freely visit the United States without the hassle of obtaining a visa will strengthen the bilateral relationship between our two nations. Both Israel and the United States will benefit from this common sense legislation”“Israel is not only a strong ally, but also an important trading partner with a thriving technology sector,” said Senator Wyden. “This legislation will make it easier for Israelis to collaborate with their American counterparts and to invest in the United States.”“Adding our key ally Israel to the State Department’s Visa Waiver Program will help the economies of both the U.S. and Israel,” said Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. “It would make travel to the United States by Israeli citizens easier and thus increase tourism and strengthen the already strong ties between our nations. We must be doing all we can to support Israel during these tumultuous times in the Middle East and this program is a great opportunity to demonstrate to the Israeli people and to Israel’s enemies that our friendship is stronger than ever.”“Israel is a trusted and valued friend of the United States with a vibrant economy,” said Congressman Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). “Permitting Israel to join the Visa Waiver Program has bipartisan support and will facilitate greater trade and cultural exchange between our two countries. I strongly support this legislation.” The following members joined Sherman and Poe in introducing the Visa Waiver for Israel Act: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Zoe Lofgren, Chris Van Hollen, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Ed Markey, Steve Israel, Don Young, Robert Brady, Mike Honda, Adam Schiff, Charles Rangel, Jerrold Nalder, Michael Grimm, Jan Schakowsky, Renee Ellmers, Judy Chu, Bill Keating, Mike Michaud, Trent Franks, Gene Green, Carolyn Maloney, Scott Garrett, Bill Johnson, David Cicilline, Michael McCaul, Bill Pascrell, Randy Hultgren, Mark Amodei, Rush Holt, Janice Hahn, Al Green, Jim McGovern, Frederica Wilson, Gerald Connolly, Allyson Schwartz, Ted Deutch, Leonard Lance, Richard Hanna, Doug Lamborn, Randy Weber, Juan Vargas, Dina Titus, Matthew Cartwright, Corrine Brown, Brad Schneider, Alan Lowenthal, Hakeem Jeffries, Alan Grayson, Steve Stockman. -30-

H.R. 6649, the Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2012, contains provisions that provide for the free transfer to Turkey of two Oliver Hazard Perry class guided missile frigates, the USS Halyburton and the USS Thach. Sherman highlighted how Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has threatened to accompany international flotillas to Hamas in the Gaza Strip with armed Turkish naval escorts in order to confront Israel. “Erdogan called for Israel to be punished for interfering with the previous effort to aid Hamas with the flotilla,” warned Sherman. “In September 2011, after a U.N. report on the Gaza flotilla was released, Turkey threatened to send an armed naval presence to the eastern Mediterranean to confront Israel, and Prime Minister Erdogan said that Israel should expect more naval presence from Turkey in the area,” Sherman said. In his floor speech Sherman also noted that Turkey has aggressively threatened legitimate Cypriot and Israeli efforts to cooperation on energy exploration. Ankara has boosted Turkish armed naval presence around the natural gas fields between Israel and Cyprus and declared “invalid” an agreement between Cyprus and Israel on demarcating their respective energy exploration areas.

The bill passed the House by a unanimous voice vote. “This common-sense, overdue legislation makes a minor change to our banking laws to revise a very costly and unnecessary rule that requires financial institutions such as community banks and credit unions to send each of their customers a copy of their privacy policy every year, regardless of whether the policy has changed or there is any new information for the consumer,” said Sherman. “This pointless act costs these businesses millions of dollars each year — dollars they can now invest in new loans and better service for their customers.” Currently, financial institutions are required to mail annual privacy notices to all of their customers explaining their information sharing practices. Financial institutions are required to send these notices each year, even if nothing about their privacy policies has changed. At best, this is an unnecessary and wasteful use of resources. At worst, it could cause consumers to assume they can routinely ignore notices that may contain information about important changes. H.R. 5817 would require institutions to provide information to their customers only if there has been a change in any policy or practice related to the privacy of the customer. This bill would eliminate the millions of costly, confusing, and often ignored mailings that cost millions to produce each year. As a result, information included in mailings would likely be more significant to the consumer because they would come only after a change in policy. Sherman continued, “Simply put, this bill is a win-win that improves customer awareness and reduces costly regulatory burdens for credit unions, banks and other financial institutions. I hope the Senate follows our lead by quickly passing the Eliminate Privacy Notice Confusion Act and sending it to the President’s desk to be signed into law.” -30-

Washington, DC – Last night, Congressman Brad Sherman was presented the Mkhitar Gosh medal at a Congressional celebration of the 21st anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh. Earlier this year, President Serzh Sargsyan of Armenia awarded the Mkhitar Gosh Medal to Sherman for his efforts to enhance U.S.-Armenian relations and to achieve international recognition of the Armenian Genocide. Mkhitar Gosh was an important Armenian scholar, clergyman, and codifier of the Armenian civil and canon laws. Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has been leading efforts since 1997 to provide U.S. aid to the people of Artsakh. Earlier in the day, Sherman also met with the Foreign Minister of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, Karen Mirzoyan, to discuss ways to expand cooperation between the U.S., Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh.The following are excerpts of Sherman’s remarks at the celebration last night: “I thank the President of the Republic of Armenia, Serzh Sargsyan, for honoring me with the Mkhitar Gosh medal in recognition of my efforts to expand U.S.-Armenia ties and recognition of the Armenian Genocide.Thank you, Ambassador Tatoul Markarian, for this award. I am privileged to receive this honor. I would like to recognize and thank the esteemed Foreign Minister of the Nagorno Karabakh Republic, Mr. Karen Mirzoyan, for joining us tonight. Congratulations to you and your citizens on the 21st anniversary of Artsakh’s independence. On December 10, 1991, Nagorno Karabakh held an independence referendum and overwhelmingly voted for independence.Today we celebrate Artsakh's freedom and independence. Artsakh continues to strengthen its democracy and held its fifth presidential election this year. The election in July 2012 was monitored and deemed free and fair by international observers. Despite Azerbaijan’s deeply unjust blockade and a devastating war in from 1991 to 1994, Artsakh continues to solidify its democracy and improve its economy. Nagorno Karabakh has been successful in its transition from a state-run economy to a market economy, which helped achieve steady economic growth.I was the first member of Congress to introduce legislation for direct aid to Nagorno-Karabakh. In 1997, I introduced an amendment during the House International Relations Committee’s consideration of a foreign aid authorization bill for fiscal year 1998 for direct US humanitarian aid to Nagorno Karabakh. While this amendment did not pass, it accelerated the movement for direct U.S. aid to Artsakh.In September 2012, I backed Nagorno-Karabakh’s efforts to reopen the airport in Stepanakert. The opening has been delayed several times. Unfortunately, officials in Baku have threatened to shoot down civilian planes traveling to Stepanakert. It is time for that airport to open. I condemn Baku’s pardoning and freeing of an Azeri axe-murderer, Ramil Safarov , who was imprisoned in Hungary for killing an innocent Armenian officer in his sleep in Budapest. We must hold Azerbaijan accountable for this grave injustice.Thank you.”-30-

Sikhs are a very peaceful and tolerant community, but violence against Sikh-Americans has, sadly, risen dramatically since 9/11.”“I have always backed stronger U.S. government action to protect Sikhs and prosecute hate crimes,” Sherman continued. “Less than a month after 9/11, I joined my colleagues in introducing a resolution to condemn bigotry and violence against Sikh-Americans in the wake of the terrorist attacks. The community is highly susceptible to violence because of their appearance. Most recently, in April of this year, I joined with my colleagues in sending a letter to the Department of Justice urging the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to begin collecting data on hate crimes committed against Sikh-Americans. Today, I join with the entire nation in calling for the FBI to do a complete and thorough investigation of the tragic events in Wisconsin.” --30--

The project was delivered under budget by $61.6 million and months ahead of schedule. “Orange Line commuters can now travel 18 miles from Chatsworth to North Hollywood with stops at important activity centers along the route,” said Congressman Sherman. “We should now focus our efforts on building a grade-separated transit system through the Sepulveda Pass connecting the San Fernando Valley with the Westside. Ultimately, we need to develop a system that can rapidly connect transit riders from the Orange Line to the Westside Subway Extension in Westwood and eventually south to LAX,” added Sherman.Congressman Sherman has urged local transportation officials to develop alternatives to improve transit through the Sepulveda Pass, connecting the San Fernando Valley and Westside of Los Angeles. Sherman is also working to secure federal funding to assist Metro in developing alternatives for the Sepulveda Pass Corridor project. Funding of $1 billion was allocated for this project in Measure R. On June 20, 2012, Metro staff released an interim planning study highlighting some of the proposed alternatives that will be further studied in an alternatives analysis.Following the opening of the Orange Line in 2005, Sherman urged the Metro Board of Directors to develop plans and dedicate resources toward the extension of the Orange Line north along the Metro-owned railroad right-of-way parallel to Canoga Avenue.Congressman Sherman secured funding in previous federal transportation bills to assist with construction of the 14-mile Orange Line and the Warner Center Transit Hub, as well as a new entrance to Pierce College from the Winnetka Station to help students that use the busway to easily access the campus. -30-
06.29.2012	Washington DC - Today, Congressman Sherman (D –CA) helped prevent student loan interest rates from doubling. Without Congressional action, almost eight million undergraduate students would have seen the interest rates on their need based student loans double from 3.4% to 6.8%. This would have cost the average borrower more than $2,800 in additional interest payments. The College Cost Reduction Act extension includes provisions that extend for an additional year the 3.4% interest rate for new federally subsidized student loans. Subsidized student loans are necessary for many students and families paying for higher education. “Our nation should invest in helping young Americans gain the skills and training needed to be successful in our 21st century economy. I remain committed to finding a long-term solution that helps working families avoid large interest rate increases and additional ways to keep college costs from spiraling further.” Since coming to Congress, helping students and families manage the cost of a higher education has been a top priority of Congressman Sherman. In 2012, Sherman supported increasing the maximum Pell grant amount from $4,050 in 2006 to $5,550. Sherman also helped enact the American Opportunity Tax Credit which provides a $2,500 tuition tax credit to eligible students, and loan forgiveness programs for graduates in public interest careers after 10 years, and everyone else after 20 years. -30-
06.28.2012	Washington D.C. Congressman Brad Sherman (D- San Fernando Valley) issued the following statement commending Chief Justice John Roberts and the Supreme Court in their decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act:“Today Chief Justice Roberts provided a well-reasoned legal analysis based on precedent. In doing so, he helped bolster confidence in the United States Supreme Court, while dispelling the view that all controversial cases are decided on party lines. In his opinion, he noted that every reasonable construction of a statute must be considered, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality. He then showed that for over 100 years the Supreme Court has looked at the substance of an enactment to determine whether it is a tax, rather than whether Congress chose to label the enactment a tax. He then demonstrated that taxes designed to influence behavior are hardly new, and that some of the very first taxes enacted by the Federal Government were designed to deter the purchase of imported manufactured goods in order to foster the growth of domestic industry. In fact almost every tax influences behavior, and often influencing behavior is the primary intent. For example, cigarette taxes are designed to reduce smoking as much as they are to provide revenue. Roberts then pointed out that the payment due from those who do not purchase health insurance is not a punishment to be imposed on “outlaws.” Rather it is estimated that 4 million people every year will choose to pay the IRS rather than buy insurance and that those people are acting reasonably and lawfully—they are not wrongdoers being punished. Finally Roberts pointed out that Congress’ power to regulate commerce is more restricted than its power to impose taxes, but even its power to impose taxes is not unlimited. Here the tax must be paid by those not buying insurance is not so punitive that Congress has effectively used the tax power to compel. Rather Congress has imposed a system in which it is estimated that 4 million people will decide to pay the tax. Today I am proud to be a member of the Harvard Law School class of 1979, the class that included Chief Justice Roberts.”-30-
06.11.2012	CALABASAS, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) joined former Congressman Tony Beilenson, as well as federal, state and local park officials to celebrate the grand opening of the Anthony C. Beilenson Visitor Center at King Gillette Ranch in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains.“Nearly thirty-four years ago, Congressman Beilenson helped pass federal legislation to establish the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,” said Congressman Sherman. “During his tenure in Congress, Tony Beilenson secured more than $151 million in federal funding to protect thousands of acres of pristine habitat, connect new parkland acquisitions through an expanding trail system and create the largest urban national park in the country.” “Because of Tony Beilenson’s legacy, millions of visitors to the Santa Monica Mountains now have the opportunity to learn about the national recreation area’s significant archeological, historical and cultural resources at the new visitor center and they can discover dozens of parks, more than 500 miles of trails and world-renowned beaches, ” added Sherman.Congressman Sherman has been the leading champion in Congress to help secure federal funds for key parkland acquisitions in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, such as Zuma and Trancas Canyons and Malibu Creek, as well as completing construction of the 65-mile Backbone Trail. In 2005, Sherman directed $2.5 million of the funding he helped secure for trail development in the Santa Monica Mountains toward the acquisition of King Gillette Ranch. He also helped convince the Bush and Obama Administrations to prioritize funding for local plans to construct an interagency visitor center at this historic property in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act provided $9.5 million in funding for the construction of the visitor center – the first visitor center in the National Park Service to produce all of its own energy needs. King Gillette Ranch was acquired for $35 million in 2005 through a partnership between federal, state and local agencies, as well as private donors. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park providing a variety of outdoor activities for 35 million annual visitors.-30-
05.22.2012	60 Members Sign on Letter to FASBWashington DC - Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman, CPA (D-Sherman Oaks), and Republican Congressman John Campbell, CPA (R-Newport Beach), both senior members of the House Financial Services Committee, have sent the attached letter to the Financial Standards Accounting Board (FASB) urging a careful rethinking of proposed rule changes that, if enacted, could have disastrous consequences for American businesses and the real estate industry. Sixty members of Congress from both sides of the aisle signed the letter. “As one of only a few certified public accountants (CPAs) in Congress, and a co-founder of the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional CPA and Accountants Caucus, I have a unique understanding and the utmost respect for FASB’s independent process for developing sound accounting standards,” said Sherman. “That’s why I helped lead this effort in Congress to make sure that FASB carefully considers the potential consequences of this proposal.”Under a recent FASB and International Accounting Standards Boards’ (IASB) joint lease accounting proposal (File Reference: No. 1850-100, Leases (Topic 840)), U.S. companies that lease office, industrial, and retail space would be required to capitalize the costs of their leases—just as if they purchased the property—onto their balance sheets. Currently companies record the costs of their leases as a business expense.An independent study estimated that this change will add over $1.1 trillion in leased real estate assets and liabilities onto businesses’ balance sheets.“Investor protection and financial disclosure are always paramount,” said Sherman. “However, forcing companies to capitalize the full value of their leases will explode many companies’ balance sheets overnight, especially small businesses, who already book their leases as an expense on financial statements. Capitalizing these leases will throw off debt-to-capital ratios, ruin credit ratings and force many companies to pay higher interest rates. As a result, most companies will naturally try to reduce the size of their leases by shortening leasing terms, which will increase costs for real estate owners and managers forced to renegotiate complex leases every 6 or 8 months.”The Sherman-Campbell letter insists that FASB undertake and publish a comprehensive study of the costs of this proposal before any final action is taken.Read the Full Letter Below:May 22, 2012Ms. Leslie Seidman, ChairmanFinancial Accounting Standards Board401 Merritt 7, P.O. Box 5116Norwalk, CT 06856-5116Dear Chairwoman Seidman,Accurate and transparent financial reporting is the cornerstone of global capital markets. We believe that a formal and open cost-benefit analysis should be an integral part of the financial reporting standard setting process.Nonetheless, we are very concerned with the unintended economic consequences of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Boards’ (IASB) joint lease accounting proposal (File Reference: No. 1850-100, Leases (Topic 840)) and subsequent updates to this exposure draft. According to a recent study released by Chang & Adams Consulting, the current lease proposal would negatively impact job creation, the health of the U.S. commercial real estate sector, loan covenant agreements, and liabilities of U.S. publicly traded companies.The report analyzes the current lease proposal under a best case scenario estimated its economic impacts as: (1) increasing liabilities for public companies by $1.5 trillion; (2) increasing costs to U.S. public companies by $10.2 billion annually; (3) potentially leading to job losses of over 190,000; (4) reducing U.S. household earnings by $7.8 billion annually; and (5) lowering U.S. GDP by $27.5 billion each year.The results of the Chang & Adams study, along with others, indicate the need for FASB and IASB to fully analyze the economic ramifications of lease accounting rule changes. Real estate is the cornerstone of our economy; however, the commercial real estate market continues to be negatively impacted by high unemployment levels, low consumer confidence, falling property values, and a contraction in lending. A further disruption of this market will have serious negative consequences.Furthermore, we believe it is imperative that FASB and IASB undertake and publish an all-inclusive economic impact study before any final action is taken on the lease accounting proposal. The study should examine all potential economic consequences for businesses that own, invest, and rent commercial real estate. This should include, but not be limited to possible effects, such as higher rents, further reduced property values due to shortened lease terms, administrative costs and problems resulting from obscured financial reporting, which were not calculated under the Chang & Adams study. Additionally, the potential increase on borrowing costs for all commercial real estate participants as well as the financial and regulatory impact on lending institutions must be fully examined. Finally, field testing should be undertaken to identify any further potential economic consequences before the proposal is finalized, as well as in the pre and post implementation phases of the final standard.Thoroughly vetted and sound accounting standards are needed to create certainty in the marketplace for investors and businesses alike. A comprehensive examination of the costs and benefits should be a part of that process.Sincerely,John Campbell, CPA Brad Sherman, CPAMember of Congress Member of Congress CC: The Honorable Mary L.

05.21.2012	The “Visa Waiver for Israel Act” Facilitates Israel’s Entry into the Visa Waiver ProgramWashington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced the Visa Waiver for Israel Act, a bill allowing Israel’s entrance into the U.S. Visa Waiver Program. Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX) and the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), joined with Sherman to introduce the Visa Waiver for Israel Act. The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals from certain countries to enter the U.S. as temporary visitors for tourism or business for up to 90 days without obtaining a visa from a U.S. consulate abroad. “I’m pleased to join with my colleagues Ted Poe, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and eleven additional members of Congress to introduce the Visa Waiver for Israel Act,” said Sherman. “Israel is our closest friend and democratic ally in the Middle East. Adding Israel to the Visa Waiver Program will boost business, tourism, and job creation here in the U.S. and enhance cultural ties between our two nations.” The Embassy of Israel released a statement in support of the legislation, “The Embassy of Israel welcomes the introduction of the Visa Waiver for Israel Act, initiated by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) with the support of lead co-sponsor Rep. Ted Poe (R – TX). This act would stimulate numerous business endeavors, and help promote closer cultural, economic, and touristic ties. The passage of this legislation would further strengthen the special and deep relationship between Israel and the United States.”There are 36 countries currently in the Visa Waiver Program, including western and central European countries, as well as South Korea, Japan, Brunei, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2010, 17.1 million visitors entered the United States under the Visa Waiver program, constituting 42% of all overseas visitors. Israel is one of the “road map countries” which are most interested in joining the Visa Waiver Program and have been in discussions with the U.S. Departments of State and Homeland Security to join the program since 2005. “Almost one-third of a million Israelis entered the U.S. as temporary visitors annually in recent years,” continued Sherman. “Each had to get a US visa through a bureaucratic process that sometimes takes weeks. The number of Israeli visitors would increase substantial if Israel enters the Visa Waiver Program. That means more business, tourism, academic and cultural exchanges, and most importantly, job creation. This is an important way to further strengthen ties with our close friend and ally in the Middle East – Israel.” The legislation contains counter-terrorism and information sharing provisions, and would ensure that Israel adopts biometric travel documents prior to being admitted to the program. In addition to Chairman Ros-Lehtinen, Sherman and Poe were joined by Representatives Charles Rangel, Edolphus Towns, Steve Rothman, Bill Pascrell, Shelley Berkley, Eliot Engel, Michael Grimm, Mazie Hirono, Rush Holt, Aaron Schock, and Robert Dold in introducing the bill. -30-
05.11.2012	Urges LAUSD to Restore FundingWASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) again urged the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) to restore funding for the adult education program and identify options to preserve the program for thousands of students and teachers in the San Fernando Valley and throughout Los Angeles. In January, Sherman wrote to the LAUSD Board of Education to express his concerns with the plan to eliminate the program.“I understand the predicament the Board of Education faces in making program and staffing cuts to close the budget deficit,” said Congressman Sherman. “But I am concerned that the cuts go too far in eliminating a program that provides important educational opportunities for those earning a high school diploma or seeking new job skills.” “I hope the LAUSD Board and district staff can find ways to preserve the program and hundreds of jobs or we could risk losing it and other programs forever, even if the budget outlook improves in the future,” added Congressman Sherman.Due to a looming budget deficit totaling $390 million, LAUSD has proposed eliminating the adult education program, among other program and staffing cuts in the 2012-13 budget.The full letter to the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education and Superintendent is below:May 10, 2012Dr. John DeasyLos Angeles Unified School DistrictBoard of Education 333 South Beaudry Avenue, 24th FloorLos Angeles, CA 90017Dear Board Members and Superintendent Deasy:I am writing to urge the Los Angeles Unified School District to restore the adult education program. Although the proposed budget seeks to eliminate the adult education program, I firmly believe that there are compelling reasons to restore funding for this program, which provides basic education and career training services to thousands of students in the San Fernando Valley and throughout Los Angeles.Earlier this year, I wrote to you expressing my concerns with the district’s plan to eliminate the adult education program. I continue to receive letters from students, faculty and staff at adult education sites throughout the San Fernando Valley asking for LAUSD’s support to restore funding for this program.I understand the LAUSD budget situation and will continue to fight in Washington for all of the programs that provide federal aid to the district. However, hundreds of students, teachers and administrative staff are interested in hearing from the district about what options exist to restore the adult education program if the budget outlook improves, new revenue sources are identified or fees are increased. I am concerned that once the program is eliminated, the district will not restore any programs and hire new teachers in the future if and when the budget outlook improves. The same can be said for many other programs and teaching positions that will be eliminated by the budget.I strongly urge the Los Angeles Unified School District to reconsider its decision to eliminate the adult education program. This program serves countless individuals of all ages and backgrounds seeking educational opportunities that otherwise would not exist in their communities. I look forward to hearing from you and district administrators about viable options to help restore the adult education program, particularly after the Governor’s May Revision is released. Sincerely,BRAD SHERMANMember of Congress-30-

05.09.2012	Campbell-Sherman Amendment ensures entities seeking financing from the Ex-Im bank are not in violation of U.S. sanctions on IranWashington DC - Congressman Brad Sherman today released the following statement on the passage of the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) Reauthorization Bill, H.R 2072: “I am pleased that the House finally took this important step to support U.S. exports. This bill will help U.S. manufacturers and the American workers they employ to counter the subsidization of exports and domestic industry that our trade competitors undertake on behalf of their firms. Ex-Im is the most important export promotion program we have, and it deserves our support. “The bill would increase the cap on the amount of credit that the Bank can extend in support of U.S. exports, which will enhance our ability to boost American employment through exports. The bill wisely avoids any mandate that U.S. content requirements be lowered for exports supported by the Bank. Quite simply, lower U.S. content means more foreign content in “American-made” products and fewer U.S. jobs. “I also commend the authors of the bill, and the full committee chair and ranking member, for working with me, Congressman John Campbell, and Senate counterparts on a compromise version of the Campbell-Sherman amendment on Iran. “After enactment of this legislation, all major firms involved in an Ex-Im supported transaction will have to certify that they, and any firms they control, do not conduct activities that violate several sanctions statutes and regulations. We need to use every available point of leverage to convince multinational corporations to cease remaining business they may have with Iran. This bill will ensure we do that with respect to Ex-Im assistance.” When the legislation was considered by the House Financial Services Committee in June 2011, Campbell and Sherman offered an amendment on Iran that was adopted by the Committee. Section 18 of the bill represents an agreement reconciling Campbell and Sherman’s amendment with a similar proposal put forward by Senators Robert Menendez and Mark Kirk. -30-
04.30.2012	Valley team wins second consecutive National TitleSHERMAN OAKS, CA – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) congratulated the Granada Hills Charter High School Academic Decathlon team after defending their National Title at the 31st Annual U.S. Academic Decathlon Competition in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Last month, Granada Hills Charter High School won the 2012 California Academic Decathlon to advance to the national finals.

04.27.2012	Washington DC – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA), reintroduced the “Too Big to Fail, Too Big to Exist Act,” (HR 4963) in the 112th Congress. The legislation was cosigned by Congressman Maurice Hinchey (D-NY). Senator Bernie Sanders (I –VT) introduced similar legislation in the Senate during the last Congress. Under this legislation, any institution that is too big to fail will be broken up and reorganized to avoid more Government bailouts and future risk to our economy. “Too big to fail should be too big to exist,” said Congressman Sherman who has advocated this position since 2008. “Never again should a financial institution be able to demand a federal bailout. They claim; ‘if we go down, the economy is going down with us.’ By breaking up these institutions long before they face a crisis, we ensure a healthy financial system where medium sized institutions can compete in the free market.” Sherman continued, “No longer should giant financial institutions be able to get low-cost capital by telling investors that even if the institution is mismanaged and faces financial default, by virtue of its sheer size it will be able to obtain a bailout from the federal government. Every financial institution should compete for capital based on the soundness of its balance sheet, and no financial institution should be able to claim that there is a special federal safety net available to its investors because of the institutions sheer size.”“Most of the huge financial institutions still standing have become even bigger -- so big that the four largest banks in America (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup) now issue one out of every two mortgages; two out of three credit cards; and hold $4 out of every $10 in bank deposits in the entire country,” said Senator Sanders, when he introduced his version of the legislation last Congress.“If any of these financial institutions were to get into major trouble again, taxpayers would be on the hook for another massive bailout. We cannot let that happen. We need to do exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did back in the trust-busting days and break up these big banks.”This legislation would require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit to Congress a list of all commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies that the Secretary believes have become too big to fail. Those entities deemed too large would then be broken up in a managed process of reorganization, so a single failure would no longer cause a catastrophic effect on the United States or global economy without a taxpayer bailout. ‘‘Too Big to Fail’’ refers to any entity that has grown so large that its failure would have a catastrophic effect on the stability of either the financial system or the United States economy.During consideration of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Sherman strongly supported an amendment offered by Rep. Paul Kanjorski that gave federal regulators the authority, but not the obligation to break up the largest banks and other financial institutions that impact every facet of our economy. Thus far federal regulators have not taken that step to protect our economy. By mandating that these massive entities be reorganized, the “Too Big to Fail Act” is the next logical step in the process of eliminating the unwanted risk massive financial firms pose to our economy.-30-

04.26.2012	Washington DC - On Thursday, April 26, 2012 Congressman Brad Sherman of the San Fernando Valley, an active member of the U.S.-Philippines Friendship Caucus, met with Jose L. Cuisia, Jr., Ambassador to the United States from the Philippines.The Ambassador thanked Congressman Sherman for his co-sponsorship of the Filipino Veterans Fairness Act. This bill would make Filipino Veterans of World War II fully eligible for the benefits received by all US Veterans, and widows and children of Filipino Veterans would be eligible as well. About a quarter million Filipinos volunteered to fight alongside US troops in World War II and President Franklin D. Roosevelt promised them all of the benefits given to all others serving in the US military.Ambassador Cuisia also thanked Congressman Sherman for cosponsoring a resolution, H.Con.Res 18, which urges President Obama to return two church bells taken by the US army from the town of Balangiga to the Philippines. These bells were taken by a US Infantry Regiment as trophies of war in 1901. Finally, the Filipino Ambassador thanked Congressman Sherman for the legal work on behalf of the Aquino government which was successful in getting the financial records of former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, which lead to the recovery of millions of dollars by the Filipino government.They also discussed new economic initiatives to benefit both the United States and the Philippines.Congressman Sherman urged Ambassador Cuisia to visit the San Fernando Valley both to strengthen economic ties, and to strengthen the cultural ties between the over 10,000 Filipino Americans of the West San Fernando Valley and their homeland. -30-

The Mkhitar Gosh medal is named for the noted 12th century Armenian clergyman, writer, and codifier of the Armenian civil and canon laws.Armenian Ambassador Tatoul Markarian presented Congressman Sherman the medal at a Capitol Hill reception to commemorate the Armenian Genocide. Hundreds of Armenian-Americans gathered at the event in recognition of the 97th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Upon receiving the award, Congressman Sherman reaffirmed his commitment to advancing the interests of the Armenian-American community and strengthening US-Armenia ties. “I am honored to receive this award, and I thank President Sargsyan for this honor,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is my great privilege to work so closely with the Armenian-American community and advocate on behalf of the U.S.-Armenia relationship.”“As a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I will continue to fight for recognition of the Armenian Genocide, and defend U.S. assistance to Armenia and Artsakh. The United States has always been a strong supporter of Armenia, and I will keep working hard to make sure that friendship and partnership grows even further.”Congressman Sherman represents California's San Fernando Valley, an area which is home to a large and vibrant Armenian-American community.Read Sherman’s Full Statement on US-Armenia Issues:Recognition of the Armenian Genocide During World War I and its aftermath, the Ottoman Empire attempted to destroy the Armenian population of Eastern Anatolia. Congress should remember this tragic event and proclaim that the Armenian Genocide is a fact. Unfortunately, there are many who deny that the first genocide of the 20th Century actually took place. It is long overdue that Congress be on the right side of this issue and affirm what history has shown to be true. Since going to Congress in 1997, I have cosponsored every resolution commemorating the Armenian Genocide. In March 2009, my colleagues and I introduced a resolution calling for the U.S. to recognize the Armenian Genocide. In March 2010, the House Foreign Affairs Committee voted on this resolution.The resolution passed narrowly, by just one vote, with a final tally of 23 to 22. At the vote, I stressed that the last act of any genocide is genocide denial, and the first act of preventing the next genocide is to acknowledge past acts of genocide. There is no doubt about the historical reality of the Armenian Genocide, and this resolution should have passed by a larger margin. I fought diligently to bring the Armenian Genocide Resolution to a vote on the House floor before the closing of the previous two-year session of Congress in December 2010. I brought the case for recognition to many members of Congress, in order to achieve a majority of votes. Unfortunately, the House leadership at the time decided to not bring the resolution to a vote on the floor.America should never be associated with genocide denial. The victims of the Genocide deserve our remembrance and recognition. It is in our national interests to remember the past and learn from these crimes against humanity to ensure that they are never repeated.I joined with other members of Congress to introduce the new Armenian Genocide Resolution now pending before Congress. I will not give up this fight and will continue to organize efforts in Congress to ensure that we bring the Armenian Genocide Resolution to a successful vote on the House floor.Increased Assistance to JavakhetiWe should provide a robust U.S. aid package for Georgia that includes significant assistance to the Javakheti region to support that region’s infrastructure and job creation needs. I believe that our aid programs in Georgia, while supporting development throughout the entire country, should include a robust package for this relatively underdeveloped area of Georgia. U.S. aid to the Javakheti region focuses on agricultural modernization, social development, health projects, and improved infrastructure. Increased U.S. aid to the region helps increase the quality of life for ethnic Armenians living there. Recently, I met with the Georgian Ambassador to the U.S. to discuss the U.S. aid package to Georgia and targeted aid to Javakheti.I also raised the Javakheti issue with the Administration. During a February 29, 2012, hearing with Secretary Clinton on our foreign affairs budget for 2013, I advocated for increased U.S. assistance to the Javakheti region in the south of Georgia. Javakheti is one of the poorest and least developed regions of the Republic of Georgia, and has a large Armenian community. Noting the generous U.S. aid provided to Georgia, I requested that the Armenian community residing in the Javakheti region of Georgia directly benefit from increased U.S. assistance to that area. I also recently pressed USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah on the difficult economic conditions facing this region and his efforts in conjunction with the Armenian-American community to focus U.S. assistance to the area. I joined my House colleagues in a request to House Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations Chairwoman Kay Granger and Ranking Member Nita Lowey urging that U.S. assistance to Georgia in 2013 be targeted (at least 10% of aid to Georgia) toward job creation efforts in Javakheti.Aid for Armenia and ArtsakhSince 1993, Congress has provided about $2 billion in assistance to Armenia. This funding has helped Armenia make the transition from a state-run to a free market economy, build democratic institutions, and provide for the needs of the Armenian people. As a leading member of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, I have fought against cuts in aid to Armenia, year after year. In the President’s most recent budget request for 2013, he called for $36.6 million in assistance to Armenia. This is, unfortunately, a 17% decrease in aid to Armenia from current funding levels. I am requesting along with my colleagues that the Appropriations Committee provide no less than $50 million aid to Armenia in 2013. I have been an outspoken voice in support of increased humanitarian aid to Nagorno-Karabakh. While Congress has appropriated over $46 million in humanitarian and development aid for Nagorno-Karabakh since 2004, the State Department has unfortunately not expended the funds Congress has provided for the people of Artsakh every year. I am strongly supporting efforts to require the State Department to expend the aid that Congress provides to Nagorno-Karabakh. Recognizing the Sumgait, Kirovabad, and Baku Massacres In addition to leading efforts in Congress to get recognition of the Armenian Genocide, I have also recognized other, more recent massacres against Armenians. On February 29, 2012, I solemnly marked the massacre of Armenian civilians in Azerbaijan with a House statement for the record. On the evening of February 27, 1988, a three-day rampage against Armenian civilians living in Sumgait, in Soviet Azerbaijan, began. Armenian civilians were maimed, raped, beaten, and burned alive at the hands of rioters.The Sumgait Pogrom was, sadly, only the beginning. Despite international condemnation of the pogrom in Sumgait, another anti-Armenian pogrom occurred later that year in Kirovabad, Azerbaijan, from November 21st to 27th. Due to the brutality, the Armenians of Kirovabad and the surrounding areas were forced to flee their homes. Another crime against humanity occurred yet again from January 13th to the 19th, in 1990. Members of the Armenian community of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, were assaulted, tortured and killed again by violent mobs. The ethnic-cleansing of the Armenians from Azerbaijan must not be forgotten. Additionally, the United States must to do more – we need to demonstrate to Azerbaijan that the United States is committed to peace and to the protection of Artsakh from coercion. Azerbaijan should cease all threats and acts of coercion against the Republic of Nagorno Karabakh. The fact that we must educate others about the victims of the Sumgait, Kirovabad, and Baku massacres demonstrates that the world has not learned the lessons of the Armenian Genocide. If we hope to stop future massacres and conflicts, we need to acknowledge those horrific acts of the past and make sure they do not happen again. -30-
04.25.2012	Washington DC – Today, during a hearing of the Capital Markets Subcommittee, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA) questioned Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Schapiro on efforts to require greater disclosure and more effective dissemination of information about publically traded companies that conduct business with sanctioned State Sponsors of Terrorism, especially Iran. Sherman urged that the SEC put back in place a web-based system to allow investors to easily search SEC filings for disclosures by companies detailing business relationships with these sanctioned countries. That web-based tool, which was implemented four years ago, was terminated by Schapiro’s predecessor after companies complained that the information being made available was “defective.” “It was taken down at least in part because it was too successful,” Sherman said. “Any real problems with the system should have been fixed by now and it should be back up and running – this needs to be done as soon as possible.” Sherman further noted that in July 2010 testimony Chairman Schapiro promised that the SEC would take steps to educate investors about the dangers of investing in firms that conduct business with Iran and other sanctioned countries. “The capability for investors to quickly search SEC fillings would be an extremely effective way to help educate them,” Sherman said. Sherman also noted that the House has passed the Iran Threat Reduction Act by a wide margin, and this legislation will likely be enacted this year. The bill would require greater disclosure by companies regarding their business relationships with Iran. Sherman also called for the SEC to takes steps in anticipation of the new law to ensure that business relationships with Iran be considered “material information” that must be disclosed. “Companies that do business with Iran, particularly with the government of Iran, particularly in areas of strategic significance, not only undermine American foreign policy, but also expose their shareholders to risk -- namely the risk that the firms will be sanctioned.”Sherman is an original cosponsor of the Iran Threat Reduction Act, and is the author of several of its provisions. Chairwoman Schapiro noted in response that the SEC staff has begun working on a rule to require better disclosure of firms’ business in or with Iran as part of their regular fillings with the Commission. -30-
04.25.2012	Metro Seeking Federal Grant to Study AlternativesWASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) urged Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood to support a grant application submitted by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) to develop alternatives to improve transit through the Sepulveda Pass, connecting the San Fernando Valley and the Westside of Los Angeles. “The Sepulveda Pass Corridor is the vital link between the housing-rich San Fernando Valley and the jobs-rich Westside of Los Angeles, yet our region lacks a rapid transit option for thousands of commuters hoping to bypass traffic in this heavily congested corridor,” said Congressman Sherman. “The alternatives should include a rapid transit system linking the Orange Line with the proposed Westside Subway Extension, and eventually extending those connections north and south along the 405 freeway between the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).”Funding of $1 billion was allocated for this corridor in the “Measure R” sales tax measure that was approved by the voters of Los Angeles County in November 2008. The Sepulveda Pass Corridor is one of twelve transit projects funded by “Measure R” and is included as part of the America Fast Forward Initiative, which will help major metropolitan areas like Los Angeles accelerate construction of transportation improvement projects through federal financing tools.Several project alternatives are also being considered, including rail transit and bus rapid transit. The Alternatives Analysis will also explore elevations and routes for multimodal options through the Sepulveda Pass.The full letter to the U.S. Department of Transportation is belowApril 24, 2012The Honorable Ray LaHoodSecretaryU.S. Department of Transportation1200 New Jersey Avenue, SEWashington, DC 20590Re: Sepulveda Pass Corridor Alternatives AnalysisDear Secretary LaHood:I am writing to express my support for the application submitted by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) to prepare an Alternatives Analysis for the proposed Sepulveda Pass Corridor project. Metro is embarking on a bold plan to improve transit connectivity between the housing-rich San Fernando Valley and the jobs-rich Westside of Los Angeles via the Sepulveda Pass and link the Metro Orange Line (busway) with the planned Westside Subway Extension, as well as other regional transit corridors within the study area.The Sepulveda Pass is the main corridor linking the San Fernando Valley with the Westside of Los Angeles, as well as two of the most heavily congested freeway interchanges in the nation (US 101/I-405 and I-10/I-405). The study corridor is approximately 30 miles in length and extends from the I-5/I-405 Junction to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). I urge the U.S. Department of Transportation to consider Metro’s application for federal funding to prepare the Sepulveda Pass Corridor Alternatives Analysis. Your contribution to this project will help accelerate our regional goal of linking the San Fernando Valley and the Westside of Los Angeles with a rapid transit option, while developing innovative methods to finance construction and operations of a viable alternative and improving traffic flow along one of the busiest highway corridors in the nation.Thank you for your ongoing efforts in improving mobility for millions of residents in Los Angeles County.Sincerely,BRAD SHERMANMember of Congress-30-
04.23.2012	White House Names Local Burbank Teacher as the 2012 Teacher of the Year Washington DC - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman called to congratulate Rebecca Mieliwocki, a local Burbank teacher who was named 2012’s Teacher of the Year. The Council of Chief State School Officers announced that Rebecca Mieliwocki, a 7th grade English teacher in California is the 62nd National Teacher of the Year. Mieliwocki, along with all 2012 State Teachers of the Year will be recognized by President Barack Obama in a ceremony at the White House, on Tuesday, April 24. “I am thrilled that the 2012 Teacher of the Year is right here in Burbank,” said Congressman Sherman. “Rebecca Mieliwocki is an inspiration to us all. I had an opportunity to congratulate Rebecca today and look forward to congratulating her in person in my office tomorrow. When I spoke to her, her enthusiasm for teaching was infectious. I commend not only Ms. Mieliwocki, but all other teachers across our country who have dedicated themselves to one of the most noble and important jobs in our society. I look forward to joining everyone in celebrating this outstanding award at Luther Burbank Middle School on April 30th." Rebecca Lynn Mieliwocki is a seventh grade English teacher at Luther Burbank Middle School, which houses 1100 students. She has been teaching for 14 years and has spent 9 years in her current position. Rebecca holds a Bachelor of Arts in Speech Communication from California Polytechnic State University. She received the PTA Honorary Service Award in 2009 and served as a teacher expert for CSUN College of Education Panel titled "Managing the Paper Load." A child of two veteran public school teachers, Rebecca shied away from becoming a teacher early in life, but realized that there is "no nobler profession" than teaching. Her own K-12 teachers serve as her heroes and she models her teaching style on the example they set for her. She works hard to provide her students with an exciting and dynamic lesson that is both educational and amusing-because her students learn better in this environment. She believes strongly in the importance of good teacher preparation programs and values the teaching profession as a sought-after career. "Rebecca is the kind of teacher that students look back on and say “She changed my life,” said Luther Burbank Middle School Pricipal Brian O'Rourke. "Rebecca teaches because it is a calling for her and her passion for students is an integral part of who she is." "Students learn best when they have the most enthusiastic, engaged teachers possible," says Mieliwocki. “I firmly believe that teachers must be held accountable for their students’ success, from helping them meet personal or school-wide learning goals to achieving on district and state level assessments. Our students are our future, so we, their teachers, must do our best to inspire them and guide them to greatness." -30-
04.16.2012	Sherman Announces How Los Angeles Residents Can Find Out If They Have Unclaimed Tax RefundsWASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D - Sherman Oaks) announced that 4,176 taxpayers in Los Angeles County are owed $6,722,735 in tax refunds. In many instances, the United States Postal Service was unable to deliver refund checks due to mailing address errors. In an effort to assist taxpayers in collecting their tax refunds, Congressman Sherman has posted a list of Los Angeles County residents who are owed a refund for their 2010 taxes on his web page, BradSherman.house.gov.“For a struggling family, a thousand or even a few hundred dollars can help with the costs of housing, food, medicine and other important provisions,” said Congressman Sherman. “If there is any chance you have an unclaimed refund, check out our website to see if you’re on the list and learn how to contact the IRS to collect your refund.”In California, the top three undeliverable refunds average $36,900. The average 2010 tax refund check was $1,610 in Los Angeles County. This information is also listed at BradSherman.house.gov. The Internal Revenue Service owes refunds to 869 residents in the San Fernando Valley, but their checks were returned to the U.S. Postal Service because some families moved without leaving a forwarding address or the IRS found errors in the taxpayers’ favor, but could not locate the people owed the unexpected windfalls.If a taxpayer moves after filing his or her tax return and doesn’t leave a forwarding address, the Postal Service returns the check to the IRS. If a person changes his or her name, perhaps after marriage, and doesn’t notify the Social Security Administration of the name change, then their Social Security number will not properly match in IRS computers. This can slow or prevent the transfer of old refund checks to them. And, in the case of deceased taxpayers, some families and executors of estates may not know that they had an unclaimed refund.California taxpayers should also check with the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) for unclaimed refunds by visiting www.ftb.ca.gov/online/refund. Congressman Sherman represents half of the San Fernando Valley. Before he was elected to Congress in 1996, Sherman, a certified public accountant, was chairman of the California State Board of Equalization – the nation’s only elected tax commission and America’s second largest tax agency.Congressman Sherman Assists Local Valley Residents at a free tax clinic at Pierce College To help assist taxpayers collect their refund, Congressman Sherman has posted a list of all Los Angeles County residents who are owed a refund for their 2010 taxes on his web page.

04.02.2012	Congressman Sherman Presents Steven Ryu with the Congressional Award Bronze Medal at Town Hall Meeting in Lake BalboaLake Balboa, CA – On Sunday, April 1st, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall meeting at Birmingham High School, fielding questions from some of the 200 constituents who attended. Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine and Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich also made appearances at the Town Hall and spoke to the audience about local Valley issues.Congressman Sherman has held over 160 Town Hall meetings during his time in Congress in a variety of formats, including visiting virtually every public and private high school and middle school in the San Fernando Valley. Sherman’s staff has also hosted over 100 information booths at various community fairs, senior centers, veterans’ organizations, cultural and religious festivals, and farmers markets to share information about his constituent services program. On Sunday, Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including, taxes, the national debt, education, Social Security and Medicare as well as other issues facing Congress. Sherman highlighted his continued work to resolve the nation’s debt crisis, restore faith in the economy and help put Americans back to work. Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies.Sherman also had the honor of bestowing the Congressional Award Bronze Medal to Steven Ryu, of Granada Hills Charter High School, who completed over 100 hours of Voluntary Public Service. Every year Congressional Awards are given to outstanding youth throughout the country to recognize individuals who excel in volunteering, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition. Steven helped supply donated food and other goods to those in need by volunteering with the food bank operated by the Cathedral Center of St. Paul. For his Personal Development component, Steven improved his violin skills and earned the first violinist position for the Valley Philharmonic Orchestra. For Physical Fitness, he completed over 50 hours of Kendo practice in which he obtained his second degree black belt. “Town Hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Sherman. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents, helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.”Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

04.02.2012	Washington DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, issued the following statement regarding new sanctions on Iran’s central bank:“Last week, President Obama took bold action against Iran, providing the required certification under Section 1245 of the National Defense Authorization Act concerning world oil supply. Within a few months, foreign banks face tough penalties if they process transactions for oil sales involving the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). This action will force Iran’s remaining oil customers to further curtail their purchases and seek greater discounts. Known as the Menendez-Kirk Amendment, the legislation is having a direct impact on Iran’s government revenues from oil, and it is the boldest single sanction against Iran we have applied thus far. President Obama and his administration should also be commended for their effective diplomacy on isolating Iran as they have implemented the major legislation passed by Congress in 2010 and late 2011. Europe has imposed an oil embargo effective in July of this year and no longer allows its banks to do business with the CBI. Other allies are curtailing their business relationships with Iran to an unprecedented degree. There is real pressure on the Iranian government now. Unfortunately, that pressure is still insufficient. Therefore, we must enact stronger sanctions legislation soon. The action is now in the Senate, where legislation authored by Senators Johnson and Shelby awaits floor action. I urge the Senate Leadership to work to strengthen the excellent Johnson-Shelby bill before it is passed by the Senate. In particular, I urge Senate Leadership to allow a version of an amendment authored by Senator Kirk to be considered by the Senate. I introduced similar legislation in the House, along with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. This legislation, called the Iran Financial Sanctions Improvement Act, will close a number of gaps in our existing sanctions. It will ensure that all of Iran’s banks are cut off from the financial system, not just those that have been designated. It will ensure compliance by all banks by requiring them to report to Treasury periodically on their Iran business. It would sanction any firm that handles assets for the CBI, and has provisions that would target firms that provide insurance for sensitive business with Iran. After the current district work period the Senate should pass the toughest possible Iran legislation, and it is critical that the Kirk-Sherman language be part of the bill when it leaves the Senate.” -30-
03.21.2012	Annual Appropriations Request Spearheaded by Sherman Includes Widest Support YetWashington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, along with Congressmen Eliot Engel, Robert Dold, Aaron Schock, and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Mark Kirk, and Ron Wyden, led a request to the House and Senate Subcommittees on Energy and Water for $2 million for the U.S.–Israel Energy Cooperation Program. The appropriations request this year included the highest number of signatories – 34 Members of Congress and 10 Senators – since the creation of the program in 2008. Sherman noted the importance of the American-Israeli cooperative program. “This is a significant step in our efforts to strengthen ties with our ally Israel,” said Sherman. “I am pleased that so many of my colleagues in both chambers of Congress support this effort. Our national security and energy independence goals depend on the development of alternative energy technologies. Funding for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program has already accelerated innovative projects in green energy.”The funding would be the fourth appropriation for the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program since its inception in 2008 if approved by the Appropriations Committee later this year. The total amount appropriated for this program since its creation is $6 million. The Israeli government matches U.S. appropriations on a one-for-one basis. Additionally, the program has leveraged over $12.5 million in private sector cost-share since 2008. Six cooperative projects are currently underway, high efficiency solar wafers and cells, solar thermal plant design, smart grid systems for residential and commercial buildings, and advanced laser technology to facilitate wind speed and power output forecasting in wind. Separately, cooperation is underway involving several Israeli and U.S. universities throughout the country. “Israel and the United States already have a long track record of successful, cooperative research in several fields such as medicine, biotechnology, computer programming and hardware, and agriculture,” Sherman added. “This program is a great way to leverage a modest investment in alternative energy and efficiency, to the benefit of both countries. We will continue to work together to promote energy security and job creation.”Congressman Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2005, along with former Congressman John Shadegg and Congressman Eliot Engel. Congress passed this legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, and the bill was signed into law by the President in December 2007. -30-
03.08.2012	Sherman Introduces New Provisions to Expand Sanctions and Penalties on to all Iranian BanksWashington DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, introduced new legislation, the Iran Financial Sanctions Improvement Act, with several new provisions to tighten international financial pressure on Iran’s banking sector. The bill is cosponsored by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. Senator Mark Kirk (R- IL) is expected to introduce similar measures in the Senate. The bill would expand current efforts to sanction the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) unless it discontinue the practice of allowing Iranian banks to utilize its communications services. Currently, the European Union is considering measures to prevent SWIFT from doing business with some Iranian banks, reportedly only the Central Bank of Iran and other “designated” Iranian banks. Sherman’s new legislation applies to all Iranian banks – the bill would sanction the SWIFT network as long as it conducted services on behalf of any Iranian bank. SWIFT handles secure communications between banks internationally, sending payment orders that are settled through accounts that the banks have with each other. Every time banks make payments for one of their customers to an account in another bank, they utilize the SWIFT system. Iran’s banks would find it very difficult to process most transactions without the benefit of the system, and trade with the outside world would become even more cumbersome for Tehran. These provisions included in this bill will be introduced in the Senate as an amendment to the Iran Sanctions, Accountability and Human Rights Act of 2012 by Senator Mark Kirk.“As Tehran brazenly continues its pursuit of a nuclear weapon, we need to leave no stone unturned in our effort to financially pressure and isolate Iran,” Sherman said. “If Iran cannot process payments with SWIFT members, Iran will find that its remaining trading partners either give up entirely, or will demand more in payment for what they send to Iran, or demand to pay less for what they buy from the Iranians.” Sherman is also the lead Democratic cosponsor of legislation already introduced in the House, H.R. 3880 that would penalize the SWIFT network if it does not stop doing business with Iranian banks.Sherman’s new bill would also similarly expand Section 104 of CISADA, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act, which provides for sanctions against financial entities that engage in transactions with designated Iranian banks. The new bill would apply this provision to all Iranian banks – not just those that are designated by the Treasury Department.Another provision in Sherman’s sanctions bill would expand the Menendez-Kirk provision in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that targeted the Central Bank of Iran (CBI). The new bill would expand the NDAA provisions to sanction not only those companies that facilitate transactions on behalf of CBI, but also those who hold financial assets on behalf of CBI. A 2009 court decision revealed that an American bank had been ordered to freeze almost $2 billion worth of debt securi¬ties belonging to Iran. The funds were at the bank in the name of Clearstream, a Luxembourg-based clearinghouse and bank owned by the Deutsche Börse Group. Under the new bill, these types of activities on behalf of CBI would be subject to stiff penalties. Additionally, the new Sherman bill contains provisions to clarify the imposition of current sanctions law to cover the provision of insurance or underwriting for any sanctionable act with regard to business with or in Iran would be subject to sanctions themselves. “We must expand financial sanctions against the Iranian banking sector to include all Iranian banks – not just the Central Bank of Iran and those roughly twenty banks already designated by the Treasury Department,” continued Sherman. “I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to confer quickly once the Senate passes it’s bill and send the toughest possible Iran sanctions bill to the President that puts increasingly pressure on Iran’s faltering economy,” said Sherman. “We cannot relent as long as Tehran is full speed ahead towards a nuclear weapon.”-30-
03.08.2012	Congressman Sherman Receives Humane Champion Award from Wayne Pacelle Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman today received the Humane Champion Award from the Humane Society of the United States. This is Congressman Sherman’s fifth consecutive Humane Champion Award. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on an animal welfare issues and for his consistently perfect score on the Humane Society’s Legislative Scorecard. The Humane Society was particularly appreciative of Sherman’s leadership in introducing the Sportsmanship in Hunting Act (H.R. 2308), which would create a federal prohibition on Internet hunting and establish penalties for those who violate the prohibition. The legislation was strongly supported by the Humane Society. “Congressman Sherman has been a prominent voice in the U.S. Congress for safeguarding animals against abuse and advancing their protection,” said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. “We are deeply grateful for his being such a stalwart champion and consistent friend in our efforts to create a more humane world.” The inhumane practice of Internet hunting, also called remote-controlled hunting, occurs when a customer uses a computer and the Internet to aim and fire a weapon that is mounted on a mechanized tripod at a remote location, usually a game ranch where the hunted animals are penned. Canned hunting, in which customers pay to shoot tame, exotic animals within the confines of an enclosure where the animals have no chance of escape, would also be banned by the bill. These practices are cruel and have no resemblance whatsoever to traditional hunting. “We thank Rep. Sherman for his outstanding work to ensure that our federal laws reflect the core humane values and attitudes of American society,” said Michael Markarian, President of the Humane Society Legislative Fund. -30-
03.06.2012	Washington D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman today mourned the passing of his friend and colleague, Rep. Donald Payne of New Jersey’s 10th District.“I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our friend and colleague Donald Payne. He was a great champion of human rights both at home and abroad. He was a force for good in the world, who used his knowledge and expertise for positive change. He will be remembered as both a leader on education and an outspoken advocate to end global suffering, particularly for his work on HIV/AIDs in Africa.We will miss his presence in Congress and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who loved him.”-30-
02.29.2012	Washington DC - In separate hearings today with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA) urged both officials to work to oust Iran from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) in advance of legislation currently under consideration by in Congress that would sanction the bank network if it continued allow Iranian banks to utilize its communications services. In response to Sherman’s questioning, Secretary Clinton said she believed that “using the SWIFT system is a very effective way of utilizing the financial system to further isolate Iran” and that “we will engage with the Federal Reserve” to provide them with guidance on the issue. Earlier, Bernanke noted that the Fed is one of the supervisors of SWIFT and that it would be feasible for the Fed to work successfully to prevent the network from handling communications for Iranian Banks. Bernanke’s comments were in response to Sherman’s question.“In response to my question, Bernanke said he was confident that the Fed could act successfully to exclude Iranian banks from SWIFT, but he wanted input from those responsible for U.S. foreign policy,” said Sherman. “That’s why it was important for me to get Secretary Clinton to endorse excluding all Iranian banks from SWIFT when she testified later that afternoon.”SWIFT handles secure communications between banks internationally, sending payment orders that are settled through accounts that the banks have with each other. Every time banks make payments for one of their customers to an account in another bank, they utilize the SWIFT system. Iran’s banks would find it very difficult to process most transactions without the benefit of the system, and trade with the outside world would become even more cumbersome for Tehran. Sherman stressed with both officials that all Iranian banks, not just those currently under sanction, should be prevented from using SWIFT’s services. “We need to leave no stone unturned in our effort to economically isolate Iran,” Sherman said. “If they cannot process payments with SWIFT members, Iran will find that its remaining trading partners either give up entirely, or will demand more in payment for what they send to Iran, and demand to pay less for what they buy from the Iranians.” Sherman is the lead Democratic cosponsor of legislation introduced in the House, H.R. 3880 that would penalize the network if it did not stop doing business with Iranian banks. Similar legislation was added to the Senate’s main Iran sanction’s bill earlier in February by an amendment authored by Senator Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Roger Wicker (R-MS) in the Banking Committee.

02.22.2012	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the Obama Administration included $2.4 million in its Fiscal Year 2013 Budget to acquire and protect up to 238 acres of pristine land in Zuma and Trancas Canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. The project was one of six nationwide land acquisition priorities in the budget and the only project in California. “After years of fighting Congressional cuts to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, I am pleased that the President’s budget once again highlights the importance of acquiring and protecting land in the Santa Monica Mountains,” said Congressman Sherman. “We cannot afford to lose more land to development and the administration’s investment in the Santa Monica Mountains, if approved by Congress and signed into law, will help protect critical habitat and expand recreational opportunities for generations of park visitors.” “I am pleased to have led the effort in Washington to persuade the National Park Service, and Department of the Interior to fund this critical land acquisition. In fact, this is the only National Park Service land in California requested in the President’s budget.” In December 2011, Congressman Sherman wrote to the Secretary of the Interior and the National Park Service Director to urge the administration to include three land acquisitions in the Santa Monica Mountains in the Fiscal Year 2013 Budget. A copy of Congressman Sherman’s letter can be found below. Sherman also hosted Interior Secretary Ken Salazar during a visit and tour of the Santa Monica Mountains on July 9, 2010 as part of President Obama’s America’s Great Outdoors Initiative, to promote and support efforts to conserve outdoor open spaces and to reconnect Americans to the outdoors. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park providing a variety of outdoor activities for over 33 million annual visitors. Congressman Sherman has secured nearly $20 million in federal funding to acquire and preserve critical open space in the Santa Monica Mountain, including King Gillette Ranch and Zuma and Trancas Canyons, as well as complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. Sherman was also instrumental in helping secure federal funding for the construction of the Anthony C. Beilenson Visitor Center at King Gillette Ranch, which is set to open to the public in June 2012. Read the Full Letter Below December 1, 2011 The Honorable Ken Salazar Mr. Jon Jarvis Secretary Director, National Park Service U.S. Department of the Interior U.S. Department of the Interior 1849 C Street, NW 1849 C Street, NW Washington, DC 20240 Washington, DC 20240 Dear Secretary Salazar and Director Jarvis: I am writing to urge the U.S. Department of the Interior and the National Park Service to include three critical Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) acquisitions within the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (SMMNRA) in the President’s Fiscal Year 2013 Budget. The President’s Fiscal Year 2012 Budget included $3,043,500 to acquire up to 350 acres of pristine habitat in Zuma and Trancas Canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. While I am hopeful that Congress will ultimately fund a portion of the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 request for LWCF, I would like to call your attention again to three important acquisitions that should be included in the President’s Fiscal Year 2013 Budget. The acquisitions include parcels near Malibu Creek and in Zuma and Trancas Canyons, as well as the Mansdorf property – the largest remaining privately owned stretch of coastline in the Santa Monica Mountains. All of these properties are included in the SMMNRA Land Protection Plan for priority acquisition due to their scenic, recreational and natural resource values. Although there are many other competing requests in the Pacific West Region and throughout the country, you both know firsthand from you experience visiting the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area that there is an imminent threat of development and a critical need to preserve sensitive habitat and recreational trails in this treasured national park unit. Moreover, these lands are immediately accessible to millions of urban residents in Greater Los Angeles, most of who have never visited a national park. I look forward to the Department’s Fiscal Year 2013 Budget recommendations and working with the administration and Congress to support these important acquisitions in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Thank you for your continued support. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMAN Member of Congress

02.07.2012	Washington DC – Congressman Sherman, a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus, issued the followed statement regarding the recent court decision on the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8: “I’m extremely pleased that the 9th Circuit court upheld the decision to find Proposition 8 unconstitutional,” said Sherman.“We should reject any law that denies certain citizens the legal rights and protections that are available to others, simply because of their sexual preference. Everyone should have the right to marry the person of their choosing. Furthermore the rights of the minority should not be voted upon. In America rights should be granted equality to all citizens across the board. I would hope this decision is upheld if an appeal moves to the Supreme Court.”-30-

The House has already passed its version of the Iran legislation, the Iran Threat Reduction Act, so we stand ready to work out the differences between the bills and send tough legislation to the president as soon as possible. However, we will need to significantly strengthen the current legislation as the process moves forward.” “We need far tougher provisions in order to more effectively address the threat posed by Iran’s nuclear weapons program.” Title III of the Senate’s bill, The Iran Sanctions Accountability and Human Rights Act of 2012, contains measures targeting the many fronts and affiliates of the IRGC and, more importantly, their international business partners. These provisions are similar to legislation first introduced by Congressman Sherman in 2009, the Iran Revolutionary Guard Designation Implementation Act, and Sherman’s subsequent Iran bill, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act of 2010. These provisions, which were co-authored by current House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, were also included in the House-passed Iran Threat Reduction Act. This House-passed legislation draws several additional provisions from the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, including measures to sanction buyers of Iranian sovereign debt, measures to prevent Iran from buying spare aircraft parts, and provisions authorizing states to take measures against Iran’s business partners. -30-
01.25.2012	Reseda, CA – On Saturday, January 21st, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall meeting at Reseda High School, fielding questions from some of the nearly 400 constituents who attended.Congressman Sherman has held over 150 Town Hall meetings during his time in Congress in a variety of formats, including visiting virtually every public and private high school and middle school in the San Fernando Valley. Sherman’s staff has also hosted over 100 information booths at various community fairs, senior centers, veterans’ organizations, cultural and religious festivals, and farmers markets to share information about his constituent services program. On Saturday, Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues including, taxes, the national debt, education, Social Security and Medicare as well as other issues facing Congress. Sherman highlighted his continued work to resolve the nation’s debt crisis, restore faith in the economy and help put Americans back to work. Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies.“Town Hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Sherman. “These meetings are something I have always done, and will continue to do in the future. Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents, helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.”Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.--30--

12.19.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman introduced the Libyan Assets Taxpayer Reimbursement Act, a bill that will require that funds of the Gaddafi family and regime frozen by the United States be used to defray the cost of U.S. military actions and humanitarian aid benefiting the Libyan people. Congressman Dan Burton (R-IN) joined Sherman in introducing the bill. According to the Treasury Department, the U.S. has frozen roughly $37 billion in assets in the U.S. owned by the late Gaddafi and his now-deposed regime. Since April, Congressman Sherman has repeatedly urged that these frozen funds be used to defray the cost of U.S. military actions benefiting the Libyan people.Under the bill, a small portion of these frozen funds would be used to compensate the American taxpayer for the full cost of our military operations and recent humanitarian efforts on behalf of the Libyan people. Additionally, the assets could be used to provide for the full compensation of American victims of Gaddafi terrorism.“American taxpayers should not be liable for the bill when about $37 billion of Gaddafi assets is available to pay for the NATO operation and humanitarian assistance,” said Sherman. Libya is an oil rich country: in 2010, Libya had one of the world’s highest per capita oil export revenues. According to the Energy Information Administration, Libya has the largest proven oil reserves in Africa. Around the world, over $150 billion of Gaddafi assets are frozen, and the vast bulk of this amount will be paid to the new Libyan government.The Administration puts the cost of our military and humanitarian efforts for the Libyan people at just under $3 billion. Thus, under this bill, the vast bulk of the $37 billion frozen in the U.S. would still be turned over to the new government of Libya. In May of 2011, Congressman Sherman met with Dr. Mahmoud Jibril, now interim Prime Minister of Libya, in Washington D.C. and urged him to formally adopt a resolution in the Transitional National Council ensuring that funds of the Gaddafi family would be used to pay for American military actions. Sherman also urged Dr. Jibril to identify all persons who have supported al-Qaeda or the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and fought American troops in Afghanistan or Iraq, and bar those terrorists from service in the military or civilian operations of the Transitional National Council of Libya.Congressman Sherman is the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. -30-
12.15.2011	House of Representatives Passes Comprehensive Bill Targeting Iran’s Nuclear Program, Energy Sector, and Revolutionary Guard Corps Washington, DC – Today, the House of Representatives passed two major sanctions bills targeting Iran for greater economic and diplomatic pressure, and strengthening the nonproliferation regime against Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Both bills, sponsored by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, included major provisions authored by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Last Spring, Congressman Sherman joined with Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and others in introducing both bills. The House voted to pass the Iran Threat Reduction Act by a vote of 410 to 11. The House also voted to pass the Iran, North Korea Syria Nonproliferation Reform and Modernization Act by a vote of 418 to 2. Sherman is the lead Democratic sponsor of the latter bill. “We have to create a circumstance where the regime in Tehran has to choose between its nuclear weapons program and regime survival,” said Congressman Sherman. The Iran Threat Reduction Act includes several important portions put forward by Congressman Sherman and which were originally included in the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act he first introduced in 2010: • Requiring an expedited campaign at the Treasury Department to sanction the hundreds of front companies and agents that operate on behalf of the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and provides for tough sanctions against foreign companies that do business with them.• Sanctioning the purchase or issuance of Iranian sovereign debt, including government bonds or bonds issued by a state-controlled firm.• Effectively ending the “Halliburton loophole” by sanctioning parent companies for the activities of a foreign subsidiary that would violate current U.S. sanctions. • Requiring the State Department to better define and publish the types of goods, services, and technologies that enable Iran to disrupt the flow of information and monitor and crush dissent in its population, and whose transfer to Iran will cause the company in question to be sanctioned by the U.S. The Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Reform and Modernization Act improves existing law targeting firms and countries that assist these countries’ nuclear and other advanced weapons programs. Sherman is the lead Democratic sponsor of this legislation.“Iran, Syria, and North Korea continue to work together to threaten U.S. interests and allies around the globe,” said Sherman. “A U.N. report in May of this year revealed that North Korea and Iran have been routinely sharing prohibited ballistic missile technology in breach of U.N. sanctions. This bill will provide our government with better tools to address this proliferation threat.” The bill includes provisions authored by Congressman Sherman that would provide for sanctions against firms that provide Iran, North Korea or Syria with equipment or technology relevant for mining or milling uranium. Iran is facing a uranium shortage, and has been searching for foreign sources of uranium, as well as trying to improve its domestic capability to mine uranium. Under the bill, anyone that assists in either effort would be subject to penalties. This provision was first introduced by Sherman in 2009 in the International Uranium Extraction and Milling Control Act and was also in the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act he introduced in 2010. -30-
12.06.2011	Washington DC – Following a hearing on Congressional insider trading in the House Financial Services Committee, Congressman Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement.“The STOCK Act may be a good start to curb unethical insider trading, but more ought to be done. I have not traded individual stocks while serving in Congress, and I believe other Members should be discouraged from, perhaps prohibited from, holding and trading individual stocks.” -30-
12.01.2011	Earns 100% Rating From Planned Parenthood, NARAL, HRC, Sierra Club & Brady CampaignWashington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks, CA) released a series of statements regarding his work in Congress on the following issues: safeguarding reproductive freedom, protecting the environment, controlling guns, preventing discrimination against the LGBT community and protecting civil liberties.Congressman Sherman has earned a 100 percent rating from the following organizations: (1) Planned Parenthood(2) NARAL Pro-Choice America (3) The Sierra Club(4) The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence(5) The Human Rights CampaignRead Congressman Sherman’s Full Statements:Safeguarding A Woman’s Right to Choose • Blocking Attacks on Planned Parenthood“The Republican majority has targeted Planned Parenthood Federation of America by attempting to cut off its federal funding. None of the federal funds received by Planned Parenthood are used for abortion services, instead the federal funds are used to provide services including cancer screenings, breast exams, HIV testing and contraception. I voted against these efforts and am pleased that Planned Parenthood is still able to receive the federal funding it deserves.” • Increasing Funding for Title X Family Planning“The Title X Family Planning Program provides grants for voluntary family planning and related preventative health services. I have consistently supported increasing funding for Title X and fought against attempts to cut its funding.”• Opposed the Stupak Amendment in Health Reform Bill“During House consideration of the health care reform bill in 2009, Congressman Bart Stupak offered an amendment that would bar women who receive federal health insurance subsidies from buying a health plan with abortion coverage. I voted against the Stupak amendment. A weaker version of this amendment was included in the final health care reform bill, which I will work to remove to ensure that women have full access to health care plans that cover the range of reproductive health services.”Protecting the Environment• Supporting the American Clean Energy and Security Act (Sometimes called Cap and Trade)“I voted for the American Clean Energy and Security Act (H.R. 2454) which passed the House in 2009. This historic legislation was an important effort to help America achieve energy independence and fight global warming. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act on this important legislation and, given the partisan climate in the House of Representatives, it is unlikely that a new version of this bill will be considered this year.”• Improving Vehicle Mileage & Reducing Greenhouse Gasses“I introduced the Right to Clean Vehicles Act to force the EPA to allow California to regulate vehicle greenhouse gas emissions. Shortly thereafter, the Obama administration issued new nationwide rules designed to reach reduction levels similar to those adopted by the State of California. The new rules will be phased-in beginning with model year 2012 for cars and light trucks (pickups, vans, and SUVs) and are estimated to increase fuel economy standards to as much as 35.5 miles per gallon (mpg) by model year 2016. The Obama administration also recently announced new standards to establish a fleetwide target of 54.5 mpg by 2025.”Controlling Guns• Ensuring the Most Dangerous Weapons Stay off the Streets“There is no legitimate reason to allow the sale of “cop-killer” handguns, assault weapons, and sniper rifles. However, instead of protecting our law enforcement personnel, Republican leadership has blocked legislation that would ban the Five-SeveN handgun – a gun which can shoot bullets to penetrate a bulletproof vest from over 200 yards. To protect our officers, I am again joining with my colleagues to introduce the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act, which would ban the Five-seveN pistol and its ammunition.” Equality for the LGBT Community• Ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell“On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act, which I strongly supported. The repeal of DADT will be fully effective on September 20, 2011. In a great victory for equality and civil rights, any qualified American who wishes to serve will finally be able to do so without fear.”• Protecting Students from Bullying“Many LGBT students face daily harassment from their peers and even teachers. I have again joined with my colleague Rep. Jared Polis to introduce the Student Nondiscrimination Act (H.R. 998). This bill would prohibit public schools from excluding students from participating in, or subjecting students to discrimination under, any federally-assisted educational program on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill is now being considered by the House Education and the Workforce Committee, and I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that it becomes law.”Protecting Civil Liberties• The PATRIOT Act“On May 26, 2011, I voted against a bill (S. 990) providing for a four-year reauthorization of three troubling provisions of the PATRIOT Act, and I have voted against similar reauthorizations in the past. Unfortunately, the bill passed by 250-153, and has been signed into law.” • Preventing Torture“I have consistently supported legislation to prevent torture. Soon, I will again be joining with my colleague Rep. Jerrold Nadler to introduce the American Anti-Torture Act, which would prohibit all employees of the U.S. government (not only our military, but also the CIA, contractors, and all other federal employees) from using torture in interrogations.”-30-

Throughout my term in Congress, I have worked to support U.S. friendship and increased cooperation with Israel, our only close ally in the Middle East. “ Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement on US-Israel Relations: Urging UN Member States to Vote No on Unilateral Palestinian Statehood Recently, I wrote to Permanent Representatives from 81 countries to the United Nations to oppose a unilateral attempt by the Palestinians to declare statehood at the UN this month. The 81 countries, from every corner of the world, are the likely "swing states" (out of 193 total UN member states) that are not firmly decided on the issue. I asked the UN ambassadors not to support this pending resolution, but to “cast a vote instead for the principle of peace through negotiations." Israel’s Ambassador to the US, Michael Oren, personally expressed his appreciation for my efforts. In the letter, I warned that Palestinian efforts to achieve statehood unilaterally through a UN resolution could have dire consequences for the Middle East peace process. The unilateral Palestinian move violates the all-important principle that the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through negotiations leading to a peace treaty fully accepted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In addition to my own letter to 81 UN Ambassadors, I signed onto a similar letter spearheaded by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer to approximately 40 European heads of state who are wavering on whether to stand with the US and Israel on this issue. the matter is pending at the UN. Regardless of the outcome there, I will continue to battle against efforts to de-legitimize Israel. Increasing Economic and Diplomatic Pressure on Iran Iran remains the number one state sponsor of terrorism. I reintroduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act in April of this year. My new bill is the toughest Iran sanctions bill ever introduced. Among the provisions of the bill, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act would impose sanctions on companies that provide Iran with financing by paying in advance for future oil deliveries, or that sign long-term deals with Iran for sales of oil or gas. It would also target firms that help Iran borrow funds on world markets. It would target companies that do business with Iran’s radical Revolutionary Guards, an elite army that controls much of Iran’s economy and exports terror abroad. The bill would also sanction firms that provide Iran with equipment or technology relevant to mining uranium.Securing Continued Aid to Israel In 2008, the US and Israeli governments announced a new 10-year aid program that will ensure that Israel retains an edge in military strength over its adversaries. Under this new arrangement, aid will be increased from the $2.4 billion provided in military assistance in 2008 to an average $3 billion per year over the 10 years covered by the plan. I am pleased to report that Congress provided the full $3 billion in security aid to Israel for 2011. While it will be necessary to trim federal spending in many areas, including on foreign and security programs, I am fighting for full funding of our assistance to Israel, at the level of $3.075 billion for 2012, in accordance with the 10 year plan. Israel typically spends most of its aid money buying U.S.-made items. Leading the Effort to Fund U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Several years ago I wrote the US-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, which became law in late 2007. The Act provides for cooperative research between American and Israeli scientific institutions in various fields of energy. The Israeli government matches the US contribution, so that for every dollar Congress appropriates, two dollars of research is performed. For the third year in a row we were able to secure funding for research programs under the Act. Currently, six cooperative programs are underway in various fields: energy grid management, biodiesel, photovoltaic and solar micro-turbines, and other fields in which the unique talents of American and Israeli researchers offer the opportunity of genuine breakthroughs. This is another significant step in our efforts to cooperate with our ally Israel, which has a proven record of innovation in the field of energy research. Our national security depends on the development of alternative energy. Funding for the US-Israel Energy Cooperation Program has already advanced innovative new energy projects. Protecting Parental Rights Regarding Male Circumcision As many have heard, a measure had qualified for the November 2011 ballot in San Francisco which would make it illegal to perform circumcision on males under the age of 18. Efforts were begun to put a similar measure on the city ballot in Santa Monica. I regarded these measures as interferences in parental rights and an attack on a traditional religious practice of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years. The proponents of these measures made clear their anti-Semitic motivation. That is why I recently introduced the Religious and Parental Rights Defense Act of 2011, a bill to prevent San Francisco and other municipalities from banning the circumcision of males under the age of 18. Not only is the circumcision on the eighth day of life an ancient tradition of our people, modern science shows clear benefits from male circumcision. According to a United Nations study, male circumcision offers a sixty percent reduction in HIV risk. I agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics that parents should have the right to freely decide whether circumcision is in the best interest of their male children. American parents, Jews and gentiles alike, have chosen circumcision for over 75% percent of their male children. Congress has a legitimate interest in making sure that a practice that reduces disease and health care costs remains available to American parents. Moreover, Congress has acted on many occasions over the years to make sure that local laws do not interfere with the free practice of religion. My bill is still pending before the United States Congress. But its purposes have been largely achieved. Immediately after I asked him to do so, Assemblyman Mike Gatto introduced legislation protecting parental rights regarding male circumcision in the California legislature. You may remember Mike Gatto as my former District Chief of Staff who represented me at literally hundreds of events in the San Fernando Valley prior to his election to the Assembly. I’m pleased to report that Assemblyman Gatto’s bill, protecting both parental rights and religious rights, passed both the State Senate and the State Assembly and is expected to be signed by the Governor soon. Accordingly, neither San Francisco nor any other California city will be able to interfere in the rights of parents to circumcise their male children. -30-
12.01.2011	Denounces Piracy & Runaway ProductionWashington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) released a statement in support of the entertainment industry.“This year, I became the Chair of the Entertainment Industries Caucus. The Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus engages Members of Congress on issues important to the entertainment industry. It recognizes the great economic and cultural contribution of the entertainment sector throughout the country and serves as a forum to discuss and formulate innovative approaches to the challenges confronting the industry -- such as intellectual property protection, runaway production, and the development of new digital mediums.”Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement:The Performance Rights ActAs Chair of the Entertainment Industries Caucus, I have worked hard to ensure that all artists are justly compensated for their work. Unfortunately, a major loophole continues to exist in U.S. copyright law that allows broadcast radio to profit from the work of musicians played over the airwaves without providing the musicians any compensation whatsoever. Shamefully, the United States remains the only developed nation to not protect musicians in this regard. Also, because the United States does not require U.S. radio broadcasters to compensate foreign performers when they play their sound recordings, reciprocity allows foreign broadcasters to deny paying U.S. performers when they play their works in their countries. U.S. artists lose millions in potential foreign performance royalties because of our failure to update our copyright laws.That is why I have repeatedly joined with my colleagues to introduce the Performance Rights Act. The bill would simply ensure that musicians receive just compensation when a radio station airs their music. I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that musicians can rightfully earn a living from the music they create. Everyone in this country should be compensated when someone profits from their product. Fighting Intellectual Property PiracyIntellectual property theft remains a major threat to the entertainment industry. A 2007 study found that intellectual property piracy annually causes $12.5 billion dollars in losses to the U.S. economy as well as more than 70,000 lost jobs and $2 billion in lost wages to American workers. I have worked to protect the entertainment industry from the theft of the content it produces.A recent success in the fight against piracy was the passage of Prioritizing Resources and Organization for Intellectual Property Act (or otherwise known as the “Pro-IP Act”), which I joined with former Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers and others in introducing. The bill was signed into law in 2008. The legislation makes significant changes to numerous intellectual property statutes and programs, providing intellectual property owners and federal law enforcement officials with new tools to effectively pursue intellectual property theft. Federal enforcement agencies are also given a new coordinator to help streamline anti-counterfeiting efforts. I will continue to monitor the implementation of this law, making sure that enforcement efforts combat both hardware piracy (such as illegally copied DVDs and CDs) and internet piracy. On an international level, it should come as no surprise that piracy in countries like Russia and China runs rampant and the governments do little to enforce intellectual property law and treaty obligations. For example, the American film industry loses out on 90% of its estimated revenue to piracy in China. However, Canada, our friendly neighbor to the north, has actually become a major center of piracy. In fact, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has estimated that Canada has the highest level of online piracy in the world. I have been focused on drawing attention to the problem of piracy in Canada.As the Chair of the Entertainment Industries Caucus, I have sent letters with Caucus members pressing the Canadian parliament to consider new comprehensive intellectual property legislation. I have also delivered this message personally to high-ranking members of the Canadian Parliament. Particularly, I have been concerned with significant loopholes in Canadian law with regard to taking down infringing websites, like peer-to-peer websites that intentionally facilitate piracy on a massive scale. Until Canada can improve its laws and their enforcement, I will continue working with my colleagues in the Entertainment Industries Caucus to pressure Canada into modernizing its intellectual property enforcement laws. Preventing Runaway ProductionI have also been working to prevent a problem known as runaway production. In our global, competitive marketplace other countries have begun offering their own incentives to the film industry causing productions conceived in the United States to be relocated out of the country (and unfortunately out of Southern California and the Valley). This outsourcing trend which began in the late 1990s costs the United States’ economy up to $10 billion per year and has affected thousands of U.S. workers. This phenomenon not only impacts actors, studios and their employees, but also threatens the livelihood of small business people who may operate restaurants, dry cleaners, and hotels that depend on film and television production.One way of combating runaway production is through tax incentives, such as the tax deduction provision in Section 181 of the Tax Code. Section 181 allows investors immediately to write off for tax purposes the first $15 million of costs associated with certain film and television productions instead of having to deduct small portions of the cost throughout a number of years. A film only qualifies for a credit if 75 percent of the total compensation of the production is compensation for services performed in the United States by actors, directors, producers, and other relevant production personnel. The Tax Cut Compromise Bill, signed into law this past December, revived this previously expired film tax incentive, which was established in 2004. Section 181 can now be used for films produced in 2011, and can be applied retroactively to films produced in 2010. I have been a supporter of this provision since its inception, and this Congress, I will be introducing legislation to extend Section 181. It is clearly important both culturally and economically to stop runaway production. Through inattention and lack of will, it would be tragic to let this great American industry flock to other countries – who would be most happy to welcome it. As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Trade, I am particularly appreciative of former MPAA President Jack Valenti’s statement that the movie industry “has a surplus balance of trade with every single country in the world . . . No other American business enterprise can make that statement.” I look forward to working to keep this statement true by making the Section 181 incentive permanent.Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect the interests of the entertainment industry. -30-

Throughout my term in Congress, I have worked to support U.S. friendship and increased cooperation with Israel, our only close ally in the Middle East. “ Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement on US-Israel Relations: Urging UN Member States to Vote No on Unilateral Palestinian Statehood Recently, I wrote to Permanent Representatives from 81 countries to the United Nations to oppose a unilateral attempt by the Palestinians to declare statehood at the UN this month. The 81 countries, from every corner of the world, are the likely "swing states" (out of 193 total UN member states) that are not firmly decided on the issue. I asked the UN ambassadors not to support this pending resolution, but to “cast a vote instead for the principle of peace through negotiations." Israel’s Ambassador to the US, Michael Oren, personally expressed his appreciation for my efforts. In the letter, I warned that Palestinian efforts to achieve statehood unilaterally through a UN resolution could have dire consequences for the Middle East peace process. The unilateral Palestinian move violates the all-important principle that the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through negotiations leading to a peace treaty fully accepted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In addition to my own letter to 81 UN Ambassadors, I signed onto a similar letter spearheaded by House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer to approximately 40 European heads of state who are wavering on whether to stand with the US and Israel on this issue. the matter is pending at the UN. Regardless of the outcome there, I will continue to battle against efforts to de-legitimize Israel. Increasing Economic and Diplomatic Pressure on Iran Iran remains the number one state sponsor of terrorism. I reintroduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act in April of this year. My new bill is the toughest Iran sanctions bill ever introduced. Among the provisions of the bill, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act would impose sanctions on companies that provide Iran with financing by paying in advance for future oil deliveries, or that sign long-term deals with Iran for sales of oil or gas. It would also target firms that help Iran borrow funds on world markets. It would target companies that do business with Iran’s radical Revolutionary Guards, an elite army that controls much of Iran’s economy and exports terror abroad. The bill would also sanction firms that provide Iran with equipment or technology relevant to mining uranium.Securing Continued Aid to Israel In 2008, the US and Israeli governments announced a new 10-year aid program that will ensure that Israel retains an edge in military strength over its adversaries. Under this new arrangement, aid will be increased from the $2.4 billion provided in military assistance in 2008 to an average $3 billion per year over the 10 years covered by the plan. I am pleased to report that Congress provided the full $3 billion in security aid to Israel for 2011. While it will be necessary to trim federal spending in many areas, including on foreign and security programs, I am fighting for full funding of our assistance to Israel, at the level of $3.075 billion for 2012, in accordance with the 10 year plan. Israel typically spends most of its aid money buying U.S.-made items. Leading the Effort to Fund U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Several years ago I wrote the US-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, which became law in late 2007. The Act provides for cooperative research between American and Israeli scientific institutions in various fields of energy. The Israeli government matches the US contribution, so that for every dollar Congress appropriates, two dollars of research is performed. For the third year in a row we were able to secure funding for research programs under the Act. Currently, six cooperative programs are underway in various fields: energy grid management, biodiesel, photovoltaic and solar micro-turbines, and other fields in which the unique talents of American and Israeli researchers offer the opportunity of genuine breakthroughs. This is another significant step in our efforts to cooperate with our ally Israel, which has a proven record of innovation in the field of energy research. Our national security depends on the development of alternative energy. Funding for the US-Israel Energy Cooperation Program has already advanced innovative new energy projects. Protecting Parental Rights Regarding Male Circumcision As many have heard, a measure had qualified for the November 2011 ballot in San Francisco which would make it illegal to perform circumcision on males under the age of 18. Efforts were begun to put a similar measure on the city ballot in Santa Monica. I regarded these measures as interferences in parental rights and an attack on a traditional religious practice of the Jewish people for over 3,000 years. The proponents of these measures made clear their anti-Semitic motivation. That is why I recently introduced the Religious and Parental Rights Defense Act of 2011, a bill to prevent San Francisco and other municipalities from banning the circumcision of males under the age of 18. Not only is the circumcision on the eighth day of life an ancient tradition of our people, modern science shows clear benefits from male circumcision. According to a United Nations study, male circumcision offers a sixty percent reduction in HIV risk. I agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics that parents should have the right to freely decide whether circumcision is in the best interest of their male children. American parents, Jews and gentiles alike, have chosen circumcision for over 75% percent of their male children. Congress has a legitimate interest in making sure that a practice that reduces disease and health care costs remains available to American parents. Moreover, Congress has acted on many occasions over the years to make sure that local laws do not interfere with the free practice of religion. My bill is still pending before the United States Congress. But its purposes have been largely achieved. Immediately after I asked him to do so, Assemblyman Mike Gatto introduced legislation protecting parental rights regarding male circumcision in the California legislature. You may remember Mike Gatto as my former District Chief of Staff who represented me at literally hundreds of events in the San Fernando Valley prior to his election to the Assembly. I’m pleased to report that Assemblyman Gatto’s bill, protecting both parental rights and religious rights, passed both the State Senate and the State Assembly and is expected to be signed by the Governor soon. Accordingly, neither San Francisco nor any other California city will be able to interfere in the rights of parents to circumcise their male children. -30-

His steadfast opposition to efforts to privatize Social Security and a commitment to improve Medicare benefits have earned him a 100-percent rating from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Congressman Sherman's voting record is rated 100% by AARP.“All Americans should seek a comfortable retirement including IRA’s, 401(k)’s and similar accounts, said Sherman “ However, any sound retirement plan starts with an inflation-adjusted lifetime annuity -- a monthly check for life that you cannot lose, and you cannot outlive. This is what Social Security provides. We should not replace a guarantee with a gamble. I will fight plans to privatize Social Security or turn Medicare into a voucher program.” Closing the Donut Hole in Prescription Drug Coverage Previously, Medicare did not provide any coverage for prescription drug costs between $2,840 and $6,447 per year – causing a “donut hole” or coverage gap for prescription drugs. Now, thanks to legislation supported by Congressman Sherman, recipients whose drug costs fall within the donut hole are receiving a 50% discount on brand-name prescription drugs. The out-of-pocket costs for seniors’ drug costs falling in the donut hole will be further reduced incrementally until it is completely eliminated in 2020. The Republican budget plan would reinstate the donut hole. It would also repeal the new provision that provides free annual checkups without co-pays. Congressman Sherman Fighting to Protect Medicare In April, the Republican Majority in the House of Representatives passed a radical plan to eliminate Medicare as we know it and replace it with a voucher program. Seniors would use their own money, along with a government voucher to purchase insurance from private insurance companies. Congressman Sherman strongly opposes efforts to create a “voucher” system that effectively wipes out Medicare’s guaranteed health care benefits and would increase the average senior citizen’s costs by $6,300 per year, according to the Joint Economic Committee. New Threats to Social Security There are new proposals in Congress to privatize Social Security. These plans would cut future Social Security benefits and divert these savings to fund new private accounts. Because these plans would divert massive sums from the Social Security Trust Fund, it would leave the program in a deep financial hole, and likely lead to cuts in benefits. Sherman will continue to fight against any plan that privatizes Social Security or turns Medicare into a voucher program. “Social Security belongs to the people who contribute, not the government—it must not be hijacked to pay the federal debt. The money put in should be protected and used only for Social Security,” Sherman added. -30-
11.28.2011	Washington DC – Following news that Congressman Barney Frank will not seek reelection, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the Financial Services Committee released the following statement: “I didn’t always agree with him, but he was an outstanding leader for Democrats on the Financial Services Committee. He has often been acknowledged as the smartest member in the House, and he will be missed. “I hope very much that he can continue to use his considerable skills to serve the American people, perhaps in the executive branch.”-30-
11.22.2011	Washington DC – Following news that the Congressional Super committee failed to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks, CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, released the following statement: “It’s disappointing that the committee couldn’t even come up with a modest compromise to begin the process of real spending reduction and tax reform to solve our deficit problem. The fact that most Republicans have pledged to never consider revenues shows that they are unwilling to engage in real negotiations. They have pledged away their credibility. -30-
11.22.2011	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D – CA), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade released the following statement regarding announcements from the Treasury and State Department about new measures against Iran:“I applaud the Treasury and State Department for adopting additional measures against Iran today, but the measures in place are still too timid to cause the Iranians to abandon their nuclear weapons program,” said Sherman. I am pleased the President has adopted an explicit policy providing for sanctions against companies that provide goods, services and technology for -- as opposed to investment in -- Iran’s oil and gas sectors, and to provide for sanctions against those that help Iran’s Petrochemical sectors. While investment was clearly covered by the Iran Sanctions Act, whether the mere sale of goods, services and technology alone is sanctionable was left vague by the statute. This is a change I had urged during the deliberations on the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act last year, and the President finally addressed it in this new order. The designation of additional entities under the existing Executive Order targeting proliferation is also welcome, but we still have only designated a relative handful of the entities warranting such sanction. Far more is necessary. Also, foreign companies that continue to do business with those Iranian entities designated need to face tough penalties. That still is not the case under the President’s orders, but is addressed by language I authored in the legislation currently being considered by Congress. The designation of Iran under Section 311 of the Patriot Act as an area of money laundering concern could have a significant impact, but we need to actually punish those foreign financial companies that continue to do business with Iran’s banks, including the Central Bank. The action announced today will only require that US banks take greater measures to ensure that their foreign partners do not allow the Iranians to access the US financial system through them. Congress still needs to enact tough Iran sanctions legislation, sooner rather than later, including the Iran Threat Reduction Act and legislation that I introduced, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act. -30-

I am committed to achieving a solution that ultimately reduces or eliminates nighttime noise within the communities that have fought for relief for decades. This legislation will help balance the needs of aviation and those residents seeking peace and quiet in their communities. Reducing Helicopter Noise Currently, there are no official flight paths or standards for commercial helicopter operators, particularly news helicopters that hover low over Valley neighborhoods. Due to growing concerns over helicopter noise and safety, I co-sponsored the Los Angeles Residential Helicopter Noise Relief Act of 2011 to restrict helicopter flight paths and set minimum altitudes for helicopter operators in residential areas in Los Angeles County. Exemptions would be allowed for law enforcement, emergency responders and the military. Reducing Noise Impacts at Bob Hope Airport There is no reason that those who live near the Bob Hope Airport should have to endure uncomfortable noise levels when remedies exist. That is why I support efforts to impose a curfew on nighttime flights at Bob Hope Airport, and to fund and expand residential soundproofing. Over the years, the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded a total of $85.6 million in federal funds to insulate local schools and homes to reduce the impact of jet noise, including 1,800 homes in the communities within the flight path of the Bob Hope Airport. The Residential Acoustical Treatment Program at Bob Hope Airport is free to property owners in designated areas around the airport who are greatly impacted by airport noise, and it includes door and window replacement, attic insulation, weather stripping, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. While these measures have helped many, I support efforts to expand the designated area to include other homes affected by the noise. I will work to ensure that additional federal funds are allocated to this important program. Reducing Noise at Van Nuys Airport Since coming to Congress, I have taken strong positions in support of a ban of the noisiest aircraft at Van Nuys Airport in order to reduce noise over the most impacted communities in the San Fernando Valley, including Lake Balboa, Encino and Sherman Oaks. Last year, the Los Angeles City Council approved an ordinance to phase out the noisiest jets at Van Nuys Airport by 2016. As a longtime advocate of aggressive noise control measures, I encouraged the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners and the Los Angeles City Council to implement the noise ordinance. Important measures have been instituted over the last few years to help reduce airport noise at Van Nuys Airport. These include a 10:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. curfew on takeoffs from Van Nuys Airport for the noisiest jets, and a non-addition rule that prohibits additional Stage 2 jets from being based at Van Nuys Airport. I supported these noise control efforts, and will continue to support additional efforts to reduce airport noise. -30-
11.15.2011	Minibus to Restore Higher FHA Limits for High Cost AreasWashington DC – This week Congress is expected to pass legislation championed by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) to extend higher housing loan limits as part of a bill that will fund several agencies through 2012 and the rest of the government on a temporary basis. The bill, known as the “minibus conference report,” includes a provision to extend higher Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan limits for 2 years in high cost areas of the country.Congressman Sherman praised the inclusion of higher FHA loan limits, which has received bi-partisan support. “Higher FHA loan limits are critical to supporting current housing prices and our overall economic recovery, and it doesn’t cost the federal government a dime,” said Congressman Sherman. “This is the single most important provision in the minibus bill to prevent a collapse of housing prices in high cost areas like Los Angeles. I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that these loan extensions become permanent.”In 2008, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) and Congressman Gary Miller (R-Brea) were successful in a bi-partisan effort to create a high-cost area conforming loan limit capped at $625,500 in high cost areas that have median home prices above $417,000. Those limits were later temporarily increased to $729,750, thanks to the ongoing advocacy of Reps. Sherman and Miller, and their partners in Congress from both sides of the aisle.Unfortunately, the temporary $729,750 limits were allowed to expire on September 30, 2011, and the loan limits dropped overnight from $729,750 to $625,500 in high-cost areas. The compromise provision, which is expected to become law this week, will restore the $729,750 limit for FHA loans until December 31, 2013.In May of this year Congressmen Miller and Sherman introduced H.R. 1754, the Preserving Equal Access to Mortgage Finance Programs Act, legislation that makes the higher conforming loan limits permanent for Fannie, Freddie and FHA loans. Sherman also introduced similar legislation in 2009.-30-

Many people hold strong opinions about the issues currently facing Congress. Hearing from Valley residents, helps me better serve them. I want to stay up to date with what Valley residents are saying, so I can continue to fight for their needs in Washington. I would like to thank everyone who came to participate.”Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

11.03.2011	Washington DC - The House of Representatives today passed a bipartisan amendment offered by Representatives Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Stephen Fincher (R-TN) to H.R. 2930, the Entrepreneur Access to Capital Act, which creates a “crowdfunding” exemption for startup companies raising capital from small investors. The bill, which accomplishes a cornerstone of President Obama’s Startup America initiative, allows small startup companies to raise up to $2 million by cutting away the bureaucratic red tape that often prevents small companies with limited resources from seeking small investments. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, they employ nearly two-thirds of the American workforce, and the health of new small business creation is critical to our economic recovery efforts,” said Congressman Sherman. “This is a model that has shown great promise and bipartisan support as a tool to help small businesses raise startup capital and grow.”“We have to get government out of the way to allow our job creators to put more Americans to work,” said Congressman Fincher. “This is one of the best ways we can get our economy moving in the right direction. Indexing crowdfunding investment pools for inflation will ensure investment opportunities today are just as strong tomorrow. The ability to access crowdfunding capital is a useful tool for small businesses, start-ups, and entrepreneurs who are often overlooked by conventional lenders. And we all know providing capital to small businesses allows for expansion and job creation.”Previously, small businesses that wished to raise startup capital through small investments were burdened by complex paperwork and regulatory burdens. This bill makes it easier for small businesses to raise money through independent investors that meet certain standards for investors’ protections. The Sherman/Fincher Amendment ensures that this policy will remain available for future generations by indexing the contribution limits in the bill to inflation, to make sure the $2 million allowed today remains worthwhile to future entrepreneurs.-30-
11.02.2011	House Foreign Affairs Committee Approves Comprehensive Bill Targeting Iran’s Military, Energy Sector, and Nuclear ProgramWashington, DC – Today, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs passed two major sanctions bills targeting Iran for greater economic and diplomatic pressure, and strengthening the nonproliferation regime against Iran, North Korea, and Syria. Both bills, sponsored by Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, included major provisions authored by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA). The Committee voted to pass the Iran Threat Reduction Act and the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Reform and Modernization Act. Congressman Sherman is the lead Democratic cosponsor of the latter bill. “I urge the House leadership to swiftly bring this important legislation to the House floor for passage,” said Sherman. “We must send a tough message to Tehran: stop your nuclear weapons program, or else face serious economic consequences. We must send a tough message to Iran’s remaining business partners: stop doing business with Tehran or you will be forced to stop doing business in the United States. Sanctions have had some impact on Iran’s economy – as Ahmadinejad recently admitted – but we need to ramp up the pressure much more and fully enforce all Iran sanctions passed by Congress.” Sherman is the Ranking Democratic Member on the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House. The Iran Threat Reduction Act is a comprehensive bill tightening sanctions against the Iranian government, military, and energy sector. The bill includes several important portions authored by Congressman Sherman: • Requiring an expedited campaign at the Treasury Department to sanction the hundreds of front companies and agents that operate on behalf of the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and provides for tough sanctions against foreign companies that do business with them.• Sanctioning the purchase or issuance of Iranian sovereign debt, including government bonds or bonds issued by a state-controlled firm.• Effectively ending the “Halliburton loophole” by sanctioning parent companies for the activities of a foreign subsidiary that would violate current U.S. sanctions. • Requiring the State Department to better define and publish the types of goods, services, and technologies that enable Iran to disrupt the flow of information and monitor and crush dissent in its population, and whose transfer to Iran will cause the company in question to be sanctioned by the U.S. Sherman emphasized the importance of the provisions targeting the Revolutionary Guards. “The IRGC is the vanguard of Iranian terror abroad and a pillar of repression in Iran. It also controls a huge portion of Iran’s economy and supports Iran’s weapons programs through front companies and other shadowy relationships.” Sherman said. “If you want to hurt Iran’s efforts to proliferate and support terrorism, as well as cause general dislocation to the Iranian economy, there is no better target at this point than the IRGC and its affiliates.” The Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Reform and Modernization Act improves existing law targeting firms and countries that assist these countries’ nuclear and other advanced weapons programs. “Iran, Syria, and North Korea are proliferators of nuclear weapons technology and work together to threaten U.S. interests and allies around the globe,” said Sherman. “This bill would provide the U.S. with tools to strengthen the international nonproliferation regime against these violent, authoritarian states.” The bill includes provisions authored by Congressman Sherman that would provide for sanctions against firms that provide any of the countries with equipment or technology relevant for mining or milling uranium. Iran is facing a uranium shortage, and has been searching for foreign sources of uranium, as well as trying to improve its domestic capability to mine uranium. Under the bill, anyone that assists in either effort would be subject to penalties. In April, Congressman Sherman introduced the toughest Iran sanctions bill ever, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act. The provisions authored by Sherman in the bills approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee today are based on legislation in the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act. -30-
10.31.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, called for the enforcement of sanctions against a Chinese firm aiding Iran’s crackdown on democracy activists.According to the Wall Street Journal, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., recently signed a contract to install equipment for a system at Iran's largest mobile-phone operator that allows Iranian police to track people based on the locations of their mobile phones. The Journal also reported that the Chinese company has provided similar services to Iran's second-largest mobile-phone provider. Congressman Sherman called for the State and Treasury Departments to sanction Huawei Technologies Co., which is likely violating sanctions under CISADA, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act. “I call on the State and Treasury Departments to impose tough sanctions on Huawei Technologies, a Chinese company aiding Tehran’s brutal crackdown on pro-democracy activists, dissidents, and Iranians exercising their human right to freedom of expression,” said Congressman Sherman.Congressman Sherman and Sen. Charles Schumer authored provisions in CISADA, which was signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, that restrict the flow of dissent-monitoring technologies to Iran. Foreign entities that export sensitive technologies to Iran that restrict the free flow of information in Iran or disrupt, monitor, or restrict the speech of the people of Iran are barred from US government procurement contracts. “The case of Huawei, a Chinese company, demonstrates how Iran pays foreign companies to provide sensitive technologies to enable the regime to monitor and crush dissent through surveillance,” said Sherman. “When Iran’s people rose up against the regime’s sham elections in June 2009, Siemens enabled the brutal crackdown on anti-government demonstrators by providing mobile phone surveillance to the regime in Tehran. We need to send a strong message to foreign entities aiding Iran’s stifling of dissent by immediately slapping harsh sanctions on this company.” Huawei, reportedly linked to China’ military and national security apparatus, is one of the world's top producers of telecom equipment. The company is trying to expand in America’s telecom market as well. Huawei unsuccessfully tried to win U.S. approval for acquiring assets and server technology from 3Leaf Systems Inc. of California, last year. In April, Congressman Sherman introduced the toughest Iran sanctions bill ever, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act. Among the provisions of the bill, the legislation would definitively end the practice of American corporations conducting business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries, sanction entities that provide loans to the government of Iran, sanction firms that prepay for future Iranian oil and gas deliveries, and target the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its business partners for greater sanctions. -30-
10.27.2011	Sherman Testifies During Transportation & Infrastructure Committee Roundtable About Helicopter NoiseWASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) testified during the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee’s Aviation Subcommittee roundtable meeting in support of measures to reduce helicopter noise in residential areas of Los Angeles County. Sherman was joined at the roundtable meeting by Congressmen Howard Berman and Adam Schiff, as well as officials from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).“Excessive helicopter noise is a reasonable concern for many Valley residents, especially those that live in neighborhoods where commercial helicopter operators fly low over celebrity homes or iconic landmarks such as the Hollywood Sign,” said Congressman Sherman. “We need to give the FAA the tools to implement new standards related to flight paths and minimum altitudes to reduce overall helicopter noise pollution and ensure the safety of the helicopter operators in the busy skies over Los Angeles.” The Committee held a roundtable meeting to hear from various officials about the growing noise and safety concerns with low-flying helicopters above densely populated neighborhoods in Los Angeles County. Congressman Sherman highlighted the impact of commercial helicopter operators over neighborhoods in the San Fernando Valley, particularly in the hillside communities of Encino, Sherman Oaks, and Studio City.Congressman Sherman is a co-sponsor of the Los Angeles Residential Helicopter Noise Relief Act (H.R. 2677). The legislation requires the FAA to issue regulations for helicopter operations in Los Angeles County that include requirements relating to flight paths and minimum altitude standards with the goal of reducing helicopter noise pollution in residential areas. The bill exempts helicopter operations related to emergency, law enforcement and military activities. H.R. 2677 has garnered support from the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association and a coalition of 17 members of Los Angeles County’s Delegation in the State Legislature.-30-
10.27.2011	Washington D.C. – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Democrat of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee that deals with trade, released the following report regarding his work on trade policy: “I believe that Washington’s trade policy during the last decade took the United States’ industrial base and economy in the wrong direction,” said Congressman Sherman. “For too long, we have seen the U.S. export jobs rather than products. We can no longer afford to continue on this same path that is eroding our industrial base and hurting American working families. We must abandon the failed, so-called “free trade” policies of the past and take a new direction. We need a trade policy that creates and keeps good paying jobs here for American working families. We need balanced trade.” Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement on Trade:Testifying Before the U.S.-China Commission As the Ranking Democrat of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee that deals with trade, I have helped lead the effort to protect the American worker and our industrial base from a dangerously lopsided trading relationship with China as well as that country’s unfair business practices. I testified before the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission on May 4, 2011. I spoke to the Commissioners about how damaging the US-China trade relationship is to the American economy and the need for serious policy changes. Additionally, I explained to the Commission how the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) would harm American economic and national security interests. To see my testimony, please visit my YouTube page at www.youtube.com/ShermanCA27. In 2000, we were promised that a permanent trade agreement with China would lead to economic growth here at home. The advocates of Most Favored Nation status for China promised that we would see more jobs for Americans, free trade, and a decline in our trade deficit with China. Instead, China has abused the trading relationship, engaging in abuses ranging from currency manipulation to piracy of intellectual property. Of course, there are many pro-KORUS FTA advocates promising us growth opportunities here at home. We must remember, though, that successive U.S. administrations and the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) have had a history of vastly underestimating the negative impacts that free trade agreements have on the U.S. economy. In 1999, the USITC estimated that China’s entry into the World Trade Organization would increase the U.S. trade deficit with China by only $1 billion, and have no significant impact on U.S. employment. In fact, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with China increased by $185 billion between 2001 (when China entered the WTO) and 2008. Some 2.4 million U.S. jobs were displaced or lost in those seven years. As I mentioned to the U.S.-China Commission, in debates about trade agreements in the future, we should draw lessons from the experience of making China’s MFN status permanent.Opposing the Free Trade Agreement with Korea I have been at the forefront of opposition to the Korea-US (KORUS) Free Trade Agreement. When discussing new trade agreements, we should draw lessons from our harmful trade relationship with China. The supporters of KORUS argue it will benefit the American economy. In 2010, the annual U.S. trade deficit with South Korea was $10 billion. According to the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), the KORUS FTA will increase the U.S. trade deficit with Korea by about $16.7 billion, and displace about 159,000 American jobs within the first seven years after it takes effect. This is not just an economic issue for the United States– this is a national security and human rights issue as well. Just six miles north of the demilitarized zone that separates North from South Korea, factories run by South Korean industrial giants employ 40,000 North Koreans in the Kaesong Industrial Complex. These factories plan to eventually employ several hundred thousand. These workers are not paid directly by their South Korean employers. Instead, their wages are paid to the North Korean government, which pays the workers what it chooses, sometimes as little as $8 per month. The Korea FTA’s “rules of origin” appear to allow North Korean goods to be incorporated into South Korean products and given duty-free treatment under the agreement. For example, automobiles with only 35% South Korean content would receive favorable treatment under the agreement. If the U.S. blocks automobiles with as much as 65% North Korean content from duty-free access to the U.S., we would be found in violation of the agreement as drafted. Likewise, many goods 65%-made-in-China, and 35%-made-in-South Korea, would enter the U.S. duty free. Thus goods substantially made in China would have freer access to the U.S. than those made in Britain or France. But America would gain no additional access to the Chinese market. Any trade agreement should be based on respect for the rights of the workers producing the goods to be traded. The risk of Kaesong goods entering the United States makes the KORUS FTA a bad deal for human rights as well as for economic and national security. From challenging the United States Trade Representative (USTR) on the risk of Kaesong goods entering the U.S., to writing on the pages of the Los Angeles Times, to repeated speeches on the floor of the House, I have relentlessly worked in Congress on this issue – in the interest of keeping American jobs at home. To see my speeches on the House floor on this issue, see my YouTube page at www.youtube.com/ShermanCA27. Unfortunately, the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement passed the House by a vote of 278 to 151 on October 12, 2011. I voted against the bill – and I will continue to oppose future trade agreements that ship American jobs overseas.Ending Most Favored Nation Status for China A decade ago, the United States granted China permanent Most Favored Nation (MFN) status. That was a mistake. Recently, I reintroduced legislation to eliminate Most Favored Nation status for China within six months. I first introduced similar legislation in 2010. Far too often, we see American jobs shipped overseas instead of U.S.-made products. Our trade relationship with China in particular is horrendously lopsided. We export only 24 cents worth of goods to China for every dollar of goods we import. Our trade deficit with China ballooned $189 billion in a decade – from $84 billion in 2000 to $273 billion in 2010. It is time for a change. My bill will revoke Most Favored Nation status for China six months after it is enacted and will direct the President to negotiate a new trading relationship with China designed to eliminate the trade imbalance within four years. Only under the pressure of losing access to the US market within six months will China agree to a fair and balanced trade relationship. That is why my bill provides that unless such a new trade relationship is negotiated and approved by Congress within six months, China loses its Most Favored Nation status. -30-
10.27.2011	Sherman Oaks, CA – This month, Congressman Sherman participated in AIDS Walk Los Angeles. “For many years I have been proud to participate in AIDS Walk Los Angeles,” said Sherman. This event helps provide much needed assistance to Los Angeles area residents that are living with HIV and AIDS.” Congressman Sherman and other Elected Officials at AIDS Walk Los Angles(Pictured From Left to Right: County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Executive Director of AIDS Project Los Angeles Craig Thompson, Congressman Brad Sherman, Councilmember Dennis Zine, City Controller Wendy Greuel, Congressman Adam Schiff, State Assembly Member Bonnie Lowenthal and State Assembly Member Mike Feuer)Since its inception in 1985, AIDS Walk Los Angeles has benefited AIDS Project Los Angeles (APLA), an AIDS service organization dedicated to: improving the lives of people affected by HIV disease; reducing the incidence of HIV infection; and advocating for fair and effective HIV–related public policy.-30-
10.27.2011	Washington DC – In September, Congressman Sherman (D-CA) and several other members of Congress wrote a letter to the Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) urging the IRS to treat LGBT couples in states with domestic partnership and same-sex marriage laws equitably and fairly. Currently same-sex partnerships have undue complications in filing simple tax returns because their marriages are not recognized by the federal government. The letter, which was led by Congressman Jim McDermott, was signed by a bipartisan coalition of 74 Members of Congress. “Currently, fifteen states recognize same-sex marriage or domestic partnerships with no equivalent recognition under federal law. The absence of federal recognition for these couples has created ambiguity and complexity in the tax law that can, in part, be mitigated through IRS action,” reads the letter. “While I believe that legislative action should be taken to fully address the inequities experienced by same-sex couples, I will continue to work with my colleagues in urging the IRS to take immediate action to reduce the unnecessary burdens faced by LGBT couples in complying with our federal tax laws. Our tax laws should be applied fairly,” said Sherman. The Text of Full Letter Follows: Dear Commissioner Shulman: We write today to bring to your attention the serious issues that registered domestic partners and same-sex married couples experienced in the 2010 tax filing season. These couples face significant complexity in filing even the most simple of returns, often resulting in improper enforcement action by the Internal Revenue Service at a considerable cost to these taxpayers and the federal government. We urge the IRS to take swift action to address these issues and ease the unequal burdens faced by these taxpayers. Currently, fifteen states recognize same-sex marriage or domestic partnerships with no equivalent recognition under federal law. The absence of federal recognition for these couples has created ambiguity and complexity in the tax law that can, in part, be mitigated through IRS action. In the 2010 Annual Report to Congress, the National Taxpayer Advocate discusses the inequities faced by these couples, and recommends the IRS publish rulings and guidance to address these issues. We ask that the IRS review these recommendations and take appropriate action to ensure that the tax law is enforced with integrity and fairness to all taxpayers. Furthermore, domestic partners living in Washington, California, and Nevada, face additional tax complexity with respect to community property. For couples living in these three states, community income and community deductions are shared equally between both partners, as required by the IRS and well established Supreme Court precedent. However, current IRS systems do not adequately link domestic partners — resulting in erroneous notices of improper reporting and the inaccurate assessment of penalties and interest. These errors are costly for the taxpayer to address, and waste significant IRS funds and resources. Now, more than ever, our tax system must be simplified for taxpayers and provide for the efficient and economical administration of our tax laws. While we believe that legislative action should be taken to fully address the inequities experienced by same-sex couples, we urge the IRS to take immediate action within its authority to reduce unnecessary burdens and ensure our tax law is applied fairly and equitably to all taxpayers. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration and committent to these issues. Sincerely, Brad Sherman (And 74 additional Members of Congress; click here to view signed letter.)
10.21.2011	Washington DC – Congressman Brad Sherman today released a statement on the death of the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and plans to introduce legislation that would use Gaddafi’s frozen assets to pay for US military actions in Libya."The people of Libya can breathe easier knowing that a cruel despot, who ruled over them for 42 years with an iron fist, has died," said Sherman. "American forces should be commended for their successful contributions to the military operations in Libya. However, American taxpayers should not be on the hook when some $30 billion is available to pay for the cost of military operations and whatever technical assistance the Libyan transitional government needs.""In February 2011, the US treasury froze nearly $30 billion of money that Gaddafi had invested in the United States,” continued Sherman. “These funds should be used to compensate the American taxpayer for US military operations in Libya and to provide assistance to the Libyan transitional government."According to the Pentagon, the Defense Department spent roughly $1.1 billion on the operation from April 1 to Sept. 30. Sherman strongly disputes this $1.1 billion dollar estimate, which does not include the cost of major operations beginning in March when operations were most intense. According to the Department of Defense, U.S. military operations from March 19 to March 29, cost $550 million, not including an F-15E aircraft that was destroyed during a mission. "These figures likely represent only the marginal cost, which drastically underestimates the full expense of the Libyan Operation," said Sherman. "The Pentagon’s estimate does not even include the cost of salaries paid to pilots flying over Libya. A calculation of the full costs, including some portion of the fixed costs of maintaining the world’s finest military, would likely yield a much higher amount – closer to $3 billion. Whatever the actual cost, we should see reimbursement from these frozen funds.""I plan to introduce legislation that would do just that - use Gaddafi’s funds to reimburse the American taxpayer the full cost of U. S. military actions in Libya."Since April, Congressman Sherman has repeatedly urged that the $30 billion of frozen funds be used to defray the cost of U.S. military actions benefiting the Libyan people.Watch Congressman Sherman’s Floor Statement on Libya from April, 2011: CLICK HERE-30-
10.21.2011	Senate Passes the Menendez/Isakson Amendment to Restore Higher Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA Loan Limits Washington DC – Today, Republican Congressman Gary G. Miller (R-CA) and Democratic Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), both senior members of the House Financial Services Committee, praised the Senate for passage of the Menendez/Isakson Amendment reinstating higher limits on loans made in high-cost areas that are purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) or that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). In 2008, Congressmen Miller and Sherman were successful in a bi-partisan effort to create a high-cost area conforming loan limit, which allowed for higher loan limits in areas that have median home prices above $417,000. Those limits, which were set at 125 percent of the area median home price, capped at $729,750, expired on September 30, 2011, and the formula for calculating each area’s loan limit dropped overnight from 125 to 115 percent of the area median home price. The maximum loan limit also decreased from $729,750 to $625,500. The Menendez/Isakson Amendment, which passed the Senate by a vote of 60-38, restored the conforming loan limits to their pre-September 30, 2011 levels.“I am extremely pleased that the Senate has recognized the importance of reinstating higher mortgage loan limits to stabilizing our nation’s housing market,” said Congressman Miller. “Allowing the loan limits to be reduced while private mortgage capital remains scarce has made it increasingly difficult for potential homebuyers in California and other high-cost areas to obtain mortgage credit. This reduction in credit availability comes at the worst possible time for our housing market. Housing is vital to our nation’s economic recovery, and we must reinstate the loan limits. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the House to send this extension to the President’s desk as soon as possible. Without it, our fragile economic recovery will be dealt a devastating blow.”“The Senate has taken a positive step to help housing prices, and I am committed to doing everything I can to push the House to support restoring the higher conforming loan limits,” said Congressman Sherman. “Increased conforming loan limits are critical to supporting current housing prices and our overall economic recovery, and they don’t cost the government a dime.”In May of this year Congressmen Miller and Sherman introduced H.R. 1754, the Preserving Equal Access to Mortgage Finance Programs Act, legislation that makes the higher conforming loan limits permanent. -30-
10.21.2011	Congressman Sherman Chats With Students at High Tech High Sherman Oaks, CA – Earlier this week, Congressman Brad Sherman spoke to the entire student body of both High Tech High School and Birmingham Charter High School in Lake Balboa. Sherman has routinely hosted town hall meetings for students during his time in Congress, including multiple events at nearly every public and private high school in the West San Fernando Valley. On Wednesday, Sherman spoke about many federal issues including education, national debt, and military academies and internship opportunities in the Congressman’s Sherman Oaks and Washington, DC offices. Sherman also responded to questions on a wide range of issues including economic policy, immigration reform, college loans and the future of the high tech job market. “It’s an honor to speak before a group of such promising young scholars,” said Congressman Sherman. “Schools like High Tech High and Birmingham Charter School are developing the type of skills that will lead American innovation into the next century. Meetings like this are critical to the public policy process. They provide an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns of young Californians, and to elaborate on the work for students that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. These students contributed to substantive conversations on a variety of issues that are important to the community. I thank all the students and faculty for their participation in the meeting.” After speaking with the students, Congressman Sherman presented the principal of High Tech High, Marsha Rybin, and the principal of Birmingham Charter, Marsha Coates, with a flag flown over the United States Capitol. Sherman also recognized Wendy Gonzalez, an exceptional student at Birmingham Charter High School, and presented her with a certificate for her outstanding dedication to the community and commending her civic engagement. Congressman Sherman directed the students to contact his Sherman Oaks office at (818) 501-9200 for further assistance with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education. He encouraged students and their families to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.

10.21.2011	Sherman Oaks, CA – On Tuesday, October 18th, Congressman Brad Sherman hosted a Middle East Town Hall meeting at Temple Judea’s Tarzana Campus with special guest Gil Artzyeli, the Deputy Consul General of Israel in Los Angeles. The meeting which was attended by over 300 people, focused on recent developments in the Middle East, including terrorism, the US-Israel relationship and Iran’s nuclear weapons program. Most of the meeting was devoted to listening and responding to questions from Valley residents.Before responding to questions, Congressman Sherman, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, briefed the attendants on his extensive work on issues concerning the United States’ relationship with countries in the Middle East.“This is a tenuous time in the Middle East,” said Congressman Sherman. “With revolutionary uprisings across the Arab world, we are at a critical point in history. Time and again, the Iranian regime has proven to be the greatest threat to peace and stability in the region. In order to ensure a stable Middle East, we must prevent Iran from obtaining or developing nuclear weapons. Furthermore the United States must remain a strong supporter of democracy and a stalwart ally to Israel, our closest friend in the region.”Deputy Consul General Gil Artzyeli also helped to answer questions from Valley residents regarding US-Israel relations and Middle East policy. Artzyeli’s post covers Southern California, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming. He has been a member of the Israeli Foreign Service since 1994. -30-

Watch Congressman Sherman’s Remarks on the House Floor: CLICK HERE Or Read Congressman Sherman’s Remarks below:Transcript from CSPAN 10/12/2011 Mr. Speaker. At this time I yield two minutes to the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman. The speaker pro tempore: the gentleman from California is recognized for two minutes. Mr. Sherman: It looks like the only thing congress is going to do this year about jobs is to ship them overseas. Trade adjustment assistance is being authorized tomorrow. But not a penny is being appropriated tomorrow and any penny that is appropriated will no doubt be taken from health and education spending necessary without the trade agreements. This South Korean free trade agreement will increase our trade deficit by tens of billions of dollars and every billion of dollars of increase in our trade deficit costs us tens of thousands of jobs. The agreement is being sold as if goods made in South Korea are the only goods that are going to come into our country. That’s wrong in three ways. First, if goods are 65% made in china, 35% finished in South Korea, they come into our country duty-free. And that 35% of the work done in South Korea can be done by Chinese workers living in barrack in South Korea -- barracks in South Korea. So the goods may never be touched by a South Korean. We are going to be talking in this congress, I hope, about Chinese currency manipulation. There are proposals that would impose tariffs on Chinese goods. This South Korean agreement, is a prebuilt loophole in anything we try to do with china over currency manipulation. They manipulate their currency, they make 65% of the goods in china, they ship them to South Korea, they come in free into the United States. Without having to worry about our tariffs or our sanctions against their currency manipulation. Second, goods that are 65% made in North Korea, 35% made in South Korea have a right to come in under this agreement. but we have an executive order that will bar them at our ports. so we will be in violation of this agreement on the first day. That means South Korea can impose sanctions and take away whatever benefits you think we're going to get under this agreement. I ask the gentleman for no additional time and I thank the gentleman for his time.AFL-CIO Factsheet on Korean Trade Agreement This is what the AFL-CIO says about the Korea Trade deal:https://node/2“In economic terms, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) is the most significant U.S. trade agreement negotiated since NAFTA. And like NAFTA, it largely replicates the same model, which cost the U.S. more than one million jobs, allowed violations of core labor standards to continue unabated, and resulted in numerous challenges to laws and regulations designed to protect the public interest.” -30-
10.13.2011	Washington D.C. – Three Republican Senators, recently returned from Libya, have authored an editorial in the Wall Street Journal urging that we help the Libyan transitional government with the enormous task of rebuilding the country after 42 years of tyranny and seven months of war (The Promise of a Pro-American Libya). In response Congressman Brad Sherman (D –CA), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, released the following statement:"In February of 2011, the US treasury froze nearly $30 billion of Gaddafi money that he had invested in the United States. These are the funds that should be used to provide assistance to the Libyan transitional government. American taxpayers should not be on the hook when some $30 billion is available to pay for whatever technical assistance the Libyan transitional government needs. Any aid worth providing ought to be paid for with Libyan money. And if there is aid the Libyan government does not wish to pay for - it’s probably not that useful.In addition the frozen funds should be used to fully reimburse the United States for the cost of air operations over Libya."Since April, Congressman Sherman has repeatedly urged that the $30 billion of frozen funds be used to defray the cost of U.S. military actions benefiting the Libyan people.Watch Congressman Sherman’s Floor Statement on Libya from April, 2011: CLICK HEREAdditionally in May of 2011, Congressman Sherman met with Dr. Mahmoud Jibril, the Interim "Prime Minister" of the Transitional National Council of Libya in Washington D.C. and urged the rebel leader to formally adopt a resolution in the Council ensuring that funds of the Qaddafi family would be used to pay for American military actions. Sherman also urged the rebel leader to identify all persons who have supported al-Qaeda or the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and fought American troops in Afghanistan or Iraq, and bar those terrorists from service in the military or civilian operations of the Transitional National Council of Libya.-30-
10.11.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, commended the FBI and DEA for disrupting an Iranian plot to commit terrorism inside the United States. The alleged plan, directed by elements of the Iranian regime, was to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States and to bomb the embassies of Saudi Arabia and Israel in Washington, DC.“It’s not enough to punish the operatives; we must hold the Iranian government accountable,” said Congressman Sherman. “We should not be surprised by the audacity of this assassination and terrorist plot. The mullah regime in Tehran has been committed to terrorism as state policy ever since the inception of the Islamic Republic.”“I commend our law enforcement and intelligence agencies for stopping this Iranian terrorist plot,” continued Sherman. “Now, we must act together to hold the Iranian regime accountable by fully enforcing all sanctions. Otherwise, we may embolden Iran in its future attempts to commit terrorism on American soil.” The individuals involved in this plot are reportedly connected to the Qods Force, a division of Iran’s elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps that carries out operations outside Iran. The money in support of the plot had been transferred through a bank in New York, according to the New York Times. “We must fully enforce the tough sanctions passed by Congress thus far and continue to enact tougher sanctions to weaken Iran economically and diplomatically, and we must act now,” said Sherman. “The fact that Iranian regime transferred money for this operation through a bank in New York means that the Treasury Department needs to accelerate its enforcement of tough financial measures against Tehran and its global terrorist network. The threat is clearly on American soil – more than ever before.” As a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Sherman has pressed several administrations of both parties over the years to get tougher with Tehran on the enforcement of sanctions – particularly in Iran’s energy sector. In April of this year, Sherman reintroduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, the strongest Iran sanctions bill ever introduced. The bill’s provisions include a title targeting the IRGC and its business partners for greater sanctions. -30-

10.06.2011	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – On Tuesday, September 27th, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall meeting at The Village at Sherman Oaks, a senior living community located at 5450 Vesper Ave. Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including prescription drug costs, the national debt, Social Security and Medicare as well as other issues facing Congress. Sherman highlighted his continued work to lower the cost of prescription drugs as well as fight against any plan that privatizes Social Security or turns Medicare into a voucher program."Social Security belongs to the people who contribute, not the government – it must not be hijacked to pay the federal debt. The money put in should be protected and used only for Social Security," Sherman said."The Village at Sherman Oaks was very happy and enthusiastic about having our local US Congressman actually come to our community and make himself available to our residents," said Shellie Stewart, Marketing Representative for The Village at Sherman Oaks. "The Town Hall format allowed many of our residents to address concerns particularly relevant to our senior population. Representative Sherman’s visit was especially valuable because he allowed our politically engaged residents an opportunity to speak directly to him. In today’s world of emails and tweets, it was rewarding for our seniors to have their representative actually be here IN PERSON and very accessible. We at The Village at Sherman Oaks have a goal to keep our residents as active and involved in life as possible. Representative Sherman made a valuable contribution to that goal."Sherman also set up a constituent services booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies."Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of senior citizens and all Valley residents," said Congressman Brad Sherman. "At a time when many are struggling to endure challenging economic times, it is inspiring how united we remain, and how dedicated we are to making our communities stronger."Congressman Sherman has held over 150 Town Hall meetings during his time in Congress in a variety of formats, including visiting nearly every Senior Center in the San Fernando Valley numerous times to hear from senior citizens and other Valley residents about the issues important to them and their families and to describe what he does in Congress. Congressman Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

09.28.2011	Sherman Oaks, CA - On Sunday, September 25, 2011, Congressman Brad Sherman celebrated Armenian Independence Day with President Serzh Sargsyan and Armenian-Americans from all across Southern California. Upon meeting President Sagsyan, Congressman Sherman presented Sargsyan with a flag flown over the US Capitol. Sherman has helped lead the effort to strengthen ties between the United States and Armenia, and continues the fight to bring the Armenian Genocide Resolution to a successful vote on the House floor. "I am honored to celebrate Armenia's independence alongside President Sargsyan and so many great Armenian Americans here in California," said Sherman. "As a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have focused on recognizing the Armenian Genocide, recognizing the massacre of Armenian civilians in Sumgait, increasing funding to Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, and increasing military training aid for Armenia despite attempts by the administration to increase aid only to Azerbaijan." said Sherman.

09.23.2011	Washington DC – Congressman Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) released the following statement on his recent efforts in Congress to keep our communities safe from gun violence.“I have worked to encourage stronger enforcement of existing gun laws and to pass new common sense legislation to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. I have consistently earned a 100 percent vote rating from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.” Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement on Gun Control:High Capacity Ammunition MagazinesOn January 8, 2011, a disturbed individual, Jared Loughner, began shooting during an open meeting held by my friend and colleague Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Tragically, he wounded 13 individuals, including Rep. Giffords, and killed 6 others, including a 9-year old girl. Reasonable gun control laws could have prevented this devastating event, or at the very least saved some of these individuals.Specifically, there could have been fewer victims had legislation been in place prohibiting the sale of high capacity ammunition feeding devices, like the one that Mr. Loughner used on that day. If Mr. Loughner had been using a traditional magazine (carrying less than 10 rounds), he would not have been able to shoot as many rounds before having to stop and reload, and a bystander could have stopped him much sooner.To prevent a similar tragedy in the future, I have joined with Rep. McCarthy in introducing the Large Capacity Ammunition Feeding Device Act (H.R. 308). The bill would prohibit the sale of any ammunition magazine holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition (with reasonable exceptions for law enforcement and other government personnel). The bill is currently being considered by the Judiciary Committee. High capacity feeding devices simply should not be on the market – they are not necessary for either self-defense or sporting. I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure this important bill becomes law. Protecting Sensible Gun Control LegislationIn March of last year, the Supreme Court decided McDonald v. City of Chicago. While this case was a setback for gun control efforts, I am pleased that the Court held that the Second Amendment is not “a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.” By saying this, the Court has rightfully acknowledged that states and localities, as well as the federal government, can continue to pass and enforce sensible gun control legislation.Clearly, our recent history indicates a dire need for such reasonable gun control laws. The rate of firearm deaths in the United States for those under age fourteen is nearly 12 times higher than the combined rate in the 25 other “industrialized” nations. The United States lost 31,224 people to firearms in 2007 alone (the last year for which the Centers for Disease Control has statistics). And, incidences like the 2007 Virginia Tech and 1999 Columbine massacres, in which disturbed students murdered a combined 45 people, continue to occur. These tragedies must serve as solemn reminders of the government’s duty to regulate guns. In an effort to prevent such future shootings, I will continue to work with my colleagues under the new Supreme Court guidelines to pass tough gun control legislation.Closing the Gun Show LoopholeThe Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires criminal background checks of those purchasing guns through federally licensed gun dealers. However, unlicensed sellers (persons who are not in the day-to-day business of selling guns) are not required to do background checks. This loophole causes particular problems at gun shows. In most states convicted felons, domestic violence offenders, and those who are mentally ill and dangerous can walk into any gun show and buy weapons from unlicensed sellers without being stopped and with no questions asked. This is particularly concerning considering the popularity of gun shows. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives estimates that more than 4,000 gun shows are held in the United States each year. To prevent guns from ending up in the hands of criminals or terrorists, I have cosponsored the Gun Show Loophole Closing Act (HR 591), which would close this outrageous loophole. This legislation would require criminal background checks on all gun sales that occur at gun shows. The bill is currently being considered by the Judiciary Committee. I will work with my colleagues to make sure that this important legislation becomes law.Cop Killer GunsWe should ban the Five-seveN handgun, a “cop-killer” weapon designed to penetrate the protective armor police officers wear to keep them safe. Despite being powerful enough to pierce a bulletproof vest from over 200 yards away, this gun is light and easily concealed, making it even more dangerous. To protect our officers, I will again join with Rep. Engel to introduce the Protect Law Enforcement Armor (PLEA) Act, which would ban the Five-seveN pistol and its ammunition. Congress passed armor-piercing ammunition bans in 1986 and 1994 to protect law enforcement from similar guns, and this bill would update these bans to include the Five-seveN handgun. I will continue to fight to enact meaningful measures that keep guns off our streets and out of the hands of criminals. -30-
09.21.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) proudly announced that the National Park Service has acquired one of the last three remaining parcels of land necessary to complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Sherman was instrumental in securing the federal funding used to acquire the five acre "Kee" Property along the popular trail near the Los Angeles/Ventura County Line."We are close to realizing a 25-year endeavor to complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail, which will stretch from Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu," said Congressman Sherman. "The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is one of the most visited national parks in the country offering outdoor activities to millions of visitors from across Southern California and the world." Congressman Sherman has led the effort to acquire the remaining parcels along the Backbone Trail right-of-way. Sherman has secured nearly $20 million in federal funding to acquire and protect critical open space, including King Gillette Ranch and Zuma and Trancas Canyons, as well as complete the Backbone Trail. Earlier this year, Sherman announced the acquisition of 160 acres of pristine habitat between Peter Strauss Ranch and Malibu Creek State Park in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains.In July, Congressman Sherman received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his commitment to preserving America’s national parks and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. -30-
09.14.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) wrote to Permanent Representatives from 81 countries to the United Nations to oppose a unilateral attempt by the Palestinians to declare statehood at the UN later this month. The 81 countries, from every corner of the world, are the likely "swing states" (out of 193 total UN member states) that are not firmly decided on the issue. Sherman, the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, asked the UN ambassadors not to support this pending resolution, but to “cast a vote instead for the principle of peace through negotiations."Similar letters were sent from other members of Congress. The Congressman warned that Palestinian efforts to achieve statehood unilaterally through a UN resolution could have dire consequences for the Middle East peace process. “This unilateral move violates the all-important principle that the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through negotiations leading to a peace treaty fully accepted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority,” said Sherman in the letter. “The move also violates many existing agreements and understandings between the parties not to act unilaterally.” Calling attention to the negative consequences of a Palestinian statehood resolution in the UN, Sherman emphasized the negative impact it could have on Palestinians. "This resolution threatens to create instability and violence on the ground by creating exaggerated expectations among the Palestinians that cannot be fulfilled,” said Sherman. “Development aid to the Palestinian Authority from donor nations could be compromised, potentially reversing recent gains by the Palestinian economy."Sherman also noted that most members of the House of Representatives oppose the Palestinian plan at the UN. H.Res.268, a bipartisan resolution that passed the House July 7, 2011, by a vote of 407 to 6, opposes any attempt to establish or seek recognition of a Palestinian state outside of an agreement negotiated between Israel and the Palestinians. The resolution states that Palestinian efforts to circumvent direct negotiations with Israel will harm U.S.-Palestinian relations and will have implications for assistance programs for the Palestinian Authority (PA)."Together with the vast majority of my colleagues in the United States Congress, I believe this [pending UN] resolution could have immensely damaging repercussions for the Middle East peace process and above all for the Palestinians themselves," said Sherman. Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Letter:September 13, 2011 Dear Ambassador,I am writing to you to ask you to oppose a unilateral attempt by the Palestinians to declare statehood at the United Nations later this month.Together with the vast majority of my colleagues in the United States Congress, I believe this resolution could have immensely damaging repercussions for the Middle East peace process and above all for the Palestinians themselves.This unilateral move violates the all-important principle that the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is through negotiations leading to a peace treaty fully accepted by Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The move also violates many existing agreements and understandings between the parties not to act unilaterally. The government of Israel has repeatedly accepted the need for a two-state solution – a Palestinian and a Jewish state living side by side as good neighbors. But the Palestinians refuse to negotiate.This resolution threatens to create instability and violence on the ground by creating exaggerated expectations among the Palestinians that cannot be fulfilled. It could destabilize the finances of the Palestinian Authority, putting Palestinian economic progress in jeopardy and throwing thousands back into poverty. Development aid to the Palestinian Authority from donor nations could be compromised, potentially reversing recent gains by the Palestinian economy. Additionally, the Palestinian leadership has indicated that the resolution will include reference to the so-called Palestinian “right of return.” This means endorsing the right of some 6 million Palestinians (some 200,000 surviving refugees from 1948, plus their descendants) to flood into Israel, thus destroying Israel’s identity as the Jewish national homeland. And since there are no adequate records, any Arabic-speaking person could claim to be eligible for this supposed right of return. For all these reasons, I am appealing to you not to support this pending resolution, but to cast a vote instead for the principle of peace through negotiations.

09.13.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman is again introducing legislation to revoke Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for China and direct the President to negotiate a new trading relationship that is designed to eliminate the trade imbalance. Sherman first introduced the legislation in the previous session of Congress in 2010. The bill is designed to force China to enter expedited negotiations to create balanced trade between our two countries within four years. Warren Buffet proposed a balanced trade system in a November 2003 Fortune magazine article on America's growing trade deficit. Sherman, the Ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, is joined by Representatives Marcy Kaptur, Peter DeFazio, Dana Rohrabacher, and Walter Jones in introducing the legislation. The bill revokes MFN for China six months after enactment and directs the President to negotiate a new trading relationship with China designed to eliminate the trade imbalance. The bill also provides for the expedited consideration of any new trade partnership with China that will bring the trade deficit down to zero. "The U.S.-China trade relationship is horrendously lopsided. In the year 2000, the advocates of Most Favored Nation status for China promised that we would see more jobs for Americans and great opportunities for Americans to manufacture items and send them to China," said Congressman Sherman. "Unfortunately, we have seen the opposite occur: the U.S. has exported jobs to China. And China has abused the trading relationship in many ways, from currency manipulation to the piracy of intellectual property. That is why I have introduced legislation to revoke Most Favored Nation status from China until the President establishes a more level playing field between our two nations." The United States made MFN status for China permanent on October 10, 2000. Congressman Sherman voted no on the bill in Congress, which authorized the extension of non-discriminatory treatment to the products of China. The United States’ trade deficit with China has grown from approximately $84 billion in 2000 to $273 billion in 2010. For every dollar’s worth of goods the United States imports from China, our country exports only about 25 cents worth of goods to China. Our exports to China equal only 1.6% of China’s GDP, and this percentage has actually declined since 2006. -30-
09.09.2011	Washington DC – Following President Obama’s September 8th speech, Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement: “The President’s economic plan is good but insufficient. We need a bolder spending program over the next 2 years to get us out of this recession, but if and only if it is paired with an even bolder program to reduce the deficit over the next 10 years. I’m pleased that the President supports tax breaks for the middle class, including the payroll tax holiday which provides immediate additional stimulus and is self-reversing. I’m disappointed that among the measures that congress should enact the president mentioned free trade agreements; this will have the exact opposite effect and ensure the loss of thousands of American jobs. I would also like to see the administration take a more active role in keeping housing prices from declining any further. Along with any jobs recovery act, we should have a housing act.” -30-
09.08.2011	Washington DC – Congressman Sherman released the following statement on the importance of Credit Unions:“I strongly believe that the not-for-profit, cooperative nature of credit unions and the services they provide to their members and communities amply justify their continued tax-exempt status,” said Congressman Sherman. “Credit unions have a special mission, and they play a unique role in meeting the credit and savings needs of consumers – especially those persons with low and moderate income. Please be assured that I will continue to work to preserve the credit union charter and will vigorously resist efforts to tax credit unions.”Read Congressman Sherman’s Full Statement:Credit Union Member Business LendingOur economy needs more business loans, particularly to small businesses. Whenever I meet with credit union leaders, they tell me that they are ready to expand their member business lending. For this reason, I have cosponsored H.R. 1418, the Small Business Lending Enhancement Act of 2011, which would allow credit unions to make more loans and larger loans to their small business members.In particular, the bill would raise the cap on a credit union’s member business lending portfolio to as much as 27.5% of total assets and revise upwards the size of loan excluded from this cap to $250,000. The bill would also ensure a focus on lending to underserved areas and low-income communities by excluding such loans from the cap.Under current law, credit unions are restricted from holding member business loans exceeding the lesser of 1.75 times the credit union’s net worth or 12.25% of the credit union’s total assets. Furthermore, a loan is counted under this cap so long as it is larger than $50,000 – a level that is prohibitively small to allow credit unions to effectively serve the borrowing needs of their business members in today’s economy.The Credit Union National Association estimates that H.R. 1418 will allow credit unions to expand their business lending by $13 billion in the first year, helping to create 140,000 jobs across the country – at no cost to the federal government. We know that credit unions are eager to put their capital to work to help sustain the recovery, and I will continue advocating for the government to simply get out of the way.Sherman Amendment a Major Victory for Credit UnionsI am especially pleased to report that I led the fight to ensure that only the largest financial institutions would be forced to pay the costs of dealing with the next financial crisis. Thanks to an amendment I sponsored during consideration of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, special assessments to recoup any losses to the Government will be imposed on institutions with greater than $50 billion in assets, rather than a mere $10 billion. In effect, the Sherman Amendment exempts the entire credit union movement from bearing the costs of cleaning up a future mess created by Wall Street. While we hope that taxpayers will never again be called upon to bail out Wall Street, if it happens, credit unions will not be asked to pay a dime.This victory would not have been possible without the grassroots activism of credit union executives and volunteers. I have no doubt that my amendment was the right thing to do, but it might have never been adopted without the efforts of your colleagues across the country. It was credit union leaders like yourself who reached out to their own representatives – at just the right moment – to convince them of how important it was to support the Sherman Amendment.Alternative Sources of CapitalIn order for credit unions to do their part to help make credit available to America’s consumers and small businesses, they need access to alternative sources of capital beyond their retained earnings. Congress should change the law to allow credit unions to raise additional capital in ways that are consistent with their character as non-profit, member-owned cooperatives.It was less than three years ago that the largest banks in America came to Washington looking for investments from the taxpayer, and over the objections of the American people, Congress gave them $700 billion of additional capital, despite my efforts in opposition. Credit unions, on the other hand – who are not responsible for the financial mess that led to the bailouts – are not asking for any taxpayer money. They are simply asking to be allowed to raise alternative sources of capital.To me, it is a paradox that our government would hand over billions of taxpayer dollars to banks while standing in the way of credit unions raising private capital. As we work to develop new capital standards that will strengthen the balance sheets of all financial institutions, credit unions must be part of the discussion. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) should submit a proposal to Congress that would allow credit unions to raise capital from alternative sources. The time is now to make this a reality.Regulatory ReliefIn many important respects, credit unions are too heavily regulated and unnecessarily restricted in the services that they may offer. The Federal Credit Union Act has not been amended in a truly meaningful way since 1998, and credit unions remain the most regulated and restricted of all depository institutions. I have been working to ease the regulatory burden and other constraints on credit unions for a number of years, and I will continue my efforts to enhance their ability to serve their members and their communities.I supported the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006, which became law and took some valuable first steps toward regulatory relief for credit unions. The 2006 Act allowed leases of land on federal facilities for credit unions, increased the 12-year limitation of the maturity of credit union loans to 15 years, clarified the definition of credit union “net worth” to conform with the accounting standards of other depository institutions, and permitted credit unions to extend lifeline services and remittances to non-members who otherwise fall within their field of membership.Last year, I worked to ensure that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act largely preserves the NCUA’s longstanding consumer protection role, rather than creating a new layer of regulation for credit unions. The Act exempts smaller credit unions (those under $1.5 billion in assets) from examination by the newly-established Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Thus, most credit unions will continue to be examined by the NCUA, but they will also benefit from the harmonization of consumer protection that will result by consolidating the rule-writing responsibilities under the CFPB. For too long, banks and thrifts have had the advantage of shopping around for a charter that offered the regulator with the lightest touch. A uniform approach to enforcing our truth-in-lending laws and other federal consumer protections will benefit consumers, while leveling the playing field for community financial institutions.-30-
09.07.2011	Sherman Oaks, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) joined over 50 members of United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) at Ralphs – a local supermarket at 14440 Burbank Boulevard in Sherman Oaks – to urge executives of Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons supermarkets to negotiate a fair contract with their employees. “These people have been working without a contract for six months," Sherman said before the crowd. "It's time the supermarket chains shared some of their millions in profits with their workers.” “The hard-working employees at Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons deserve a fair contract that provides affordable health care coverage and fair wages,” Sherman continued. “No one can afford to repeat a months long strike, especially the dedicated employees at our local supermarkets and the customers that are supporting these workers and their families.” Following his remarks, Congressman Sherman delivered a letter to the Ralph’s store manager on behalf of the demonstrating supermarket workers calling for improved healthcare benefits. Congressman Sherman also delivered letters to the executives of Kroger Co., Safeway Inc. and SUPERVALU Inc. to express his concerns over the negotiations and urging them to work towards a fair and equitable contract with their employees as soon as possible. If negotiations break down, Congressman Sherman has agreed to rally with workers outside local supermarkets until a contract is approved.
08.28.2011	RESEDA, CA – On Sunday, August 28th, Congressman Brad Sherman (D – Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall meeting at Reseda High School, located at 18230 Kittridge Street, fielding questions from some of the over 600 constituents who attended.Congressman Sherman has held over 150 Town Hall meetings during his time in Congress in a variety of formats, including visiting virtually every public and private high school and middle school in the San Fernando Valley numerous times to hear from students and Valley residents about the issues important to them and their families and to describe what he does in Congress. Sherman’s staff has also hosted over 100 information booths at various community fairs, senior centers, veterans’ organizations, cultural and religious festivals, and farmers markets to share information about his constituent services program. Congressman Sherman has recognized the accomplishments and community service records of hundreds of volunteers and organizations serving the residents of the San Fernando Valley.In May of this year, Congressman Sherman conducted a Town Hall Meeting at the new Valley Performing Arts Center at Cal State Northridge, fielding questions from some of the 1,200 constituents who attended – one of the most successful and widely attended Town Hall Meetings of Sherman’s 15 years in Congress. The Arts Center, which features a 1,700-seat Great Hall where the Town Hall Meeting took place, officially opened on January 29, 2011. Congressman Sherman helped secure federal funding for the Valley Performing Arts Center, which has hosted numerous performances from world-class performers, musicians and distinguished speakers in its first season. On Sunday, Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including, taxes, the national debt, education, Social Security and Medicare as well as other issues facing Congress. Sherman highlighted his continued work to resolve the nation’s debt crisis, restore faith in the economy and help put Americans back to work. Sherman also set up a constituent service booth at the meeting to help dozens of constituents resolve problems they were having with federal agencies.“Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “Virtually every question from my constituents was regarding a matter of public policy, standing in stark contrast to the several reporters in attendance who only wished to discuss political horse racing. At a time when many of us are struggling to endure challenging economic times, it is inspiring how united we remain, and how dedicated we are to making our communities stronger.”Congressman Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. -30-

In its most recent scorecard, I earned a 100% rating from the Human Rights Campaign for my record on issues important to the LGBT community,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am also a member of the LGBT Equality Caucus, which is co-chaired by Congress members Barney Frank, Tammy Baldwin, and Jared Polis. The mission of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus is to promote lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender equality. This Caucus works for equal rights, the repeal of discriminatory laws, the elimination of hate-motivated violence, and the improved health and well-being for all regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity/expression.” Read Sherman’s Full Statement on LGBT issues: Marriage Equality I believe that government should allow all consenting adults, regardless of sexual orientation, to enjoy the benefits of legally-recognized marriage. I have consistently opposed Constitutional amendments seeking to ban gay marriage. As a member of Congress, I will continue the fight for marriage equality and am optimistic that one day all adults will be able to marry the person of his or her choosing. Ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell Repeal Act, which I strongly supported. The repeal will be fully effective 60 days after the Secretary of Defense has received a review from the Department of Defense on the implementation of the repeal, and the President, Secretary, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certify to the congressional defense committees that the implementation of the DADT repeal is consistent with standards of military readiness and effectiveness. Repealing Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell is not only a matter of fairness; it is also an urgent national security issue. At this critical time in our nation’s history, we need to attract and retain the very best in our military. Any qualified American who wishes to serve should be able to do so without fear. I am confident that the requisite certifications will be made shortly, and this discriminatory policy will finally be repealed. Protecting Students from Bullying Our children and students deserve particular vigilance from the government in protecting them from all types of pernicious discrimination. Many LGBT students face daily harassment from their peers and even teachers. This harassment has devastating effects. Recently, a number of gay students or students perceived as being gay have committed suicide following school-based bullying incidents. As a step to help prevent such tragedies in the future, I have again joined with my colleague Rep. Jared Polis to introduce the Student Nondiscrimination Act (H.R. 998). This bill would prohibit public schools from excluding students from participating in, or subjecting students to discrimination under, any federally-assisted educational program on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Any student who has been discriminated against on these grounds can seek recourse in court. The bill is now being considered by the House Education and Labor Committee, and I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that it becomes law. Preventing Discrimination Against Workers No person should be denied employment simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Unfortunately today, many Americans are terminated, or simply not hired, not because of their qualifications or performance but rather because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. To prevent such workplace discrimination, I have again joined with Congressman Barney Frank and others in introducing the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, known as ENDA, (H.R. 1397). Under the bill, employers cannot base employment decisions, such as hiring and/or firing, on sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill is currently being considered by the House Education and Labor Committee. I will work with my colleagues to make sure that this important legislation passes, so everyone, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, has the right to fairly participate in the American workforce. Keeping Our Families Together Under our immigration laws, non-citizen spouses of citizens are allowed to reside in the United States. This same privilege should not be denied to same-sex partners. I have again cosponsored the Uniting American Families Act (H.R. 1537). The bill would include same-sex (“permanent”) partners within the scope of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The bill is currently being considered by the Judiciary Committee. Caring for Loved Ones Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, certain private and all public employees may take up to twelve weeks of unpaid medical leave to care for a parent, spouse, or child with a serious health condition. Unfortunately, same-sex spouses or domestic partners do not currently enjoy the same right. Therefore, to care for a critically-ill partner, a same-sex spouse who needs to take time off from work must risk termination. Because every employee should have the right to take a reasonable amount of time from work to care for a seriously ill family member, last Congress I cosponsored the Family Medical Leave Inclusion Act (H.R. 2132). This bill would provide medical leave to care for a same-sex spouse or domestic partner. I look forward to joining with my colleagues in reintroducing this important piece of legislation soon. In 2009, we passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which imposes additional federal penalties for crimes motivated by hatred on the basis of race, religion, or actual or perceived sexual orientation. I hope that we are equally successful in pass the legislation documented above. I will continue fighting for the civil rights for the entire LGBT community. -30-

The PATRIOT Act On May 26th, I voted against a bill (S. 990) providing for a four-year reauthorization of three troubling provisions of the PATRIOT Act when it came up for a vote in the House, as I have voted against similar reauthorizations in the past. Unfortunately, the bill passed by 250-153, and has been signed into law. One particularly disturbing provision of the PATRIOT Act that has now been reauthorized is the so-called “library provision” that allows the FBI to acquire records about what books a person checks out from the library. The other two provisions allow roving wiretaps and the collection of information on “lone wolves” who are not connected to terrorist organizations or governments. This reauthorization will last until June 1, 2015. I will continue fighting for substantial reform of the PATRIOT Act. In February, I also voted for an amendment which would prevent the federal government from obtaining a person’s library records under the “Library Provision.” The amendment was offered during the debate on the Full Year Continuing Appropriations Act for FY 2011 (H.R. 1), which would fund the federal government for the rest of the fiscal year. Despite my support, this amendment did not pass. The final vote was 196 to 231. I am confident that we can keep this country safe while also protecting Americans from unwarranted intrusions of privacy. Ending Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell On December 22, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell (DADT) Repeal Act, which I strongly supported. According to the law, the repeal of DADT would only be fully effective 60 days after the Secretary of Defense received a review from the Department of Defense on the implementation of the repeal, and the President, Secretary, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff certified to the congressional defense committees that the implementation of the DADT repeal is consistent with standards of military readiness and effectiveness. On July 22nd, the necessary certifications were made. Therefore, DADT will finally be repealed on September 20th. Repealing DADT is a great national victory for the causes of civil rights and equality. Any qualified American who wishes to serve will finally be able to do so without fear. Protecting Students from Bullying Our children and students deserve particular vigilance from the government in protecting them from all types of pernicious discrimination. Many LGBT students face daily harassment from their peers and even teachers. This harassment has devastating effects. Recently, a number of gay students or students perceived as being gay have committed suicide following school-based bullying incidents.

This bill would prohibit public schools from excluding students from participating in, or subjecting students to discrimination under, any federally-assisted educational program on the basis of their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity. Any student who has been discriminated against on these grounds can seek recourse in court. The bill is now being considered by the House Education and the Workforce Committee, and I will continue working with my colleagues to make sure that it becomes law. Preventing Torture Our values and our Constitution, which guarantee the right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment, prohibit “waterboarding” and other forms of torture from being used in interrogations. That is why I have consistently supported legislation to prevent torture. Soon, I will again be joining with my colleague Rep. Jerrold Nadler to introduce the American Anti-Torture Act, which would prohibit all employees of the U.S. government (not only our military, but also the CIA, contractors, and all other federal employees) from using torture in interrogations. This legislation would explicitly include waterboarding and other techniques prohibited by the Army Field Manual. Accountability of the Executive Branch No matter who holds the White House, citizens should be able to have their legal grievances with the federal government fairly adjudicated in a court of law. Under current law, the Federal government, when it is a defendant in a civil case, may assert a defense known as the “State Secrets Privilege”. Under this privilege, the Executive Branch can make the judge dismiss any civil case, without even presenting any evidence, by claiming that the case involves classified information. In the 20th Century, this privilege was used sparingly. However, from 2001 through 2008, U.S. government agencies asserted it frequently to block a wide variety of private citizen lawsuits. We must make sure the government asserts the “State Secrets Privilege” reliably and in a limited manner. That is why I will again join with my colleague Rep. Jerrold Nadler to introduce the State Secret Protection Act. This bill will enable judges to examine, in a secure area, the government’s evidence in asserting the “State Secrets Privilege”. And, it will allow the government to assert the privilege only if the government shows that public disclosure of the information that the government seeks to protect would be reasonably likely to cause significant harm to the national defense or the diplomatic relations of the United States. Please be assured that I will continue to work to protect civil liberties. -30-
08.22.2011	Washington DC – Congressman Sherman takes strides to fight for animal protections and ensure humane treatment. Sherman’s work over the last year earned him the “Humane Champion” award from the Humane Society, an honor he has received four years running, and he has consistently received a 100 percent rating on the Humane Society’s legislative scorecard.“Like many of my constituents, I support strong measures to protect animals and ensure that they are not subjected to undue pain or suffering,” said Congressman Sherman. “With the right action in congress, we can end unnecessary abuse and cruelty toward animals.”Sherman’s Full Statement of Support for Animal Rights Issues: Regulating Puppy MillsIt is estimated that 2 million to 4 million puppy mill puppies are sold each year in the United States. Facilities that breed dogs for commercial resale are required to be licensed and inspected under the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA), but a loophole in the law allows thousands of puppy mills to sell directly to the public and go unchecked from any federal oversight. Due to improper care and over-crowded conditions, their puppies are often ill, leaving unsuspecting consumers with sick, sometimes dying puppies, expensive vet bills and very unhappy children. Meanwhile, the breeding dogs at these facilities often spend their entire lives in constant confinement and deprivation.I have cosponsored the Puppy Uniform Protection and Safety (PUPS) Act, H.R. 835, to close this loophole in the Animal Welfare Act that allows thousands of large, commercial breeders to sell puppies over the Internet and escape licensing and regulation. Many of the "puppy-mill" dogs are typically forced to live their entire lives in small cages with no opportunity for exercise or social contact. The PUPS act would require that dogs used for breeding be allowed to exercise outside their primary enclosures every day. I will continue to advocate for this bill, which has been referred to the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry.Protecting HorsesHorses have played a large role in the history of the San Fernando Valley. From the days of early Hollywood, the “Fat Jones” stables in North Hollywood provided horses to the movies from 1912 to the mid-1960s. Many of us also remember the historic Devonshire Downs race track in Northridge. Today, the equestrian community remains strong and committed to the protection of horses nationwide.Although all horse slaughter plants in the United States have been shut down, horse slaughter continues to thrive by an unscrupulous industry that ships American horses to Mexico and Canada where the slaughter continues. I joined with my colleagues to introduce the Prevention of Equine Cruelty Act in 2009, which would close this loophole by prohibiting the shipment, possession, purchase, sale, or donation of horses to be slaughtered for human consumption. While the legislation had over 150 cosponsors, it unfortunately did not make it to the House floor for a vote. I will continue to push to get similar legislation introduced and brought to the House floor for a vote during this session.Legislation to Stop Cruel “Crush” Videos Many of us in the Valley were outraged last year by the U.S. Supreme Court decision which struck down a federal law banning video and other depictions of dog fighting and violence against animals, holding that it violated constitutional guarantees of free speech. In response to this decision, essentially upholding grisly acts of animal cruelty, I quickly joined several colleagues to introduce the Prevention of Interstate Commerce in Animal Crush Videos Act (H.R. 5566). This common sense legislation was narrowly crafted to give law enforcement the ability to prosecute people who traffic in videos showing such heinous acts as the intentional crushing, burning, drowning, suffocating, or impaling of puppies, kittens, and other animals. With the support of the Humane Society, this legislation passed in the House and Senate and was signed into law by the President.Stopping Internet HuntingInternet hunting, also known as remote-controlled hunting, allows people to use a computer and the Internet to kill penned animals which have been lured to a feeding station within range of a mechanized mounted rifle fired by the simple click of a computer mouse. This “pay-per-view” slaughter has no resemblance whatsoever to traditional hunting. It is a practice so cruel that it is denounced by both the Humane Society and the National Rifle Association. It is also banned in 38 states, including California. However, a federal ban is necessary to permanently end the travesty of Internet hunting. I joined with several members of Congress to introduce the Sportsmanship in Hunting Act (H.R. 2210), which would create a federal prohibition on Internet hunting and establish penalties for those who violate the prohibition. Canned hunting, in which customers pay to shoot tame, exotic animals within the confines of an enclosure where the animals have no chance of escape, would also be banned by the bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these important legislative initiatives to protect animals. -30-
08.15.2011	Congressman Brad Sherman will host a Town Hall meeting from 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. on Sunday, August 28th at Reseda High School, located at 18230 Kittridge Street. The Congressman will discuss the economy, taxes, the national debt, education, Social Security and Medicare as well as other issues facing Congress. Most of the meeting will be devoted to Congressman Sherman listening and responding to questions from Valley residents.Sherman has held over 100 Town Hall Meetings since going to Congress. In May of this year, Congressman Sherman conducted a Town Hall Meeting at the new Valley Performing Arts Center at Cal State Northridge, fielding questions from some of the approximately 1,200 constituents who attended – one of the most successful and widely attended Town Hall Meetings of Sherman’s 15 years in Congress. The Arts Center, which features a 1,700-seat Great Hall where the Town Hall Meeting took place, officially opened on January 29, 2011. Congressman Sherman helped secure federal funding for the Valley Performing Arts Center, which has hosted numerous performances from world-class performers, musicians and distinguished speakers in its first season. "Town Hall Meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. I hope to have a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents," said Congressman Brad Sherman. "The large attendance at our previous Town Hall Meetings proves that the residents of the San Fernando Valley are actively engaged in their community and their government. I look forward to hearing their ideas."For the upcoming August 28th Town Hall, Sherman’s district office staff will be on hand to help constituents resolve any problems they may have with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The event, refreshments, and parking are free.-30-
08.08.2011	Washington D.C. – In response to the S&P decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating, Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA) a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, released the following statement: "They did this on the theory that Washington might deliberately refuse to pay its debt because of a political impasse. But I don't know what makes them experts at this,” said Sherman. "S&P's main job is rating private issuers, and they have some expertise in that, although obviously they got it pretty wrong in mortgage-backed securities. In the parlance of finance; they gave Triple A to ‘Alt-A’, but downgraded the USA. That is to say that until 2008 they gave their coveted triple A rating to non-prime mortgages but now they take it away from US treasuries. In this case you need to be a political scientist and not an MBA - and I don’t know if they’ve got any political scientists over there." Congressman Sherman has long argued that perhaps the single greatest cause of the financial meltdown was the decision of the credit rating agencies to give high ratings to bonds backed by questionable mortgages. In June, Sherman appeared before the conference committee on financial regulatory reform to encourage the adoption of a measure, which he proposed in the House and which U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN) introduced and successfully passed in the Senate. The Franken-Sherman amendment would require an independent agency to assign credit rating agencies impartially. -30-
08.03.2011	Ending So-Called “Right-to-Work” Laws Would Give Working People a Fair Deal Washington, DC – Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman announced the introduction of dramatic legislation that would eliminate so-called “right-to-work” laws (H.R. 2775), which was applauded by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. Sherman has a strong record of supporting working men and women and earned a 100% rating from the AFL-CIO. Right-to-work laws require unions to represent non dues-paying employees, thereby undermining the basic premise and promise of union membership and creating free riders – people who don’t pay their fair share. Right-to-work laws create different standards for union membership in different states. This results not only in confusion over the regulation of union membership, but also places a higher cost on worker representation in labor rights states. Right-to-work laws have come to be known as right-to-work-for-less laws, because employees in states with these laws average about $5,333 a year less than workers in labor rights states. Even a conservative American Enterprise Institute scholar argues that right-to-work laws would violate international labor standards that have been accepted by most of the world for decades. Similarly, in testimony at Congressman Sherman’s March 10, 2010 hearing entitled “International Worker Rights, U.S. Foreign Policy and the International Economy”, the U.S. Department of State expressed concerns about efforts to undermine the right to organize throughout the world. “I do not believe that there should be a right to be treated unfairly or to endure unnecessary restrictions. Right-to-work laws strip unions of their legitimate ability to collect dues, even when the worker is covered by a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. This forces unions to use their time and members’ dues to provide benefits to free riders who are exempt from paying their fair share,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “These laws are harmful to states like California, which allows labor unions to organize, because now we have to compete with the race to the bottom as our companies have to compete with those where the workers would like better wages, working conditions and benefits but are unable to organize to get them.” “We applaud Congressman Sherman for his proposal to ban so-called Right-to-Work laws,” said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. “Right-to-Work is another partisan attack perpetuated by corporate CEOs and their political allies. It undermines the middle class by making it harder for all workers to fight for better wages and benefits, job security, and safer workplaces.” In 1947, Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act stripped the federal government of its role in protecting the American workers’ right to freedom of association by allowing states to pass legislation that eliminates the ability of unions to collect dues from their members. The result is a confusing web of labor laws that encourages a race to the bottom. -30-
07.28.2011	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman called on Speaker Boehner to restore the text of the Senate-passed Leahy/Sherman Faster FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) Act (S. 627), which the Speaker plans, as a procedural maneuver, to replace with the language of the Budget Control Act. The FOIA created a system for citizens to obtain government records. Unfortunately, significant delays in processing and responding to FOIA requests have become too frequent. The Faster FOIA Act (S. 627), which was passed by the Senate on May 26th by unanimous consent, would have established the Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays. The Commission would have up to one year to study methods to reduce delays in processing FOIA requests and recommend legislative and administrative actions that can be taken to limit those delays. Congressman Sherman introduced identical legislation in the House (H.R. 1564). “It is a shame that the Speaker has decided to replace a piece of bipartisan legislation with the partisan, ill-conceived Budget Control Act,” Sherman said. “I call on Speaker Boehner to bring to the floor the text of the original Faster FOIA Act, which would help prevent excessive delays in the government’s response to Freedom of Information Act requests.” “Taxpayers should have the opportunity to quickly and easily obtain information from the federal government,” Sherman said. “As former Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, ‘Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.’ The Faster FOIA Act should not be used as a pawn in the debt limit debate.” -30-
07.22.2011	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that construction is underway on a $4.7 million project to help alleviate congestion at the 101/405 interchange –the busiest highway interchange in the nation carrying over 457,000 vehicles daily. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) will widen the southbound and northbound off-ramps on the 101 Freeway at Van Nuys Boulevard to provide additional capacity to accommodate future traffic volumes. Completion is estimated summer 2013. “Day in, day out, motorists in the San Fernando Valley sit idle in traffic in both directions of the Ventura Freeway at the 101/405 interchange,” said Congressman Sherman. “This project will help reduce overall traffic delays in both directions on the 101 Freeway for motorists transitioning to the 405 Freeway and for vehicles exiting onto Van Nuys Boulevard.” “This is yet another project on the Ventura Freeway that will help to improve aging freeway infrastructure and the flow of traffic in the Los Angeles area,” said Caltrans District 7 Director Michael Miles. “We are very happy to have transportation advocates like Congressman Sherman on our team.” Congressman Sherman was successful in convincing the California Transportation Commission to accelerate funding for the project. Sherman secured $500,000 in federal appropriations funding to initiate project studies at the 101/405 interchange, including improvements to the northbound and southbound Van Nuys Boulevard off-ramps. He has also advocated successfully for federal and state funding to accelerate construction of a northbound carpool lane on the 405 Freeway through the Sepulveda Pass. -30-
07.13.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, Democrat from California, endorsed Senator McConnell’s plan to allow an increase in the debt limit. Sherman had voted for a clean increase in the debt limit on May 31, 2011 in H.R. 1954. Sherman said, “I know that the McConnell proposal is designed to hurt Democrats politically, because in effect, only Democratic votes would be necessary to enact a debt limit increase due to the proposal’s mechanism requiring a 2/3 opposition in Congress to stop the increase. But the proposal will allow our country to avoid a crisis that is already costing us jobs and investment. Democrats should proudly support this McConnell-designed political charade because whatever its intent, it will allow us to avoid economic disaster and move on to the real medicine for reigning in the federal deficit through the appropriate processes.” Sherman continued, “We need to take fiscally responsible action to reduce our deficit. A crisis can sometimes be helpful in prodding the adoption of difficult, fiscally responsible measures. But this crisis is hurting our economy now and providing no measurable progress toward fiscally responsible measures. We had a budget crisis in April, and we are certain to have a budget crisis on September 30th when funding for all government agencies expires. We don’t need a third budgetary crisis this year.” -30-
07.13.2011	Washington DC – Today, Congressman Sherman received the Friend of the National Parks Award from the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) for his commitment to preserving America’s national parks for future generations. “I am honored by the National Parks Conservation Association’s award, and I thank them. I will continue to work hard to protect our treasured national parks and natural space,” said Sherman. The National Parks Award is for Members of Congress who lead efforts to protect and enhance the National Park System. The NPCA, which has 600,000 members and supporters, works to protect the park system to preserve the nation’s natural, historical, and cultural heritage. One of Sherman’s major accomplishments in helping the National Park System is the protection of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. The area is the most visited unit of the National Park System, with over 33 million annual visitors. Sherman spoke on the importance of the Santa Monica Mountains for residents of the Valley. “Protecting our environment – especially our pristine national parks – is one of my top legislative priorities. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park, providing a variety of outdoor activities for Valley families.” Earlier this year, Sherman worked to persuade the Obama administration to include funding in its Fiscal Year 2012 Budget for land acquisitions in the Santa Monica Mountains. The President’s budget included $3 million to acquire and protect up to 350 acres of land in Zuma and Trancas Canyons near Malibu in the Santa Monica Mountains. Over the years, Sherman has helped to secure nearly $20 million to acquire and preserve critical open space and complete the 65-mile Backbone Trail. The National Park Service completed an acquisition of 160 acres of pristine habitat in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in April of this year. The three parcels, located between Peter Strauss Ranch and Malibu Creek State Park, were identified as high priority land acquisitions due to the undisturbed condition of the property and the richness of the natural habitat. Congressman Sherman worked with Senator Feinstein to secure the federal funding to preserve this area near the north face of Castro Creek from future development.-30-

Sherman’s amendment reads, “None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of the War Powers Resolution.” The House voted to pass the amendment, with 316 voting for and 111 voting against. “The House sent a very strong message today: the War Powers Act is the law of the land, and we cannot tolerate its violation. We cannot bring democracy and the rule of law to Libya without safeguarding democracy and the rule of law here at home,” said Congressman Sherman. The War Powers Resolution (also known as the War Powers Act) prevents the President from conducting military action for more than 60 days without Congressional approval. Congress has not authorized military action in Libya. The administration sent a perfunctory letter to the House leadership encouraging a resolution approving military action against Qaddafi’s forces on May 20, 2011 – about 60 days after hostilities began in March. This is the third time the House voted on Sherman’s War Powers amendment. On June 13th, Sherman offered the same amendment to the Military Construction-VA Appropriations Act. The House voted to pass that amendment, 248 to 163. The House voted on the same amendment offered to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, on June 2nd. That amendment had nearly passed 208 to 213. Sherman stressed the historical importance of passing this amendment to ensure that the Executive Branch complies with the law. “The past several Presidents have asserted that the War Powers Resolution is not binding on them and that any President can deploy unlimited military assets for any duration for any purpose deemed worthwhile,” said Sherman. “This amendment uses the power of the purse to compel adherence to the War Powers Resolution. No President should be able to wage war indefinitely without Congressional authorization.” -30-
06.23.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, commended the Treasury Department today for imposing sanctions against Iran Air but stressed the need to not license the repair of Iran’s U.S.-made engines. Iran Air, along with several affiliated entities, were designated for providing material support and services to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Iran’s Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), and for their role in support of Iran’s proliferation activities. “I commend the Treasury Department for sanctioning Iran Air,” said Sherman. “Nonetheless, the administration has not ruled out licensing the repair of Iran’s airplanes. Given Treasury’s decision today, there should no longer be any debate within the U.S. government – the repair of these planes should not be licensed,” said Sherman. “Our message should be that these unsafe planes should remain grounded until Tehran grounds its illicit nuclear weapons program.” In April of this year, Congressman Sherman and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called on the Secretary of State to withhold pending licenses for the inspection and repair of engines on Iranian aircraft in a letter signed by several key Members of the House and Senate. There are 15 aircraft currently in service on Iranian airlines, sold to the Iranians while the Shah was in power in the 1970s, that use American-made engines. “Iran does not simply fly its ‘civilian’ aircraft to carry passengers and commercial cargo,” said Sherman. “Iran’s ‘civilian’ aircraft fleet supports the regime’s proliferation and terrorist activities, including the supply of weapons to Syria, Hezbollah and other terrorist groups, and the transfer of ballistic missile technology between Iran and North Korea.”In May, a United Nations report revealed that North Korea and Iran have been routinely sharing prohibited ballistic missile technology – with the help of Iran Air – in breach of U.N. sanctions against North Korea. The report said that the transfers were believed to be taking place on regular scheduled flights of Air Koryo, North Korea’s state-owned airline, and Iran Air, using air cargo hubs with lax security in a “neighboring third country” widely assumed to be China. Earlier this year, Sherman introduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, legislation that will further isolate Iran’s crumbling energy sector and target the Revolutionary Guards. The legislation would also prohibit the transfer of any goods, services or technology needed to keep Iran’s American-made aircraft flying. -30-
06.14.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman announced today that he will be introducing the Religious and Parental Rights Defense Act of 2011, a bill to prevent San Francisco and other municipalities from banning the circumcision of males under the age of 18. Sherman’s new bill is in reaction to a measure that has qualified for the November 2011 ballot in San Francisco that would make the performance of circumcisions on males under 18 a misdemeanor—with a possible $1,000 fine and one-year prison term. “Male circumcision has been practiced for thousands of years and is a deeply important ceremony for two major religions,” said Sherman. “Circumcision is obligatory for Jewish-born males -- it must be performed on the eighth day after birth and is only postponed in the case of threat to the life or health of the child. Muslim parents also circumcise their male children.” Sherman expressed concern over the motivation of the provision. “To infringe the religious rights of so many Americans, San Francisco should have some compelling medical reason; however, the medical literature actually shows clear benefits of male circumcision.” According to a United Nation AIDS agency study, male circumcision offers a 60 percent reduction in HIV risk and the benefits are life-long. “I agree with the American Academy of Pediatrics that parents should clearly have the right to freely decide whether circumcision is in the best interests of their male children,” said Sherman. “In fact, American parents have chosen circumcision for over 75 percent of male children.” “Congress has a legitimate interest in making sure that a practice that appears to reduce disease and health care costs remains available to parents,” Sherman said. “And, nothing in my bill prohibits statewide law ensuring that male circumcision occurs in a hygienic manner.” “Congress has historically legislated to protect the free exercise of religious rights from state and local intrusions,” Sherman said. “In 2000, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, designed to protect religious institutions from unduly burdensome local zoning laws.” “The Religious and Parental Rights Defense Act of 2011ensures that Jewish and Muslim families will continue to be able to enjoy the free exercise of their religious beliefs,” Sherman said. -30-
06.14.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – By a vote of 248 to 163, the House voted to pass the Sherman Amendment to the Military Construction–Veterans’ Affairs Appropriations bill. The amendment reads: “None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in contravention of the War Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1541).”Sherman’s statement in favor of his amendment follows: “Mr. Chairman, I had the Clerk read the amendment because it’s a simple one-sentence amendment. It says that none of the money in this act can be used deliberately by the President to violate law, in particular, the War Powers resolution, often referred to as the War Powers Act, which is found in Title 50 of the United States Code. This is the same amendment I offered to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill. Some 208 Members of Congress voted for that amendment. The only argument against the amendment at that time was that it wasn’t exactly appropriate or relevant to the Homeland Security bill. After all, I was preventing the funding of a violation of the War Powers Act with the funds provided to the Department of Homeland Security. Now that I offer this amendment to the Military Construction–Veterans’ Affairs bill, it is relevant. This is a bill that provides tens of billions of dollars for the Defense Department. And it is necessary and appropriate, if we are going to adopt a policy that says that money is not going to be appropriated for deliberate violations of our law, that we apply this amendment not only to the Defense Appropriations bill, but to this second bill that funds the Pentagon. Why is this amendment necessary? Because so many administrations have embraced the idea of an imperial Presidency, the idea that a President can send our forces into battle for unlimited duration, for any purpose, unlimited in scope. This is not what the Constitution nor the law provides. The War Powers Act is the law of the land, and it says the President may indeed commit our forces, but the President must seek congressional authorization and must withdraw within 60 days if that authorization is not provided by the affirmative vote of both Houses of Congress. In Libya, we face not an attack on the United States, not an attack on our allies. But even in this circumstance, this President, like others, claims that he does not have to follow the law. The administration has implied that there are substitutes for congressional authorization; they have implied that resolutions by the United Nations, the Arab League or NATO can be a substitute for congressional authorization; and they implied that consulting congressional leaders, a lunch with leadership, is a substitute for the affirmative vote of both Houses of Congress. It is time for us to stand up and say, ‘No, Mr. President, you actually have to follow the law.’ Obviously, this amendment is even more apropos to the Defense Appropriations bill, but we will be dealing with that weeks from now. The President has been violating the War Powers Act for many weeks. It is time to act today. Moreover, if we put this amendment only on the Defense Appropriations bill and don’t put it on this bill, then we invite the administration to try to figure out clever accounting ways to use the billions of dollars provided to the Defense Department in this bill to carry out operations in Libya. We should not invite a loophole hunt. We should put the same restriction on both of the bills that fund the Defense Department. Now, if we pass this amendment, the President will, I hope, request an authorization from Congress to take action in Libya, and will have to accept an authorization that I expect will be limited in time and scope. Perhaps it will say that only air forces and not ground forces may be committed. Perhaps it will require renewal every 3 or 6 months. There may be conditions on funding sources. For example, perhaps we use some of the $33 billion that Qadhafi was stupid enough to leave invested in the United States in ways that we could find and that we have frozen, rather than use taxpayer dollars. Congress will ask some tough questions. And we may put some conditions requiring certain action also by the Benghazi transitional government. We would ask why the Benghazi government has refused to disassociate itself from the al Qaeda fighters and the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group men who are in their midst and why they will not remove from that transitional government those that have American blood on their hands from Iraq and Afghanistan. This is not just the issue of an aggrandizing President. It is also the issue of a derelict Congress. Continuing military action in Libya should be conducted only consistent with American law. If Congress habitually appropriates funds knowing that those funds will be used to violate the law of the land, then we are complicit in undermining democracy and the rule of law in the United States. The question is not democracy and the rule of law in Libya; the question is democracy and the rule of law in the United States.”-30-
06.06.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Sherman today joined with Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, in introducing the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Reform and Modernization Act. The legislation improves existing law targeting firms and countries that assist these countries’ nuclear and other advanced weapons programs. The bill includes a provision authored by Congressman Sherman that would provide for sanctions against firms that provide any of the countries with equipment or technology relevant for mining or milling uranium. Iran is facing a uranium shortage, and has been searching for foreign sources of uranium as well as trying to improve its domestic capability to mine uranium. Under the bill, anyone that assists in either effort would be subject to penalties. “I look forward to working with the Chairman, Ranking Member Howard Berman and others to pass this legislation and wider Iran sanctions legislation this year,” Sherman said. “We have a number of nonproliferation bills introduced that I hope we will consider soon in Committee and pass through the House.” Although Congress enacted significant sanctions legislation last year, the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Divestment and Accountability Act (CISADA), and other countries have also stepped up sanctions, Iran has yet to abandon its nuclear weapons program. “Stopping proliferation by Iran, North Korea and Syria are top priorities for this Congress,” Sherman said. “While Iran’s economy has been affected by existing measures, it’s time we ramp up pressure on all three countries to stop developing nuclear weapons.” Earlier this year, Sherman introduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, legislation that will further isolate Iran’s crumbling energy sector and target the Revolutionary Guards that have terrorized the Iranian people. Sherman is the Ranking Democratic Member on the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade. -30-
06.02.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman offered an amendment to H.R. 2017, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act in the House. The amendment prohibits funds provided by the bill from being used to conduct military operations which violate the War Powers Resolution (also known as the War Powers Act). The vote on the amendment occurred today and nearly passed, with 111 Republicans and 97 Democrats voting in favor, and 123 Republicans and 90 Democrats voting against, and 12 members not voting. The War Powers Resolution prevents the President from conducting military action for more than 60 days without Congressional approval. Congress has not authorized military action in Libya. The administration sent a perfunctory letter to the House leadership encouraging a resolution approving military action against Qaddafi’s forces on May 20, 2011 – about 60 days after hostilities began.“We cannot bring democracy and the rule of law to Libya without safeguarding democracy and the rule of law in the United States,” said Congressman Sherman. “The War Powers Resolution is the law of the land, and we should not facilitate or tolerate its violation, even for a purportedly worthy cause.” Sherman expressed optimism about the amendment passing in a future bill. The most significant argument against the amendment was its germaneness to the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which provides only limited funding relevant for conducting a war. The amendment is more likely to pass when it is offered on the Defense Appropriations bill.“It was important to have this vote this week,” said Sherman. “The Defense Appropriations bill is weeks away – we need to demonstrate that the President needs to seek authorization for the Libya operations now.” -30-
05.16.2011	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – On Sunday, May 15th, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall Meeting at the new Valley Performing Arts Center at Cal State Northridge, fielding questions from some of the approximately 1,200 constituents who attended – one of the most widely attended Town Hall Meetings.Sherman has held over 100 Town Hall Meetings since going to Congress. The Valley Performing Arts Center at Cal State Northridge, which features a 1,700-seat Great Hall where the Town Hall Meeting took place, officially opened on January 29, 2011. Congressman Sherman helped secure federal funding for the Valley Performing Arts Center, which has hosted numerous performances from world-class performers, musicians and distinguished speakers in its first season. Yesterday, Congressman Sherman honored two outstanding Valley veterans for their heroic service in defense of our nation during World War II. Congressman Sherman presented the Purple Heart to Corporal Russell H. Bauman and three Bronze Service Stars to Naval Corpsman First Class David H. Swerdlow. With the assistance of Congressman Sherman’s constituent services staff, these brave heroes were able to receive these medals for the first time. After the presentation, Congressman Sherman responded to questions about major federal issues, including the condition of the economy, health care, education, the war in Afghanistan and the U.S./NATO intervention in Libya. “Town Hall Meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns of people in the San Fernando Valley,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “The large attendance at our Town Hall Meetings proves that the residents of the San Fernando Valley are actively engaged in their community and their government. I enjoy hearing their ideas.”Congressman Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. -30-
05.12.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, handed Dr. Mahmoud Jibril, the Interim "Prime Minister" of the Transitional National Council of Libya, the attached letter in a meeting at 3 P.M. today on Capitol Hill. Congressman Sherman urged Dr. Jibril to identify all persons who have supported al-Qaeda or the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG) and fought American troops in Afghanistan or Iraq, and bar those terrorists from service in the military or civilian operations of the Transitional National Council of Libya. In particular, Sherman urged Dr. Jibril to address the issue of Abdel-Hakim al-Hasidi. Al-Hasidi is an al-Qaeda affiliated fighter who boasts of fighting American soldiers in Afghanistan and recruiting Libyans to fight Americans in Iraq, and who claims to be a commander of rebel forces in Libya. Sherman asked if the Transitional National Council in Benghazi is willing to extradite al-Hasidi, who has claimed that he helped kill Americans. Sherman also urged the rebel leader to formally adopt a resolution in the Council ensuring that funds of the Qaddafi family and Qaddafi government frozen by the United States be used to defray the cost of U.S. military actions benefiting the Libyan people. -30-
05.02.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, released the following statement today on the killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. forces, as confirmed by President Obama last night:“The successful killing of Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks, by U.S. forces, is a major victory in the global fight against al-Qaeda and its affiliates. “While the death of Osama bin Laden does not signal the end of our struggle against terrorism, it is the most significant victory against al-Qaeda since September 11, 2001. “I applaud President Obama’s leadership, as well as the superb professionalism of our armed forces and intelligence community, in the successful effort to bring this terrorist leader to justice. The U.S. must continue to pursue al-Qaeda members and affiliates around the world who seek to harm us and our allies.” -30-
04.20.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, the Ranking Member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, reintroduced the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act late last week. Sherman’s new bill would tighten economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran and its remaining business partners. Congressman Ed Royce is the lead Republican cosponsor of the bill. Sherman first introduced the bill in the previous Congress in September 2010. Senator Robert Casey and Senator Scott Brown introduced similar legislation under the same name in the Senate in December 2010. President Obama signed into law the last round of economic sanctions against Iran on July 1, 2010. In the wake of the new American statute and a new round of U.N. sanctions, the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies enacted tougher trade sanctions against Iran, effectively barring their firms from developing Iran’s energy sector and reducing Iran’s access to the international financial system. Sherman’s bill seeks to follow on with even more measures designed to isolate Iran. “Existing Iran sanctions have had a significant impact on Iran’s economy, but have not achieved the ultimate goal of ending Iran’s nuclear weapons program. We must continue to enact tougher sanctions to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically, and we must act now,” said Sherman. Among the provisions of the bill, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act would definitively end the practice of American corporations conducting business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries, sanction entities that provide loans to the government of Iran, sanction firms that prepay for future Iranian oil and gas deliveries, and target the IRGC and its business partners for greater sanctions. A longer summary of the provisions of the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act is below. Summary of the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, H.R. 1655112th Congress Sanction Entities that Pay in Advance for Oil Deliveries or Sign Long-Term Contracts to Purchase Oil and Gas from Iran. In 2003, Japanese purchasers reportedly paid several billion in cash for future oil deliveries over the course of several years. In 2008, the Swiss firm EGL reportedly signed a contract worth nearly $20 billion for future purchases of Iranian gas. When the world buys Iranian oil and gas, they should do so on a cash basis without long term commitment, lest they provide the Iranian government with, in effect, a bailout. The bill will make these agreements and transactions sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA). Sanction Entities that Subscribe to Iranian Sovereign Debt. Iran recently announced that a subsidiary of its national oil company has issued $4.2 billion in bonds to help finance the development of the South Pars gas field. The bill includes a provision that would make buying or facilitating the issuance of Iranian sovereign debt, including government bonds or bonds issued by a state-controlled firm, an activity sanctionable under the ISA.Provide for Sanctions Against Firms that Enter into Joint Ventures or Other Investment Arrangements with Iran’s National Oil Company or Other Iranian Firms. Late last year, BP announced it was suspending a project involving Iran’s national oil company off the coast of Scotland due to concerns about EU sanctions. We need to encourage other companies with similar arrangements to follow suit. Currently, Iran’s national oil company has invested in a number of joint ventures to develop oil and natural gas projects outside of Iran. These type of deals provide Iran’s state oil firm with access to technology and capital. Entering into these types of arrangements should be sanctionable to the same extent as an energy investment in Iran would be under the Iran Sanctions Act. Subsidiaries of U.S. Firms Conducting Business in Iran. Currently, the Iran sanctions regulations allow the foreign subsidiaries of American firms to conduct business in Iran that would be prohibited if conducted by the American firm, so long as no U.S. person and no one working at the American firm is involved. A number of U.S firms, most notably the Halliburton Corporation, have conducted business in Iran through their overseas subsidiaries. This provision would punish the U.S. parent entity for the activities of a foreign subsidiary that would violate current U.S. sanctions if they were conducted by a U.S. person – effectively ending the Halliburton loophole. This provision is based on legislation from previous Congresses, including an amendment to H.R. 282 from the 109th Congress, a bill authored by Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. Fighting the IRGC. Provisions in the new Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act (CISADA) target the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps and other designated entities through a financial sanction – any financial institution that conducts business with them will have their business in the United States severely curtailed. This provision does not target commercial transactions with the IRGC and its affiliates; also, Treasury has designated only about 60 IRGC-related entities, while we know that the IRGC operates its business and procurement operations through hundreds of fronts. The bill contains a provision that would require an expedited campaign at the Treasury Department to designate the hundreds of front companies and agents that operate on behalf of the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corps, especially in sensitive industries such as the energy sector. The bill also provides for secondary sanctions against any firms that continue to do business with them or the main IRGC. This language is based on stand-alone legislation developed with Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen during the 111th Congress (H.R. 2375).Deny Tax Benefits to Companies that Violate the Iran Sanctions Act. This provision would deny favorable amortization rules for exploration expenditures for any corporate family of companies that has violated the Iran Sanctions Act’s prohibition on investment in the energy sector of Iran. This is similar to provisions included in H.R. 1400, authored by the late Rep. Tom Lantos, from the 110th Congress. Prevent Aircraft Parts and Services Transfers. Current law provides for special licensing of aircraft repair and servicing of U.S. origin aircraft owned by Iran. If they are unable to fly due to needed repairs, those planes should remain grounded until the nuclear crisis is resolved. Unfortunately, the State Department recently noticed its intent to license the inspection and repair of 15 U.S. origin aircraft, including four planes operated by Mahan Air, a suspected IRGC front company. Comprehensive Denial of U.S. and State Government Business to those Who Conduct Sanctionable Activity in Iran. The bill will include provisions that bar companies who conduct activities sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act from receiving any taxpayer funds or other governmental assistance through OPIC, Ex-Im, TDA, foreign aid and other programs. The bill will also require that the TSP divest of firms that run afoul of the Iran Sanctions Act. Expanding the provisions of CISADA, the bill would also allow U.S. states and local jurisdictions to enact laws to deny licenses -- for example, permission to sell insurance -- to firms that conduct activities sanctionable under the ISA. Mining and Milling Equipment. Current law provides for sanctions against a firm if it provides nuclear or other WMD technology or advanced conventional arms to Iran, North Korea or Syria. Known as the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act, or INKSNA, this statute is a key weapon in our nonproliferation arsenal. Iran’s supply of uranium is limited, and Iran has sought to obtain uranium from a number of foreign sources and through domestic mining. Supplying mining and milling equipment to Iran for its uranium mines is not currently sanctionable. This language is similar to legislation developed with Chairman Ros-Lehtinen and current Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee Chairman Ed Royce in the last Congress (H.R. 2290). Reduce Contributions to the World Bank if it Resumes Lending or Other Assistance to Iran. From 2000-2005, as the United States sought to stop Iran’s nuclear program, the World Bank approved some $1.4 billion in loans to Iran. We must stop this respected financial institution from approving any further assistance to Iran and work to prevent the distribution of the benefits already approved. The bill would require that the U.S. work to stop disbursements and prevent future assistance. It would reduce funding for the Work Bank should it resume lending to Iran. Divestment Tax Benefits. The bill will contain a series of provisions that allow taxpayers to defer the recognition of capital gains on the sale of companies conducting sensitive business in Iran, so long as the taxpayer purchases replacement investments without such connections to Iran. The taxpayer would pay taxes on the gain when they sold the replacement property, of course. American investors are beginning to seek investments without ties to terrorism. This measure could provide modest encouragement for such beneficial financial decisions (similar to H.R. 3516, from the 111th Congress). Bar Entry for Those that Engage in, or Serve as Senior Executives in Companies that Engage in, Sanctionable Activities. This provision would bar from the United States senior executives at corporations that conduct activities sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act and other statutes targeting Iran. This provides additional, powerful disincentive for corporate decision-makers (new provision, not in 111th version of this legislation).-30-
04.14.2011	Let the Sun Shine on Government, Says ShermanWASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced the introduction of the Faster FOIA Act, which establishes an advisory commission of experts and government officials to study whether changes in federal law and policy are needed to ensure more effective and timely compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) law.The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) created a system for citizens to obtain government records, but the process overly burdens citizens and deters them from seeking information to which they are entitled.The Faster FOIA Act would direct the 16–member Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays Commission to report to Congress and the president on how to reduce the lengthy delays in the federal government’s handling of FOIA inquiries. The committee study would specifically attempt to identify methods of reducing delay in FOIA processing, create an efficient and equitable processing system, and examine whether the charging of fees and granting of waivers needs to be reformed. It would be required to issue a report within one year of the enactment of the legislation. The bill is based on legislation Sherman introduced last Congress and identical to legislation the Senate Judiciary Committee marked up last week.“It is time for the pendulum to swing back to favor a more open democracy and let the sun shine, opening the doors to a more accessible and transparent government,” said Congressman Sherman. “We must improve the accountability, accessibility, and openness of the federal government by improving FOIA.”Several years ago, President Bush signed an executive order requiring agencies to designate a senior official to oversee compliance with the law that for 40 years has provided an important tool for reporters and citizens to obtain information about the government. Sherman was honored to attend the signing ceremony (photo attached), but the president’s order failed to address his administration’s own policies, which dramatically reduced public access to government documents. -30-
04.08.2011	Washington, DC -- Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that he will not accept his federal salary during a government shutdown, should one occur.“I will be fighting in Washington to prevent a government shutdown, but if the government does shut down, I will return all compensation that I otherwise would be entitled to,” said Sherman. “What my colleagues choose to do is up to them. However, I do not feel right accepting compensation during a period of time when people are being denied government services and when many federal employees, including members of my staff, are on furlough.” Sherman supported legislation that would keep the government open for one additional week of negotiations without pre-conditions. Unfortunately, this legislative action failed to achieve a majority in the House. -30-
04.06.2011	Washington, DC -- Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement concerning the Republican plan to seriously undermine Medicare benefits.“Earlier this week the House Republican leader on budget issues, Chairman Paul Ryan, released the budget plan of Republicans in the House of Representatives. The plan slashes corporate tax rates and pays for it by slashing Medicare. I agree with the AARP’s condemnation of the proposal.” The AARP stated on April 5: “The [Republican] Chairman's proposal, rather than tackling skyrocketing health care costs, would simply shift these costs onto the backs of people in Medicare. It would undermine Medicare's promise of secure health coverage---a guarantee that future seniors have contributed to through a lifetime of hard work. If Congress is serious about reining in Medicare costs, it can start by allowing Medicare to negotiate for lower drug prices and speeding up access to generic versions of expensive biologic drugs. “…If we're serious about lowering health care costs, we cannot just look to Medicare for savings. We must improve the delivery of health care, including better coordination of care, and remove waste from the entire health care system. “Any changes to Social Security must be focused on ensuring the retirement security of present and future retirees, and not simply to reduce the deficit. AARP agrees that protecting and strengthening Social Security must be done on a bipartisan basis, and we welcome the opportunity to continue the conversation with our membership and all Americans about how to achieve that goal. “As we tackle our nation's fiscal challenges, we urge that we not upend crucial programs that will come at the cost of seniors' health and financial security. We will work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to discuss proposals with the goal of enhancing the health and income security of older Americans and their families.” “I agree with the AARP that we must work to balance our nation’s budget. This requires that we grow our economy, eliminate unnecessary government spending and close corporate tax loopholes. “We should not dismantle Medicare in order to balance the federal budget. As to the Social Security Trust Fund, we must remember that it belongs to the working people who contributed to Social Security—it is not the government’s money, and it is not available to be used to balance the federal budget. “I look forward to working with Republicans and Democrats to put our fiscal house in order. I co-founded the CPA caucus, a bi-partisan group of members of the House of Representatives who are certified public accounts and are bringing a CPA approach to the Federal budget. “But dismantling Medicare or turning it into a voucher program, or privatizing Social Security, will hurt seniors and will do little to balance the federal budget.”-30-
04.04.2011	Washington, DC -- Congressman Brad Sherman and House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen called on the Secretary of State to withhold pending licenses for the inspection and repair of U.S.-made engines on Iranian aircraft in order to maintain pressure on the Iranian government until it abandons its nuclear weapons program and support for terrorism in a letter signed by several key Members of the House and Senate. The 15 aircraft currently in service on Iranian airlines use an American engine that was the subject of a Federal Aviation Administration safety bulletin last year. These aircraft were sold to the Iranians while the Shah was in power, in the 1970s. While transfers of aircraft parts and services to Iran are generally prohibited, as is most trade with Iran, there is a special, infrequently used waiver process for repairs necessary due to a safety issue with American-made aircraft. Sherman has called for this loophole to be closed. “There is no reason we should be helping the Iranians keep these planes in the air,” Sherman said. “Our message should be – these planes are unsafe, they should be grounded, and they should remain grounded until Tehran grounds its nuclear weapons program.” “Fixing these aircraft is in 180 degree opposition to our sanctions policy, which if properly implemented, would provide for Iran’s increased economic and political isolation,” Sherman added. Their letter notes that Iran’s “civilian” aircraft have been used to further Iran’s proliferation activities, including the supply of weapons to terrorist and groups supported by Iran, citing the recent grounding of a “civilian” Ilyushin plane in Turkey bound for Syria, on which weapons were reportedly found. “Iran does not simply fly its civilian aircraft to carry passengers and legitimate cargo – some of these planes are in use by Mahan Air, a company designated by the Commerce Department and believed to be affiliated with the IRGC,” Sherman said. Legislation introduced last year by Congressman Sherman, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, which he will soon reintroduce, would prohibit the transfer of any goods, services or technology needed to keep Iran’s American-made aircraft flying.-30-
03.30.2011	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman today received the Humane Champion Award from the Humane Society of the United States. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on an animal welfare issue and for his perfect score on the Humane Society’s 2010 Legislative Scorecard. The Humane Society was particularly appreciative of Sherman’s leadership in introducing the Sportsmanship in Hunting Act (H.R. 2308), which would create a federal prohibition on Internet hunting and establish penalties for those who violate the prohibition. The legislation was strongly supported by the Humane Society. “Congressman Sherman is such an outstanding champion for animal protection in the U.S. Congress, leading the way on important legislation and always taking account of the impacts on animals,” said Wayne Pacelle, president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. “We are so fortunate to have him giving voice to these concerns and helping to make this a more humane world.”The inhumane practice of Internet hunting, also called remote-controlled hunting, occurs when a customer uses a computer and the Internet to aim and fire a weapon that is mounted on a mechanized tripod at a remote location, usually a game ranch where the hunted animals are penned. Canned hunting, in which customers pay to shoot tame, exotic animals within the confines of an enclosure where the animals have no chance of escape, would also be banned by the bill. These practices are cruel and have no resemblance whatsoever to traditional hunting. “We thank Congressman Sherman for his compassion and determination to ensure that our animal welfare laws reflect our basic values and attitudes shared by people across the country,” said Humane Society Legislative Fund President Michael Markarian.The Humane Society boasts 25,911 supporters in Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley district and more than 11 million nationwide.-30-To view the photo of Congressman Sherman receiving the award, click here.
03.24.2011	Washington, DC -- Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) today released the following response to the document issued by the United States Trade Representative (USTR) regarding the Kaesong Industrial Zone and how the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (Agreement) would treat goods produced at this facility: “The USTR’s document says that this administration believes that it would require a statute to alter the status of the Kaesong Industrial Zone under the Agreement. This is a positive development in the sense that USTR had not previously made such a statement in writing (at least that I am aware of), but it hardly puts the matter to rest. “First, the USTR document has absolutely no legislative significance. This commitment to seek a statute before goods produced at Kaesong or other similar areas north of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) are treated as though they are in effect South Korean needs to be in the implementing legislation. The language needs to be iron-clad – any goods produced at Kaesong or anywhere else north of the DMZ are banned from entering the U.S. unless and until a joint resolution is passed by both houses of Congress changing their status. A mere letter or statement does not prohibit this administration, nor the next one, from interpreting the vague language of Annex 22-B to require something less than a statute. “However, there is a more significant problem. There are actually two disparate issues concerning Kaesong and North Korea with respect to the agreement and this USTR document addresses only one of them. While the USTR attempts to resolve concerns about goods fully produced or assembled in Kaesong, separately, the FTA could provide benefits to goods containing significant Kaesong (or other North Korean) content for which final assembly occurs in South Korea. “The document does not address this issue of content or ‘inputs’ that are incorporated into goods that, for the purposes of the Agreement, are considered South Korean. Goods with up to 65 percent non-South Korean, non-US content may be considered ‘South Korean’ under the rules of origin in the Agreement (different categories of goods have different permissible levels of foreign content). Nothing in the Agreement says that the foreign content allowable may not be North Korean – whether from Kaesong or some other place in North Korea. “That remains a huge flaw in the Agreement. While I brought both problems to the attention of the USTR long ago, they chose for some reason to address only one in their paper. One can only assume at this point that they do not yet have a credible response to the other, perhaps larger, problem of North Korean inputs coming to the U.S. as part of South Korean goods. “The language of the agreement is clear on its face. Many goods made with significant North Korean content that are assembled in South Korea may enter the United States. If we try to prevent them from entering the United States, we will be in violation of the agreement and will be forced either to relent and allow those goods in, or face retaliation.” “A similar scenario has played itself out with respect to Mexican trucks – we attempted to enforce our domestic safety laws against language in a free trade agreement and lost. When we continued to enforce our domestic law, the Mexicans were allowed to retaliate, slapping hundreds of millions in tariffs on U.S. exports to Mexico. “To fix this problem, there will need to be changes to the agreement to make it clear that we have the unambiguous right to bar goods with any North Korean content from entering the United States.” -30-
03.10.2011	Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) today released the following statement on the planned consideration of the South Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement: Congress should reject the pending FTA with South Korea. It is likely that the United States would be opened up to North Korean goods under the agreement’s liberal rules of origin. Goods with up to 65 percent non-South Korean content can enter the United States with preferential, often duty free, treatment under this agreement. Nothing in this agreement prevents that foreign content from being North Korean. Also, the language purporting to govern the so-called Kaesong Industrial Complex is intentionally vague. Goods entirely produced in sweatshops north of the DMZ may end up being given the same treatment as South Korean goods under the agreement. The 40,000 workers at Kaesong are not paid by their South Korean employers. The money goes to the North Korean government. Along with several millions in fees, these payments provide hard currency for the North Korean government to maintain its grip on power and pursue nuclear proliferation. If we are serious about denying North Korea the cash it needs to pursue its nefarious aims, we would ensure that this free trade agreement was clear, that no North Korean goods will be allowed into the United States. In hearings on July 13, 2007 and again by letter on February 9, 2011, I asked the United States Trade Representative for a clear statement that goods made 100 percent at Kaesong could not be given access to the United States market unless approved by future statutory enactment. Silence on both occasions provides a clear answer. As the South Korean Ambassador said in 2007, “the planned ratification of the Korea-U.S. FTA will pave the way,” for Kaesong goods in the United States. Congressman Sherman is the Ranking Democratic Member on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism Nonproliferation and Trade.

02.09.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressmen Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Michael Conaway (R-TX) announced the creation of the Bipartisan Congressional CPA Caucus. Congressman Sherman and Congressman Michael Conaway (R-TX) will act as co-chairs. The Congressional CPA Caucus will serve as an informal, bipartisan group of Members who are CPAs, dedicated to discussing and formulating innovative policy approaches to the issues affecting CPAs – including tax administration and compliance and accounting and auditing standards. The Caucus will work to reduce the compliance burden of our tax laws. It will also seek to provide input on issues being debated by Congress on which CPA’s have particular expertise – including budgeting and fiscal issues. “Establishing the CPA Caucus allows us to educate our colleagues about the importance of the accounting profession to American business, and to share our expertise on tax administration and compliance,” said Congressman Sherman, who is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee. “We also hope to bring a bipartisan CPA perspective to the fiscal and budgeting issues facing Congress.” Prior to being elected to Congress, Sherman, who represents the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, was a Tax Law Specialist and CPA. He audited large business and government entities, provided tax counsel and advised small businesses on tax issues. Congressman Michael Conaway, an advocate for a simpler and fairer tax system, has sponsored legislation that would bring more accountability in government funding. Conaway earned a degree in Accounting from Texas A & M University-Commerce and, before coming to Congress, worked for Price Waterhouse & Co. “Taxpayer dollars should be spent wisely, or not at all. It is our responsibility to revaluate the spending process in Congress. I look forward to working with our fellow CPAs in Congress to ensure a platform through which we can share our perspective, informed by our unique education and experience, with the rest of our colleagues,” said Conaway. There are eight CPAs in the 112th Congress. In addition to Sherman and Conaway, Congressman John Campbell (R-CA), Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins (R-KS), Congressman Collin Peterson (D-MN) are all certified public accountants, as are newly-elected Congressmen Steven Palazzo (R-MS), James Renacci (R-OH) and Bill Flores (R-TX).
02.09.2011	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced his selection as the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade to be chaired by Congressman Ed Royce (R-CA).“I am honored to be selected by my colleagues to once again serve as the lead Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. I look forward to working with my friend and colleague, Congressman Ed Royce, and to continuing to address the challenges we face from the proliferation of dangerous weapons, international terrorism, and massive trade deficits,” Sherman said.Congressman Sherman has been the lead Democrat on the terrorism subcommittee since its inception in 2003. He served as chairman from 2007 to 2011.Sherman has been a particularly vocal advocate for strong sanctions against the Islamic Republic of Iran for the purposes of containing the terrorist state’s nuclear weapons program. Sherman’s legislation, The Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program Act, would add to the list of Iran-related activities that are sanctionable and would raise the penalties on individuals and companies continuing to do business with Tehran.
01.12.2011	Those Who Advocate Violence Should Be RepudiatedWASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Sherman issued the following statement about the need to tone down political rhetoric in the wake of the tragedy in Tucson.“When you have a heart attack, it’s time to stop smoking. It’s not necessary to wait for proof that tar and nicotine caused that particular heart attack.“For years we have inhaled the toxic fumes of violent political rhetoric. It’s time to stop now. If violent rhetoric was not the precise and provable cause of the assassination attempt in Tucson, it will surely be the cause of violence in the future. Those whose language and rhetoric go over the line must be criticized and disowned, not only by their opponents, but also by their supporters. So far, this has too rarely happened.” “Last summer Sharon Angle stated ‘if this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies,’ followed by the statement, ‘what we need to do is take Harry Reid out.’[1] Read in context, her statements implied that if her side could not control Congress through ballots, they should use bullets. These statements should have derailed her Senate campaign, but Angle paid only a slight political price. Even when she repeated the same sentiments again, Angle continued to receive unqualified support and money from respectable mainstream Republicans.[2] “As Gabrielle Giffords said last spring, ‘people really need to realize that the rhetoric and firing people up… They’ve got to realize that there are consequences to that action… community leaders, not just political leaders, need to stand back when things get fired up and say whoa—let’s take a step back here.’[3]-30- [1] Greg Sargent, Washington Post, 6/15/20 - https://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/06/sharron_angle_floated_possibil.html[2] Anjeanette Damon and David McGrath Schwartz, Las Vegas Sun, 6/17/10 - https://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jun/17/senate-race-armed-revolt-angles-rhetoric-candidate/[3] Gabrielle Giffords, MSNBC, March 25, 2010
12.28.2010	Economic Recession Pressuring Valley Families WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the U.S. Census Bureau's 2009 San Fernando Valley Census Report. At his request, the Census Bureau updated the report using detailed data from the 2009 American Community Survey (ACS). The Valley Census Report offers an annual demographic snapshot of the San Fernando Valley to help community organizations, businesses, and government leaders make better-informed decisions affecting the Valley's future and help our region compete for its fair share of funding for transportation improvements, housing, and social service programs. The first-ever Valley Census Report was released in December 2006, also at Congressman Sherman's request. The Census Bureau will release decennial census data by April 2011. "The Valley Census Report reveals important information about the Valley's diverse population and the challenges it will continue to encounter as we recover from the economic recession," said Congressman Sherman. "The Valley's rich cultural diversity and highly educated workforce stands apart from other large regions, but the economic recession has prevented many Valley families from achieving economic security and homeownership," said Sherman. The more than 1.77 million people who live in the Valley exceed the populations of all but the four largest cities in the United States - New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. According to the 2009 ACS data, the Valley's population has increased 4.7% since the 2000 Census. The Valley Census Report shows that Valley residents spend, on average, nearly a half-hour (28.2 minutes) commuting to work, which is nearly 6% longer than the average Californian and 11% longer than the average American. Although commute times have decreased slightly from a year ago, Congressman Sherman continues to highlight the need to develop more transit alternatives and highway improvements for Valley residents, such as a transit corridor through the Sepulveda Pass to connect the Metro Orange Line and the future subway extension to Westwood and additional improvements to the 101/405 interchange. Valley residents, on average, are more educated than other parts of the City and County with 117,365 people with graduate or professional degrees and another 259,125 with bachelor's degrees. Since 2000, the Valley has had a nearly 26% increase (77,458) in those with bachelor's or advanced degrees. Valley residents have access to renowned colleges and universities, such as California State University, Northridge, Woodbury University, Pierce College, Valley College, and Mission College, and efforts must continue to educate, train and retain this skilled workforce. In 2009, the median home value as self-reported on the American Community Survey form by respondents in the Valley ($458,700) was higher than the median home value in Los Angeles County ($441,400) and California ($384,200), and was nearly triple the U.S. median home value ($185,200). According to the CSUN San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center Housing Report for October 2010, Valley home transactions decreased 30.4% from a year ago, but housing prices remain stable. Also in 2009, nearly half of Valley homeowners (117,420) were spending 35% or more of their income on housing. Overall, the median monthly mortgage and homeowner's costs have increased nearly 10% ($2,381 to $2,632) since 2000. This dramatically contrasts with the U.S. as a whole, where only about a quarter spend over 35% of their income on housing. The report also shows that poverty continues to plague many Valley families (11.1%, or over 44,401 households, have incomes below $15,000). Although the poverty rate has decreased over the last eight years in the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles, the figures have edged upward within the last year due to the impact of the economic recession. "The just released 2009 American Community Survey shows how the recent recession put pressure on the San Fernando Valley," said Dr. William W. Roberts, Director of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center at California State University, Northridge. According to Dr. Roberts, Valley residents that drove to work solo dropped by 3 percent and the average commute time fell by over a minute from 29.4 minutes in 2008 to 28.2 minutes in 2009. Notably, individuals working at home rose by over 30 percent to 44,500 in 2009. "While the greatest impact of the recession shows in the substantial rise in unemployment, the median household income declined by less than 3 percent," explained Dr. Roberts. "The Valley continues to be home for a highly diverse population employed in a broad range of industries. This diversity has helped us weather the economic downturn and should yield significantly improved figures for 2010," added Dr. Roberts. "The results of the 2010 decennial census have a major impact on the drawing of political boundaries. That is why it's important that the San Fernando Valley be seen as an identifiable 'place,' both demographically and socially as these will be criteria used in determining legislative districts," explained Robert L. Scott, Director of the Mulholland Institute (a division of The Valley Economic Alliance). "The 2010 decennial data will be used throughout the coming decade, by government, non-profits and businesses in distributing services and making strategic decisions on a range of issues that affect the economics and development of our communities." The entire report is available online in ms-excel format. -30- 2000 Population SFV: 1.69 million LA: 3.69 million Race/Ethnicity SFV White: 44% (746,392) Latino: 38.9% (659,878) Black: 3.7% (62,764)

The Caucus recognizes the economic and cultural contribution of the entertainment sector, and the many challenges to the industry today, such as copyright protection, runaway production, and the development of new digital mediums. The Caucus serves as a forum to discuss and formulate innovative approaches to challenges confronting the entertainment industry.“After establishing the congressional Entertainment Industry Caucus seven years ago, I am very proud of how far we have come. We made Congress more aware of the entertainment industry’s concerns, educating our colleagues about how the businesses associated with this industry are impacted by legislation and the legislative process,” said outgoing chair, Congresswoman Diane Watson (D-CA). “I am particularly proud of my staff member Dorinda White for taking the Caucus’ work to new levels over the last three years.”During Congresswoman Watson’s tenure, the Caucus drafted legislation to extend tax credits to the industry, helped facilitate charitable contributions abroad, and worked with our industry allies, such as James Cameron and Sony Pictures, to highlight how their creative productions intersect with the public policy debate.“I am honored to follow Congresswoman Watson as the next Chair of the Entertainment Industries Caucus,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “The entertainment industry generates billions of dollars and millions of jobs, and the Caucus will remain dedicated to ensuring that continues to happen.”Congressman Sherman represents the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, California, which is home to studios and music labels, as well as musicians, actors, and other entertainment industry employees. Sherman has been fighting to protect and enhance intellectual property rights. He also has been a consistent supporter of ensuring that musicians get the right to be paid for the radio performance of their work.“I am honored to serve as Vice Chair of the Congressional Entertainment Industries Caucus in the 112th Congress. As Vice Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, protecting intellectual property and ensuring that it is safe from both international and domestic piracy has been one of my top priorities,” said Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (D-CA). “I’m also hopeful that our mainstream media will continue to become more reflective of our nation’s growing diversity. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that our entertainment industry remains as vibrant and successful as ever.”Congressman Sherman’s Chief Counsel, Marc Berkman, will serve as point of contact on Entertainment Industry Caucus related issues.
12.06.2010	[Washington, DC] – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade issued the following statement concerning the proposed U.S. – South Korea Trade Pact: “It’s all well and good to increase exports, but not if we increase imports by an even larger amount. Every trade pact increases American employment in some industries, and costs jobs in other industries.” “Proponents of the trade pact are arguing it will increase U.S. exports to South Korea by $11 billion. This may well be accurate, but it is on the basis of an incomplete analysis. “I’m extremely concerned that the proposed trade pact will increase U.S. imports from South Korea far more than it increases our exports to South Korea. Calculations by the Economic Policy Institute show that our trade deficit in 2008 with South Korea was some $13.4 billion dollars. The Economic Policy Institute further estimates that in 2015 our trade deficit will more than double to $26.9 billion if we enter into a free trade agreement with South Korea. “I look forward to looking at the last-minute changes made to the text to see whether any new concessions by South Korea altered the conclusions reached by the Economic Policy Institute. Any trade agreement that increases our imports substantially more than our exports will cost America jobs.”

10.26.2010	[Washington, DC] -- Congressman Brad Sherman applauded Secretary of Education Arne Duncan for agreeing to return to its 2004 policy and applying Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to the protection of Jewish students from anti-Semitism on campuses. “For two years, I have been pushing the U.S. Department of Education to adopt this policy, held numerous meetings with the Department’s officials, and conversations with Secretary Duncan. The policy is now clear: colleges and universities will no longer be permitted to turn a blind eye when Jewish students face severe and persistent anti-Semitic hostility on their campuses. The schools will now be compelled to respond.” Congress passed Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect students from discriminatory harassment. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on “race, color, or national origin.” Unfortunately, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education (OCR) had recently revised its policy and decided that Title VI does not apply to acts of discrimination against Jewish students, erroneously claiming that because Judaism is a religion that Jews do not constitute an ethnic group. Recently, there have been multiple, unsettling incidents involving anti-Semitic epithets, slurs, obscenities and even physical violence towards students at American schools. These incidents include: At the University of North Dakota, a student was harassed by fellow students with anti-Semitic slurs and was shot at with a pellet gun. At the University of California at Irvine, a Holocaust memorial was destroyed; posters have depicted women in traditional Muslim garb saying “God bless Hitler;” swastikas have defaced campus property; and a Jewish student was told to “Go back to Russia where you came from.” In response to these tragic events, Sherman began intense efforts to convince the Department of Education to return to its 2004 policy and protect Jewish students on campuses, including a letter of April 30, 2008 signed by 5 members of Congress. This policy change has been supported by the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) and Hillel, as well as the American Jewish Committee, B’nai B’rith, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the Anti-Defamation League and U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. Sherman pledges to continue to work to protect Jewish students, and all Jews, from anti-Semitism. The Department of Education also announced that it would use Title IX of the Civil Rights Act (which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex) to protect LGBT students, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act to protect students with disabilities from harassment on campus. Sherman applauds this decision. Click here to read the letter to Secretary Duncan’s predecessor at the Department of Education Secretary Spellings, concerning the protection of Jewish students.
10.20.2010	[Washington, DC] – Congressman Brad Sherman led a bipartisan group of nine lawmakers in writing to the General Counsel of the Federal Housing Finance Authority (FHFA), Alfred Pollard, in support of the FHFA’s draft regulation to restrict private transfer fee covenants. The lawmakers applauded the FHFA for restricting Government Sponsored Entities (GSEs) of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks from investing in mortgages with private transfer fee covenants. They called the FHFA’s proposed guidance “an effective measure that protects consumers and the security of the GSEs from this predatory financial scheme.”Typically, a private transfer fee occurs when a property’s developer quietly slips the fee into a covenant or deed restriction to the property. The covenant requires the seller to pay one percent of the sales price to a Wall Street Investment Trust each time the home is sold, for the next 99 years.“Private transfer fees provide no benefit to homeowners, the property or the public, but rather steal homeowners’ equity, cloud title to the real estate and depress home prices in the community,” Sherman and his colleagues wrote to Pollard.As the letter states, private transfer fees take an already complicated real estate transaction and make it more difficult. Homeowners usually do not become aware of the fee until they close on their home or, worse, when they try to sell their home years later. Even real estate professionals have difficulty discovering whether a private transfer fee covenant has been placed on a property. And the security of the lender is impaired, as the fee must be paid even if there is a foreclosure.Sherman’s letter was signed by (in alphabetical order) Representatives Joe Baca (D-CA), Judy Biggert (R-IL), Ruben Hinojosa (D-TX), Donald Manzullo (R-IL), Brad Miller (D-NC), Charles Rangel (D-NY), Albio Sires (D-NJ), and Maxine Waters (D-CA), who chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity.Click here to view the October 14, 2010 letter.

Reduce the interest rate on student loans without cost to the government. Provide relief from the AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax). Adopt the Credit Card Holders Bill of Rights. End the TARP program (the Wall Street Bailout) and return $225 billion to the Treasury. (In 2008, Sherman led the fight against adopting TARP in the first place.) Audit the Federal Reserve. Congressman Sherman has cosponsored additional legislation to make such audits more frequent and effective. Stop predatory mortgage lending. Increase the “conforming loan limit” for areas where homes cost more than the national average, like the San Fernando Valley. This prevented a major increase in interest rates for those buying, selling, or refinancing a home in the Valley. Accelerate construction of the new northbound lane on the 405 Freeway, which will open in early 2013. Accelerate construction of both a new southbound and northbound lane on the Valley portion of the 5 Freeway, which will open in 2012. Improve the Sepulveda Basin and protect the Santa Monica Mountains. Sherman has consistently earned a 100% rating from the Sierra Club in its evaluation of his voting record. Break up banks that are “too big to fail.” Reform Wall Street by cracking down on those who created the financial crisis, increasing capital requirements, ending conflicts of interest at bond rating agencies, and controlling the shadowy world of derivatives. Provide extended unemployment insurance benefits to those who diligently search for a job, but cannot find work during the recession.Fight wasteful government spending. Impose sanctions on Iran for as long as Iran continues to develop nuclear weapons. Very substantially increase funding for veterans health care, including a new MRI machine and other equipment for the Sepulveda VA facility in North Hills.
10.04.2010	Washington, DC -- Secretary of Education Arne Duncan reported to Congressman Brad Sherman about the progress that the Department of Education is making on the issue of whether Title VI of the Civil Rights Act protects Jewish students from anti-Semitism on campus. “I’m extremely encouraged as a result of my conversation with Secretary Duncan,” reported Sherman. “I’m more than cautiously optimistic that the Department of Education will return to the policy it had adopted in 2004. Under that policy the U.S. Department of Education required all schools receiving federal aid to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic attacks.” “Unfortunately in 2007, the Department of Education reversed its policy,” Sherman continued. “It concluded that Title VI which protects students from bigotry occasioned by “race, color, national origin” didn’t apply to Jews. Since then there have been numerous reports of anti-Semitic attacks and intimidation on campuses including Yale University, the University of California at Irvine, the University of North Dakota, and San Francisco State University, to name a few.” In April 2008, Congressman Sherman began intense efforts to convince the Department of Education to return to its 2004 policy and protect Jewish students on college campuses, including a letter of April 30, 2008 signed by 5 members of Congress. Sherman’s efforts have included numerous telephone calls, meetings, letters and an occasional veiled threat, or at least language that could have been so interpreted. Sherman’s efforts have been supported by the Zionist Organization of America and Hillel, as well as the American Jewish Committee, B’nai B’rith, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the Anti-Defamation League and U.S. Senator Arlen Specter. Morton A. Klein, President of the Zionist Organization of America, praised this potentially historic breakthrough from the Department of Education, due in significant part to Congressman Sherman’s efforts: “The ZOA is proud to have spent many years working side by side with Congressman Sherman to finally ensure that Jewish students are afforded the same protection from harassment, intimidation and discrimination that other ethnic and racial groups have enjoyed since 1964 under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Colleges and universities will no longer be permitted to turn a blind eye when Jewish students face severe and persistent anti-Semitic hostility on their campuses. They will now be compelled to respond.” -30-
10.01.2010	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced the introduction of dramatic legislation, H.R. 6384, that would eliminate so-called “right-to-work” laws, which was applauded by AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. Sherman has a strong record of supporting working men and women and earned a 100% rating from the AFL-CIO. Right-to-work laws require unions to represent non dues-paying employees, thereby undermining the basic premise and promise of union membership and creating free riders – people who are exempt from paying their fair share. Right-to-work laws create different standards for union membership in different states. This results not only in confusion over the regulation of union membership, but also places a higher cost on worker representation in labor rights states. Right-to-work laws have come to be known as right-to-work-for-less laws, because employees in states with these laws average about $5,333 a year less than workers in labor rights states. Even a conservative American Enterprise Institute scholar argues that right-to-work laws would violate international labor standards that have been accepted by most of the world for decades. Similarly, in testimony at Congressman Sherman’s March 10, 2010 hearing entitled “International Worker Rights, U.S. Foreign Policy and the International Economy”, the U.S. Department of State expressed concerns about efforts to undermine the right to organize throughout the world. “I do not believe that there should be a right to be treated unfairly or to endure unnecessary restrictions. Right-to-work laws strip unions of their legitimate ability to collect dues, even when the worker is covered by a union-negotiated collective bargaining agreement. This forces unions to use their time and members’ dues to provide benefits to free riders who are exempt from paying their fair share,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “These laws are harmful to states like California, which allows labor unions to organize, because now we have to compete with the race to the bottom as our companies have to compete with those where the workers would like better wages, working conditions and benefits but are unable to organize to get them.” "With the introduction of legislation banning so-called right-to-work, Congressman Sherman has once again demonstrated his strong commitment to working families," said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO. "Right-to-work laws undermine the economy and weaken workers' ability to bargain for better working conditions, which translates into lower pay and fewer benefits for everyone." In 1947, Section 14(b) of the Taft Hartley Act stripped the Federal government of its role in protecting the American workers’ right to freedom of association by allowing states to pass legislation that eliminates the ability of unions to collect dues from their members. The result is a confusing web of labor laws that encourages a race to the bottom.
09.30.2010	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, announced the introduction of the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act, H.R. 6296, to increase economic and diplomatic pressure on Iran and its remaining business partners. On July 1, President Obama signed into law significant economic sanctions against Iran. In the wake of the new American statute and a new round of U.N. sanctions, the European Union, Japan and other U.S. allies enacted tough trade sanctions against Iran, effectively barring their firms from developing Iran’s energy sector and reducing Iran’s access to the international financial system. “Existing Iran Sanctions have had a significant impact on Iran’s economy, but have not achieved the ultimate goal of ending Iran’s nuclear weapons program. We must continue to enact tougher sanctions to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically, and we must act now,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “With the enactment of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act in July, Congress provided firm authorization for U.S. states to enact their own measures to divest from firms that do business in Iran. My legislation would provide similar authorization for states to refuse to contract for goods and services from such firms.” Among other provisions, the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act would definitively end the practice of American corporations conducting business with Iran through their foreign subsidiaries, sanction entities that provide loans to the government of Iran, sanction firms that prepay for future Iranian oil and gas deliveries, and reduce U.S. contributions to international institutions that provide loans or other assistance to Iran. A longer summary of the Stop Iran’s Nuclear Weapons Program Act is below. -30- Stop Iran’s Nuclear Program Act Subsidiaries of U.S. Firms Conducting Business in Iran. Currently, the Iran sanctions regulations allow the foreign subsidiaries of American firms to conduct business in Iran that would be prohibited if conducted by the American firm, so long as no U.S. person and no one working at the American firm is involved. A number of U.S firms, most notably the Halliburton Corporation, have conducted business in Iran through their overseas subsidiaries. This provision would punish the U.S. parent entity for the activities of a foreign subsidiary that would violate current U.S. sanctions if they were conducted by a U.S. person – it would effectively end the Halliburton loophole. Fighting the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corp. Provisions in the recently enacted Comprehensive Iran Sanctions Accountability and Divestment Act (CISADA) target the IRGC and other designated entities through a financial sanction – any financial institution that conducts business with them will have their business in the United States severely curtailed. This provision does not target commercial transactions with the IRGC and its affiliates; also, Treasury has designated only about 40 IRGC related entities, while we know that the IRGC operates its business and procurement operations through hundreds of fronts. The bill contains a provision that would require an expedited campaign at the Treasury Department to designate the hundreds of front companies and agents that operate on behalf of the Iran Revolutionary Guards Corp, and provides for secondary sanctions against any firms that continue to do business with them or the main IRGC. Treasury would only need to determine that there is credible evidence that an entity is a front, alias, affiliate or agent of the IRGC in order to designate it. Also, if a foreign company assists or conducts any transactions with an IRGC entity it would face harsh sanctions, including loss of access to the U.S. market. These provisions are based on the Iran Revolutionary Guard Designation Implementation Act (HR 2375). Sanction Entities that Subscribe to Iranian Sovereign Debt. There are indications that Iran may seek to float bonds sometime within the near future. The bill includes a provision that would make buying or facilitating the issuance of Iranian sovereign debt, including government bonds, an activity sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA). Sanction Entities that Pay in Advance for Oil Deliveries or Sign Long-Term Contracts to Purchase Oil and Gas from Iran. In 2003, Japan reportedly paid several billions in cash for future oil deliveries over the course of several years. The Swiss firm EGL reportedly signed a contract worth nearly $20 billion for future purchases of Iranian gas. When the world buys Iranian oil and gas, they should do so on a cash basis without long term commitment, lest they provide the Iranian government with, in effect, a bailout. The bill will make these agreements and transactions sanctionable under the ISA. Mining and Milling Equipment. Current law provides for sanctions against a firm if it provides nuclear or other WMD technology or advanced conventional arms to Iran, North Korea or Syria. Known as the Iran, North Korea and Syria Nonproliferation Act, or INKSNA, this statute is a key weapon in our nonproliferation arsenal. Iran’s supply of uranium is limited, and Iran has sought to obtain uranium from a number of foreign sources and through domestic mining. Supplying mining and milling equipment to Iran for its uranium mines is not currently sanctionable. The legislation will incorporate the operative provisions of HR 2290, which would add such activity to the list of activities sanctionable under the INKSNA. Deny Tax Benefits to Companies that Violate the Iran Sanctions Act. This provision would deny favorable amortization rules for exploration expenditures for any corporate family of companies that has violated the Iran Sanctions Act’s prohibition on investment in the energy sector of Iran. Prevent Aircraft Parts and Services Transfers. Current law provides for special licensing of aircraft repair and servicing of U.S. origin aircraft owned by Iran. In July, Iran Air was denied access to EU airspace because its old Boeing and some Airbus aircraft are unsafe for air travel. Those planes should remain grounded until the nuclear crisis is resolved. Comprehensive Denial of U.S. Government Benefits to those Who Conduct Sanctionable Activity in Iran. The bill will include provisions that bar companies who conduct activities sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act from receiving any taxpayer funds or other governmental assistance through OPIC, Ex-Im, TDA, foreign aid and other programs. The bill will also require that the TSP divest of firms that run afoul of the Iran Sanctions Act. Authorize States to Adopt Similar Restrictive Procurement Policies. The bill will include a provision authorizing states to prohibit procurement from firms that conduct activities sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act. Provide for Sanctions Against Firms that Enter into Joint Ventures or Other Investment Arrangements with National Iranian Oil Company or Other Iranian Firms. Currently, Iran’s national oil company has invested in a number of joint ventures to develop oil and natural gas projects outside of Iran, including one with BP off the coast of Scotland. This provides Iran’s state oil firm with access to technology and capital. Entering into these types of arrangements should be sanctionable to the same extent as an energy investment in Iran would be under the Iran Sanctions Act. Reduce Contributions to the World Bank or other International Financial Institutions that Provide Loans or Other Assistance to Iran. From 2000-2005, as the United States sought to stop Iran’s nuclear program, the World Bank approved some $1.4 billion in loans to Iran. Likewise, last year the IMF approved a distribution of so-called “Special Drawing Rights” – SDRs – worth $250 billion to IMF member states to increase liquidity during the financial crisis. Iran benefited by receiving in its IMF account more than $1 billion in SDRs tradable for hard currency. We must stop these respected financial institutions from approving any further assistance to Iran and work to prevent the distribution of the benefits already approved. The legislation will include provisions that would require the Administration to work at the World Bank, IMF and other institutions to stop disbursements to Iran and to prevent approval of further assistance. It would also provide for the reduction or elimination of U.S. contributions to an institution if it approves new assistance to Iran. Divestment Tax Benefits. The bill will contain a series of provisions that allow taxpayers to defer the recognition of capital gains on the sale of companies conducting sensitive business in Iran or Sudan, so long as the taxpayer purchases replacement investments without such connections to Sudan or Iran. The taxpayer would pay taxes on the gain when they sold the replacement property, of course. American investors are beginning to seek investments without ties to terrorism or the genocidal war in Sudan. This measure could provide modest encouragement for such beneficial financial decisions. These provisions are based on H.R.3516.

Recently, there have been multiple incidents involving anti-Se­mitic, anti-Muslim, and anti-Sikh epithets, slurs and obscenities, and even physical vi­olence towards students at American schools. “All students should be protected from discrimination and harassment on the basis of their religion as well as their race, color, and national origin,” said Senator Specter. “We need to close the loop-hole that allows students to be harassed and threatened because of their religion. The law specifically forbids discrimination on the basis of religion in virtually every other area, including employment and housing, and it’s about time it protects our students as well. This legislation will give the Department of Education clear jurisdiction over all incidents involving harassment on the basis of religion and will assure all of our students are equally protected.”“We need to act to protect students of all faiths against invidious discrimination and harassment, which is why I am joining with Senator Specter to amend the Civil Rights Act,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “No student should be subjected to discrimination on the ground of their religious beliefs. Currently, the Department of Education has the authority under existing law to protect Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh students and, frankly, I’m flabbergasted that they have not already acted to protect these students.”Congress passed Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect students from discriminatory harassment. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on “race, color, or national origin.” Unfortunately, the Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education (OCR) recently revised its policy and decided that it does not apply to acts of discrimination against Jewish students (and by implication students of groups with both religious and ethnic characteristics). The Department of Education (DOE) has the authority under Title VI to act independently now to protect students from Jewish, Muslim, and Sikh discrimination. In fact, surprisingly, the current position of the Department of Education (DOE) is a reversal of an earlier interpretation which served to protect these students as the Specter-Sherman legislation would require.A number of recent and unfortunate incidents that highlight the need for a new interpretation include the following: ·At the University of North Dakota, a student was harassed by fellow students with anti-Semitic slurs and was shot at with a pellet gun. ·At the University of California at Irvine, a Holocaust memorial was destroyed; posters have depicted women in traditional Muslim garb saying “God bless Hitler;” swastikas have defaced campus property; and a Jewish student was told to “Go back to Russia where you came from.”·At the University of Illinois a Hindu college student was assaulted and called a “terrorist.”· A Sikh seventh-grader in New Jersey faced serious and repeated harassment, including taunts of “Osama” and a physical assault on school grounds that resulted in head injuries and contusions.·A Muslim college student in Illinois was beaten with a handgun in a restroom where her attacker scrawled on the mirror, “Kill the Muslims” and the same student had a swastika and “Die Muslims” drawn on her locker.The Specter-Sherman bill has provisions to ensure that it does not affect the operation of parochial schools and other types of non-secular education institutions. It also will not require any schools to accommodate the religious obligations of students beyond the requirements of current law. Congressman Eliot Engel is an original cosponsor of Congressman Sherman’s legislation.
09.01.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) recently sent a letter urging Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Agency for International Development Administrator (USAID) Rajiv Shah to ensure that U.S. relief and recovery assistance for the 2010 Pakistan floods reaches all those in need. Pakistan is currently experiencing the most catastrophic flooding in over 80 years, impacting the lives of as many as 20 million people. On August 15th, the U.N. reported that the Sindh’s situation is becoming critical with 35% of the Sindh under water and over 2 million affected by the flooding. As of August 26th, the U.S. was providing $200 million in aid. “The widespread devastation wrought by this disaster cannot be overstated,” Congressman Sherman wrote in the letter. Sherman further expressed his concern that a lack of oversight may prevent U.S. assistance from reaching the people most severely impacted by the flooding. He states, “I remain concerned that U.S. assistance will not reach those who need it most. Reports of corruption arose in the aftermath of the 2005 earthquake in Kashmir. Many survivors continued to await internationally-funded Pakistani assistance to rebuild their homes more than one year after the earthquake.”
08.30.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – On Sunday, August 29th, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall Meeting at Reseda High School, fielding questions from some of the approximately 600 hundred constituents who attended. Sherman has held over 100 Town Hall Meetings since going to Congress. In January, Congressman Sherman conducted a Telephone Town Hall with nearly 5,000 Valley residents. In February, Sherman hosted an in-person Town Hall Meeting with approximately 800 constituents. On Wednesday, July 7th he held a special Town Hall Meeting on affairs in the Middle East. On July 11th, Sherman addressed hundreds more of his constituents and discussed a wide range of issues.Yesterday, Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including the condition of the economy, health care and terrorism. “Town Hall Meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “The large attendance at our Town Hall Meetings proves that the residents of the San Fernando Valley are actively engaged in their community and their government. I enjoy hearing their ideas.”Sherman highlighted his continued work fighting for tough regulations to prevent future abuses by giant Wall Street firms, which he and his colleagues on the Financial Services Committee included in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (HR 4173). Congressman Sherman also led the fight to ensure that there are no more taxpayer bailouts of these Wall Street firms, like the $700 billion bailout sought by former President Bush in 2008. Congressman Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

08.20.2010	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the California Transportation Commission (CTC) voted to allocate funding for a project to help alleviate congestion at the 101/405 interchange. Congressman Sherman wrote to the CTC in support of the project to construct one additional lane for southbound and northbound off ramps at Van Nuys Boulevard on the 101 Freeway. “Over the next three years, construction will be underway on two important projects to ease the daily commute for thousands of motorists traveling on the 101 and 405 Freeways,” said Congressman Sherman. “This project will help reduce backup in both directions on the 101 Freeway for motorists exiting onto busy Van Nuys Boulevard and traveling to Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys.” The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) will begin construction by spring 2011 and complete the widening project within two years. The California Transportation Commission voted to allocate $8 million for the shovel-ready project at the Commission’s meeting on August 12th after adopting a plan earlier this year to advance the project by two years. Congressman Sherman secured $500,000 in federal appropriations funding to initiate project studies at the 101/405 interchange, including improvements to the northbound and southbound Van Nuys Boulevard off ramps. Sherman has worked closely with various transportation agencies, including the CTC to accelerate construction of this important transportation improvement project. He has also advocated successfully for federal and state funding to accelerate construction of a carpool lane on the 405 Freeway between the 101 and 10 Freeways.
08.11.2010	Washington, DC -- Congressman Sherman issued the following statement about Republican demands that Congress not reconvene in November and December:“Republican leaders now demand that Congress agree not to reconvene for a so-called ‘lame duck’ session after the November 2nd election. However, in November 2006, Republican Speaker Hastert called Congress back into session for a ‘lame duck’ session. Had Congress not acted in the 2006 lame duck session, the entire Federal Government, save only the Department of Defense and Homeland Security, would have shut down. Thank God the Republicans did not believe then, what they claim to believe now.“Although the Republicans lost control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 election, they called us back into a lame duck session to deal with critically important legislation. If speaker Dennis Hastert had not done so, then for two months the Federal Government would have been closed.“The post-election defeat, ‘lame duck’ Congress of 2006 also extended tax benefits for research and development and education, provided for trade relations with Vietnam, and authorized President Bush to negotiate a nuclear cooperation agreement with India. “The Republican-called ‘lame duck’ session of 2006 also confirmed Robert Gates.“If the Republicans of 2006 had followed their own manifestly ridiculous proposal of 2010, then the Department of Defense would have been rudderless in late 2006, in the midst of two wars. “Thank God the Republicans didn’t do in the past what they now claim to be fair, proper and necessary.“Republicans also called ‘lame duck’ sessions in 2004, 2002 and 2000. Had they failed to do so, most of the federal government would have shut down for the last two months of each of those years, and the U.S. would have defaulted on its public debt in 2004.”
08.04.2010	Washington, D.C.— Congressman Brad Sherman proposes revoking Most Favored Nation (MFN) status for China and directing the President to negotiate a new trading relationship with the country that is designed to eliminate the trade imbalance.Sherman, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, is joined by the Ranking Member of the full Foreign Affairs Committee, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), among others, in introducing the legislation.The bill, H.R. 6071, revokes MFN for China six months after enactment and directs the President to negotiate a new trading relationship with China designed to eliminate the trade imbalance within four years. Finally, the bill provides for the expedited consideration of any new trade partnership with China that will bring the trade deficit down to zero within four years. “The U.S.-China trade relationship is horrendously lopsided, and it has not lived up to the promises of those who encouraged us to give preferential trade treatment to China. In the year 2000, we were told that it would allow for almost unlimited trade and would create opportunities for Americans to manufacture items and send them to China; that it would boost the U.S. economy and create jobs,” said Congressman Sherman. “Unfortunately, we have seen the opposite occur. This is why I have introduced legislation to revoke Most Favored Nation status from China until the President establishes a more level playing field between our two nations.” The United States made MFN status for China permanent on October 10, 2000. Congressman Sherman and Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted no. The advocates of MFN for China promised that we would see more jobs for Americans, free trade, and a decline in our trade deficit with China. Instead, China has abused the trading relationship in many ways, engaging in abuses ranging from currency manipulation to piracy of intellectual property. The United States’ trade deficit with China has grown from approximately $84 billion in 2000 to nearly $227 billion in 2009. For every dollar’s worth of goods the United States imports from China, our country exports only 23 cents worth of goods to China. Our exports to China equal only 1.6% of China’s GDP, and this percentage has actually declined since 2006.The following members of congress are original cosponsors of this legislation: Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Carol Shea-Porter (D-NC), Walter Jones (R-NC), Steve Kagen (D-WI), Patrick Murphy (D-PA), and Peter DeFazio (D-OR).Click here to view H.R. 6071.
07.21.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, applauded President Obama for signing the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (HR 4173) into law. The new law contains a set of historic reforms to protect the economy of our country and the financial security of Americans.“The new law includes several key provisions on which I labored tirelessly. I am particularly pleased that I was able to remove other provisions that would have created TARP on steroids. Not only does this bill end TARP, it closes the door on future bailouts. Not only will consumers be protected from deceptive and risky financial schemes, Wall Street will be on the hook to clean up its own messes, not the taxpayer,” said Congressman Sherman. Congressman Sherman, who led the effort to oppose TARP, the bailout for big Wall Street banks adopted in late 2008, also led a successful, bipartisan effort to remove provisions that would have given the Treasury Department permanent, unlimited authority to bail out Wall Street giants using taxpayer dollars. The new law also ends TARP immediately, thus returning $225 Billion to the Treasury, which could otherwise fund additional Wall Street bailouts.Sherman, a CPA, also worked with his colleagues on the Financial Services Committee to ensure that the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contained the strongest consumer protections, creating a new, powerful watchdog called the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, which will ensure that the products and services sold by Wall Street to consumers are fair and marketed honestly. Sherman has long argued that perhaps the single greatest cause of the financial meltdown was the practice of the credit rating agencies of giving their best ratings to bonds backed by questionable mortgages. He worked with U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN) to successfully amend the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to end conflicts of interest in the selection of rating agencies by bond issuers.
07.15.2010	SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS, CA – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) welcomed Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, to Solstice Canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area during a visit as part of President Obama’s America’s Great Outdoors Initiative. Congressman Sherman invited Secretary Salazar and other administration officials to the Santa Monica Mountains to showcase the park’s innovative programs as a blueprint for other national parks. “I am encouraged that the Secretary took time to visit the Santa Monica Mountains and to hear from area officials about our efforts to encourage millions of visitors from across Los Angeles, the United States, and the world to enjoy our local treasure,” said Congressman Sherman. “Secretary Salazar is clearly committed to conservation and recreation and I am pleased that he is helping park agencies in the Santa Monica Mountains achieve President Obama’s goal of reconnecting people with the outdoors.”In April 2010, President Obama launched the America’s Great Outdoors Initiative to promote and support innovative community-level efforts to conserve outdoor open spaces and reconnect Americans to the outdoors. Administration officials, including Secretary Salazar, held a public listening session in Los Angeles to discuss the opportunities to improve recreation and conservation near large urban populations. During the Secretary’s visit, Congressman Sherman emphasized the need to prioritize funding from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to preserve thousands of acres of pristine habitat in the Santa Monica Mountains from the threat of development. To date, the National Park Service has acquired 22,000 acres of parkland in the Santa Monica Mountains using the LWCF totaling $163 million, but approximately 22,700 critical acres remain to be acquired at an estimated cost of $57 million.The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park. Every year over 33 million visitors enjoy a variety of outdoor activities, including swimming, surfing, hiking, wildlife viewing, bicycle riding and horseback riding. Congressman Sherman has secured over $20 million in federal funding to preserve and expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. These funds were used to construct the Backbone Trail, allowing hikers to travel from Pacific Palisades to Point Mugu.
07.14.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) issued the following statement today about an attack on him aired on the Fox News Channel this afternoon.“Fox News has claimed that I am negligent in not being knowledgeable about the attacks on Attorney General Eric Holder regarding his treatment of an incident in Philadelphia on November 4, 2008.“A review of major sources of information which I rely upon most during the month prior to my July 11th Town Hall Meeting shows the following mentions of this issue:Postal Mail to my office: 0 Faxes: 0Emails: 1 – sent one business day before Town Hall.Los Angeles Times News: 0Los Angeles Times Op-ed: 1Los Angeles Daily News: 0The Economist: 0Newsweek:0Congressional Quarterly: 0National Journal Magazine: 0“While it is possible that our review missed something, it can be said that less than one page per 50,000 from the above sources deals with the issue.“In contrast, Fox News covered the issue repeatedly.“Also, since Fox News began its attacks on me, we have received hundreds of communications, a small portion of which are actually from within our district.“I will soon send a letter to Attorney General Holder regarding the importance of allegations of voter intimidation, and the Philadelphia incident in particular.”
07.12.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall at Reseda High School on Sunday, fielding questions from some of the approximately 800 hundred constituents who attended. Sherman has held over 100 town halls since going to Congress. In January, Congressman Sherman conducted a Telephone Town Hall with nearly 5,000 Valley residents. In February, Sherman hosted an in-person Town Hall Meeting with approximately 800 constituents. On Wednesday, July 7th he held a special Town Hall Meeting on affairs in the Middle East.Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including the condition of the economy, health care and terrorism. “Town Hall Meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “The large attendance at our Town Hall Meetings proves that the residents of the San Fernando Valley are actively engaged in their community and their government. I enjoy hearing their ideas.”Sherman highlighted his continued work fighting for tough regulations to prevent future abuses by giant Wall Street firms, which he and his colleagues on the Financial Services Committee included in the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (HR 4173). Congressman Sherman also led the fight to ensure that there are no more taxpayer bailouts of these Wall Street firms, like the $700 billion bailout sought by former President Bush in 2008. Congressman Sherman directed his constituents to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information. Congressman Sherman’s next San Fernando Valley Town Hall Meeting on August 29th at 3 p.m. at Reseda High School, 18230 Kittridge Street. Congressman Sherman’s constituent services staff will again be on hand to help constituents address any problems they may have with any federal agency. The event, parking and refreshments are free.
06.29.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) issued the following statement today about Republican Leader John Boehner’s proposal to means-test Social Security: “Today, Congressman John Boehner, leader of the Republicans in the House of Representatives, suggested reducing or eliminating Social Security benefits for Americans with “substantial non-Social Security income.” “I reject this attempt to turn Social Security into a welfare program only for seniors without other sources of income. We should urge all Americans to save for retirement. To then tell them that because they save for retirement, they will lose their Social Security benefits is both unfair and self-defeating. “Congressman Boehner has supported tax provisions that favor the super wealthy claiming they would increase the savings and capital available for economic expansion. Yet the mere issuance of his Social Security proposal will deter savings by middle class families. From this day forward, families will know that the money they save for their retirement may be taken away from them in the form of losing their Social Security benefits. “Social Security is basically a pension program. Workers and their employers contribute. Upon reaching retirement age, the worker receives benefits. “In an interview with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review on June 28, Leader Boehner asks, ‘If you have substantial non-social security income while you are retired, why are we paying you?’ Congressman Boehner is not willing to ‘means test’ his own Congressional pension. He contributes to it, and he expects to collect it, whether or not he has substantial income from other sources. “Most Americans don’t get a congressional pension. For many Americans the only pension they will receive is Social Security and it is outrageous that Boehner would propose taking their pension rights away simply because they save for their retirement. “With one statement, Congressman Boehner, the Republican Leader in the House, has taken the security out of Social Security. Now, middle class families saving for retirement do not know whether they will be penalized for saving, because Republicans will cut their Social Security benefit. “Advocates of means-testing Social Security pretend that they are only talking about cutting benefits from those as rich as Bill Gates. But, significant savings are not available to the Social Security Fund, unless we take away benefits from middle-class retirees.”
06.25.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, applauded the approval of a proposal he first offered in 2009 to require the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to end conflicts of interest in the selection of credit ratings. Congressman Sherman has long argued that perhaps the single greatest cause of the financial meltdown was the decision of the credit rating agencies to give high ratings to bonds backed by questionable mortgages. Last week, Sherman appeared before the conference committee on financial regulatory reform to encourage the adoption of a measure, which he proposed in the House and which U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN) added to, introduced and successfully passed in the Senate. The Franken-Sherman amendment would require an independent agency to assign credit rating agencies impartially. The final financial regulatory reform bill requires the SEC to create a Board to assign qualified credit rating agencies to rate bond issuances. This compromise embraces the Franken-Sherman proposal. “We cannot continue to have a system where credit rating agencies compete with each other to secure large fees from bond issuers by giving high ratings to bad bonds,” said Congressman Sherman. “Allowing those who are selling bonds to select the credit rating agency that will rate those bonds is like allowing the home team to choose the umpire. In the parlance of finance, they gave AAA to ‘Alt-A’. That is to say, they gave their highest rating to riskier securities backed by non-prime mortgages,” Sherman added. As outlined in the conference committee report, the SEC is to establish a Board to assign rating agencies to issuers. Credit rating agencies would prosper not by wooing issuers with implicit promises of an easy grade, but rather by convincing the Board that they are qualified to produce accurate ratings.The final bill still requires final approval by the full House and Senate before it can be sent to President Obama for his signature.
06.25.2010	WASHINGTON, DC -- Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, today issued the following statement on the passage of Iran sanctions legislation by the U.S. House of Representatives:“This is the most significant legislation passed on Iran to date. Once signed into law, it will take a number of steps to significantly increase the economic pressure on Iran. Companies that participate in the development or maintenance of Iran’s energy sector or sell gasoline to Iran will face stiff penalties. “The bill takes aim at the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps by preventing banks that do business with them from doing business in the United States. It also includes provisions based on legislation that I introduced in the House, such as the provisions of Title III which target countries whose lax export controls allow Iran to receive nuclear and other sensitive technology. “It also includes provisions that Senator Schumer and I introduced prohibiting federal contracts for companies that sell the Iranian government technologies which allow them to spy on or repress the speech of dissidents. “However, the legislation will have to be rigorously enforced to be fully effective. The State Department’s record on enforcement of the existing Iran Sanctions Act is abysmal. We will need to hold their feet to fire through strong oversight and tough hearings.“We should also recognize that, as strong as this bill is, there are other measures that may prove necessary to increase the pressure on Iran’s leaders to the point where they abandon the dream to possess nuclear weapons. This should not be viewed as Congress’ last word on Iran sanctions. If it takes more to succeed, then we should be willing to do more in Congress to isolate Iran.”
06.10.2010	Americans seeking to assist the people of Gaza can legally do so through highly respected non-governmental organizations such as CARE and Oxfam.In fact, the United States Agency for International Development gives grants to the following additional organizations for Gaza aid operations: American Near East Refugee Aid (ANERA), Catholic Relief Services (CRS), CHF International, International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), Mercy Corps, Relief International, Save the Children, World Vision, and World Food Program. All of these organizations accept private donations.The Israeli government and the United Nations operate aid corridors at land-border crossings. These allow the Israeli government to ensure that no weapons are brought into the territory and that the aid makes its way to groups that will provide it to the Gaza people, not to Hamas or other terrorists.It is a crime to provide assistance of any kind to Hamas, which is a foreign terrorist organization. However one feels about the blockade and embargo or the wider politics of the Arab-Israeli dispute, people subject to United States (U.S.) jurisdiction cannot provide assistance to groups designated by the U.S. government as terrorist organizations. By bypassing the legitimate aid corridors, the participants in the flotilla knew that the material they carried would be given to Hamas once the ships reached Gaza’s port.Several of the flotilla participants have contacts with the Hamas organization. Photos from an early Free Gaza visit to the region shows members of the group, including a U.S. participant in the May 31 flotilla, meeting with Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and receiving medals from the group.One of the groups responsible for organizing the flotilla, the Insani Yarhim Vakfi (IHH) was accused in testimony provided by a highly respected French counter-terrorism jurist of playing “an important role” in planning the Al Qaeda plot to bomb the Los Angeles airport in 2000. The umbrella organization to which IHH belongs, the Union of Good, was designated under Executive Order 13224 in 2008 by the Treasury Department – specifically for being a fundraiser for Hamas.
06.09.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) joined his colleagues and UCLA alumni in introducing a House resolution to honor the remarkable life and achievements of one of the greatest sports figures and educators in our lifetime, Coach John Wooden. The legislation passed with unanimous support.Previously, Congressman Sherman passed legislation naming the Reseda Post Office in honor of Wooden. Congressman Sherman introduced legislation on December 18, 2005 to formally name the Reseda Post Office after the sports legend and long-time San Fernando Valley resident. The bill was signed into law on August 17, 2006. On Coach Wooden’s 96th birthday (October 14th), Congressman Sherman and hundreds of family, friends, former players, and fans celebrated the naming of the Post Office with the Hall of Fame player and coach.Wooden died on June 4th at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center surrounded by his family. Coach Wooden is survived by his son, James Hugh and daughter Nancy Anne, who lives in Reseda, along with seven grandchildren and 13 great grandchildren. Wooden’s beloved wife of 53 years, Nell, died in Los Angeles on March 21, 1985.“Coach Wooden’s triumphant career lasted four decades with a string of NCAA records and championships, specifically during his 27 years as Head Coach for the UCLA Men’s Basketball team,” said Congressman Sherman. “Despite his long-list of accolades, Coach Wooden inspired countless people on and off-the-court by instilling in them the tenets of leadership, teamwork and competitiveness. He not only taught these important principles, but he lived by them daily. Coach Wooden will continue to be an exemplary role model for sports players and individuals for generations to come.”Coach Wooden retired in 1975 after leading the UCLA Bruins to 10 NCAA National Championships, including seven consecutively. Before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history, he was an All-American guard for the Purdue University team that captured the 1932 national championship. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and coach. Coach Wooden authored numerous books, including The Pyramid of Success.
05.19.2010	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade issued the following statement concerning the draft United Nations Security Council resolution.“Achieving consensus on a new round of United Nations sanctions among the permanent five members of the Security Council is a positive step. There are some good provisions in the resolution, including a partial arms embargo and additional financial sanctions.“However, many of the provisions are unfortunately not mandatory, and represent steps we should have taken years ago. This resolution, like previous Security Council resolutions, does not in itself have the type of measures that would cause the calculus in Tehran to change.“It does not contain mandatory measures that would significantly restrain trade or investment in Iran’s energy sector, which needs goods, services and technology from abroad to improve or even maintain current output. It does not prohibit the sale of refined petroleum or refinery equipment. Iran’s Central Bank, which has played a significant role in proliferation, is not targeted through mandatory provisions.“Nothing about this resolution, or any measures which countries may take under its cover, justify weakening the legislation currently in conference. In fact, we need to ensure we have a tough bill to do what the Security Council is unwilling or unable to do --- impose a crippling sanctions regime that will cause the type of economic dislocation in Iran that can change the calculus regarding the wisdom of the nuclear program.”
05.11.2010	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation, issued the following statement today concerning the Obama Administration’s decision to resubmit the Section 1-2-3 nuclear cooperation agreement with Russia to Congress for its consideration. “I believe it was a mistake to send the U.S.-Russia nuclear cooperation agreement to Congress at this time. Submitting this agreement is not part of a well designed strategy focused on Iran’s nuclear program. We should withhold this agreement until we know the Russian government will back the U.S. in applying truly crippling sanctions against Iran. I fear that what is being discussed in New York is nowhere near strong enough, and Moscow has consistently worked to weaken successive resolutions. “Russia’s ongoing nuclear relationship with Iran also needs critical examination. The Government Accountability Office was highly critical of the nonproliferation assessment that President Bush sent up with this agreement in 2008. At a minimum, we need to be assured that no Russian assistance is being provided to the most sensitive aspects of Iran’s nuclear development. We also need to be assured that the assistance Russia is providing at Bushehr is truly limited to information strictly necessary for that reactor. “I consider myself one of the strongest supporters in Congress of a “reset” and improved relations with Russia. I strongly support the START agreement. I support modifying U.S. positions on the complex range of issues important to Russia in the Caucasus and other regions of the former Soviet Union. But I cannot support nuclear cooperation with a country that too often has put its relationship with Tehran’s nuclear renegades above relations with Washington.”
05.10.2010	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee issued the following statement concerning financial regulatory reform. “Previously I voiced concern that Senator Dodd’s financial reform bill could allow the executive branch to place unlimited billions at risk in connection with winding down the activities of a defunct Wall Street giant. “My most important concern was that Section 210(n)(10) would allow the FDIC to borrow an unlimited amount of money from the Treasury and use these funds for the “orderly liquidation” of a defunct financial institution. “Senator Dodd’s manager’s amendment effectively eliminated subdivision “A” of Section 210(n)(10) and replaced that subsection with other text. This important technical change will make sure that there are strict limits on the amount borrowed by the FDIC in connection with liquidating a financial institution, and that the amount borrowed never exceeds the value of the assets of the entity being liquidated. “After meeting with Senator Dodd, I am convinced he never intended to allow unlimited borrowing in conjunction with the liquidation of a financial institution. With this change, I am convinced that the bill will achieve Senator Dodd’s objectives, and will not allow unlimited amounts of taxpayer funds to be put at risk in conjunction with the liquidation of a financial institution. “I look forward to working with Senator Dodd and others to impose limits on the powers of the FDIC to guarantee the obligations of solvent banks. I also look forward to working with him and others to restrict the authority that the Federal Reserve Board has had since 1935 to make virtually unlimited loans in times of financial distress. This can be accomplished by adopting the House Bill’s restrictions on Section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act. “In the past I have expressed my concerns that the Senate bill would allow permanent, unlimited bailout authority. Those comments relate to the prior version of the bill. The Senate changes make my prior comments no longer applicable. “I would call upon those who have been quoting me to make it clear that my comments relate to the prior draft of the bill, and not the legislation currently being considered by the Senate.”
05.06.2010	Washington, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade delivered the following statement concerning the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act during the initial meeting of the conference committee on April 28, 2010. “The Iran Nuclear Program is the number one national security threat we face. The State Department identifies Iran already as the number one state sponsor of terrorism.1 A nuclear Iran means terrorism with impunity. It means eyeball to eyeball confrontations with a hostile nuclear state, and for those who find solace in the outcome of the Cuban Missile crisis, we must ask how many nuclear confrontations do you want to have with a government that is considerably less reasonable than the one that was presided over by Khrushchev. And if a half a decade from now, a million Iranians are in the streets of Tehran to overthrow that regime, Inshallah, and that government feels it is going to fall, these are not people who are going to walk off the world stage with the shrug of their shoulders as Mr. Gorbachev did. If they’re going out, they’re going out with a bang. “They could smuggle in a nuclear weapon or several into the cities of either the great Satan or the little Satan or both, using their terminology. Now some propose that we have sanctions that don’t hurt the overall Iranian economy. Such smart sanctions are dumb, for, as many have pointed out, 2 this regime is not going to change its behavior unless it is faced with absolutely crippling sanctions. Those sanctions being discussed in the international forum are a tiny fraction of what would be necessary to get this regime to change its behavior, for as Senator Lieberman points out, acquiring nuclear weapons is second only to regime survival in the objectives of this regime.3 “This is why we have to pass this bill in the strongest possible form and then consider additional legislation to create an overall program of crippling extraterritorial sanctions. It is not enough to pass laws, they have to be enforced; the main part of this bill amends and adds to the Iran Sanctions Act, which has been on the books since 1996.4 As Chairman Berman points out, the enforcement of the existing law by the State Department - in my words, not his - make a mockery of the rule of law in the United States.5 As Chairman Berman pointed out, the Congressional Research Service has found 21 transactions where the law required the State Department to identify, name and shame and then either waive or impose sanctions, and the State Department has deliberately failed to do so. Reports by the states of Florida, California and the GAO all identify even more such triggering transactions. The State Department’s Economic Bureau has deliberately failed to identify those transactions, and if the bill we pass is going to be anything more than a mockery, we are not only going to have to require reports on those transactions, as Chairman Berman noted, but we are going to need Congressional oversight, investigations and limits on appropriations. “The State Department asked for additional flexibility, they asked that we reward the fact that they have illegally ignored the law by writing provisions that will allow them to do it legally. The idea of country-by-country waivers is absurd,6 they will waive virtually every country, unless they just decide to ignore the law as an easy way to continue what has been a consistent thirteen or fourteen year policy of ignoring the Iran Sanctions Act. The bill contains language to deal with the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC)7; it has dozens of front agencies, we should require that they be identified and that we prevent companies from doing business with those agencies. The Senate bill that puts this forward is just a “sense of Congress”. We are not an advisory body appointed by the Secretary of State, we are the Congress. If we think something should be done, we should require the State Department to do it. The Iran Sanctions act focuses on those making investments in the Iranian oil sector. It is important that we realize Iran not only needs capital but technology, and we should impose the same sanctions on those who sell goods and services to develop Iran’s natural gas and oil fields. 1 For more information, see Country Reports on Terrorism 2008. https://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/crt/2008/ 2 For example, Clifford May, President of Foundation for Defense of Democracies, (https://article.nationalreview.com/433534/give-crippling-sanctions-a-chance/clifford-d-may) and Benjamin Netanyahu (https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-exclusive-interview-good-morning/story?id=10409244) 3 As Senator Lieberman says on his website, he “believes that the current leadership of Iran will only consider stepping back from the nuclear brink when they are convinced that if they fail to do so, there will be consequences so severe that the continuity of their regime will be threatened.” https://lieberman.senate.gov/index.cfm/issues-legislation/security-defense-and-foreign-policy#foreign 4 Originally called the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act (ILSA), it was signed into law on August 5, 1996 (P.L. 104-172).

04.29.2010	Up to 15,000 San Fernando Valley companies eligible for substantial tax credit now Washington, D.C. – San Fernando Valley small businesses will be getting a little bit of good news in their mailboxes. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) said today that companies eligible for new health reform tax credits will be getting a postcard explaining the credits and encouraging them to take advantage of the tax cut. Congressman Sherman said the tax credit is especially important to getting the Valley economy moving again. “There are over 15,000 companies in the Valley that meet the criteria for the small business health reform tax credit,” said Congressman Sherman. This is going to make it a little easier for companies already offering insurance to afford it and will allow more small businesses to start providing health care coverage for their workers. It is important for Valley businesses to know it is out there so they can start taking advantage of it immediately.” The tax credit is available to small businesses with 25 or fewer employees, and an average wage of $50,000 or less that provide health insurance for their employees.

04.28.2010	Washington, D.C. – Starting Thursday domestic air travelers will be spared of lengthy airplane delays on the tarmac and will enjoy additional consumer protections. Under the new rule, U.S. airlines operating domestic flights may not permit an aircraft to remain on the tarmac at large and medium hub airports (LAX and Burbank Airport) for more than three hours without deplaning passengers. U.S. carriers operating international flights departing from or arriving in the United States must specify, in advance, their own time limits for deplaning passengers. Carriers are required to provide adequate food and potable drinking water for passengers within two hours of the aircraft being delayed on the tarmac and to maintain operable lavatories and, if necessary, provide medical attention. The rule limiting tarmac delays was adopted in response to a series of incidents in which passengers were stranded on the ground aboard aircraft for lengthy periods. The only exceptions are for safety or security reasons or if air traffic control advises the pilot that returning to the terminal would disrupt airport operations. The rule also: Prohibits the largest U.S. airlines from scheduling chronically delayed flights, subjecting those that do to Department of Transportation enforcement action for unfair and deceptive practices; Requires U.S. airlines to designate an airline employee to monitor the effects of flight delays and cancellations, respond in a timely and substantive fashion to consumer complaints and provide information to consumers on where to file complaints; Requires U.S. airlines to adopt customer service plans and audit their own compliance with their plans; and Prohibits U.S. airlines from retroactively applying material changes to their contracts of carriage that could have a negative impact on consumers who already have purchased tickets. In addition, beginning at the end of July, airlines will be required to display on their website flight delay information for each domestic flight they operate.
04.22.2010	Washington, DC – Today, as the nation marks Earth Day the House Financial Services Committee passed the Green Resources for Energy Efficient Neighborhoods (GREEN) Act (H.R. 2336) which includes language authored by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) to promote the use of plug-in electric vehicles, both plug-in hybrids and pure electric.Congressman Sherman’s amendment states that for any newly-constructed residential buildings to qualify as meeting “green” building standards, such structures will need to have appropriate electrical outlets with the capacity to recharge an electric passenger vehicle in the garage or carport. Today, many residences do not have outlets with the capability to charge an electric vehicle where that vehicle would normally be parked.“We need to promote alternate energy sources for the vehicles we drive. If ‘green’ vehicles are to flourish on our roadways, we need to have the proper residential infrastructure in place so that drivers can recharge their vehicles at home,” Sherman said. “This legislation will help create the required infrastructure to support expanded use of electric vehicles.”Now having passed the Committee, the GREEN Act will go to the full House of Representatives for approval and then to the Senate for its consideration.
04.21.2010	Let the Sun Shine on Government, Says Sherman WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced the introduction of the Faster FOIA Act, which establishes an advisory commission of experts and government officials to study whether changes in federal law and policy are needed to ensure more effective and timely compliance with the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) law. The Faster FOIA Act would direct the 16–member Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays Commission to report to Congress and the president on how to reduce the lengthy delays in the federal government’s handling of FOIA inquiries. The committee study would specifically attempt to identify methods of reducing delay in FOIA processing, create an efficient and equitable processing system, and examine whether the charging of fees and granting of waivers needs to be reformed. It would be required to issue a report within one year of the enactment of the legislation. The Senate Judiciary Committee marked up similar legislation last week. “It is time for the pendulum to swing back to favor a more open democracy and let the sun shine, opening the doors to a more accessible and transparent government,” said Congressman Sherman. “We must improve the accountability, accessibility, and openness of the federal government by improving FOIA.” Several years ago, President Bush signed an executive order requiring agencies to designate a senior official to oversee compliance with the law that for 40 years has provided an important tool for reporters and citizens to obtain information about the government. Sherman was honored to attend the signing ceremony (photo attached), but the president’s order failed to address his administration’s own policies, which dramatically reduced public access to government documents. Some historians reportedly had to wait more than a year before requests were even acknowledged. Citing exaggerated homeland security claims, agencies have denied environmentalists access to drainage maps. The end result is that the number of documents being declassified for public access has dwindled dramatically.
04.15.2010	Sherman Announces How Los Angeles and Ventura County Residents Can Find Out If They Have Unclaimed Tax Refunds WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced that nearly 5,000 taxpayers in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties are owed $5,477,862 in undeliverable tax refunds from the 2008 tax year. In many instances, the United States Postal Service was unable to deliver refund checks due to mailing address errors. In an effort to assist taxpayers collect their tax refunds, Congressman Sherman has posted a list of Los Angeles and Ventura County residents who are owed a refund in 2009 on his web page at BradSherman.house.gov. “For a struggling family, a few hundred or even a thousand dollars can help defer the costs of housing, food, medicine and other important provisions,” said Congressman Sherman. “If there is any chance you have an unclaimed refund, check out our website to see if you’re on the list and learn how to contact the IRS to collect your refund.” In California, the top three undeliverable refunds average almost $380,000. Nearly $5.5 million in 2008 tax refunds did not reach the intended Los Angeles County and Ventura County resident with the average check totaling $1,126 in Los Angeles County and $937 in Ventura County. This information is also listed at BradSherman.house.gov. The Internal Revenue Service owes refunds to 831 residents in the San Fernando Valley, but their checks were returned to the U.S. Postal Service because some families moved without leaving a forwarding address or the IRS found errors in taxpayers’ favor, but could not locate the people owed the unexpected windfalls. Congressman Sherman represents half of the San Fernando Valley. Before he was elected to Congress in 1996, Sherman, a Certified Public Accountant, was chairman of the California State Board of Equalization; the nation’s only elected tax commission and America’s second largest tax agency.

Sherman has routinely hosted town hall meetings for high school students during his time in Congress. Sherman spoke about federal issues, military academies and internship opportunities in the Congressman’s Sherman Oaks and Washington, DC offices. Sherman also responded to questions on a wide range of issues including the Armenian genocide, U.S. and Turkish foreign policy, health care and college loans. “Having Congressman Sherman speak at our school is a huge benefit for our students because they were able to discuss their issues with an influential policy maker,” said Hagop Hagopian, Principal, AGBU Manoogian Demirdjian School. “This meeting provided our students a unique opportunity to learn how the government operates and how legislation is passed. Having Congressman Sherman answering their questions is a once in a lifetime experience.” Sherman highlighted his work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee to recognize the Armenian Genocide. In March, in a 23 to 22 vote, Sherman joined the Committee to pass House Resolution 252, which officially recognizes the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Congressman Sherman is an original cosponsor of the legislation. Since coming to Congress in 1997, Sherman has co-sponsored every resolution dealing with the issue of the Armenian Genocide. “Meetings like this are critical to the public policy process. They provide an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns of the Armenian community and to elaborate on the work for Armenians and students that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “These students are the future leaders of the Armenian community. They contributed to substantive conversations on a variety of issues that are important to the community and the lives of students alike. I thank the students for their participation in the meeting.” Congressman Sherman directed the students to contact his Sherman Oaks office at (818) 501-9200 for further assistance with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.

04.08.2010	Camarillo, CA – Today, speaking to the Ventura County World Affairs Council at the Las Posas Country Club in Camarillo, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) outlined his views of current American foreign policy as a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade.Congressman Sherman’s speech entitled, “A Congressional Update on American Foreign Policy, Insight and Analysis,” covered a variety of foreign affairs topics, including Iran, nuclear proliferation and other important issues. Sherman also responded to questions, many of which focused on Iran.“One of the greatest threats we face is nuclear weapons ending up in the wrong hands, especially those of the Iranian government” said Congressman Sherman. “An Iran with nuclear weapons is like a Cuban missile crisis every month, inevitably provoked by the Iranian government. The best way to fight that threat is to convince the Iranian elites and the Iranian people that they face economic and diplomatic isolation if they don’t give up their nuclear program.”Imposing tough additional sanctions against Iran remains one of Congressman Sherman’s top priorities. Sherman has authored five bills during the current session of Congress to increase Iran’s economic and diplomatic isolation. Seven of the provisions of this legislation are included in the Iran sanctions legislation that will be finalized in the coming weeks.Congressman Sherman was introduced by Don Facciano, President and CEO of the World Affairs Council of America California Central Coast. The twenty-year-old World Affairs Council of America California Central Coast Chapter is a part of The World Affairs Council which presents world leaders on a variety of today's most relevant global issues. It is an association of 90 independent organizations in 39 states and the District of Columbia that work to engage and educate Americans on international affairs and foreign policy.
04.07.2010	Sherman Oaks, CA – Today, Senator Barbara Boxer and Congressman Brad Sherman toured Spectrolab Inc. in Sylmar to discuss with employees and executives how the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) is helping the company develop next-generation solar cell technology. Spectrolab received $2.9 million in ARRA funding for the development of next-generation solar cells, which are expected to be more efficient than current space solar cells, and will enable new generations of high powered satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Spectrolab, a wholly owned subsidiary of The Boeing Company, is the world’s leading manufacturer of high-efficiency multifunction space solar cells. “I consider it an honor to represent the hard-working men and women of Spectrolab. Their work is important to maintaining America’s standing as a global leader in science and innovation. The technology they are developing has the potential to positively impact our lives,” said Congressman Sherman. “This facility is a great example of how the Recovery Act’s investments in science and education are beneficial to our community and nation.” Following the tour, Senator Boxer and Congressman Sherman addressed business leaders at the Valley Industry and Commerce Association’s (VICA) Leaders Forum in Studio City. At the VICA luncheon, Senator Boxer explained how the stimulus bill has helped California by providing tax cuts to small business and the middle class. These cuts are raising the average tax refund by 10 percent or $266 this year. According to the IRS, this increase is largely due to the Recovery Act. Sherman talked about the importance of sustaining the recovery in housing by maintaining the maximum conforming mortgage loan limit at $729,750. Without Congressional action, that limit will expire on December 31, 2010, dramatically shrinking the size of loans that may be backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). To keep the maximum at $729,750, Sherman has introduced the bipartisan Increasing Homeownership Opportunities Act, which now has 49 cosponsors.
04.07.2010	Sherman Oaks, CA – This week Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) addressed approximately 1,200 high school students at Grover Cleveland High School in Reseda and El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills. Sherman has routinely hosted town hall meetings for high school students during his time in Congress.Sherman spoke about federal issues, military academies and internship opportunities in the Congressman’s Sherman Oaks and Washington, DC offices. Sherman also responded to questions on a wide range of issues including health care reform legislation, jobs, immigration and college loans.“Meetings like this are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns of our community’s students and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress, which impacts students most. The students had thoughtful and insightful questions which added to substantive discussions,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “We had good conversations about a variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley students and residents alike. In these challenging economic times Valley residents of all ages are committed to improving our community and I thank the students for their participation in the meeting.”“It was a great opportunity for the seniors. Certainly, in my department and classes, we spend a lot of time talking about civic responsibility and civic duty—what it means to be informed and become a participant, not just a bystander,” said Danielle Aucoin, Grover Cleveland High School, Social Studies Department Chair. “Seeing the Congressman here was an opportunity for the students to see a real person who works to implement laws and effect change that can truly impact their lives. A huge part of our work as teachers, especially in history and government, is to make the work interesting and relevant to the students. The Congressman’s visit accomplished this.”“This visit is tremendously helpful to our government and economics students. These are young adults who lived through an immensely historic election-- they studied it and discussed it all the time,” said Dave Fehte, Principal, El Camino Real High School. “I think that prepared them for the discussion today, the questions they asked were thoughtful and challenging."Sherman highlighted his work on expanding college opportunities for more Americans by helping to pass The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which was recently signed into law. This bill provides the largest increase in student aid in history, while also reducing the deficit. This important legislation, strengthens the Pell Grant program, invests in community colleges, extends support for Historically Black Colleges and Minority Serving Institutions, and helps student borrowers manage their student loan debt.Congressman Sherman directed the students to contact his Sherman Oaks office at (818) 501-9200 for further assistance with federal agencies, including the U.S. Department of Education. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.
04.05.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that California State University, Northridge (CSUN) was awarded nearly $8.5 million in federal funding over five years to improve the teacher quality and student achievement for students with disabilities in high-need schools. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Education through the Teacher Quality Partnership program.This project addresses the critical shortage of qualified special education teachers who are prepared to serve in high-need schools. The project is a partnership between the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) and the Colleges of Education and Humanities at California State University, Northridge. The program will recruit a total of 150 special education teachers from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, prepare them to serve children with disabilities in high-need schools, and evaluate the impact of the project on new teachers and their students. The program will offer an 18-month credential or master’s degree residency program in Special Education, and a 2-year induction program.“Cal State Northridge is nationally recognized for its exemplary programs to prepare highly qualified teachers and develop partnerships with high-need schools,” said Congressman Sherman. “Once again, CSUN stands at the forefront in teacher preparation and training and improving student achievement in our local schools.”“California State University, Northridge is proud to be an institution working to reform teacher education through teacher residency programs,” said CSUN President Jolene Koester. “This grant is a strong statement of support for the great work happening on the Cal State Northridge campus and in our partner schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District. The program will not only provide positive outcomes for our region, but also produce outcomes that could help inform teacher residency programs across the nation.”Congressman Sherman has secured nearly $2.4 million in federal appropriations funding for a variety of programs and projects at Cal State Northridge, including teacher education and arts education programs, as well as funding for the construction of the Valley Performing Arts Center and an on-campus transit center.
03.25.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) testified today in the House Appropriations Committee in support of his request for additional land acquisition funding to expand the Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area.Sherman appeared before the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee to request funds to protect core habitat in Zuma and Trancas Canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, calling it his top priority for the Fiscal Year 2011 Interior and Environment Appropriations Act. The Department of the Interior Fiscal Year 2011 Budget provides $3.75 million to acquire 16 tracts of land, but Sherman is urging the Committee to increase the amount to $6 million so that an additional 12 tracts may be purchased.“Hiking trails within the canyons provide scenic views of the Pacific Ocean, numerous waterfalls, and natural solitude, and additional land acquisition funds would help secure critical recreational trail connections for the public to enjoy,” said Sherman. “However, high-end real estate development on private in-holdings threatens to displace critical habitat and degrade park scenery and coastal water quality.”Subcommittee Chairman Jim Moran (D-VA) echoed Sherman’s argument, concurring that, due to the struggling economy, now is the time to acquire available lands. If land is not acquired now, mansions will be built on the property and we will not be able to buy the land, he said.Each year over 33 million visitors enjoy the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area’s renowned beaches and explore the park’s mountains, including its 60-mile Backbone Trail, which stretches across the Santa Monica Mountains and traverses through Zuma and Trancas Canyons. To date, the National Park Service has acquired 22,000 acres of parkland using Land and Water Conservation Funds totaling $163 million.The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area has one of the largest backlogs of acquisition needs in the national park system. Approximately 20,595 acres remains to be acquired to complete the Land Protection Plan recommendations. The value of these lands is estimated to be over $57 million.

03.04.2010	WASHINGTON – In a 23 to 22 vote, the House Foreign Relations Committee passed House Resolution 252, officially recognizing Armenian Genocide. “If we hope to stop future genocides we need to admit to those horrific acts of the past. When Hitler had to convince his cohorts that the world would let them get away with it, he turned to them and said, ‘Who today speaks of the annihilation of the Armenians?’,” said Sherman. “The last act of any genocide is genocide denial, and the first act of preventing the next genocide is to acknowledge past acts of genocide.” Congressman Sherman believes it is high time that this measure is passed by Congress and that the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s passage of House Resolution 252 on the Armenia genocide is a first and major step toward final passage. Congressman Sherman is an original cosponsor of the legislation, which acknowledges the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Since coming to Congress in 1997, Sherman has co-sponsored every resolution dealing with the issue of the Armenian Genocide. Video of Sherman’s remarks in the House Foreign Affairs Committee is available on his YouTube page, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CE1pcWy55M During World War I and its aftermath, the Ottoman Empire attempted to destroy the Armenian population of Eastern Anatolia. Congressman Sherman wants Congress to remember this tragic event and formally acknowledge that the Armenian Genocide is a fact. Unfortunately, there are many who deny that this first genocide of the 20th Century actually took place. Congressman Brad Sherman is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade. He has served California’s San Fernando Valley in Congress since 1997.
03.04.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) issued the following statement concerning the proposal to replace the image of Ulysses S. Grant on the $50 bill with Ronald Reagan.“History has made its verdict, and Reagan's policies are controversial. Grant was in favor of winning the Civil War and keeping the Union together. The currency is not a place to score cheap political points. Our currency ought to be something that unites us,” he said. “Even Nancy Reagan opposed previous proposals to change existing U.S. currency to reflect her husband’s image. We should respect her wishes.”"While I can understand the intentions of those seeking to place my husband's face on the dime, I do not support this proposal and I am certain Ronnie would not. When our country chooses to honor a great president such as Franklin Roosevelt by placing his likeness on our currency, it would be wrong to replace him with another. It is my hope that the proposed legislation will be withdrawn," former First Lady, Nancy Reagan said in a statement. (National Review, 12/10/03).In spite of Nancy Reagan’s comments, radio personality Rush Limbaugh called Sherman “a real whack job” for opposing the measure.
03.03.2010	WASHINGTON Congressman Brad Sherman today received the Humane Champion Award from the Humane Society of the United States. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on an animal welfare issue and for his perfect score on the Humane Society's 2009 Legislative Scorecard. The Humane Society was particularly appreciative of Sherman’s introduction of the Computer-Assisted Remote Hunting Act during the last session of Congress. The legislation was strongly supported by the Humane Society. The inhumane practice of Internet hunting, also called remote-controlled hunting, occurs when a customer uses a computer and the Internet to aim and fire a weapon that is mounted on a mechanized tripod at a remote location, usually a game ranch where the hunted animals are penned. The Computer-Assisted Remote Hunting Act proposed a federal prohibition on Internet hunting and penalties for those who violate the prohibition. Congressman Sherman is one of only 19 legislators who received the Humane Champion Award, and he remains committed to ensuring the humane treatment of animals. The Humane Society boasts 25,263 supporters in Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley district and more than 11 million nationwide.
02.22.2010	WASHINGTON, DC – On Sunday, February 21st, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall at Reseda High School, fielding questions from some of the approximately 800 hundred constituents who attended. Sherman has held over 100 town halls since coming to Congress. In January, Congressman Sherman conducted a Telephone Town Hall with nearly 5,000 Valley residents. Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including the condition of the economy, health care and terrorism. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “At a time when many of us are struggling to endure challenging economic times, it is inspiring how united we remain, and how dedicated we are to making our communities stronger.” Sherman highlighted his continued work fighting against bailouts for Wall Street firms and protecting consumers. Congressman Sherman fought against the $700 billion Wall Street bailout sought by former President Bush. Sherman remains a leading voice in the effort to prevent the Executive Branch of the federal government from getting the authority to provide unlimited bailouts to the giants on Wall Street. Sherman reiterated his commitment to protecting consumers in the Valley by working on legislation to prevent abuses in overdraft protection. New regulations require banks to obtain the consumer’s consent before enrolling them in expensive overdraft programs. Banks are now required to warn customers when an ATM transaction would cause an overdraft and give the customer the opportunity to cancel the transaction before the overdraft fee is charged. Finally, banks are prohibited from reordering withdrawals to maximize customer fees.

01.22.2010	Washington, D.C. - Yesterday, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) welcomed "Wounded Warrior" Daisy Fuentes on her first visit to Washington, DC and to his employ. Today, Fuentes returned to California to serve in Sherman’s San Fernando Valley office as part of the congressionally-funded Wounded Warrior Project. Fuentes became a "Wounded Warrior" after developing a serious eye condition as a result of her deployment to Iraq. Without corrective surgery Fuentes risks losing her eye sight entirely. The Wounded Warrior Project, seeks to honor and empower wounded warriors by raising awareness and enlisting the public’s aid for the needs of severely injured service men and women. The Wounded Warrior Project helps severely injured service members aid and assist each other, and provides unique, direct programs and services to meet these injured service members’ needs. Fuentes achieved the rank of Corporal during her enlistment in the United States Marine Corps from March of 2005 through July of 2009. Fuentes worked as a Field Wireman in Ramadi, Iraq, operating and repairing digital and analog communication systems, and as an Administrative Clerk with technical supervisory duties, training, evaluating, and counseling personnel, along with other administrative duties. A native of El Salvador and current resident of Burbank, Fuentes is fluent in Spanish. She has one daughter, 18 month old Natalia, and will be helping Congressman Sherman’s constituents to cut through the red tape of federal bureaucracy. "My staff and I welcome Daisy to our office with wide open arms and enormous gratitude for her service to our country," said Sherman. "I am pleased that I can do a small part to return an injured service member to civilian life and that Daisy is continuing to serve our country by helping people in the San Fernando Valley. I expect that Daisy’s administrative expertise and military experience will be particularly useful to the veterans who contact my office." "I am excited by this opportunity and I appreciate what the Wounded Warrior Project is doing for people like me," said Fuentes. "I am excited by the challenge, and I am eager to help others during these challenging times, especially fellow veterans." Fuentes is a recipient of the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Iraqi Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, and a Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. Prior to joining the United States Marine Corps, Fuentes attended Palomar College in San Marcos, California. The 2009 Appropriations Supplemental, which Congress passed on Thursday, May 14, 2009, addressed serious concerns over funding for healthcare for our service members and veterans. The legislation included $488 million for wounded warrior complexes to help soldiers wounded in combat recover and remain on active duty or transition to civilian life and support families through this process. The funds will allow for the construction of seven new complexes, bringing the total around the country to 16. Today, there are about 2.3 million men and women serving in the U.S. Armed Forces, active and reserve. Since 2003, more than 5,000 of them have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan and over 35,000 have been wounded.

01.22.2010	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) issued the following statement concerning the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Committee, which overturned the long-standing ban on corporate contributions to federal election campaigns.“It is clear that all elements of The Establishment are under attack from populism. The results in Massachusetts were not so much the victory of any political party, but another wave of populism rising against what voters perceived as the entrenched establishment.”“Yesterday, the Supreme Court majority discarded their judicial robes and donned their political pinstripes to give the establishment the power to fight back --They effectively armed the Death Star so that the Empire can strike back.”“I am not saying that five members of the Supreme Court self-consciously and conspiratorially decided to shred campaign finance reform laws in order to protect the establishment from the growing wave of populism. But they were willing to become judicial activists and overrule 100 years of Supreme Court precedents, in order to give corporate America the propaganda tools necessary to put out the fire of populism.”
01.12.2010	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) highlighted the availability of employment opportunities with the United States Census Bureau and the importance of the constitutionally-required decennial tally and demographic study to the Valley.Right now, to conduct the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau is hiring over 3,000 people to work in four San Fernando Valley offices: Canoga Park, Panorama City, and Burbank. Each of these offices will hire 1,000.Additional offices are located in Santa Clarita and Thousand Oaks. To find other offices in the region, visit the Census Bureau’s interactive map:https://2010.census.gov/2010censusjobs/how-to-apply/local-office-map.php The Regional Census Center, which is the operational main office for the Local Census Offices, is located in Northridge. The Regional Census Center will also be filling a number of administrative positions. “These are tough times for the Valley and the nation. The unemployment rate in Los Angeles County is estimated at 12.4 percent. For the unemployed, I certainly think that these census jobs are worth considering,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “Finding qualified Valley residents will help the U.S. Census Bureau do a thorough job of reporting on the diversity of our community.”The census is hiring now. These are temporary positions that will continue through the end of September 2010. Entry-level, census takers in these offices will earn $17.00 per hour. Supervisorial positions are also available. Generally, workers will be asked to work in their own communities. A valid driver’s license is required. However, aside from a background check, there is no special experience or educational attainment required, although an employment test is required for all Local Census Office Positions. Census forms will be delivered or mailed to households in March 2010; households should complete and mail back their forms upon receipt. Census workers will visit households that do not return forms to take a count in person. Information shared with the U.S. Census Bureau is completely confidential.The information collected for the census helps to determine how more than $400 billion dollars of federal funding each year is spent on infrastructure and services, like bridges, tunnels, hospitals, schools, fire stations, and senior centers.Applicants should call 866-861-2010 to schedule the next available exam in their area.

01.05.2010	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the U.S. Census Bureau’s latest San Fernando Valley Census Report. At his request, the Census Bureau updated the report using detailed data from the 2008 American Community Survey (ACS). The first-ever Valley Census Report was released in December 2006, also at Sherman’s request.The Valley Census Report offers an annual demographic snapshot of the San Fernando Valley to help community organizations, businesses, and government leaders make better-informed decisions affecting the Valley’s future and help our region compete for its fair share of funding for transportation improvements, housing, and social service programs."The Valley Census Report reveals that, compared to the average American, Valley residents continue to make more money, spend more of it on housing, and endure longer commutes to work," said Congressman Sherman. "The Valley has a rich cultural diversity and a highly educated workforce, but these tough economic times are presenting enormous challenges for many Valley families," added Sherman.The more than 1.75 million people who live in the Valley exceed the populations of all but the four largest cities in the United States – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. The Valley’s population has increased 3.5% since the 2000 Census.The Valley Census Report shows that Valley residents spend, on average, nearly a half-hour (29.4 minutes) commuting to work, which is 8% longer than the average Californian and 13% longer than the average American. In 2007, Congressman Sherman highlighted figures from the earlier Valley Census Report to convince officials in Sacramento to direct funding to Valley transportation projects, such as carpool lanes on the 5 and 405 Freeways.Valley residents, on average, are more educated than other parts of the City and County with 118,575 people with graduate or professional degrees and another 239,705 with bachelor’s degrees. Since 2000, the Valley has had a 16.6% increase (59,689) in those with bachelor’s or advanced degrees.In 2008, the median home value as self-reported on the American Community Survey form by respondents in the Valley ($560,500) was higher than Los Angeles County or California, and was nearly triple the U.S. median home value ($197,600). Of course, home prices have dropped substantially since 2008, both nationwide and in the Valley.Also in 2008, over 50% of Valley homeowners (119,700) were spending 35% or more of their income on housing. Overall, the median monthly mortgage and homeowner’s costs had increased nearly 10% ($2,381 to $2,630) since 2000.The report also shows that poverty remains a significant economic barrier for many Valley families (10.5% or over 55,680 households with incomes below $15,000), justifying the Valley’s requests for housing funds, as well as economic development and social service programs, including federal Community Development Block Grants (CDBG). Although the poverty rate has decreased from 2000 to 2008 in the San Fernando Valley and the entire City of Los Angeles, we could expect figures to increase given the impact of this year’s economy."The 2008 ACS release gives us our first detailed data on Valley economic conditions following the onset of our current recession and a view of the impact of over $4.00 gas prices in 2008," explained Dr. William W. Roberts, Director of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center at California State University, Northridge. According to Dr. Roberts, Valley residents showed an increase between 2007 and 2008 in the use of carpools and public transportation by almost 17 percent each. "With the onset of our housing crisis there was a slight decline in owner occupied housing and a corresponding increase in renter occupied housing. Evidence appears of a slight shift in Valley employment away from production towards service and sales occupations," added Dr. Roberts. "Valley diversity remains strong and is a powerful force in maintaining stable Valley economic conditions."Robert L. Scott, Director of the Mulholland Institute (a division of The Valley Economic Alliance) said that the "availability of San Fernando Valley Census data has helped in the process of forming a San Fernando Valley Council of Governments and will continue to provide supportive data to help our cities manage regional planning issues." "This data is crucial to our civic and government leaders in charting the course ahead," added Scott."As the economic development and business assistance program serving the San Fernando Valley, having access to Census data for this region is absolutely critical to the work we do" said Bruce Ackerman, President and CEO of The Valley Economic Alliance. "It allows us to tell the story about what is happening to our businesses, and to anticipate the types of services and programs they may need based on economic trends and patterns. We are truly indebted to Congressman Sherman for his efforts to help us secure this valuable information."

12.29.2009	Washington, DC – Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) released the following statement: Republicans seem unable to explain their votes against the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009, which passed the House by a vote of 223 - 202 on December 11, 2009. As they cannot justify their vote on the merits, they have taken to misapplying words spoken by me. In fact, I have been quoted – or should I say misquoted – by, Reps. Bachmann (R-MN), Bachus (R-AL), Capito (R-WV) and Sessions (R-TX), among others. I did indeed describe some of the legislative language proposed by the Treasury Department last summer as “TARP on steroids.” In order to improve this language, I introduced numerous amendments in Committee that were designed to prevent taxpayer money from being used to bailout the giants on Wall Street. Seven of my anti-bailout amendments were ultimately adopted. The Committee also passed anti-bailout amendments offered by Reps. Gutierrez, Kanjorski and others. The bill that reached the floor was hardly TARP on steroids, or even TARP on Valium. It was, on balance, an anti-bailout bill. As I said on the floor of the House just days before the final vote, this bill “reduces executive power to bail out Wall Street.” For the full speech, please see my website. This speech reviews the final bill, section-by-section, on the issue of bailouts. Unfortunately, Republicans seem to have listened carefully to me in October, but were unable to hear me in December. This is particularly regrettable because the bill we took up in December was far different from the proposal I was talking about in October. Despite my best efforts to correct the record, my colleagues from across the aisle continued to misquote me throughout the House’s consideration of regulatory reform, and many continue to do so currently. I am, of course, flattered to be quoted by my colleagues from either side of the aisle. But it is clearly inappropriate to apply my October statements to the dramatically-altered December bill. My Republican colleagues had ample reason to know that my TARP on steroids comment did not apply to the bill we voted on in December. I spoke on the floor to address this issue four times during the House’s consideration of the legislation on December 9th and 10th. Each time, I detailed how the bill we were voting on had changed, from “TARP on steroids” to a bill that would help end taxpayer-funded bailouts. Those who used my October comments to justify voting “No” in December, clearly had little reason for their vote – except that it pleased Wall Street. 1Bachmann, Rep. Michele.

12.11.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved $400,000 in federal appropriations funding for teacher training at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). The funding was included as part of the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the 2010 fiscal year, H.R. 3288. The legislation, which passed the House today, requires Senate approval before being sent to the President for his signature. California State University, Northridge has become a leader nationally in developing new approaches in "clinical training" for teachers. If the legislation becomes law, the appropriated funds would be used to develop and implement a new clinical training model to prepare new teachers and other professionals for our schools. "We thank Congressman Sherman for focusing his work on our efforts at California State University, Northridge to break new educational ground. He has been a tireless supporter of our programs," said Cal State Northridge President Jolene Koester. "I will continue to work to promote progress in education, especially here in the San Fernando Valley," said Congressman Sherman. "Rebuilding our economy isn’t just about making sure the jobs are here, it is about making sure we promote our children’s education and that they are being taught by well-trained teaching professionals."
12.11.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved nearly a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for community justice and drug prevention programs serving the San Fernando Valley. Notably, the House approved $800,000 for the residential treatment center, Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace, $100,000 for the City of Los Angeles’ Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART). The funding was included as part of the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the 2010 fiscal year, H.R. 3288. The legislation is virtually assured of Senate approval and the signature of the President. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to approve federal funds for important Valley projects, especially programs that focus on making our communities more safe and secure," said Congressman Brad Sherman. The largest appropriation is for Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace to strengthen family and mental health services for underserved youth in Los Angeles County. Phoenix Academy is the only facility in Los Angeles County that provides long-term residential treatment for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems. It provides vital services to youth and families struggling with substance abuse and mental health problems andrelated difficulties including educational deficits, conduct disorder, poor health, and victimization. When appropriated, this funding, which was also requested by Representatives Harman, Roybal-Allard, and Berman, would be used to enroll adolescents who would otherwise be unable to afford treatment in the Phoenix Academy. The new funds would add to the $250,000 Sherman secured for the organization’s Access to Treatment Initiative as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009. Also included in the legislation was $100,000 in federal funds for the City of Los Angeles’ Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART). Sherman was joined by Representative Watson (D-CA) in requesting these funds. The Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART) is a law enforcement-based domestic violence crisis response team that seeks to reduce the likelihood of future domestic violence incidents, injury, or escalation. The DART units collaborate with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and victim advocates when responding to reported incidents of domestic violence. Civilian advocates with specialized domestic violence expertise provide counseling, education, referrals to shelters, emergency assistance, and court accompaniment for domestic violence victims and their family members.
12.11.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved nearly one million dollars in federal appropriations funding for highway-rail grade crossing improvements and construction of a transit center in the San Fernando Valley. Specifically, the House approved $550,000 for the construction of the Bob Hope Airport Regional Transportation Center and $400,000 for the Metrolink Sealed Corridor Grade Crossing Improvements along the Los Angeles-Ventura segment. The funding was included as part of the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the 2010 fiscal year, H.R. 3288. The legislation requires approval by the U.S. Senate before being sent to the President for his signature. The Bob Hope Airport Regional Transportation Center, which would receive $550,000, per Sherman’s request, connects the Bob Hope Airport passenger terminals and the adjacent Amtrak/Metrolink Bob Hope Airport Train Station. The center will provide a hub for local and regional buses, as well as Amtrak bus service. Promoting the use of mass transit to access the airport has the correlative effects of reducing the impacts of traffic and air pollution. The Metrolink Sealed Corridor Grade Crossing Improvements project has identified twelve highway-rail crossings needing funding for safety improvements along Metrolink’s Ventura County Line in the west San Fernando Valley. This project, which received $400,000 in the House bill, will build grade crossing safety improvements including median barriers, gates at crossings, fencing at strategic points, and sidewalks, as well as other enhancements.
12.11.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved $300,000 in federal appropriations funding for El Proyecto del Barrio for facilities and medical equipment at its Winnetka clinic. The funding was included as part of the conference report for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for the 2010 fiscal year, H.R. 3288. The legislation requires Senate approval before being sent to the President for his signature. In 2007, El Proyecto del Barrio’s health clinic saw close to 80,000 patients in the San Fernando Valley. The President and Chief Executive Officer of El Proyecto del Barrio, Corinne Sanchez, said, "We thank Congressman Sherman for his dedication to our facility. His efforts have been particularly successful in winning support in Congress." In addition to the $300,000 approved last Friday, Sherman secured $333,000 for the Winnetka clinic last March. Those funds were directed toward the purchase of an electronic medical records system to improve the accuracy, accessibility and quality of patient care. "El Proyecto del Barrio sees over 80,000 patents each year. Most of these patients do not have private health insurance. I am pleased I was able to persuade my colleagues in Congress to help expand the Winnetka Clinic," said Congressman Sherman.
12.07.2009	Washington, D.C. - On Sunday, December 6th, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a town hall at John Burroughs High School, fielding questions from some of the nearly four hundred constituents who attended. Sherman has held over 100 town halls and filled several hundred seats at the John Burroughs High School auditorium on Sunday. This was the first town hall Sherman has held at the school and his second public meeting with constituents following the historic health care vote in September. Congressman Sherman provided a brief update about his work in the 111th Congress before responding to questions about major federal issues, including health care, terrorism and the condition of the economy. “Town hall meetings are critical to the public policy process, providing an opportunity for me to hear about the most pressing concerns in our community and to elaborate on the work that my colleagues and I are tackling in Congress. We had a good discussion about a wide variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “At a time when many of us have loved ones fighting for our freedom abroad and are struggling to endure challenging economic times, it is inspiring how united we remain, and how dedicated we are to making our communities stronger.” Sherman highlighted his continued work fighting against bailouts for Wall Street firms and protecting consumers. Last year, Congressman Sherman fought against the $700 billion Wall Street bailout sought by former President Bush. This year, the Treasury Department is urging Congress to pass a law that would give the federal government permanent, unlimited authority to bail out the largest firms on Wall Street, a proposal Sherman called “TARP on steroids.” Sherman is leading the effort to prevent the Executive Branch of the federal government from getting the authority to provide unlimited bailouts to the giants on Wall Street. Sherman reiterated his commitment to protecting consumers in the Valley by working on legislation to prevent abuses in overdraft protection. New legislation will require banks to obtain the consumer’s consent before enrolling them in expensive overdraft programs. Banks would be required to warn customers when an ATM transaction would cause an overdraft and give the customer the opportunity to cancel the transaction before the overdraft fee is charged. Finally, banks would be prohibited from reordering withdrawals to maximize customer fees. Congressman Sherman directed participants to his Sherman Oaks office, (818) 501-9200, for further assistance in solving problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. He encouraged constituents to visit his website (www.BradSherman.house.gov) for more helpful information.

11.03.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced that California State University, Northridge (CSUN) received $165,000 in federal funding for construction of the Valley Performing Arts Center. Once completed, the Valley Performing Arts Center at CSUN will serve as the premier cultural destination for thousands of residents throughout the San Fernando Valley, as well as Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. "The Valley Performing Arts Center at CSUN will serve as a world-class venue for student and professional theatrical and musical productions," said Congressman Sherman. "This new venue will allow Valley residents to enjoy a variety of theater performances right in the heart of the San Fernando Valley, enhancing the cultural and intellectual spirit of the community." California State University, Northridge is currently building the 160,000 square foot state-of-the-arts center, which includes a 1,700-seat main performance hall. Other features include a 178-seat black box theater for experimental and smaller-scale student productions, two full-size rehearsal spaces, indoor and outdoor entertainment areas, lecture halls, and a full studio for the award-winning campus radio station, KCSN-FM. The $125 million Valley Performing Arts Center will be completed by August 2010. The opening gala is scheduled for January 2011. "We truly appreciate Congressman Sherman's assistance with this funding. It takes us a large step closer to ensuring that people who live or work in the San Fernando Valley have a place to call their own, where they can experience world class art and culture," said Dr. Jolene Koester, President of California State University, Northridge. California State University, Northridge is one of California’s largest universities educating more than 35,000 students each year. Since coming to Congress, Congressman Sherman has helped secure approximately $1.8 million in federal appropriations funding various projects and programs including the Valley Performing Arts Center, the Michael D. Eisner College of Education for teacher education programs, the Mike Curb College of Arts, Media and Communication for arts education programs, transportation improvements and an entertainment technology program.
11.02.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman is proposing legislation to allow Bob Hope and Van Nuys Airports to implement mandatory nighttime curfews from 10 PM to 7 AM. Sherman’s legislation comes in the wake of the Federal Aviation Administration’s decision to reject the "Part 161" application submitted by the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority, which requested a waiver to impose nighttime curfews at the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank. Sherman had sent letters to the Federal Aviation Administration in support of the curfew. "The way the Federal Aviation Administration interprets existing law, no airport in the country would be able to get a nighttime curfew. This bill is designed to provide peace and quiet at night in the San Fernando Valley," said Congressman Sherman. The curfew in Sherman's legislation includes a clear exclusion for medical and other emergency flights, and will not affect a single commercial airline passenger. Rather, it would affect a few cargo flights each day or each night. "This bill was drafted in conjunction with the City of Burbank. I hope to have the support of all the Members of Congress from the San Fernando Valley," said Sherman. Sherman has also been involved in securing federal grants for noise mitigation measures in the community surrounding the Bob Hope Airport. The residential neighborhoods next to both of San Fernando Valley’s airports were built very close to the airports long before the advent of noisy jet aircraft. The airport has thus far received $83.6 million. The measures to soundproof homes and protect families from the roar of jet engines include replacing doors and windows, insulating attics, and improving weather stripping and ventilation.
10.29.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that $1,000,000 in federal appropriations funding to acquire land for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was approved by the House. The funds were secured in the Fiscal Year 2010 Interior and Environment appropriations bill, which was recently agreed upon by members of both the House and Senate. The Senate is expected to pass the legislation, and a signature from President Obama is assured, according to Congressman Sherman. "Congressman Sherman always remembers the Santa Monica Mountains,” said National Park Service Superintendent Woody Smeck. "The congressman’s help is always appreciated and he should be applauded for his commitment.” Congressman Sherman has been dedicated to expanding the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area since he was elected to Congress in 1997. With these additional funds, Sherman has won over $20 million for projects to preserve and expand the park. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is the nation’s largest urban national park, and it is estimated that it receives over 35 million visits each year. “The park is a national treasure, right here, in the Valley’s back yard.” Sherman said. “I am pleased that I was able to acquire funds to grow its boundaries and preserve the natural habitat.” Sherman, along with Senator Feinstein and Representative Berman, requested the funding, which will be used to acquire land for the Santa Monica Mountain National Recreation Area.
10.28.2009	The new Resolution Authority, set forth in Treasury’s 253-page legislative draft of October 27, 2009 provides permanent, unlimited bailout authority. This means: (1) Unprecedented powers for the executive to decide spending and taxes, without congressional approval; and (2) Depending on the desires of the Executive Branch from time to time, the greatest transfer of money from the Treasury to Wall Street in U.S. history.The Executive Branch may loan an unlimited amount to any solvent financial institution “if necessary to prevent financial instability” (§1109(a)), or to a troubled financial institution, the default of which would “have serious effects on economic condition in the United States (§1603(b)(2) and §1604(c)(1)). As to troubled firms, the bailout can also take the form of purchasing assets from the institution (§1604(c)(2)) or investing in the institution (§1604(b)(4)). The Secretary of the Treasury has rejected a $1 Trillion limit on this bailout power in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee on September 23, 2009. When bailout funds are lent to a solvent financial institution under §1109, the executives and shareholders lose nothing. Executives keep their jobs and their compensation packages; shareholders retain all their rights. In contrast, when a troubled institution receives a bailout under §1604, some executives lose their jobs, and shareholders have to stand behind taxpayers. The chief beneficiary of bailouts of troubled institutions is the creditors. The chief economic effect of Treasury’s proposed unlimited bailout legislation is to cause creditors to lend money on favorable terms to “systemically important institutions” (the top 10 to 25). If the institution cannot repay those creditors, the Government probably will. However, the shareholders of bailed out insolvent institutions also stand to benefit handsomely. The taxpayers take an enormous risk by investing in the insolvent entity. If things go well, the taxpayers merely get their money back, and the shareholders get a revived profitable corporation. The taxpayer losses are supposed to be recovered from a new tax imposed on large and medium-large financial institutions. The statute requires the Executive Branch to recoup taxpayer funds within 60 months, but then, allows them to extend this period for as long as they want. (§1609(o)(1)). Further, it is difficult to see how any tax on financial institutions would provide hundreds of Billions of revenue, which might be needed to repay a large bailout. The Executive Branch is empowered to write this new tax law. (Under our Constitutional system, the House of Representatives is supposed to write tax laws.) Congress will have no say in whether the tax is designed to produce $10 Million in revenue per year, or $10 Billion. How much will be paid each year by a medium-sized financial institution — whether it will pay $100,000 or $100 Million — will be decided by the Executive Branch, and the amount could be $100,000 in one year, and $100 Million the next. This law will allow those institutions which are clearly systematically important (the top 10 to 25) to borrow at a lower cost. This will help the largest institutions get bigger, so they can pose a greater systemic risk. Those financial institutions which are medium-large ($10 Billion to $90 Billion in assets) will have to pay whatever tax the Executive Branch imposes. However, they will not be able to borrow at lower rates, because investors will not believe they will be bailed out. Under the plan, bailouts are supposed to go only to the “systemically important” institutions. So those medium-large institutions will fund a program which benefits only their truly large competitors. While the tax imposed on large and medium-large financial institutions is called an “assessment” or an “insurance premium,” it is clearly a tax. No one has a right to collect any insurance amount — whether anyone gets a bailout is at the whim of the Executive Branch. It’s like being forced to pay insurance on your competitor’s business, while yours goes uninsured. The tax is also called “polluter pays.” But the “polluter” — the financial institution that took big risks, and became insolvent — pays nothing. Instead, prudent financial institutions must compete against the high-flyers in the good times, and then pay to bail out their high-flying competitors in the bad times. _______________________________________________________________________________ This paper analyzes the legislative proposal put forward by Treasury on October 27, 2009. Since then, I have had some preliminary discussions with Chairman Frank. The Chairman may consider accepting amendments which will address some of my concerns. Such amendments might provide for a sunset (with expedited consideration of legislation providing for an extension) and/or dollar limits on the amount of taxpayer funds advanced.
10.22.2009	Washington, D.C. - For thirteen years in Congress, I’ve been focused on Iran. When Madeleine Albright opened our markets to Iranian goods in 2000 --- not to oil, but only the stuff that we don’t need and they couldn’t sell anywhere else --- I went down to the House floor and said “there’s blood in the caviar.” Well, my fellow panelist pointed out those Iranian goods still have access to the American markets. If the nation wants to protect its national security, it must prioritize. The number one priority in American foreign policy should be to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. An Iranian nuclear bomb means the end of the worldwide nonproliferation regime. Iran is the number one state sponsor of terror; now imagine Iranian worldwide terror with impunity. A nuclear Iran can interfere with the straits of Hormuz or engage any other provocative action and that provocation will involve us going eyeball-to-eyeball with a hostile nuclear state, not one led by Khrushchev, but led by someone far less sane. And finally, if the Tehran regime thinks its going to be overthrown, inshallah, they could use their nuclear weapons against Israel in an effort to regain popularity, or against the United States, figuring they might as well go out with a bang. And do not let your neighbors tell you not to worry and feel safe behind a missile-defense shield in the United States, because it is easier to smuggle a nuclear weapon than it is to smuggle a person across our border, and you do not have to be a rocket scientist to smuggle a nuclear weapon inside a bale of marijuana. Let me speak briefly about the military option. We are all aware that Israel acted militarily to stop the nuclear program of Saddam Hussein and then Syria. The nuclear sites in Iran are harder and better hidden. Now, I have strongly opposed any declaration by the US Congress – and we’ve fought these off on the floor, successfully – that the US would not use military force against Iran to stop its nuclear program. I regard such a declaration as Ambien for Ahmadinejad – it would just help him sleep better. There are two other reasons why we should at least leave the military option on the table. One is to strengthen the argument of those Iranian forces that are saying “maybe we ought to give up our nuclear program, in return for the very generous terms offered by the West; it may get blown up before it yields any fruit, anyway.” Second, we need to convince Europe that we are serious, that they should go along with tough economic measures against Iran. If they block economic pressure on Iran, the Europeans are simply increasing the likelihood of more lethal pressure. Israel could take military action. It would be highly problematic, however, and it could take either of two forms. One is the most talked about, which is a one to two week air campaign against Iran’s nuclear sites. The second version would then add Israeli action or the threat of Israeli action against the strategic and energy sites in Iran. Israel could threaten such action if Iran did not verifiably and permanently renounce nuclear programs and nuclear research. But, as I said, this military approach is extremely problematic and we ought to focus instead on how we can force the Iranian regime to give up its nuclear program. We owe a special debt of gratitude to the mullahs in Tehran because their mismanagement, corruption and oppression have made Iran vulnerable to economic pressure. Vulnerable to what I call economic diplomacy. Let us look at that economic vulnerability. Iran has a large and growing population with twenty percent unemployment. Their budget is based on a minimum price of seventy-five dollars a barrel but they are only getting fifty. They are dependent on a large quantity of imports which they are having a difficult time financing – they especially need parts for systems that they already own. For example, they’ve got a lot of Boeing jets that they bought prior to the imposition of the U.S. embargo. Those aging jets were going to be grounded in 2005 except for the fact that the Bush Administration allowed our companies to sell replacement parts to the Iranians, thus demonstrating that our aircraft manufactures are reliable suppliers, even to a country that is creating nuclear weapons in order to annihilate Israel. I’m not sure it was the right decision. Europe has far more opportunities to say “we won’t provide this or that or replacement part or technologies that Iran needs.” Iran is in no way self sufficient; the sophisticated electric generation facilities, the sophisticated computer facilities, sophisticated aircraft systems, telephone systems, these are all coming in from abroad. Iran’s oil fields need technology and capital because the infrastructure is getting old and production is petering out. Iran has to import thirty percent of its refined petroleum, the gasoline needed for its cars and diesel for trucks. The Iranians need capital, especially in a fifty dollar a barrel world. So, they have significant vulnerability.We’ve got broadcasting resources, and nothing would please me more than to go on Radio Farda to tell the Iranian people and the Iranian elites they will face economic and diplomatic strangulation unless they abandon this nuclear program. The problem is that I can’t lie this well in Farsi. Iran does not yet face economic and diplomatic isolation. The good news is that we have a lot of tools in the toolbox, tools that would be sufficient for the job. The bad news is that all of those tools are still in the toolbox, and after thirteen years of this I’m getting a little frustrated. Let’s review some of those tools. First, we need to implement existing law. We should enforce the Iran Sanctions Act, formerly known as the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act. We used the sanctions effectively against Libya, Qaddafi changed his behavior, and we dropped Libya from the statute. The law says that if an oil company invests $20 million in oil production facilities in Iran, the State Department must name and shame this company, and then the President must either impose sanctions or waive them and explain to the American people why its in our national interest to do so. What has the State Department done? They’ve cancelled their subscription to the Wall Street Journal so they can plausibly say they’re not aware of all the stories in the Wall Street Journal about international companies making investments of $20 million or more in the Iranian oil fields. This approach was adopted in 1998 in the Clinton Administration, continued for eight years by the Bush Administration, and I have not seen a change in the Obama Administration, but it’s only been a hundred days. So we start by enforcing the Iran Sanctions Act. But what about the new legislation? First, the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act. This bill is designed to further the efforts of states such as Florida and California that have enacted divestment measures against Iran. The argument that you run into with state governments and local governments, pension plans, municipal governments and with mutual fund managers is they say “Oh, if I don’t invest for the best possible return, I’ll get sued.” Now some are genuinely afraid of lawsuits, some are just making an excuse. Either way, this bill says they can’t be sued. We’ve passed legislation saying the same thing for divestment efforts aimed at Sudan for the Darfur Genocide. We’ve passed this same Iran bill through the House in 2007 and again in 2008, we could not pass this through the Senate even though Senator Obama was the Senate sponsor of the legislation. We’ve got to pass it now. Next, the Iran Diplomatic Enhancement Act says that the Iran Sanctions Act, which focuses on investments in the oil and gas fields of Iran, should also apply to selling gasoline to Iran or selling refining equipment to Iran. Next, the Enable Divestment from Sudan and Iran Act. You’ve got some individual investors who want to divest, but a few of them realize that if they sell the stock at a profit, they are going to owe the cap gains tax. So what do we do? We say if you sell stock in a bad company and invest in a good company, you do not owe any taxes until you sell the stock in the good company some future time down the road. You’ll pay the full tax at that time. We hope to have the support of the Darfur divestment community and I hope you’ll mention this to those Members of Congress that are particularly interested in Darfur. Next, the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps Designation Implementation Act. The IRGC has already been designated a terrorist organization. We need to designate all its front groups as terrorist organizations, but we can go beyond that. It’s called secondary sanctions. Here’s where Europeans come in. It’s one thing to say we need to prevent Americans from doing business with the IRGC. Now, if the IRGC want to buy trucks, they buy from Mercedes through one of their front businesses. The question on secondary sanctions is, if Mercedes is selling trucks to a terrorist organization, can they still sell them to you? This bill would say no. Needless to say, this bill will be hard to pass, and we need your help. Next is the International Uranium Extraction Control Act, which says: do not sell anything of relevance to uranium mining and milling to Iran, North Korea or Syria. Next, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Reauthorization Act, which is a longtime agency of the federal government which supports U.S. exports and business activities overseas that assist with development projects. Its charter expires this year. Its jurisdiction is in my subcommittee. This bill will say to OPIC that you cannot help a corporation that is doing bad things in Iran. Under this bill, OPIC will look at your entire enterprise, so don’t play games with your subsidiaries and other affiliates. If one of the entities in a corporate family is doing bad things, your entire corporate family is disqualified from receiving OPIC assistance. Finally, the Iran Counter-Proliferation Act. This was Tom Lantos’ bill, alav ha-shalom, and I will reintroduce it in the coming weeks. It bans all Iranian imports into the U.S., prohibits U.S. companies from doing business with Iran through their foreign-incorporated subsidiaries, and bans the sale of spare aircraft parts to Iran. In addition what can we do without actually passing legislation? Sometimes we’re able to push on administrative agencies. Two partial successes. First, Vitol, a major Swiss oil trading company, sells gasoline to Iran. It also has a major contract with the Department of Energy. We got a decision out of the Department of Energy recently which says, in effect, no more contracts with Vitol. This company pled guilty to paying Saddam kickbacks in the Oil-for-Food scandal. Next is Reliance, the energy giant in India. This firm was getting help from the Export-Import bank. In response to Congressional pressure, they suspended gasoline shipments to Iran for several months; unfortunately, now it looks like they’re resuming those shipments. Next, multilateral organizations. The World Bank approved $1.4 billion in concessionary loans to Iran from 2000-2005. We, in effect, acquiesced to this; we could have stopped it, but that would have made the Europeans upset, so we did not. $500 million from these loans still has not been disbursed. We could stop the final disbursement. That would make the Europeans upset, so we have no plans to do that. AIPAC at its very core advocates US foreign aid, so please don’t tell anybody back home that one of the major recipients of foreign aid is also aiding terror. Just don’t tell anyone. Now, the much bigger issue is the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, it’s going to get roughly $100 billion from the United States, similar amounts from Europe, a big check from Japan. Why? To allow it to bail out countries during this worldwide economic crisis, to make the IMF more bailout ready. My view is we should not make the IMF bailout ready as long as Iran is bailout eligible. Even if the IMF never provides loans to Iran, it enhances Iran’s international credit; the world would know that if everything melts down, Iran may get an IMF bailout. We’ve got to make the IMF choose between the United States and our $100 billion and the potential relationship with Iran. More important than the IMF and the World Bank is the United Nations, where we have to deal with Russia and China. Nothing could be more powerful in this effort than strong UN sanctions against Iran. Real sanctions, not the joke of a regime we have now. We could be successful in this effort, obviously, if we could get Putin to sound like Sherman. Unfortunately, we have never offered Russia or China anything in return for them cooperating with us on Iran at the U.N. In fact, we’ve told Russia that their votes on Iran will not affect our policies towards Chechnya, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Moldova or anything else Russia cares about. Likewise, we’ve never pointed out to China how we pressured Taiwan to drop plans to develop nuclear weapons, and that our policy may be affected by whether or not they help block Iran from developing nuclear weapons. And, by the way, we have never suggested that the next shipment of tennis shoes will be stopped at the port if China continues to be unhelpful on Iran at the United Nations. If we made it clear to Russia or China that things they care about are dependent on their support of our efforts against Iran at the United Nations, I think you would see improved cooperation from those two countries. And if we have the Russians and Chinese --- not even their support but just their acquiescence at the UN --- we could get a worldwide binding resolution prohibiting the export to Iran of refined oil products that would put Iran in big trouble within a few weeks. We have that opportunity. We have to overcome the political power of the oil companies, the intransigence of the State Department bureaucracy, the ideological power in the argument that corporations should be allowed to do whatever they want without governmental interference, and we have to remember that the centrifuges are turning right now. Preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons should be the number one foreign policy objective of the United States. We have the powerful economic and diplomatic tools, and we better start using them right away. *Delivered in May 2009. Legislative appendix updated periodically.Legislative Efforts to Increase Economic Pressure on Iran The Iran Sanctions Enabling Act, HR 1327 (Frank, Berman, Sherman and Meeks) – This bill will provide federal authorization for states and municipalities to enact Iran divestment legislation. States and municipalities may face lawsuits when they enact divestment measures under various legal theories. The bill would provide similar protection to private asset managers, such as mutual fund managers, from suits brought under the theory of breach of fiduciary duty should they choose to divest from certain firms. These firms include those that invest $20 million in the energy sector of Iran, those that provide credit to facilitate such investment, firms that provide shipping for Iran’s energy sector, as well as companies that provide products or services related to pipeline construction. This bill passed the House Financial Services Committee on April 27 and awaits action in the full House. Iran Diplomatic Enhancement Act of 2009, HR 1985 (Kirk and Sherman) – It would add sales of refined petroleum and related services and the provision of refining equipment or technology services to actions sanctionable under the Iran Sanctions Act. A similar bill, the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act of 2009, HR 2194 (Berman and six others, including Sherman) was introduced on April 30. The bill has 294 cosponsors. The Senate counterpart was introduced by Senators Evan Bayh, Joe Lieberman and Jon Kyl and is designated S. 908. Iran, despite being an oil rich country, must import as much as 40 percent of its gasoline and other refined petroleum needs. The Enable Divestment from Sudan and Iran Act, H.R. 3516 (Sherman, Ros-Lehtinen and 17 others) – This bill would allow taxpayers that divest from firms doing business in Iran or Sudan to reinvest in firms or mutual funds that have no such business with Iran and Sudan. Such taxpayers would not be taxed, but would “carry-over” their basis in the new investment. This bill will be reintroduced very soon. Iran Revolutionary Guard Designation Implementation Act, H.R. 2375 (Sherman, Ros-Lehtinen, Kirk, Klein and Royce) – The Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) was designated a terrorist organization and proliferation concern by the U.S. Treasury in late 2007. Relatively few of the front companies that the IRGC operates have also been designated. A strong effort by the Administration to designate all known IRGC fronts, aliases and agents could have a significant effect on Iran’s economy. The bill calls on the President to designate all known entities within 90 days of passage of this bill and provides for strong sanctions against those that continue to do business with the IRGC and its various fronts. This bill was introduced on May 12, 2009. International Uranium Extraction Control Act of 2009, H.R. 2290 (Sherman, Royce and Ros-Lehtinen) – This bill would impose U.S. sanctions on companies providing mining and milling equipment to Iran, North Korea or Syria. Reduce Iranian Cyber-Suppression Act, H.R. 3284 (Sherman, Royce and Klein) – This legislation would prohibit federal contracting with firms that supply Iran with technology that allows the government to spy on its own citizens or suppress their ability to express their opinions via electronic media. Sherman and his colleagues introduced this legislation in July, 2009; it is identical to legislation introduced in the Senate, authored by senators Charles Schumer (D-NY) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). Overseas Private Investment Corporation Reauthorization Act (Sherman) – This legislation includes a novel provision authored by Brad Sherman that would require that any company receiving assistance from this U.S. government agency to certify that it has no prohibited investments or business in any state sponsor of terrorism. These include: an investment of $20 million or more in the energy sector; a loan or extension of credit to the government of $5 million or more for more than 45 days; or a transfer of arms to any state sponsor in the previous three years. The initial version of this bill was passed by the House in 2007 (H.R. 2798, Sherman). It is must-pass legislation for 2009, since OPIC’s charter expires later this year.
10.16.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives has approved his project request for $500,000 in federal funding for vegetation management in high burn hazard areas in the north San Fernando Valley. The program will enable the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) to clear vegetation in areas that pose the greatest risk of wildfires and threat to life and property. The LAFD will collaborate with other agencies to survey high hazard areas, plan for vegetation trimming and removal, clear "laddering fuels" (the undergrowth that wildfires climb into the tree canopy), dense trees and thickets, and overgrowth of chaparral. The funding was included in the FY2010 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which was recently agreed upon by members of both the House and Senate. Passage by the Senate and a signature from President Obama are assured, according to Congressman Sherman. "It is often said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and this project is a good example," said Congressman Sherman. "The damage caused by the Station Fire could have been limited had we implemented more of these projects before the fire started. We need to learn from that experience." The Station Fire burned more than 160,000 acres and caused in excess of $93,779,000 in damage. The fire damaged or destroyed 266 structures. Last fall, three major wildfires ravaged the north San Fernando Valley in the City of Los Angeles burning over 30,000 acres and destroying or damaging over 750 structures, including nearly 500 mobile homes. The wildfires, which were declared a major federal disaster by the President, were fanned by seasonal Santa Ana winds and fueled by dry brush in the hillsides above heavily populated communities. All three North Valley fires, the Marek, Sesnon, and Sayre were in Congressman Sherman’s district. Pre-disaster planning for wild fires could also potentially prevent mudslides and ground movement during the rain seasons.
10.08.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that research institutes in the San Fernando Valley are receiving nearly four million dollars in combined grant funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), also known as the Stimulus Bill, provides an unprecedented level of funding to the NIH to help stimulate the US economy through the support and advancement of scientific research. The NIH targeted projects that were likely to stimulate the economy, create or retain jobs, and have the potential for making scientific progress in 2 years. “I’m glad that Valley research institutes, including California State University at Northridge (CSUN), are continuing to receive federal funding for their innovations. These funds are dedicated to sustaining significant scientific research and to stimulating our local economy,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am proud of CSUN for their sustained excellence, and I will continue to highlight important local projects and organizations whenever possible.” The projects, summarized below, are described in greater detail on the NIH website, https://report.nih.gov/recovery/arragrants.cfm The ARRA was signed into law by President Obama on February 17, 2009 as the country faced the greatest economic crisis in a generation. Approximately one-third of the Recovery Act comes in the form of tax relief for families and businesses, and the other two-thirds is made up of spending ranging from state financial assistance to infrastructure and technology projects. California State University, Northridge 1) Role of E4BP4 in Glucocorticoid-Evoked Lymphocyte Apoptosis -- The purpose of this project is to understand the molecular pathway for apoptosis, cell death. Funding Amount: $80,250 (Grant Extension) 2) An Environmentally Benign Method for the Synthesis of C-Aryl Glycosides -- The objective of the project is to develop an environmentally friendly method for the synthesis of C-Aryl glycosides, a family of natural products which demonstrate properties such as antitumor, antibiotic and antifungal activities. Current methods of synthesis involve the use of corrosive acids and toxic metals. Funding Amount: $60,152 (Grant Extension) 3) Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) Support of Competitive Research (SCORE) at California State University, Northridge -- The goals of this program are to improve CSUN’s research capacity and infrastructure and to increase minority participation in basic biomedical research. Funding Amount: $100,000 (Grant Extension) 4) Multiscale Simulations of Transport in DNA and DNA-Carbon Nanotube Systems -- Nanopore sequencing is a method to determine the order in which nucleotides occur on a strand of DNA. The project aims to carry out calculations of the atomic and electronic structure and transport properties of DNA and DNA-carbon nanotube hybrid systems. The motivation for the project is to gain insight into the unusual electronic and transport properties of these systems that could lead to new types of probes and sensors. Funding Amount: $149,873 (Grant Extension) 5) Temporal and Spatial Relationships of Protein in Yeast NER -- UV rays from sunlight cause chemical reactions in DNA, which give rise to mutations in skin cells and leads to the development of skin cancer. One way the body defends against the effects of UV light is the Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER), a biological process to remove damage to DNA. A complete understanding of the biochemistry by which cells repair DNA is essential to developing new pharmaceuticals that minimize skin cancer. Funding Amount: $66,100 (Grant Extension) Bandemar Networks, LLC Mobile Just-In-Time Training of Emergency Response Personnel – Phase II -- Skilled Service Personnel (SSP), such as laborers, operating engineers, carpenters, etc., support emergency response organizations during an emergency, but they rarely have recent training on the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and/or explosive agents they may encounter or personal protective equipment relevant to the incident. The project addresses this shortfall by developing a wireless lesson delivery system called the Just-In-Time Training for Emergency Incidents System. Funding Amount: $143,334 (Two Grant Extensions) Sepulveda Research Corporation Mechanisms of Race-Based Differences in Factor VIII Immunogenicity in Hemophilia -- The study will elucidate mechanisms of immune responses to the infused factor VIII (FVIII) used to stop bleeding in hemophilia patients. Funding Amount: $3,349,126 (New Grant)
10.01.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that the House of Representatives approved a half million dollars in federal appropriations funding for a smart grid initiative in the City of Burbank. Today, the House passed the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for 2010, which includes this project. The Senate is expected to pass the bill next week. The federal funds will help Burbank Water and Power’s program to develop an advanced “smart grid” that incorporates state-of-the-art systems and Wi-Fi technology. Burbank’s smart grid system would transition from existing infrastructure into a system that can better direct renewable energy resources -- the charging of plug-in hybrid cars, for example -- while making it more efficient and resilient to both natural events and malicious attacks. “Anyone who lived through California’s energy crisis knows that our energy infrastructure not only needs to be updated to meet increased demand but also to incorporate new technologies,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is important to develop new sustainable energy sources and technologies, and it is also important to have modern means and methods to distribute that energy.” Congressman Adam Schiff also supported this appropriation request.
10.01.2009	Washington, D.C. - Federal spending legislation passed by the House of Representatives today includes $2 million for U.S.–Israel energy cooperation. This funding represents the second appropriation for a program originally sponsored by Congressman Brad Sherman as the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act. The funds will go to a grant program that will provide assistance to cooperative efforts by Israeli and U.S. government agencies, businesses, and academic institutions to develop technologies that will utilize alternative energy sources and increase energy efficiency. These funds were included in the Energy and Water Appropriations Act for 2010. Israeli officials have committed to contribute matching funds for this project. “This is an important step in our efforts to cooperate with a partner that has a proven record of innovation in the field of energy research,” Sherman said. “Israel should be viewed, not as a place of tsuris, rather, as a place where hope, energy, and ideas are generated. I look forward to working with the Obama Administration on ramping up this program in future budgets.” “Israel and the United States already have a long track record of successful, cooperative research in medicine, biotech, and agriculture,” Sherman added. “It’s time we work together to tackle the great challenges of our time --- energy security and job creation.” Congressman Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2004, along with Congressman John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Eliot Engel (D-NY). Congress ultimately enacted the legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, in December 2007. The cooperative project received an initial $2 million appropriation last year as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2009. In a June 2008 address to the America Israel Public Affairs Committee, then-candidate Barack Obama praised Sherman’s legislation and pledged to increase U.S. cooperative efforts with Israel: “It is time for the United States to take real steps to end our addiction to oil, and we can join Israel, building on last year’s U.S.-Israeli Energy Cooperation Act to deepen our partnership in developing alternative sources of energy. We should work with Israel, increasing scientific collaboration and joint research and development.” The Energy and Water Appropriations Act for 2010 will likely be passed by the Senate soon and sent to the president for final approval.
09.23.2009	Washington, D.C. - In his questioning of Secretary Geithner before the Financial Services Committee today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) focused on the new bailout authority included in the 618 page legislative proposal submitted by the Treasury Department. Sherman described Geithner’s proposal as “TARP on steroids”. He noted that Section 1204 of the proposal allows the executive branch to use taxpayer money to make loans to, or invest in, the largest financial institutions to avoid a systemic risk to the economy. Sherman compared Geithner’s proposal to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the $700 billion Wall Street bailout adopted last year. Sherman noted that TARP was limited to two years, and to a maximum of $700 billion. Section 1204 is unlimited in dollar amount and is a permanent grant of power to the executive branch. TARP contained some limits on executive compensation and an array of special oversight authorities. Section 1204 contains absolutely no limits on executive compensation and no special oversight. Sherman asked Secretary Geithner whether he would accept a $1 trillion limit on the new bailout authority; if the executive branch wanted to spend more, it would have to come back to Congress. Geithner rejected a $1 Trillion limit, insisting that the executive branch be able to respond without coming back to Congress. Finally, Sherman noted that both TARP and the Treasury proposal have vague provisions under which taxpayers might possibly recover any money lost through a special tax on the financial services industry. Sherman noted that under the Treasury proposal, only the very largest institutions could benefit from a bailout, but the special tax, if ever collected, would fall chiefly on medium-sized institutions. Thus, the medium-sized institutions will be at a competitive disadvantage for two reasons. First, the largest institutions will be able to borrow money more cheaply because their creditors will believe that if the institution is unable to pay, the taxpayers will. Second, if there ever is a bailout benefitting a very large financial institution, the tax will be imposed on the medium-sized institutions.
09.16.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has made available low-interest disaster loans for homeowners, property owners, renters, and businesses impacted by the Station Fire, which has destroyed or damaged 102 homes and 48 commercial properties mostly within the Angeles National Forest. The SBA is making these low-interest loans available to help individuals and families cover the gap between the cost of rebuilding and the amount of insurance settlements. “Federal assistance is available now to help those directly impacted by the largest fire in Los Angeles County’s modern history. With this assistance, homeowners and businesses that lost their property during this devastating fire within the Angeles National Forest area can start to rebuild their homes and businesses,” said Congressman Sherman. Disaster loans up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property. Homeowners and renters are eligible for up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property. Businesses may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property. SBA representatives will be on-hand at two locations in Acton and Sylmar to issue loan applications, answer questions about the disaster loan program, and help individuals complete loan applications. The SBA Disaster Loan Outreach Centers will be open at the following locations on the indicated dates and times: Acton Acton Community Center 3748 Nickels Avenue Open Sept 17, 9am-6pm Sept 21, 28 and Oct 5, 9am-6pm Sylmar Veterans Memorial Park 13000 Sayre Street Open Sept 17-18, 9am-7pm Sept 19, 9am-2pm Sept 21-24, 9am-7pm Fire victims can also apply for disaster loans by calling the SBA toll-free at (800) 659-2955 or online at www.sba.gov/services/disasterassistance.

09.09.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) issued the following statement after President Barack Obama addressed a Joint Session of Congress on the issue of health insurance reform: “Tonight the President began to do something that we needed to do early in the process: explain to Americans who like their health coverage why a change in law is necessary. “The President was clear. If you like the coverage you have, and we adopt his reform proposal, you can keep what you have. “However, if you like the coverage you have, and we do not adopt a reform proposal, you will not keep what you have. A failure to change our laws guarantees very adverse changes in the health insurance marketplace. “As people with good coverage already understand, their Insurance cards are shrinking. Every day, there are higher deductibles, higher copayments, limits on what services are provided, and the total amount that can be spent to keep any one person alive. Every day, the costs to employers and to employees, goes up. And every day some employers either drop coverage, or switch to some super-high deductible plan. “Even if your employer continues to provide great coverage, your employer must compete with other companies that are providing less. Every day your employer is paying more for health coverage, and some of your employer’s competitors are paying less—by dropping or gutting the health coverage they offer to their employees. “Today, there are 46 million uninsured and one in five persons taken to the emergency room does not have coverage. Hospitals do not collect for the emergency services provided to the uninsured. Hospitals must then increase what they charge those patients who do have coverage. Those increases are translated into higher charges to your health insurance company, and higher premiums to employers and employees. As a result of these increases, some employers drop coverage. “Soon we’ll have 56 million or 66 million uninsured. Soon it will be one in three, or one in four persons taken to an emergency room that do not have coverage, and for whom the hospital is not paid. At that point, hospitals will have to close their emergency rooms because they cannot charge two patients who have coverage enough money to cover one patient who doesn’t. “Again, if you like what you have and we adopt the President’s plan, you keep it. If you like what you have and we do not adopt the President’s plan, you lose it. In Support of a Public Option: “A public option is of vital importance in putting together a health reform package. The public option will compete with the private insurance companies, forcing them to provide real coverage at fair prices. A public option does not mean the end of private insurance. It will actually lead to better private insurance. The introduction of express mail by the post office has hardly put Federal Express, UPS, and DHL out of business. “The statutory proposals are clear. The public entity will not receive subsidies. It will compete fairly with existing private insurance companies.”

08.04.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, the most senior Democrat on the House Financial Services committee to have opposed the Troubled Asset Relief Program, reacted today to reports that the Security and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) levied a $33 million fine against Bank of America (BofA) for keeping investors in the dark over billions of dollars of bonuses paid to Merrill Lynch bankers in the wake of a $50 billion merger with the Wall Street brokerage firm last year. "The S.E.C. determined that Bank of America executives lied to Bank of America shareholders about $5.8 billion in executive bonuses. The executives lied. Shareholders were the victims of that lie. The S.E.C. solution: take $33 million from the shareholders. “Not one penny is taken from the BofA executives who told the lies, or from the Merrill Lynch executives who got the $5.8 billion in highly questionable bonuses. The fine reduces the shareholders equity. The fine is only .6 percent of the bonuses at issue – too small to force a change in the BofA management. “The S.E.C. should be fining those executives who lied to shareholders in the Proxy statement and should prevent BofA from indemnifying those executives. Instead, under the crony capitalism enshrined on Wall Street, only a slap on the wrist will be administered – and it was imposed on the victims of the lie, the shareholders.”
07.31.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressmen Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Ed Royce (R-CA), joined by more than two hundred of their colleagues, are urging the Saudi Arabian government to seize on this historical moment to foster peace in the Middle East in a letter to be delivered this evening. The letter calls on the Saudi government to engage directly with the Israelis to discuss a resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The letter to King Abdullah builds on comments made by President Obama earlier this year in his address to the Muslim World, when he called on Arab states to live up to their responsibility and recognize Israeli legitimacy. "…Arab states must recognize that the Arab Peace Initiative was an important beginning, but not the end of their responsibility," Obama said. “The Arab-Israeli conflict should no longer be used to distract the people of Arab nations from other problems. Instead, it must be a cause for action to help the Palestinian people develop the institutions that will sustain their state, to recognize Israel's legitimacy and to choose progress over a self-defeating focus on the past." The Saudi Arabian government authored the Arab Peace Initiative, first proposed at an Arab League summit in 2002, which calls for Arab states to normalize relations with Israel in return for Israeli withdrawal to the 1967 "Green Line" and a settlement of the Palestinian refugee issue. This proposal is potentially an important step by the Arab states toward peace with Israel, as it holds out the possibility of Arab recognition of Israel. However, the Saudis have treated the proposal as a take-it-or-leave-it offer. Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argues, “it is not enough for the Saudis to put forward a peace proposal and treat it as a take-it-or-leave-it document that the Israelis must fulfill in total before the Arab states take any concrete steps toward peace with Israel.” "How can there be peace without recognition of Israel? Direct engagement between the parties is essential if there is to be a chance at peace," remarked Royce, also a senior member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. In part, the letter reads, “We have been disappointed thus far to see the public reaction of your government to President Obama’s request. Rather than expressing willingness to break down barriers between Arabs and Israelis, your foreign minister asserted that Saudi Arabia could not take any step toward normalization before the return of all Arab land.” To view the letter please click here.
07.27.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that The House of Representatives today approved $300,000 in federal appropriations funding for El Proyecto del Barrio for facilities and medical equipment at their Winnetka clinic. The funding was included in the Labor – Health and Human Services – Education Appropriations bill for the 2010 fiscal year, which passed the full House of Representatives on Friday. The legislation requires Senate approval before being sent to the President for his signature. In 2007, El Proyecto del Barrio’s health clinic saw close to 80,000 patients in the San Fernando Valley. The President and Chief Executive Officer of El Proyecto del Barrio, Corinne Sanchez, said, "We thank Congressman Sherman for his dedication to our facility. His efforts have been particularly successful in winning support in Congress." In addition to the $300,000 approved last Friday, Sherman secured $333,000 for the Winnetka clinic last March. Those funds were directed toward the purchase of an electronic medical records system to improve the accuracy, accessibility and quality of patient care. "El Proyecto del Barrio sees over 80,000 patents each year. Most of these patients do not have private health insurance. I am pleased I was able to persuade my colleagues in Congress to help expand the Winnetka Clinic," said Congressman Sherman.
07.27.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved $400,000 in federal appropriations funding for teacher training at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). The funding was included in the Labor – Health – Education Appropriations bill for the 2010 fiscal year. The legislation, which passed the House yesterday, requires Senate approval before being sent to the President for his signature. California State University, Northridge has become a leader nationally in developing new approaches in “clinical training” for teachers. If the legislation becomes law, the appropriated funds would be used to develop and implement a new clinical training model to prepare new teachers and other professionals for our schools. "We thank Congressman Sherman for focusing his work on our efforts at California State University, Northridge to break new educational ground. He has been a tireless supporter of our programs," said Cal State Northridge President Jolene Koester. “I will continue to work to promote progress in education, especially here in the San Fernando Valley,” said Congressman Sherman. “Rebuilding our economy isn’t just about making sure the jobs are here, it is about making sure we promote our children’s education and that they are being taught by well-trained teaching professionals.”
07.24.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved nearly one million dollars in federal appropriations funding for highway-rail grade crossing improvements and construction of a transit center in the San Fernando Valley. Specifically, the House approved $550,000 for the construction of the Bob Hope Airport Regional Transportation Center and $400,000 for the Metrolink Sealed Corridor Grade Crossing Improvements along the Los Angeles-Ventura Subdivision. The funding was included as part of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act for the fiscal year 2010, H.R. 3288. The legislation, which passed the House yesterday evening, requires approval by the U.S. Senate before being sent to the President for his signature. The Bob Hope Airport Regional Transportation Center, which would receive $550,000 per Sherman’s request, connects the Bob Hope Airport passenger terminals and the adjacent Amtrak/Metrolink Bob Hope Airport Train Station. The center will provide a hub for local and regional buses, as well as Amtrak bus service. Promoting the use of mass transit to access the airport has the correlative effects of reducing the impacts of traffic and air pollution. The Metrolink Sealed Corridor Grade Crossing Improvements project has identified twelve highway-rail crossings needing funding for safety improvements along Metrolink’s Ventura County Line in the west San Fernando Valley. This project, which received $400,000 in the House bill, will build grade crossing safety improvements including median barriers, gates at crossings, fencing at strategic points, and sidewalks, as well as other enhancements.
07.08.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that the House Appropriations Committee has approved a half million dollars in federal appropriations funding for a smart grid initiative in the City of Burbank. Last evening, the House Appropriations Committee considered the Energy and Water Appropriation bill, which includes this project. The legislation will next be considered by the full House of Representatives. The legislation also requires approval by the U.S. Senate before being sent to the White House for President Obama’s signature. If approved, the federal funds would help Burbank Water and Power’s program to develop an advanced “smart grid” that incorporates state-of-the-art systems and Wi-Fi technology. Burbank’s smart grid system would transition from existing infrastructure into a system that can better direct renewable energy resources -- the charging of plug-in hybrid cars, for example -- while making it more efficient and resilient to both natural events and malicious attacks. “Anyone who lived through California’s energy crisis knows that our energy infrastructure not only needs to be updated to meet increased demand but also to incorporate new technologies,” said Congressman Sherman. “It is important to develop new sustainable energy sources and technologies, and it is also important to have modern means and methods to distribute that energy.” Congressman Adam Schiff also supported this appropriation request.
06.19.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the House of Representatives approved nearly a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for community justice and drug prevention programs serving the San Fernando Valley. Specifically, the House approved $800,000 for the residential treatment center, Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace, $100,000 for the City of Los Angeles’ Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART) and $100,000 for Chabad of the Valley’s PRIDE program. The funding was included as part of HR 2847, the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Act for the 2010 fiscal year. The legislation, which passed the House yesterday evening, requires Senate approval before being sent to the President for his signature. “I will continue to work with my colleagues to approve federal funds for important Valley projects, especially programs that focus on making our communities more safe and secure,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. The largest appropriation is for Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace to strengthen family and mental health services for underserved youth in Los Angeles County. Phoenix Academy is the only facility in Los Angeles County that provides long-term residential treatment for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems. It provides vital services to youth and families struggling with substance abuse and mental health problems andrelated difficulties including educational deficits, conduct disorder, poor health, and victimization. If appropriated, this funding, which was also requested by Representatives Harman, Roybal-Allard, and Berman, would be used to enroll adolescents who would otherwise be unable to afford treatment in the Phoenix Academy. The new funds would add to the $250,000 Sherman secured for the organization’s Access to Treatment Initiative as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009. Also included in the legislation was $100,000 in federal funds for the City of Los Angeles’ Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART). Sherman was joined by Representative Watson (D-CA) in requesting these funds. The Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART) is a law enforcement-based domestic violence crisis response team that seeks to reduce the likelihood of future domestic violence incidents, injury, or escalation. The DART units collaborate with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and victim advocates when responding to reported incidents of domestic violence. Civilian advocates with specialized domestic violence expertise provide counseling, education, referrals to shelters, emergency assistance, and court accompaniment for domestic violence victims and their family members. Finally, $100,000 is included for Chabad of the Valley’s PRIDE program, which provides at-risk youth with drug and alcohol prevention and crisis intervention services. The PRIDE acronym refers to prevention, resource, information and drug education.
05.26.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) was joined by Councilmember Tony Cardenas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and representatives of the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks to mark the completion of the $5.2 million Bull Creek Channel Ecosystem Restoration Project located at the Anthony C. Beilenson Park in the Sepulveda Basin. “The Bull Creek project fulfills our promise of restoring wildlife and native habitat in the channel while providing park visitors better access to this unique recreational area in the San Fernando Valley. For years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks have worked to bring new life to this corner of the Sepulveda Basin, and continue to develop environmental and recreational projects to improve the environment and to provide places where children and families can play and enjoy nature,” said Congressman Sherman. Over the course of this project, Congressman Sherman has secured $2.5 million in federal funding toward the restoration of Bull Creek. The Bull Creek Channel Ecosystem Restoration Project features nearly 28 acres of aquatic, riparian and native upland habitat along the channel just south of Victory Boulevard. Pedestrian bridges provide public access to trails within the project area that connect to the Lake Balboa pedestrian path and offer opportunities to view wildlife in the channel. The Sepulveda Basin is a 2,097-acre federally owned flood control area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers currently leases nearly 1,600 acres to the City of Los Angeles for recreational purposes. The Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is comprised of Woodley Park, Beilenson Park, three golf courses, Hjelte Sports Field, tennis courts, Balboa Recreation Center, a dog park, cricket fields, the Japanese Garden Center and numerous playing fields and picnic areas.
05.21.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, reacted to the Obama Administration’s submission today of an agreement between the United States and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). “I believe that the United States missed an opportunity to leverage this agreement to convince the UAE to improve its export control regime and to reign in Iranian front companies that have used UAE territory to obtain sensitive technologies for Iran’s weapons programs. “While the UAE has made important strides in these areas, their export control law, passed in 2007, still is not fully implemented. We need maximum effort from this critical transshipment hub country; thus far, we don’t have it. “Congress will also need to use the 90-day review period to examine this agreement in light of its being held out as a “model” for future nuclear cooperation agreements. Given the increased interest in nuclear power we have seen globally, including by other countries in the Middle East, we need to ensure that this agreement does in fact represent the best we can achieve from a nonproliferation perspective. “On April 6, 2009, I wrote to the President along with key colleagues, expressing these concerns and laying out the provisions that should be in agreements for nuclear cooperation. We also outlined the policies that should guide U.S. nuclear cooperation in order to prevent the use of civilian nuclear technology in weapons programs. I will evaluate this proposed agreement in light of these provisions and principles. “Another important concern we need to examine is the employment benefits of this agreement and the expansion of nuclear exports generally. The UAE government has said it will accede to the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) once it makes the final decision to deploy nuclear reactors. It is critical that we have an iron clad commitment from the UAE to adopt this type of liability protection as soon as possible. Without such protection, no U.S. firm will be able to sell the UAE nuclear reactors due to concerns about being held liable for untold billions should there be a nuclear accident. The French and Russian competitors are state-owned firms that can claim sovereign immunity in the event of a catastrophe.”
05.21.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman asked Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to restore prior departmental policy and to override the decision made by the Bush Administration concerning anti-Semitism. On November 30, 2007, the Bush Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights, decided that Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VI) did not apply to acts of anti-Semitism, no matter how violent or blatant. The Bush Administration reasoned that since the Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of “race, color, or national origin”, it did not apply to discrimination against religious groups and hence did not apply to anti-Semitism. The 2007 Bush Administration ruling reversed prior administration policy. “I am writing to express my concern regarding anti-Semitic incidents aimed at Jewish students at several colleges and universities and the response to such incidents by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR). In particular, I am concerned about whether OCR is enforcing Title VI to protect Jewish students from anti-Semitic discrimination,” wrote Sherman. Sherman cited Shaare Tefila Congregation v. Cobb in which the U.S. Supreme Court held that Jews qualified as a “race” for purposes of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. He also pointed out that Jews are a national origin group, as virtually all Jews are descended from the inhabitants of the kingdom of Judea, which was obliterated by the Romans. That fact that many Jewish families have lived in the Diaspora for nearly 2,000 years does not obliterate their original origin. Sherman also cited Janko vs. Illinois State Toll Highway Authority which holds that the Roma people, often referred to as gypsies, are a national origin group because of common ethnic characteristics, and despite the fact that it is not proven that all those referred to as “gypsies” are descended from any particular nation-state. Sherman asked that the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education restore its prior policy as regarding anti-Semitic harassment and discrimination as falling under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.
05.20.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, voted to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive credit card practices by supporting the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights Act. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 361 to 64, and will now go to President Obama who is expected to sign it this week. As a cosponsor of this legislation for several years, Sherman has long championed the Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights Act, which will end the unfair and deceptive practices of the credit card industry and protect consumers from the abusive tactics that have driven and continue to drive so many Americans deeper and deeper into debt. Sherman said, “The people of the San Fernando Valley should not face excessive fees, or arbitrary interest rate hikes at any time and for any reason, or unfair, incomprehensible credit card agreements that are revised at will. This legislation will reign in these excesses and injustices.” The Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights will ban most retroactive interest rate hikes on existing balances (except when payments are more than 60 days late), double-cycle billing, and due date gimmicks. The bill protects cardholders against arbitrary interest rate increases, empowers them to set limits on their credit that the credit card companies cannot exceed without the customer’s consent, and requires the card companies to allocate payments to pay-off first the debt that bears the highest interest rate. It also prohibits charging fees just to pay a bill by phone, or charging over-the-limit fees unless a consumer opts-in in advance. It also prohibits issuing credit cards to minors, unless the minor has the ability to pay, or has parental consent. The legislation also gives Americans the information and protections they need to make better decisions about their financial lives. “I am particularly pleased that this bill includes language that I have long pushed for that will require the credit card companies to tell customers how long it will take them to pay off their credit card balance, and how much interest they will pay, if they make only the minimum monthly payment on their credit card account. This language will also tell customers how much they would need to pay each month in order to pay off their credit card balance in three years,” said Congressman Sherman. “Seeing this information will help consumers to see the benefits of paying-off credit card debt as quickly as they can, and to see the enormous costs of just making the minimum payment.”
05.19.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced bipartisan legislation along with Congressman Gary G. Miller (R-CA) to permanently increase the limits on the loans made in high cost areas that are purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (GSEs) or that are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D-MA), and 29other members are original cosponsors of this legislation. Established in 1934, the FHA provides mortgage insurance for prospective homebuyers. By purchasing mortgage loans from lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide lenders with the capital they need to make additional home loans. Both programs, however, are barred by law from insuring or purchasing loans above a certain size. “Passage of this legislation would make mortgage financing more affordable in the San Fernando Valley and in other high cost areas throughout the United States. Increasing the availability of such affordable mortgage financing is critical to helping to stabilize the housing market and to returning Fannie, Freddie and the FHA to relevance in California. It is critical to make the increased loan limits permanent so that affordable mortgage financing can remain available,” said Congressman Sherman. “While lower priced home sales have increased in recent months, sales in the higher priced ranges have not seen as much movement because of higher interest rates on jumbo loans,” said Congressman Miller. “Buyers in high cost areas, such as Southern California, are at an extreme disadvantage simply because of where they choose to work and live. In order for the overall economy to recover, every part of the housing market needs to improve, including high cost areas. By permanently increasing the GSE and FHA loan limits, Southern Californians will have access to conforming loans, which can be about 100 basis points lower than if financed through a jumbo loan, thereby making homeownership more attainable. It is imperative that Congress permanently increase the loans limits so that hardworking Americans across the country have equal access to safer, more affordable mortgage products.” Until the summer of 2008, the national single family conforming loan limit -- the size of the mortgage loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could buy -- was $417,000, even in high-cost areas and the FHA-insurable limit was $362,000, far too low to be of use to many home owners and prospective homebuyers in California and other high cost areas. Under the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, the loan limit for both the GSE and the FHA programs was temporarily increased through December 31, 2008 to a maximum of $729,750, depending on an area’s median home price. The Los Angeles Metropolitan area loan limits for 2008 were at the $729,750 ceiling. Legislation was passed in 2008 that permanently increased the GSE and FHA loan limits to a ceiling of $625,500 effective January 1, 2009. Then in the economic stimulus bill, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act that became law in February 2009, Congress restored the 2008 loan limits to the 2008 ceiling of $729,750 through December 31, 2009. Thus, without further action, the ceiling on the GSE and FHA loan limits will fall once again to $625,500 on January 1, 2010. “The temporary nature of these increases in the loan limits reduces the availability of affordable mortgage financing,” said Congressman Sherman. “The higher limits are not working as well as they should because the GSEs are reluctant to sell, and purchasers of mortgage-backed securities from the GSEs are reluctant to buy, loans that are conforming when issued, but which may not be conforming within a brief period. Allowing the current loan limits to fall would be disastrous to California.”
04.15.2009	Washington, D.C. - As taxpayers rushed to file last-minute returns by tonight’s midnight deadline, Congressman Brad Sherman is helping southern Californians uncover over $10,000,000 in old refunds and stimulus payments that are just waiting to be claimed by 13,050 Angelenos. Three potential claimants each stand to receive more than $250,000. Last year, the IRS could not locate thousands of taxpayers due refunds – refunds which remain undelivered. In Los Angeles County, those taxpayer refunds average more than $1,000. A list of Californians who overpaid federal taxes and are owed money is posted on the Congressman’s web page at BradSherman.house.gov. “Tax refunds belong in your pocket, not stowed in a cob-webbed corner of a dark safe at the IRS,” Sherman said at a press conference outside the IRS offices in the San Fernando Valley. “If there is any chance you have an unclaimed refund, check our website to see if you’re on the list.” In many instances, the IRS found mathematical errors in taxpayers’ favor, but then could not locate the people owed the unexpected windfalls. In other cases, refund checks were undeliverable because taxpayers moved without leaving a forwarding address after graduating from college or getting married or finding a new job. Nearly 9,000 Los Angeles residents did not receive their 2008 economic stimulus payments. Over $5 million in stimulus checks did not reach the intended Los Angeles resident with the average check totaling $608. This information is also listed at BradSherman.house.gov. Sherman has consistently supported legislation to help the IRS do a better job of tracking down taxpayers who are owed refunds. “Waiting for taxpayers to surface is not good enough. The IRS should do more to find people who are owed refunds,” Sherman said. “Certainly the IRS should take stronger steps than it does now to reach taxpayers who are owed money.” Sherman is a Certified Public Accountant. Before he was elected to Congress in 1996, Sherman was chairman of the California State Board of Equalization; the nation’s only elected tax commission and America’s second largest tax agency.
04.07.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), joined by Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) and Edward Markey (D-MA), sent a letter yesterday to President Obama calling for a review of international nuclear cooperation policy and requesting that he withhold a proposed nuclear cooperation agreement with the United Arab Emirates (U.A.E.) until that country makes greater progress in controlling the transshipment of sensitive technologies to Iran. The letter calls on the Obama Administration to conduct a thorough review of U.S. nuclear cooperation policy, and to consider the inclusion of several provisions in any future agreements submitted to Congress to strengthen nonproliferation policies. The U.A.E. agreement, which had originally been negotiated by the Bush Administration, has been held out as a “model” for future nuclear cooperation with foreign countries. “Due to concerns about greenhouse gases and last year’s high oil prices, we saw a significant increase across the globe in nuclear power, including among energy rich states,” said Sherman, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade. “It is critical that if we go forward with nuclear cooperation agreements, they have strong nonproliferation policies. If the U.A.E. agreement is the template, we need to ensure it’s the best agreement we can achieve.” The letter also calls on the U.A.E. to take stronger action to prevent the flow of dangerous shipments to Iran. U.A.E. is a noted transshipment and diversion point. “While the U.A.E has made significant strides, it still has not fully implemented an export control law enacted in 2007. We should leverage this agreement for greater progress by the U.A.E. on this critical concern for the U.S.” Sherman said. “Given the U.A.E.’s past history as the major transshipment point for goods destined for Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, serious concerns remain about its eligibility for a nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. We still have questions about the effectiveness of its export control system, elements of which have yet to be fully implemented,” said Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Ranking Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “There are pending issues concerning enforcement and safeguards to avoid diversion of sensitive materials and technology to problem recipients. Its nuclear regulatory structure is still not fully in place. The U.A.E.’s cooperation with the U.S. on combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation is a relatively recent development. Critical U.S. security interests are at stake. Moving in haste could jeopardize those vital interests. If the U.S.-U.A.E. agreement is to be the model for future nuclear cooperation agreements, we need to get it right the first time." “This past weekend, President Obama presented a sweeping new vision of a world free from the terror of nuclear weapons and a strategy which would dramatically improve the security of the United States and the world,” said Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-MA), the chairman of twin climate and energy panels in the House. “In his speech, the President said he would work to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation treaty so that any expansion of nuclear power across the globe is done ‘without increasing the risks of proliferation.’ Unfortunately, the nuclear cooperation agreement with the United Arab Emirates increases the risks of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East. The President should improve the nonproliferation elements of this deal to be a true gold standard, or he should not ask the Congress for its approval at all.” Under the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, nuclear cooperation agreements govern the exports of nuclear reactor equipment and technology, as well as nuclear fuel. Without one of these agreements in place, significant transfers of nuclear technology from the U.S. to a foreign country are impossible. A nuclear cooperation agreement must be submitted to Congress for a 90 day review period before it can go into effect.A copy of the above referenced letter is available here
04.03.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman is reminding San Fernando Valley residents and businesses that beginning on April 18, 2009 they will be required to dial the number one (1) and the area code prior to any phone number, even if dialing an 818 area code. Valley residents and businesses are encouraged to reprogram all mobile phones, fax machines, speed dialers, automatic dialing equipment, call forwarding settings, Internet dial-up numbers, alarm and security systems, voicemail services and related functions to address this change. In 2007, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator informed the California Public Utilities Commission (the Commission) that the supply of 818 prefixes available for assignment would run out in the third quarter of 2009, compelling the Commission to enact a plan for providing additional telephone numbers. At public hearings throughout the San Fernando Valley, the Commission received feedback from interested parties. The Commission debated implementing a geographic split, but decided against it due to strong opposition from businesses and community groups, as well as the costs and confusion associated with an area code split. The 747 overlay plan, which adds a new area code prefix to the same geographic region as the 818 area code, was approved in April 2008. All new telephone numbers after May 18th will receive the 747 area code. No one with an 818 area code will change to an 747 area code, but new customers will not have the option to choose an 818 area code. “Although the 818 area code is synonymous with the identity of the San Fernando Valley, we have nearly run out of usable phone numbers. Valley businesses and residents are being allowed to keep our existing area code, with new numbers receiving a new, overlapping area code. However, even when one is just calling someone down the street, the new dialing procedures must be used in order to complete the call,” said Congressman Sherman. “I encourage everyone to plan accordingly to minimize inconveniences associated with this change.” Sherman wrote to the Commission on October 12, 2007 in support of the 747 area code overlay as the preferred area code relief alternative. He noted that an area code overlay allows existing customers to keep their numbers while reducing costs to businesses who would otherwise have to change their letterhead, signage, and equipment if the CPUC implemented a 747 area code split in the San Fernando Valley.
04.02.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman followed-up on a brief conversation with President Obama on Monday evening and on a letter he sent Tuesday, sharing his concerns about a proposed communique to be issued by the G-20 nations and its impact on congressional discretion. Sherman expressed concerns that language in the leaked communique would be used to limit the ability of Congress to take action to stimulate the American economy, and could limit the ability of the U.S. to retaliate against the unfair trade practices of other countries, such as dumping. Sherman is also concerned that the G-20 will push for increased “trade finance” funding, which could lead to a situation where the American worker’s taxes could be used to fund imports into the United States to support the “global supply chain.” Sherman urged that the President avoid making commitments that would harm American workers or limit the ability of Congress to pass legislation protecting the health and safety of Americans, as these measures will be labeled as “protectionist” by some trading partners. In particular, Sherman voiced concern about any action taken at the G-20, which would limit the ability of the U.S. to assist its auto industry. Sherman is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. Sherman’s letter to President Obama is available here.
03.31.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman had a brief conversation with President Obama yesterday evening and urged the President to make sure Iran does not benefit from decisions made at the G-20 meeting. That meeting is expected to approve additional resources to the World Bank, IMF and related international financial institutions. In his conversation with President Obama, Sherman described how the World Bank was currently aiding Iran’s government. Today, Sherman sent a follow-up letter to the President in which he noted that the World Bank approved nearly $1.4 billion in nine separate loan packages to Tehran from 2000-2005, and that these funds are still being disbursed. Some $600 million of the funds approved for Iran remain undisbursed. It is critical that, as part of the overall effort to isolate Iran, the Obama Administration use the G-20 summit to obtain a commitment to halt World Bank disbursements to Iran and prevent new assistance by the World Bank, IMF or other institutions. “We cannot allow the G-20 package to become a lifeline to the world’s most dangerous regime,” Sherman said. “Given the World Bank’s record, we need to take a tough line at the G-20 – no cash is disbursed to Iran – or we cannot join in efforts to reform or bolster the World Bank and its sister institutions.” Sherman noted that, as a strong supporter of foreign aid, the provision of assistance to Iran would make it impossible to support elements of the G-20 package which need approval in Congress. Sherman is the Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade. A copy of Sherman's letter to the President is attached.
03.30.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today introduced legislation to impose a 70% surtax on all excess compensation over $1,000,000 per year paid to executives of all the big bailed-out firms. Sherman’s legislation applies to all financial institutions which receive over $500 million under the TARP program. It also covers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were bailed out under a program adopted last summer. “My bill deals with all compensation, whether it is called a salary, bonus, retention payment, commission, employee of the week prize, or whatever,” Sherman said. “Some will argue that a $1,000,000 per annum cap on executive compensation is too low. For this reason, I allow the Treasury to permit bailed-out firms to give executives restricted stock.” Restricted stock cannot be sold unless and until all the bailout money has been returned to the Treasury. If the company goes bankrupt before fully repaying the Treasury, then such restricted stock will be permanently worthless. The bill makes it plain that no executive will be taxed in any way on any compensation returned to the employer. Sherman’s legislation also exempts commissions for non-executive salespersons. Sherman noted the differences between his bill and H.R. 1586 which passed the House of Representatives on Thursday, March 19th. The bill previously passed does not affect the ability of bailed-out financial institutions to paymillion-dollar-a-month salaries to executives. A bailed-out bank which might otherwise pay an outrageous bonus is still free to raise an executive’s salary to $2 million a month. That legislation only covers bonus payments made since January 1, 2009, and would not reach the millions in huge bonus payments made by Merrill Lynch and other banks in 2008. Original cosponsors include Representatives Marcy Kaptur, Bob Filner, Dennis Kucinich, and Peter DeFazio.
03.25.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today received the Humane Champion Award from the Humane Society of the United States. Sherman was given the award for his leadership efforts on an animal welfare issue and for his perfect score on the Humane Society’s 2008 Legislative Scorecard. The Humane Society was particularly appreciative of Sherman’s introduction of the Computer-Assisted Remote Hunting Act (H.R. 2711) during the last session of Congress. The legislation was strongly supported by the Humane Society. The inhumane practice of Internet hunting, also called remote-controlled hunting, occurs when a customer uses a computer and the Internet to aim and fire a weapon that is mounted on a mechanized tripod at a remote location, usually a game ranch where the hunted animals are penned. The Computer-Assisted Remote Hunting Act proposed a federal prohibition on Internet hunting and penalties for those who violate the prohibition. Congressman Sherman remains committed to ensuring the humane treatment of animals. The Humane Society boasts 24,672 supporters in Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley district and more than 11 million nationwide.
03.19.2009	Washington, D.C. - The tax bill coming before the House of Representatives today is a step in the right direction. It imposes a 90% tax on bonuses paid to executives of the big bailed-out financial institutions. While the bill focuses on bonuses, it does not affect million-dollar-a-month salaries. In fact, a bailed-out bank which might otherwise pay an outrageous bonus, is free to raise an executive’s salary to $2 million a month. Not a penny of that $2 million a month would be taxed or restricted by this bill. The bill also allows unlimited commissions, without defining the word commissions. If Wall Street firms can rename their “bonuses” and call them “commissions,” they may escape the bill entirely. The bill applies to those financial institutions that have received over $5 billion in return for their preferred stock. The Treasury is now planning to spend hundreds of billions of dollars buying toxic assets from financial institutions. A financial institution’s executives are not affected by the bill merely because the institution sells tens of billions of dollars of toxic assets to the Treasury. I will be introducing a bill either Friday or Monday which imposes a substantial tax on all excess compensation (over $500,000) paid to executives of all the big bailed-out firms. It will deal with salaries, bonuses, retention payments, commissions, employee-of-the-week prizes, and all other manners of compensation.
03.12.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the California Emergency Management Agency (CalEMA) approved $1,633,700 in public assistance funding to the City of Los Angeles to remove debris from Oakridge Mobile Home Park in Sylmar. Some 75% of the funds are from FEMA and are disbursed pursuant to the federal major disaster declaration issued on November 18, 2008 by the President at the request of Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and Congressman Sherman. In February, FEMA approved a plan by the City of Los Angeles to begin the exhaustive cleanup of Oakridge Mobile Home Park. Oakridge residents were forced to flee their homes on Friday, November 14, 2008 as the flames spawned by the Sayre Fire swept through the bucolic mobile home park at the northeast end of Glenoaks Boulevard in Sylmar. “For over three months, Oakridge residents whose homes were saved from the fire and those who lost their homes have waited for the chance to return and rebuild. With this agreement, federal, state and local officials are taking the initiative to help cover the costs of debris removal and allow residents an opportunity to start a new life in their quaint community,” said Congressman Sherman. The Sayre Fire destroyed 476 mobile homes at Oakridge; 124 were damaged or remain intact, but residents are not permitted to occupy their homes until all the debris is safely removed from the property. The President’s major disaster declaration prompted FEMA to release federal funds to help communities and cities recover from the November wildfires. Sherman pressed state and federal officials to declare a disaster for both the October and November wildfires, which devastated communities across the northern part of the San Fernando Valley. Since December, federal, state and local officials, including Congressman Sherman’s office, have met on many occasions to formulate a plan that would allow residents to return to the property in Sylmar. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health declared a “Public Health Hazard” due to the environmental and health impacts associated with fire ash and debris at the Oakridge Mobile Home Park. This action was necessary in order for FEMA to direct Public Assistance resources toward debris removal at the private property in Sylmar. The City of Los Angeles will serve as the local public sponsor and work with state officials to draw down federal funds to pay for the costs of debris removal services. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and City Councilmember Richard Alarcón were instrumental in helping to craft the final agreement. “When the last flame was out and the smoke cleared, the City of Los Angeles pledged to help the residents of Oakridge rebuild from the devastation left behind,” said Mayor Villaraigosa. “Removing the fire debris will not only begin the process of rebuilding, but will eliminate the constant threat lingering in the ashes and loose debris threatening to once again endanger the well being of the surrounding community” FEMA will reimburse 75% of the total cost of debris removal, while the State of California and the City of Los Angeles assume the 25% local sponsor match. Of the $1,633,700 in eligible costs, FEMA will pay $1,225,275, California will pay $306,319, and the City will bear the remaining $102,106. Officials estimate the cleanup will take up to 60 days. Debris removal at the site should be completed by the end of April. State and county agencies will re-inspect the site to determine if it is safe before transferring the site back to the property owner and residents.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Federal spending legislation passed by Congress today includes $2 million for U.S.–Israel energy cooperation. This funding represents the first appropriation for a program originally sponsored by Congressman Brad Sherman as the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act. The funds will go to a grant program that will provide assistance to cooperative efforts by Israeli and U.S. government agencies, businesses, and academic institutions to develop technologies that will utilize alternative energy sources and increase energy efficiency. These funds were included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2009, a bill that will fund much of the federal government’s non-defense spending for fiscal year 2009. Israeli officials have committed to contribute additional funds for this project. “This is an important step in our efforts to cooperate with a partner that has a proven record of innovation in the field of energy research,” Sherman said. “Israel should be viewed, not as a place of tsuris, rather, as a place where hope, energy, and ideas are generated. I look forward to working with the Obama Administration on ramping up this program in future budgets, including the fiscal year 2010 budget expected a few weeks from now.” “Israel and the United States already have a long track record of successful, cooperative research in medicine, biotech, and agriculture,” Sherman added. “It’s time we work together to tackle the great challenges of our time --- energy security and job creation.” Congressman Sherman first introduced the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Act in 2004, along with Congressman John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Eliot Engel (D-NY). Congress ultimately enacted the legislation as Section 917 of a larger energy reform bill, the Energy Independence and Security Act, in December 2007. In a June 2008 address to the America Israel Public Affairs Committee, then candidate Barack Obama praised Sherman’s legislation and pledged to increase U.S. cooperative efforts with Israel: “It is time for the United States to take real steps to end our addiction to oil, and we can join Israel, building on last year’s U.S.-Israeli Energy Cooperation Act to deepen our partnership in developing alternative sources of energy. We should work with Israel, increasing scientific collaboration and joint research and development.” The Consolidated Appropriations Act was approved today by the Senate and will be signed by President Obama within days.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress today approved over half a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for juvenile justice related programs serving the San Fernando Valley. The funding was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009 which will be signed by the President soon. The funds Sherman secured are for three specific projects: Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace, New Directions for Youth in Van Nuys, and the Court Appointed Special Advocates program serving the San Fernando Valley. Phoenix Academy’s Access to Treatment Initiative - $250,000 Phoenix Academy of Lakeview Terrace is the only facility in Los Angeles County that provides long-term residential treatment for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems. It also provides vital services to youth and families struggling with substance abuse and mental health problems. This funding will be used to increase the number of adolescents who are able to receive treatment – treatment these adolescents would otherwise be unable to afford – and to provide additional outreach services to the community. Sherman was joined by Rep. Jane Harman in requesting money for this project. “Thanks to Congressman Sherman, Phoenix Academy is able to help hundreds of Los Angeles’ most needy youth and their families each year,” said Elizabeth Stanley-Salazar, managing director of Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace. “Phoenix Academy is dedicated to helping troubled teens get their lives back on track and Congressman Sherman’s support will give us the opportunity to help even more teens.” Phoenix Academy is part of a network of 29 drug-treatment facilities throughout California and others across the country. The academy’s one-year residential substance abuse treatment program is followed by a year of aftercare for adolescents with drug, alcohol, and behavioral issues. The substance-abuse treatment is combined with a course of academic study coordinated with the resident’s home school and directed by experienced, state-licensed teachers. New Directions for Youth, Gang and Delinquency Prevention Program - $150,000 New Directions for Youth seeks to provide comprehensive and individualized programs that assist at-risk youth to become productive, self-sufficient, healthy young adults and that create supportive, safe family environments. The primary goal of the Gang and Delinquency Prevention Program is to prevent youth involvement in gangs among 13-18 year olds in the San Fernando Valley, specifically targeting a number of local high schools. “We’re excited and appreciative for all of Congressman Sherman’s work,” said Executive Director of New Directions for Youth, Monica Austin-Jackson. “Our program helps stitch together some of the more tattered sections of the fabric of our community. The Congressman has been and continues to be a friend to New Directions for Youth and we applaud his dedication to Valley families.” Court Appointed Special Advocates of Los Angeles County - $110,000 This funding will provide the Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) of Los Angeles County program with the resources required to recruit, train and supervise community volunteers to advocate for abused and neglected San Fernando Valley children in the foster care system. CASA volunteers maintain regular visits with the children they serve, getting to know the child as an individual, not just a case. “These funds reflect Congressman Sherman’s appreciation for children in our community and for their need to have a compassionate and considerate court system. We are thankful that the Congressman went to bat for our program,” said CASA of Los Angeles County Executive Director David Melendez.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress has approved $85,000 in federal appropriations funding for Los Angeles Pierce College in Woodland Hills. The funding is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to President Obama for his signature. The $85,000 in federal funds that Congressman Sherman secured for Pierce College will aid in the acquisition of new meteorological equipment for their on-campusweather station. "We are delighted that Congressman Sherman succeeded in obtaining these funds," said Pierce College President Robert Garber. “We appreciate Congressman Sherman’s advocacy for our school. Our Weather Station will see tremendous improvements thanks to this congressional appropriation.” The Pierce College Weather Station enables students, community members, and the news media to compare recent weather indicators with those extending back to 1949. Upgrades to the Pierce College Weather Station will enhance its data collection and reporting usefulness to multiple audiences, including the National Weather Service, local, national, and international weather reporters and researchers, Pierce College Meteorology and Geography students, and K-12 science students, not to mention the general community in the college’s service area.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress approved $621,000 in federal appropriations funding for ecological studies in the San Fernando Valley. The $618,000 in federal funding was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today, and is heading to the White House for President Obama’s signature. “The Army Corps of Engineers’ studies are the first step toward revitalizing and restoring the Sun Valley Watershed and the Los Angeles River,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am thankful that my colleagues share my concern for the Valley’s watersheds and waterways.” The Los Angeles River Revitalization Study, which was awarded $478,000, will build upon an existing study by the Army Corps of Engineers. This study will explore alternatives for ecosystem restoration in and along the river and incorporate input from the City of Los Angeles’ Master Plan for the Los Angeles River. The Sun Valley Watershed Feasibility Study will receive $143,000. The Sun Valley Watershed is a 2,800 acre (4.4 square mile) urban watershed tributary to the Los Angeles River, located approximately 14 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. The urban Sun Valley community suffers from a lack of both recreational opportunities and wildlife habitat. The community has also experienced severe, chronic flooding for over 40 years. These federal funds will be used by the Army Corps of Engineers to study whether it is feasible to pursue environmental restoration, water quality improvement, and flood mitigation projects, among others, in the Sun Valley Watershed. The Los Angeles County Flood Control District, represented by the County of Los Angeles Department of Public Works, will work with others to provide the required local match for the development of this study. Congressman Howard Berman also supported this request.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress has approved $570,000 in federal appropriations funding for two programs at California State University, Northridge (CSUN) – one to train teaching professionals in new techniques and the other to introduce children to the performing arts. The funding is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to President Obama for his signature. "These funds are critical to our efforts at California State University, Northridge to break new educational ground and provide rich educational opportunities that reflect and incorporate the diversity of our surrounding community. We thank Congressman Sherman for his dedicated service to the Valley and to our mission," said Cal State Northridge President Jolene Koester. CSUN has become a leader nationally in developing new approaches in teaching teachers. The TLC (Teaching, Learning, Counseling) Model will receive $285,000 for a one-year demonstration project to develop and implement a new clinical training model to assist new teachers. This program promotes a “transdisciplinary” model, combining teaching, learning and counseling. The TLC model is expected to prepare better teachers and school counselors to work collaboratively and support the needs of those children who are at risk of being left behind. The K-12 Arts Education Program also received funding, in the amount of $285,000. These funds will be used to provide live performance experiences and performing arts instructional programs in dance, symphony, popular music, theatre, and opera, for promising students enrolled in Title I public and charter schools in the San Fernando Valley. The program will be administered by California State University, Northridge, under the joint auspices of staff assigned to its new Center for the Performing Arts, the College of Education, and the College of Arts Media and Communication. “These funds demonstrate the Congress’s continued commitment to ensuring that the next generation of Valley school children have opportunities to learn and grow,” said Congressman Sherman. “Our communities need more and better qualified teachers, and they benefit from a curriculum that exposes students to creative and artistic expression.”
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress approved nearly a half million dollars in federal appropriations funding for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Zero Emissions Bus Project. The $475,000 in strategically targeted federal investments that Sherman secured is included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today, and now heads to the White House for President Obama’s signature. The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (Metro) will receive $475,000 in federal funds to demonstrate the latest zero emission technologies in heavily urbanized operating environments such as the San Fernando Valley. This funding will be used to help demonstrate the commercial and operational viability of current generation fuel cell-powered buses. The Zero Emissions Bus Project will be the first zero emission demonstration project in the Los Angeles basin. “We are very pleased that Congressman Sherman successfully secured funding for Metro’s zero emission bus project,” remarked Metro Chief Executive Officer Roger Snoble. “Metro transit services currently reduce air pollution in Los Angeles County by over 1,100 metric tons each day. With the funding made available through Congressman Sherman’s efforts, we look forward to further enhancing our clean air fleet,” Snoble added. “Given the drastic effects of climate change, we have a responsibility to act quickly to reduce harmful emissions of greenhouse gases,” said Congressman Sherman. “I am glad that the Congress is recognizing the need to employ environmentally-friendly technologies as part of our efforts to improve mass transit systems.”
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that Congress today approved $333,000 in federal appropriations funding for El Proyecto del Barrio, a San Fernando Valley non-profit organization which operates a health clinic and provides free services to those who qualify. In 2007, El Proyecto del Barrio’s health clinic saw close to 80,000 patients in the San Fernando Valley. The funds El Proyecto del Barrio will receive will be used to purchase an electronic medical records system. This new system will improve the accuracy, accessibility and quality of patient care. The funding was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which passed the Senate today and now heads to the White House for President Obama’s signature. The President and Chief Executive Officer of El Proyecto del Barrio, Corinne Sanchez, said, “It is hard to find words to highlight the importance of good organization and record management to the quality of the services we provide. In addition to providing accurate medical case histories, moving to an electronic management system should free up staff time that can be directed to providing services to the community. On behalf of the tens of thousands of patients who are served by our clinic, we thank Congressman Sherman.” This project was also supported by Congressman Howard Berman and then-Congresswoman Hilda Solis, who is now the Secretary of the Department of Labor in the Obama Administration.
03.10.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that the Congress has approved nearly a quarter of a million dollars in federal appropriations funding for the Northridge Hospital Foundation Family Justice Center in the San Fernando Valley. The $237,500 in funding was included as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2009, which was approved by the Senate today. The legislation now heads to President Obama for his signature. These funds will be used to redesign the Northridge Hospital Foundation Family Justice Center to serve the victims of sexual assault, bring social, legal and medical service professionals together under one roof, and streamline a victim’s search for help and justice. "We are very appreciative to Congressman Brad Sherman for his support in securing federal funds to assist in the development of the San Fernando Valley Family Justice Center. This Center has been a dream of Northridge Hospital for the past four years and by enabling public and private agencies to co-locate into one facility, we can more effectively serve victims of sexual and domestic abuse," said Michael Wall, President and CEO of Northridge Hospital Medical Center. Congressman Sherman said, “I applaud the Northridge Hospital Foundation’s Family Justice Center for seeking to minimize the obstacles that assault victims must confront as they cope with trauma.”
03.05.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-27) today issued the following statement on the decision of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to issue a warrant to arrest Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir, President of Sudan, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. “As the conflict over Darfur continues, the cost of the conflict is being paid in human lives. Acts of genocide have claimed at least 300,000 innocent lives, and displaced as many as 2.7 million people. “After a careful examination of the evidence, the International Criminal Court (ICC) decided today to issue a warrant for the arrest of Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. With this warrant, the ICC has sent a strong message, not only to the perpetrators of genocide, but also to their many innocent—and often nameless—victims. “The ICC warrant to arrest Sudanese President Al Bashir is only the first step, however. The United States must now work with the international community to ensure that the Government of Sudan fully complies with this arrest warrant. But what is far more important than bringing Bashir to justice is stopping the genocide.”
03.02.2009	Washington, D.C. - Last Friday, Congressman Brad Sherman and a group of colleagues sent a letter to Energy Secretary Steven Chu, requesting that he have the Department review a January, 2009 contract awarded to the energy firm Vitol to provide oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Vitol pled guilty to grand larceny in New York state court in November, 2007 in connection with the Oil-for-Food program. Past criminal activity can be grounds for barring a firm from receiving federal contracting, an act known as “debarment.” Sherman’s letter calls on the Energy Department to determine whether Vitol should be barred from future contracting with the federal government, and whether the current contract should be terminated. Specifically, Vitol pled guilty to paying kickbacks of $13 million to the Iraqi government, then under U.N. sanctions, effectively stealing from the United Nations and the Iraqi people. “This contract, which was awarded by the previous Administration, should be reviewed to ensure that Vitol’s criminal activity was made known to Energy Department officials and adequately reviewed during the contracting process,” Sherman said. “If Vitol withheld information about this Oil-for-Food guilty plea, the Energy Department should probably debar the firm and possibly cancel existing contracts.” “Paying kickbacks to Saddam’s Iraq goes beyond mere corruption – it is sanctions-busting activity in violation of U.S. and international law. It requires that the U.S. government seriously consider whether we should be doing business with this firm.” Sherman’s letter also notes that Vitol is a major supplier of refined petroleum to Iran. Tehran, although oil-rich, must purchase as much as half of its refined petroleum from abroad. The letter was cosigned by Howard Berman (D-CA), Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL), Robert Andrews (D-NJ), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Edward Royce (R-CA), and Robert Wexler (D-FL). Sherman and others believe that firms which provide this vital fuel should be discouraged from doing so until the ongoing efforts to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program are successful.Read the full text of Congressman Brad Sherman's letter.
02.11.2009	Washington, D.C. - During a House Financial Services Committee today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) questioned the chief executive officers of eight major banks who received taxpayer bailout funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and was given three very interesting sets of answers. Concerning the issue of luxury corporate jets, which many American taxpayers view as emblematic of Wall Street corporate arrogance, seven out of the eight CEOs testified that their firms will continue to own or lease private planes. The sole exception was Goldman Sachs. “Will you institute a policy to not pay your shareholders dividends until you have repaid taxpayer funds?” Sherman asked. Less than half of the witnesses expressed the intent to follow such a policy. Most testified that their firms would continue to pay dividends to common shareholders, rather than use available capital to repay the federal government. The exceptions were Bank of America, Citigroup, and State Street Corporation. “The taxpayers have been undercompensated to the tune of $78 billion dollars, but these companies are unwilling to provide the taxpayers with fair value for the cash that they received,” said Sherman, pointing to a now famous chart on page 27 of the Congressional Oversight Panel’s February 6th report (copy attached), showing the panel’s finding that the federal government was shortchanged by $78 billion, 31% of the amount invested. The report indicates that of the $254 billion initially invested by the Treasury, the Treasury received only $176 billion worth of preferred stock and warrants from the Wall Street firms. At the time the TARP funds were initially granted, both the Treasury and the companies receiving the funds announced that the taxpayers would receive securities (preferred stock and warrants) worth the full amount that the taxpayers were providing. It is now clear that taxpayers received $78 billion less in securities than we should have. Nonetheless, all eight CEO’s testified that they would not issue additional preferred stock or warrants to the Treasury to make up for the $78 billion shortfall. The eight CEOs testifying were Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs & Co., James Dimon of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Robert P. Kelly of Bank of New York Mellon, Ken Lewis of Bank of America, Ronald E. Logue of State Street Corporation, John J. Mack of Morgan Stanley, Vikram Pandit of Citigroup, and John Stumpf of Wells Fargo & Co.
02.05.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Wednesday that he has nominated the following outstanding Valley students for admission to the nation’s elite military service academies. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, CO Christian Beckler (Burbank), Anthony Ethington (Porter Ranch), Kyle Kilroy (Granada Hills), Edward Lixandru (North Hollywood), Saul Rios (Sylmar), Jonathan Samonas (Burbank), Cheyanne Tran (Winnetka) Naval Academy at Annapolis, MD Alika Bautista (Van Nuys), Christian Beckler (Burbank), Anthony Cox (North Hills), Anthony Kratz (Northridge), Jonathyn Lomeli (North Hills), Jeffery Valine (Northridge) U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY Christian Beckler (Burbank), Albert Choi (Chatsworth), Kyle Kilroy (Granada Hills), Anthony Kratz (Northridge) “I am so proud of these young men and women and very grateful for their willingness to serve our country at this critical time,” Sherman said. The military academies are ranked among the best educational institutions in the country. In addition to a rigorous academic curriculum, a military academy education offers cadets extensive hands-on training and an opportunity to participate in varsity and intramural sports, music groups, and clubs. Cadets also must live under a strict personal and ethical code to develop the discipline necessary to become leaders in today's military. Applicants who apply to multiple academies may receive nominations to attend two or three different academies. The service academies decide which of the Congressman’s nominees to admit, but each academy generally is required to admit at least one of Sherman’s nominees. Due to the high quality of applicants from the Valley, each academy usually admits two or three.
02.04.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), the most senior member on the House Financial Services Committee to vote against the TARP legislation, issued the following statement after President Barack Obama called for companies receiving the TARP funds to abide by reasonable limits on executive compensation. “The President responded to the anger of the American people, demanding that executives at companies receiving TARP funds are limited to $500,000 in total annual compensation until the funds are repaid to the Federal Government. The $500,000 limit is even tougher than I initially proposed. Unfortunately, there are three giant loopholes in the Administration’s proposal. “First, the terms do not apply to firms like Citigroup or AIG who have already received TARP funds, unless they receive even more. Both Citigroup and AIG have both received over $45 billion, and they face no limits on executive compensation if they choose to retain what they have received without seeking more. Section 111 of the TARP legislation requires the Treasury Department to issue regulations providing ‘appropriate standards’ for executive compensation applicable to all firms that have received TARP funds. I urge the administration to follow the law and define ‘appropriate standards’ for all firms who are holding TARP funds. “Second, most of the firms who received TARP funds in the future are allowed to pay any amount in executive compensation or bonuses. They are only required to allow their shareholders to vote on a non-binding resolution on executive compensation and can pay unlimited compensation no matter how the shareholders vote. Under the Administration’s proposal, only a few firms receiving extraordinary assistance will be subject to the $500,000 limit. “Third, the proposal has no effective limits on luxury perks. The Administration’s proposal simply requires boards of directors to adopt policies on such luxury items as private jets and lavish parties. These are the same boards who have approved these abusive policies in the past, and who are very likely to do so again in the future. “I look forward to working with the new Administration so that the executive compensation limits proposed by the Treasury Department fully carry out the expressed intent of President Obama.”
01.30.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a telephone town hall yesterday evening, fielding questions from a number of the thousands of constituents who participated from the comfort of their own homes. A “Telephone Town Hall” operates like a large-scale conference call where constituents can hear from Congressman Sherman and ask him questions about major federal issues, including terrorism, health care, and the condition of the economy. Roughly 5,000 Valley residents participated in the 90 minute forum for varying periods of time. “Thanks to the new technology, thousands more of my constituents are able to engage their congressman than would otherwise attend a town hall meeting. We had a good discussion about a variety of issues that are important to the daily lives of Valley residents – issues that the federal government is seeking to address,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. During Congressman Sherman’s Telephone Town Hall, Sherman elicited the input of his constituents by asking a series of survey questions about pressing issues. The results of the survey questions are as follows: Which of the following is the most important priority for federal funding? Federal aid to public schools -- 13% Providing pharmaceutical benefits to seniors -- 11% Environmental protection -- 8% Tax cuts for middle-class families -- 36% Transportation -- 6% Paying off the national debt -- 12% Providing for our national defense and homeland security -- 15% For the last 20 years or more, the United States has followed a policy of so-call free trade, negotiating trade pacts with Mexico, China, Central American and other countries. Do you believe: These agreements have had a strong positive effect on the economy of the United States and have provided good jobs for thousands of Americans. -- 8% The trade agreements have been a mixed bag; negotiating free trade pacts should not be a high priority-- 34% Free trade agreements have been a disaster for America, driving up our trade deficit and sending thousands of good jobs overseas. -- 58% Which of the following statements best fits your views on noise generated at Van Nuys and Burbank Airports? Strong measures to control airport noise should be adopted. -- 36% The existing measures to restrict hours of operation and aircraft types are sufficient.-- 21% I do not have strong views regarding these airports. -- 42% In fighting the War on Terrorism, the federal government has taken steps to prevent another major terrorist attack on American soil that have curtailed civil liberties. Do you believe that: The measures taken by the government have generally been necessary and appropriate to protect Americans from terrorism. -- 31% The measures have protected the United States, but more must be done to ensure that the government does not impede the rights of Americans. -- 34% The war on terrorism has greatly reduced American civil liberties and has not had a significant impact on the safety of Americans. -- 35% Which of the following organizations do you most strongly support? Brady Campaign to Stop Gun Violence -- 10% AFL-CIO -- 6% United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) or Burbank Teachers Assn. -- 9% American Legion or Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) -- 14% Humane Society -- 9% American Civil Liberties Union(ACLU) -- 9% Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare -- 37% The Sierra Club -- 7% Which statement best fits your views on gun control? I strongly believe we need tough new controls on guns. -- 50% Let's just enforce the gun laws we have. -- 28% Let's repeal some existing gun laws. -- 15% I don't have strong views on gun control. -- 7% Which statement best fits your views on abortion? I strongly believe abortion should be legal for all women. -- 58% There should be some limits on abortion. -- 30% Abortion should be illegal, except to save the life of the mother. -- 11% I don't have strong views on abortion. -- 1% Which statement best fits your views on the Middle East conflict? We should strongly supportIsrael. -- 50% We should support Palestinians at least as much as we support Israel. -- 28% We should just stay out of the conflict. -- 18% I don't have strong views on our Middle East policy. -- 4%
01.27.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the National Park Service has been awarded $2.6 million to construct a visitor center at King Gillette Ranch, in the heart of the Santa Monica Mountains. The new visitor center will offer educational and recreational resources about the Santa Monica Mountains, provide access to miles of hiking trails in one of the most breathtaking areas within the park, and establish a permanent home for federal, state and local park agencies engaged in the preservation and conservation of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. "This funding helps fulfill a 30-year vision of the National Park Service, Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and California State Parks to offer a world-class visitor center capable of orienting visitors to the beautiful parks and beaches found in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,” said Woody Smeck, Superintendent of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. "Over 35 million visitors recreate in the parks annually, and we look forward to serving them with information that will enhance their enjoyment and safety." “Public officials, environmentalists, and local residents have long fought to acquire King Gillette Ranch and help to preserve this 588-acre oasis in the Santa Monica Mountains,” said Congressman Sherman. “With this commitment of funds, we can establish a visitor center at King Gillette Ranch and provide educational resources to the millions of visitors to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.” King Gillette Ranch, formerly Soka University, was acquired by federal, state, local, and nonprofit park agencies in April 2005. Congressman Sherman secured $2.85 million for the acquisition of the property. Sherman’s predecessor, Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson, introduced legislation in 1978 to establish the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and helped secure millions in federal funds to preserve critical open space. The Anthony C. Beilenson Visitor Center will relocate to King Gillette Ranch from the National Park Service headquarters in Thousand Oaks. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area – a unit of the National Park Service – is the world’s largest urban national park. It is located in the second largest urban area in the United States, spanning 46 miles across Los Angeles from Point Mugu in the west to Griffith Park in the east. Since his election to Congress in 1996, Congressman Sherman has secured $20 million in federal funds for land acquisition and trail construction, including the 65-mile Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
01.27.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced today that the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank will be awarded $7 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation to help insulate nearby homes from airport noise. "This grant demonstrates the commitment of the federal government to reduce or eliminate the impact of aircraft noise on the communities that surround Bob Hope Airport,” said Dan Feger, Executive Director of Bob Hope Airport. “This investment will go a long way in improving the quality of life for nearby residents and greatly diminish the impact of jet noise over the neighborhoods surrounding the Bob Hope Airport,” said Congressman Sherman. The $7 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, combined with local funds, will enable the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to protect an additional 207 homes and reduce the impact of air traffic on the local community. To date, nearly 1,500 homes have been insulated from the noise of aircraft passing overhead. Measures to soundproof homes include replacing doors and windows, insulating attics, and improving weather stripping, and ventilation. The new grant brings the total amount of federal support for noise mitigation awarded to the Bob Hope Airport to $83.6 million. The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has added $20.6 million in matching funds, and has committed another $3.1 million to pay for noise-abatement work not covered by federal grants. For more information about Bob Hope Airport’s Sound Insulation Program or to report a noise complaint, residents should contact the airport at (818) 840-8840.
01.26.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-27) applauded President Barack Obama’s decision to direct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reconsider the Bush Administration’s past rejection of California’s request for a waiver to adopt stricter automobile greenhouse gas emissions standards than those required by national rules – a move that is consistent with legislation Sherman proposed during this and the previous Congress. “By allowing California to institute stricter regulations of greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles, President Obama is living up to campaign promises and acting with the best interest of the planet,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “This decision truly represents the kind of change from the recent past that Californians need. We need to seek greater, not lesser, emission standards if we hope to stem the tide of global warming and to keep our air clean.” Last year, with record high fuel prices and the overwhelming scientific evidence of global warming, Sherman and his colleagues introduced the Right to Clean Vehicles Act to immediately grant California’s Clean Air Act waiver request, which Bush’s EPA denied, and give an additional twelve states the authority to implement tailpipe emission standards. Senator Barbara Boxer (CA) introduced similar legislation in the U.S. Senate. “The purpose of the Right to Clean Vehicles Act was to grant California’s waiver request so that California and other states could impose stronger vehicle mileage standards. It appears that the Obama Administration will now grant the waiver that the Bush Administration denied, thus effectuating the purpose of my bill,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. The EPA denied California’s waiver request on December 19, 2007 after considering it since 2005. A number of other states are impacted by the decision, including, but not limited to Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The Governors of Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Utah have also committed to the standards. According to the Washington Post, granting a waiver for California to regulate tailpipe emissions would affect nearly half the U.S. auto market.
01.17.2009	Washington, D.C. - Today, on the 15th anniversary of the Northridge Earthquake, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) is reminding residents of the San Fernando Valley and metropolitan Los Angeles how they can prepare for a future seismic event. Fifteen years ago, dozens of lives were lost and thousands were injured by one of the largest earthquakes in our nation’s history. The Northridge Earthquake was also one of the most costly federal disasters, with damages in excess of $20 billion. It was the 11th largest earthquake recorded in California since 1769, measuring higher on the “Richter Scale” than any other North American earthquake in an urban area. “The images of the collapsed apartments, freeways, bridges and buildings should remind us to prepare ourselves and our families for when Los Angeles is struck again by a major earthquake,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “It is imperative that we take the steps necessary to protect ourselves and our families should another major disaster occur, whether it is an earthquake, a fire, or another natural disaster.” Sherman encourages all residents to prepare themselves by taking the following steps before, during, and after an earthquake: Before an earthquake: (1) Check for hazards in the home, (2) identify safe places indoors and outdoors, (3) educate yourself and family members, (4) have disaster supplies on hand, (5) develop an emergency communication plan, and (6) help your community get ready by talking to your neighbors or participating in your neighborhood council. During an earthquake: Take cover indoors in a safe place such as under a sturdy table or within a doorway. If outdoors, stay in a safe open area away from buildings, streetlights and utility wires. After an earthquake: Expect aftershocks, listen to a battery-operated radio or television for emergency information, use the telephone for emergency calls only, stay away from damaged areas; inspect your home for damages, and inspect gas lines and electrical systems, as well as sewage and water lines. For more information about Earthquake Preparedness, visit the following websites: www.fema.gov, https://www.usgs.gov, www.oes.ca.gov, or www.lacity.org/emd. Congressman Sherman’s San Fernando Valley constituents may contact him directly with questions or additional concerns at (818) 501-9200. HISTORY OF NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE On January 17, 1994, at approximately 4:30 a.m., the San Fernando Valley and much of Southern California awoke to a massive earthquake that shook the nerves of residents for one minute followed by hundreds of unnerving aftershocks. When the shaking stopped, the 6.7 magnitude earthquake damaged 114,000 residential and commercial structures spread over 2,100 square miles. The Northridge Earthquake killed over 60 persons, injured nearly 12,000, left thousands temporarily homeless, and significantly impaired Los Angeles’ infrastructure network. President Bill Clinton reacted quickly, deploying personnel and resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake to assist public agencies in the recovery effort. President Clinton declared a federal disaster within hours of the earthquake, enabling individuals to apply for federal disaster assistance. Nearly 700,000 Southern California residents registered for federal assistance through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA disbursed $7.8 billion in Individual, Public and Mitigation Assistance program funds. In all, the Federal government expended $13.2 billion toward the recovery.
01.09.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-27) today issued the following statement regarding a congressional resolution, H. Res. 34, which recognizes Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Gaza, reaffirms the United States' strong support for Israel, and supports the Israeli-Palestinian peace process: “Hamas claims to be beleaguered, but it has rejected the United Nations Security Council cease-fire resolution passed last night. Hamas has done everything it can to increase civilian casualties, including the use of human shields. Yet even U.N. estimates say that over two-thirds of the Palestinian casualties have been gun-toting militants, and other estimates put that number at over three-quarters. “When Hamas launches rockets from a neighborhood, an Israeli sergeant has seconds to decide whether to return fire, and there’s always a pundit to vilify that decision. But moral culpability for civilian casualties does not lie at the feet of sergeants. Moral culpability for the horrors of war lies with politicians who seek extreme and unjust ends, through violent means. “While Israel seeks to live in peace alongside a Palestinian state, Hamas seeks to kill or expel every Jew from the Middle East. Hamas proudly waves the banner of genocide and ethnic cleansing.” The measure passed.
01.07.2009	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-27) today issued the following statement in response to a report in India’s Business Standard newspaper (attached) that Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) has decided to stop selling refined petroleum to Iran after fulfilling its current contractual obligations: “It appears that RIL has made a decision to cease selling gasoline to Iran. This is a welcome development. It is clear that if we are to convince Iran to abandon its nuclear program, we will need a manifold increase in the economic and diplomatic pressure on Tehran. “Refined petroleum products are an Achilles heel for Iran, which must import nearly half of its gasoline. RIL has provided as much as 30 percent of Iran’s petroleum imports “My colleagues and I will continue to monitor this critical issue. By temporarily forgoing business opportunities with Iran, our trading partners can play a critical role in deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.” Sherman, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, led a bi-partisan group of House members in writing to the U.S. Export-Import Bank last month, requesting that the bank suspend loan guarantees promised to RIL for expansion of its Jamnagar facility until RIL commits to stop selling Iran refined petroleum.
01.06.2009	Washington, D.C. - These days, a modern depression seems almost within the realm of possibility. To avert this, we need an enormous, immediate stimulus. But unless it's well designed, it may not pass Congress; it may not achieve its objectives; or worse, it may sow the seeds of a disastrous decline in the dollar's value. That's why the stimulus should be tough, temporary, and reversible. Federal dollars should be extended to private interests only on the toughest terms. Taxpayers should demand the highest yield, the largest equity upside, and the strictest limits on executive compensation and perks. Being tough on those we bail out offers three important advantages. First, it increases public support, which we'll need to enact huge stimulus expenditures. The public is currently focused on executive compensation and perks, but it will need to focus soon on the value of the securities the Treasury is receiving, including warrants – stock options that would allow taxpayers to cash in on a rebounding company's success. Second, by being tough on those obtaining bailouts, we can limit the number of companies seeking a bailout. If executives see the federal government as a source of easy, cheap money, why wouldn't they – and every other company – attempt to get a bailout? The government does not have that kind of money. Third, getting a good deal on our investments will minimize the eventual increase in the federal debt, and the burden it poses to succeeding generations. Many of those companies receiving bailout funds will still go bankrupt, so we must generate profits on those that do not. We need to look at both the rate of return on the preferred stock, and the value of the warrants. It can be done productively: When Warren Buffett invested in Goldman Sachs, he got twice the rate of return and six times the warrants as taxpayers received for a similar investment in the firm. Meanwhile, Keynesian economics offers a simple, two-part prescription for the difficult times ahead: easy money now, and fiscal and monetary austerity when the economy improves. The biggest reason not to provide the first half of this prescription is that the metaphorical patient will be unwilling to swallow the second half. How, in good conscience, can I vote for massive economic stimulus now, if I believe that we will not be able to adopt fiscal restraint later? We in Congress love handing out money, whether it be in tax cuts, tax rebates, tax holidays, tax fiestas, benefit expansions, subsidies, bailouts, infrastructure projects, aid to states, aid to cities, or aid to individuals. Can we count on future Congresses to discontinue and then reverse expansionary fiscal policies? If we adopt the fiscal stimulus practices the economy needs now, then both our tendencies toward profligacy and legislative inertia will cause us to leave the financial spigot on too long – perhaps permanently. Some members of Congress familiar with the process, and fearful of the result, may oppose opening the spigot at all. What's likely to happen is that fiscal hawks will prevent us from getting the full measure of economic stimulus we need now, and that advocates of tax cuts and free spending will prevent us from turning off the spigot later. Thus, we could get inadequate stimulus in 2009, and continue that stimulus long after it is necessary, and even until it is harmful. To avoid this, the stimulus package should be both temporary and self-reversing. The same statutes that provide a massive stimulus should also provide that particular tax increases and expenditure cuts go into effect in 2013, automatically. The statute could provide an automatic, temporary delay in these austerity measures if we fail to achieve 3 percent economic growth in 2012. Sure, we should fine-tune the program later. But we need to give the upper hand to those who will advocate fiscal responsibility four years from now. If austerity in 2013 is mandated by statute, advocates of fiscal responsibility will have a fighting chance when budgets are negotiated early next decade. Only if the economic stimulus proposal is tough, temporary, and self-reversing can we be confident that Congress will adopt a proposal that is big enough and fast enough. Only if the stimulus measures are temporary and self-reversing can we also make sure that the actions we take today do not eventually lead to inflation, higher interest rates, a declining dollar, and an enormous increase in federal debt. • Brad Sherman is a Democratic congressman from California, a certified public accountant, and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee.
12.22.2008	SHERMAN OAKS, CA – At the request of Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), the U.S. Census Bureau has prepared the San Fernando Valley Census Report. The updated Valley Census Report offers a more current demographic snapshot of the San Fernando Valley to help community organizations, businesses, and government leaders make better-informed decisions affecting the Valley’s future. The report’s data will also help the region secure its fair share of funding for highway and transit improvements, housing, and social service programs. “We rely on the Valley Census Report to fight for the Valley’s fair share of funding in Sacramento and Washington, DC. The report reveals important information about the Valley’s rich cultural diversity, educated workforce and entrepreneurial spirit, as well as the challenges facing many Valley families and homeowners during these tough economic times,” said Congressman Sherman. The Census Bureau prepared the updated Valley Census Report at the request of Congressman Sherman using detailed data from the 2007 American Community Survey. The first report was released in December 2006, also at Sherman’s request. The Valley Census Report reveals that, compared to the average American, Valley residents make more money, spend more of it on housing, and endure longer commutes to work. The more than 1.76 million people who live in the Valley exceed the populations of all but the four largest cities in the United States – New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. The Valley’s population has increased over 4% since the 2000 Census. The Valley Census Report shows that Valley residents spend, on average, nearly a half hour (28.7 minutes) commuting to work, which is 5% longer than the average Californian and 12% longer than the average American. The report discloses that the Valley, on average, is more educated than other parts of the City and County with 112,000 people with graduate or professional degrees and another 248,000 with bachelor degrees. Since 2000, the Valley has had a 61,000 increase (20.4%) in those with bachelors or advanced degrees. In 2007, the median home price in the Valley ($633,900) was higher than the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County or California, and was more than triple the U.S. median home price ($194,300). These figures from a year ago stand in stark contrast to the current Valley housing market. The CSUN San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center reported last month that the median Valley home price fell to $405,000. Also in 2007, nearly 40 % of Valley homeowners (115,300) were spending 35% or more of their income on housing. Overall, the median monthly mortgage and homeowner’s costs have increased 8% ($2,381 to $2,572) from 2000 to 2007. The report also shows that poverty remains a significant economic barrier for many Valley families (10.6% or over 62,000 households with incomes below $15,000), justifying the Valley’s requests for housing funds and economic development and social service programs. Bob Scott, Director of the Mulholland Institute and past chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association (VICA) explained the importance of this data in better understanding the issues impacting the Valley housing market. “It is a real challenge to cover mortgage costs if you purchased or refinanced at the recent market peak. It is extremely useful to see how the San Fernando Valley region is faring compared to other urban areas – to assess any instability, and to understand what we need to do to steady our local economy. We have to understand and be prepared to deal with market realities”, said Scott. “As the economic development and business assistance program serving the San Fernando Valley, having access to Census data for this region is absolutely critical to the work we do” said Bruce Ackerman, President and CEO of the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley. “It allows us to tell the story about what is happening to our businesses, and to anticipate the types of services and programs they may need based on economic trends and patterns.” The San Fernando Valley also shines as a haven for innovators and entrepreneurs,” added Dr. Daniel Blake, Director of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center at California State University, Northridge. According to Dr. Blake, the San Fernando Valley census data reveals that 13.2% of the Valley’s workers are self-employed in their own unincorporated business. This compares favorably to 8.9% for California, and 6.7% for the U.S. “These comparisons suggest that the Valley is very hospitable to the innovative and entrepreneurial among us,” said Blake. In April 2007, the U.S. Census Bureau announced that it was considering the elimination of some of the Census County Division (CCD) designations. In response, Congressman Sherman and many Valley-area elected officials and organizations called upon the Census Bureau to continue providing specific census data for the San Fernando Valley. In February 2008, Congressman Sherman announced that the Census Bureau will continue reporting and publishing census data specifically for the San Fernando Valley after 2010.

12.19.2008	Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA), known for questioning auto CEOs on their arrival in Washington on luxury jet aircraft, stated: “We need to save the U.S. auto industry, and a formal bankruptcy reorganization is not the way to go. Given that Republican Senators blocked Congressional action, the Administration’s plan is far better than inaction. However, the plan gives the taxpayers too few warrants, and may allow executives to receive multi-million dollar compensation packages. Warrants are the device to share in the upside if the companies prosper in the future. The Congressional proposal provided taxpayers with warrants worth a minimum of 20% of the cash to be invested. I thought 20% was far too little given the risks taxpayers were being asked to take, particularly with regard to GM and Chrysler. At the November 19th hearing, I asked GM CEO Rick Wagoner whether taxpayers deserved far more warrants and suggested taxpayers deserved up to five times the 20% level. Wagoner responded: ‘… we respect that the government should get fair compensation and are very willing to discuss the kind of terms that you laid out.’ Yet the Bush administration settled for warrants worth only 20% of the amount we are investing. This is a generous Christmas gift to the shareholders and executives of the big three. The deal seems to contain no effective limits on the total compensation of each executive. It allows multi-million dollar salaries to continue and seems to impose no limits on stock options. Stock options are warrants given to executives, and could be worth tens of millions if the companies recover. While the deal prevents the big three from owning or leasing corporate jets, it allows them to charter luxury jets for executive travel. One of the companies told me explicitly that their CEO will never fly commercial.”
12.18.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman and a bipartisan group of House colleagues sent the attached letter to the president of the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) yesterday afternoon, calling on the Bank to suspend assistance for Reliance Industries Limited (Reliance) until it agrees to stop selling gasoline to Iran. The letter also calls on Ex-Im to do a better job in the future to ensure that the projects it supports are not in conflict with U.S. national interests. Ex-Im has approved two separate loan guarantees worth $900 million, including a $400 million package in August, 2008. Reliance has been a major supplier of refined petroleum products for Iran; according to some reports, Reliance has at times provided as much as 30 percent of Iran’s need for imported petroleum. Ex-Im’s assistance was approved to help finance the expansion of Reliance’s refining complex at Jamnagar, the very facility that provides Iran with gasoline. “I very much support the Export-Import Bank’s mission of supporting U.S. exports. However, we must ensure that when we provide assistance, the corporate recipients are not doing business with our enemies,” said Congressman Brad Sherman. “Iran is an energy rich country, but Tehran lacks the refining capacity to provide itself enough gasoline,” Sherman said. “Iran imports about 40 percent of its gasoline. We could greatly increase our leverage against Tehran in the dispute over its nuclear program by encouraging those supplying them with gasoline to halt their trade with Iran.” “We cannot miss opportunities like this one, where we can greatly increase our leverage over a major trading partner with Iran,” Sherman added. Sherman’s letter follows another letter sent by Senators Lieberman and Kyl in early November. The Lieberman-Kyl letter raised similar concerns about Ex-Im projects. Ex-Im’s response to that letter failed to address the critical shortcomings in the approval process for these loans. Sherman and his House colleagues are calling on Ex-Im to conduct a more robust investigation of the companies it assists, and to do a better job coordinating with the State Department and other foreign policy agencies to ensure that the assistance provided is in accord with our vital national security concerns.
11.24.2008	Washington, D.C. - "Taxpayers are to invest $20 billion and to assume $249 billion in risk on Citigroup’s $306 billion portfolio of toxic assets. For this, taxpayers receive preferred stock with a face value of $27 billion (worth well less than $20 billion) and $2.7 billion worth of warrants. Taxpayers are taking an enormous risk for a small share of the possible upside. Paulson should have gotten ten times the warrants. The agreement is a much better deal for Citigroup management and shareholders than it is for the taxpayers. The American people are potentially on the hook for as much as $269 billion if the assets in the Citigroup portfolio prove to be worthless. They should have the opportunity to participate in much more of Citigroup’s upside if Citigroup returns to health. The agreement does not require any changes in Citigroup’s management or board of directors. It allows payment of a dividend to shareholders of $.01 per share per quarter, currently an amount equal to about $54 million per quarter. While Citigroup must submit an executive compensation plan, including bonuses, to the Federal Government for its review and approval, there is nothing in the agreement that requires Citigroup to stop paying million-dollar-a-month pay packages to its executives. I hope that President-elect Obama will take a fresh look at these issues and direct Treasury Secretary Designate Geithner to renegotiate this agreement when the new Administration takes office." # # # On the $306 billion portfolio, Citigroup takes the risk on the first $29 billion. On the remaining $277 billion, taxpayers take 90% of the risk - $249 billion.
11.18.2008	Washington, D.C. - {Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the President declared a major federal disaster for California as a result of the wildfires burning since November 13th. The federal disaster declaration covers the Sayre Fire in Sylmar, and victims can begin to apply for direct Federal assistance and grants through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies. The declaration also included the Tea fire in Santa Barbara and the Freeway Complex fires in and near Orange County. "The San Fernando Valley wildfires, which occurred in October and November throughout my district, have burned over 30,000 acres and destroyed or damaged over 750 structures, including nearly 500 homes in the Oakridge Mobile Home Park in Sylmar. The federal disaster declaration will help victims of the Sayre fire rebuild their homes and lives," said Congressman Sherman. FEMA Individual Assistance includes aid to eligible individuals and households in the form of temporary housing, grants for the repair or replacement of damaged or destroyed homes, disaster unemployment assistance, legal services, crisis counseling and other direct assistance. The U.S. Small Business Administration will also make available low-interest loans to help individuals and families cover the gap between the cost of rebuilding and the amount of insurance settlements. In order to apply for FEMA assistance, fire victims should call 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or go online to https://www.fema.gov/apply-assistance. FEMA will also establish a Disaster Recovery Center (DRC) in the fire areas where applicants can go for information about FEMA or other disaster assistance programs, or for questions related to a disaster claim. Fire victims in the San Fernando Valley should contact Congressman Sherman's District Office at (818) 501-9200 if they need assistance in applying for FEMA aid or obtaining lost or damaged federal records. "I believe the Valley's October fires – the Marek and Sesnon fires – should be included in the federal disaster declaration. The October Fires, the Sayre fires and the Santa Barbara and Orange County fires all share the same cause – the autumn Santa Ana winds. Those who suffered in the October fires deserve the same Federal disaster assistance as those affected in November by the Sayre, Tea and Freeway fires," said Congressman Sherman. "Unfortunately, unless the Marek and Sesnon fires are included in the federal disaster declaration, victims of those fires will be eligible only for limited SBA loans – but won't get FEMA grants. That is why I have been working since Saturday to persuade Governor Schwarzenegger to include the Marek and Sesnon fires in the federal disaster declaration," added Congressman Sherman.
10.30.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has made available low-interest disaster loans for homeowners, property owners, renters, and businesses impacted by the wildfires that ravaged the north San Fernando Valley beginning October 12th. The SBA is making these low-interest loans available to help individuals and families cover the gap between the cost of rebuilding and the amount of insurance settlements. "Federal assistance is available now to help those directly impacted by the tragic fires in the north San Fernando Valley. With this assistance, Valley residents can rebuild their homes and lives from the ashes of one of the worst fires in our area in recent memory," said Congressman Sherman. Disaster loans up to $200,000 are available to homeowners to repair or replace damaged or destroyed real estate. Homeowners and renters are eligible for up to $40,000 to repair or replace damaged or destroyed personal property. Businesses may borrow up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged or destroyed property. SBA representatives will be on-hand at two locations in the San Fernando Valley to issue loan applications, answer questions about the disaster loan program, and help individuals complete loan applications. The SBA Disaster Loan Outreach Centers will be open at the following locations on the indicated dates and times: Disaster Loan Outreach Center - Marek Fire Dexter Park Community Center 11053 N. Trail Road, Kagel Canyon (at Kagel Canyon Rd & Dexter – follow signs) Wednesdays, Thursdays & Fridays 9:00 a.m. – 6:00 p.m. Center closes Thursday, November 13 Disaster Loan Outreach Center - Sesnon Fire L.A. County Dept. of Public Social Services 21415 Plummer Street, Chatsworth (Plummer St. & Canoga Ave.) Mondays & Tuesdays, 8:00 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. Center closes Monday, November 10 Fire victims can also apply for disaster loans by calling the SBA toll-free at (800) 659-2955 or online at https://disasterloan.sba.gov/. The deadline for filing disaster loan applications is December 29, 2008. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides grants, rather than loans, to victims of federally declared national disasters. The San Fernando Valley fires have not been declared by the President to be a national disaster, and accordingly, FEMA programs are not available to San Fernando Valley fire victims. The President cannot declare a national disaster unless requested to do so by the governor of the impacted state. Congressman Sherman wrote to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, and subsequently spoke with him during a tour of the fire damaged areas in Chatsworth, urging the state of California to request federal disaster assistance through a Presidential Declaration. The Governor is considering Congressman Sherman's request.
10.10.2008	Washington, D.C. - On Thursday, October 2nd, I stated on the floor of the House of Representatives that, “The only way they can pass this bill is by creating and sustaining a panic atmosphere. That atmosphere is not justified. Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday, that the sky would fall, the market would drop two or three thousand points the first day and a couple of thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no. That’s what I call fear mongering, unjustified, proven wrong.”There has been significant speculation in the blogosphere and other places regarding this statement.Speaking during the second House debate on the bailout bill, I was describing what I regarded as the increasingly unbelievable things that had been said while the House considered the bailout package – extreme things put forward as reasons why Congress had to pass that bill right away. I urged my colleagues not to take the extreme statements seriously and urged them to defeat the bill. It should be clear from the context of my speech that I did not believe that martial law would be declared under any circumstances and I did not think that such absurd and outlandish comments should cause members to vote for the bill.I also want to stress that I have no reason to think that any of the leaders in Congress who were involved in negotiating with the Bush Administration regarding the bailout bill ever mentioned the possibility of martial law—again, that was just an example of extreme and deliberately hyperbolic comments being passed around by members not directly involved in the negotiations.
10.08.2008	Washington, D.C. - I opposed the $700 Billion Bailout Bill not because I did not think that we needed to take major action quickly, but rather because I thought it was a poor use of $700 billion of the federal government’s assets. Since the Bailout Bill was passed the Dow has dropped over 1000 points. The bailout was sold in part as a way to stabilize the stock market. By the standards of the Bush Administration itself, the bailout bill seems to have been irrelevant or even counterproductive. Under the bailout bill only two things are certain: Wall Street firms and executives will benefit, and our children will be stuck with an enormous debt. In fact when the Bailout Bill actually failed on September 29th Bush claimed the bill’s opponents were responsible for the decline in the Dow that followed. That decline was small and temporary compared to the decline that followed the bill’s passage. Now it appears that Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board are looking at other more productive approaches. Today, Secretary Paulson is talking about investing in preferred stock of commercial banks, the same approach that the United Kingdom is taking. Paulson is also talking about unlimited insurance for depository institutions, which is the approach being taken by the Republic of Ireland and perhaps other European countries. The actions now being discussed are consistent with the advice given to our Skeptics Caucus by William Isaac, former chair of the FDIC. I am glad to see that the Bush Administration appointees are talking about moving in a completely different direction than that suggested initially by Secretary Paulson, whose original 3 page proposal involved only the purchase of toxic mortgage-related assets by the Treasury. Only Democratic efforts to amend the Bush proposal lead to the inclusion of provisions allowing some of the $700 billion to go towards the purchase preferred stock. The chief obstacle to pursuing these better alternatives may be that as much as $700 billion in federal assets might be committed to the wrong approach, namely the purchase of toxic assets by the Treasury Department. The bailout bill and preexisting statues give enormous and unfettered power to the Bush Administration; we can only hope that they use it wisely, which means departing from the plans that they had in September.
10.03.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congress approved the $700 billion Wall Street Bailout Bill. Under the Bill, hundreds of billions of dollars will be used to buy toxic assets currently in safes in London, Shanghai, and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Bailed out Wall Street firms will use their bail out money to pay million dollars a month salaries, and to even increase them to two million dollars a month. (For details, see paper at BradSherman.house.gov.) Our economy will not do well in the months to come, and dropping $700 billion on Wall Street is not going to make things much better. But now Wall Street will use the same fear mongering tactics which were used to pass the Bill, in order to justify the bill. In order to pass the Bill, Wall Street declared that unless they received $700 billion in unmarked bills, the Dow would drop by 4,000 points and blood would flow in the streets. The passage of the Bill will have little positive economic effect, and the fall and winter will be bad times for our economy. But in the coming weeks, Wall Street will justify the Bill by saying that we averted those very same calamities they had predicted during their successful effort to create panic, and pass the Bill. The worst abuses of the Bill can be minimized if Congress, and especially the press, begins an unprecedented level of ferocious oversight: We have to make sure that Paulson spends the money and the orderly rate of less than $50 billion month (as he has promised), not at a frantic pace that spends it all by January 20th, 2009. We have to make sure that Paulson treats all financial entities fairly, whether they be firms he likes, or firms he doesn’t like. (It will take incredible investigative journalism to see whether the executives of any bailed-out firms are making secret contributions to Section 527 organizations, which are responsible for a big chunk of today’s political advertising). When a firm receives a billion dollars in bail-out cash, we must report on which of its executives are receiving that cash in the form of salaries in excess of $1 million a year. (The bill allows unlimited salaries to be paid by bailed-out firms, and does not contain a provision preventing the bail-out cash from being used to pay those salaries.) Each time a U.S.-headquartered entity sells billions of toxic assets to the Treasury, we must ask whether that U.S. entity is just acting as an intermediary. We must ask whether those toxic assets were in foreign safes on September 20th, 2008. We must be aware of the China two-step (described in a paper at BradSherman.house.gov), in which a foreign investor who made bad business decisions can sell toxic assets to a U.S. entity on Monday, and Paulson can buy those toxic assets with taxpayer dollars on Tuesday. No one will ever be able to prove that the Bailout Bill helped or hurt our economy during the coming fall and winter. Only two things are certain: the bill will provide hundreds of billions of dollars to investors who made bad decisions and Wall Street executives; and our children and grandchildren will now face a national debt that is hundreds of billions of dollars higher.
09.17.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced today that he is co-sponsoring H.R. 6355, the Air Service Improvement Act of 2008. This legislation is designed to address air passenger rights and aviation consumer protection and was introduced by Congressmen James Oberstar (D-MN) and Jerry Costello (D-IL).If passed into law, the legislation will require airlines and large- and medium-hub airports to file emergency contingency plans. The plans will require air carriers to detail how they will provide food, water, restroom facilities, airplane cabin ventilation, and medical treatment for passengers onboard an airplane that is on the ground for an extended period of time without access to a terminal. Airports will have to detail how facilities and gates will be shared. Airlines will be required to update these emergency plans every three years, while airports will have to update their plans every five. The Secretary of Transportation will review and approve each plan. Once approved, if airlines do not comply with the plans, the air carriers will be subject to a penalty of $25,000 per day of non-compliance. The bill also directs the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to establish and advertise a consumer complaints hotline number as well as collect and publish data pertaining to cancelled and diverted airline flights.
09.16.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, the House of Representatives is considering the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act(H.R. 6899) which includes legislative language authored by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) to promote the use of plug-in electric vehicles, both plug-in hybrids and pure electric.Congressman Sherman’s amendment states that for any newly-constructed residential buildings to qualify as meeting “green” building standards, such structures will need to have appropriate electrical outlets with the capacity to recharge an electric passenger vehicle in the garage or carport. Today, many residences do not have outlets with the capability to charge an electric vehicle where that vehicle would normally be parked.“We need to promote alternate energy sources for the vehicles we drive. If ‘green’ vehicles are to flourish on our roadways, we need to have the proper residential infrastructure in place so that drivers can recharge their vehicles at home,” Sherman said. “This legislation will help create the required infrastructure to support expanded use of electric vehicles.”Once passed, the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act willgo to the Senate for its consideration.
08.06.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced today that he has introduced the Export Control Improvements Act, H.R. 6828. As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, Congressman Sherman has held a number of hearings on the need to keep dangerous technologies out of the hands of our enemies. This new legislation will improve national security by targeting the trade routes that proliferators exploit. The Export Control Improvements Act will mandate the improved tracking of shipments of potentially dangerous materials, including weapons and nuclear materials. The bill is cosponsored by Congressman Adam Smith (D-WA) and Congressman Donald Manzullo (R-IL). “We must do more to close down the routes used by proliferators to transfer sensitive and dangerous technologies into irresponsible hands,” said Sherman. “In this legislation, we require better tracking of these exports to ensure that they are not being funneled through front companies.” The bill will permanently reauthorize the law enforcement authority of the Department of Commerce, which is charged with going after those who illegally sell technologies that can be easily exploited, like the explosive devices being used against our troops in Iraq. The bill requires the administration to work more closely with two countries of concern in the resale of such technologies: Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates. Congressman Sherman’s bill will also require a temporary suspension and review of the Validated End User Program, which has eliminated the license review for the export of some sensitive technologies to China. “We require greater scrutiny in countries, known to be a transfer hub for these illicit activities, and the legislation requires a thorough review of yet another controversial program initiated by the Bush administration,” added Sherman.
08.05.2008	Washington, D.C. - At the request of Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks), the U.S. Census Bureau agreed to issue a new San Fernando Valley Report. The Report, to be released in November 2008, will offer a more current demographic snapshot of the San Fernando Valley using 2007 American Community Survey data. The new report will continue to help local community organizations, businesses, and government leaders make better informed decisions. “I want to thank the Census Bureau for agreeing to provide a new report on the Valley. Having this specific data helps us fight for the Valley’s fair share of funding from Sacramento and Washington, DC, and offers revealing information about the Valley’s rich cultural diversity, as well as the challenges facing many Valley families and homeowners,” said Sherman. The Census Bureau prepared its second San Fernando Valley Report in April of 2008. Findings from the Valley Report were highlighted in the San Fernando Valley Economic Report presented by the Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley and California State University, Northridge on May 8 in Universal City. In February 2008, Congressman Sherman announced that the Census Bureau will continue reporting and publishing census data specifically for the Valley after 2010 – nearly a year after the Census Bureau announced that it was considering the elimination of the San Fernando Valley census designation. Last year, Sherman rallied local elected officials, community and business organizations, and ordinary citizens to call upon the Census Bureau to continue providing specific census data for the Valley. The first-ever report on the San Fernando Valley was released in December 2006.
08.04.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) announced today that he has introduced the Enable Divestment from Sudan and Iran Act. This bill seeks to increase the economic isolation of Sudan and Iran by facilitating divestment from companies doing particular types of business with either government. The bill has ten bipartisan co-sponsors including several members of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and the top Republican on the Foreign Affairs Committee. “We all support employing non-lethal means to convince regimes such as Sudan and Iran to change their policies,” said Sherman. “Economic and diplomatic pressure can work – South Africa and Libya are prime examples of states that radically shifted policies as a result of economic sanctions, and particularly in the case of South Africa, divestiture campaigns,” added Sherman. Iran continues to defy the U.N. Security Council by enriching uranium, the key technology it needs to develop the capability to manufacture nuclear weapons. The bill would facilitate divestment from companies that have a $20 million or larger investment in Iran’s energy sector, that sell arms to Tehran, or that loan $20 million or more to the government of Iran. Divestiture is also a key element in a strategy to increase the pressure on Sudan until it ends its genocidal activities in Darfur.” This legislation would target companies aiding Sudan’s government, while exempting companies investing in regions the Sudanese government does not control. “In order to change the policies of the worst regimes, we have to change the policies of multilateral corporations,” Sherman said. “Divestment is a key element in our strategy to use economic pressure – until Iran gives up its pursuit of nuclear weapons and Sudan curtails its support for genocide. Under this legislation, taxpayers will be allowed to defer the recognition of any gain on the sale of securities issued by companies which conduct certain business in Iran or Sudan, so long as they purchase similar securities issued by companies without such ties. The taxpayer will pay capital gains tax in full when the replacement property is sold. “We need to pressure multinational corporations to change their behavior, if we are going to change the behavior of the regimes in Iran and Sudan,” said Sherman. “Encouraging investors to join the divestiture program will attract the attention of multinational corporations. Divestiture should be encouraged – not taxed.”
08.01.2008	Washington, D.C. - On Thursday, the House Financial Services Committee passed the Green Act (H.R. 6078) including Congressman Brad Sherman’s (CA-27) amendment to the Green Act to promote the use of plug-in electric vehicles, both plug-in hybrids and pure electrical. The Green Act is designed to encourage energy efficiency in buildings. Congressman Sherman’s amendment states that for any newly-constructed residential buildings to qualify as meeting “green” standards, such structures would need to have appropriate electrical outlets to recharge a vehicle in the garage or carport. Today most garages have an electrical outlet, but carports normally do not. “If ‘green’ vehicles are to flourish on our roadways, we need to have the proper infrastructure in place where drivers can recharge them. My amendment would help to create the required infrastructure to support expanded use of electrical vehicles.”
07.30.2008	Washington, D.C. - Yesterday, the Muslim Public Affairs Council demonstrated at Congressman Brad Sherman’s district office in an effort to derail the hearings [See press release of July 30]. Two other groups have criticized Sherman. The first of these organizations is the Council of American-Islamic Relations, whose current executive director has stated, “I am [in] support of the Hamas movement.” It was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the 2007 Justice Department case against those alleged to have been raising money for Hamas in the U.S. The second group is the Islamic Society on North America which sought to derail Sherman’s hearings Thursday. This group was also listed as an unindicted co-conspirator by the Justice Department in the case alleging efforts to raise money for Hamas. Further, a recently declassified FBI memo on NAIT, the parent organization of the Islamic Society of North America, states as follows: “Within the organizational structure of the NAIT are those… who have declared war on the US… with the common goal being to further the Holy War (Islamic jihad).”
07.30.2008	Washington, D.C. - Sherman Oaks, CA – On Tuesday, the Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) demonstrated in front of the Office of Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation. The demonstrators demanded the cancellation of a subcommittee hearing on whether American foreign aid is going to organizations affiliated with terrorists. “This hearing will go on. We need to make sure that the State Department is not giving U.S. tax dollars to those on the other side in the war on terrorism,” said Sherman. “I know there are many in our community so desperate for peace that they want us to sweep under the rug the pro-terrorism positions of some groups. There are groups in the Islamic world truly dedicated to peace, but we should not blind ourselves to the fact that some are not.” The day of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, MPAC executive Salam Al-Marayati created a furor when he stated on a Los Angeles radio program, “If we are going to look at suspects, we should look at groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents, and I think we should put the State of Israel on the suspect list…”[1] Two brothers have played a critical role in leading MPAC. Maher Hathout is a senior adviser and one of the founders of MPAC, while his brother Hassan Hathout served as MPAC’s president. In the “about the authors” section of his book, Hassan Hathout is described as “a close disciple of the late Hassan Al-Banna of Egypt,”[2] the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood. Maher Hathout has praised Hassan Al-Turabi as a reformist working for peace and justice for all.[3] Hassan Al-Turabi was head of the Sudan National Islamic Front (NIF) which the U.S. government condemned for supporting terrorism, and for launching a genocidal war in southern Sudan. Al-Turabi has been described as the “power behind the throne” in Sudan during the 1990s, as leader of the NIF and as Speaker of the National Assembly.[4] Turabi gave Osama Bin Laden sanctuary in Sudan.[5] Maher Hathout has also asserted that “Hezbollah is fighting for freedom” and that the organization is “very American”.[6] In fact, Hezbollah is listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization. “The Muslim Public Affairs Council should apologize for the statements of its executive director on September 11, 2001, and should disown and sever all connection with the Hathout brothers,” said Sherman.

07.23.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Sherman voted for a package of housing and tax bills that will provide crucial relief from foreclosure to many San Fernando Valley homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgage loans. The package will also help to stabilize the housing finance market and the economy. He made the following statement: “This bill is a compromise, and we are not getting everything that the House wanted. For example, I hope that next year we will revisit permanently increasing the loan limits in high cost areas to the $729,750 level currently in effect for 2008, rather than the $625,500 ceiling in this bill. Nonetheless, this bill is a tremendous achievement. If it becomes law, we will help literally hundreds of thousands of families who are facing foreclosure to keep their homes. “By helping qualified borrowers to refinance into an FHA insured loan that they can afford based on the current appraised value of their home while allowing their current lenders to receive more than they would realize through a foreclosure, we create a “win-win” proposition for the borrower and the lender. We also protect neighborhoods from the reduced property values that occur in areas with many foreclosures. From now on, under the bill’s prudent underwriting standards, lenders will only be able to make loans that a borrower has a reasonable ability to repay. “We create a new independent world class regulator to ensure the safety and soundness of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac without compromising their mission of facilitating the availability of affordable home financing. The bill also provides stand-by authority for the Treasury Department to make loans or equity investments in Fannie and Freddie for a limited period if required to preserve their safety and soundness. “I am pleased that the bill includes important safeguards for the taxpayers that I suggested, such as controls on executive compensation and directions for the Treasury Department to restrict dividends and seek a preferred payment position before other shareholders in the event that Treasury makes loans or takes an equity position in one or more of the GSEs. “While there are certainly risks to establishing a Federal backstop for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, these risks pale in relation to the damage that would result if we do nothing and these entities were to fail.” This package now goes to the Senate. Once the Senate passes it, the bill will go to the President, who is expected to sign it.
07.19.2008	Sherman Oaks - On Saturday, Congressman Brad Sherman honored soldiers and families of the U.S. Army Reserve upon their deployment to Iraq. Fifty soldiers of the U.S. Army Reserve’s 420th Movement Control Battalion based in Sherman Oaks and their families held a deployment farewell ceremony at the United States Army Reserve Center in Sherman Oaks. The event, scheduled prior to the battalion’s deployment, celebrated Christmas in July, since the unit will not be home in time to celebrate the holidays with their loved ones. The ceremony was attended by the Congressman and local reserve commanders. The Congressman also presented the battalion a flag flown over the United States Capitol. “We are all grateful for your service and wish you a safe return home to your families who will miss you deeply,” said Sherman. He called the soldiers “a credit to California” and said while they are “placing themselves in harms way, they are also following a great American tradition of citizen soldiers that goes back all the way to the Revolutionary War.” “This ceremony pays tribute not only to the bravery of our soldiers, but also to the selflessness of their families and the places where they work.” Sherman said.
07.02.2008	Van Nuys - Tonight, Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) joined the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and the Los Angeles County NeighborWorks Center for Foreclosure Solutions at a foreclosure prevention workshop to discuss Congressional efforts to assist Valley residents at risk of losing their homes. Participants received important information on how to work with lenders and counseling agencies and how to avoid being the victim of fraud. Credit and housing counselors, loan servicers, and lenders were on hand to provide individual consultations. According to the San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center, San Fernando Valley foreclosure filings totaled 673 in May – a 242% increase from a year ago. The dramatic rise in defaults and foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley is hitting many families and communities especially hard as the cost of living increases. The Southland Regional Association of Realtors also reported the Valley median single-family home price fell 31% to $450,000 in May. Congress is working to ensure that the problems that have placed so many homeowners at risk of foreclosure will not occur again. Congressman Sherman helped pass legislation in the House – The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act (H.R. 3221) – that would assist homeowners in avoiding foreclosure by refinancing out of a bad loan into a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgage that they can afford. “Homeowners in the San Fernando Valley need relief from foreclosures that can be avoided. This legislation will help those struggling with mortgage loans while stabilizing the housing market, protecting property values and addressing the credit crisis,” said Sherman. The legislation would also permanently increase the loan limits for San Fernando Valley loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and for insurance by the FHA to $729,750. The loan limit was temporarily increased to $729,750 for 2008, but will revert to $417,000 at the end of the year unless new legislation is passed.
07.01.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) today announced his support for the Soledad Canyon Mine Act (H.R. 5887) that resolves a mining dispute between the City of Santa Clarita and CEMEX in the Santa Clarita Valley. In April, Congressman Howard “Buck” McKeon introduced H.R. 5887 following a year of negotiations between the City of Santa Clarita and CEMEX to cancel two ten-year mining contracts in the Santa Clarita Valley’s Soledad Canyon. The legislation allows the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to prohibit future mining in the Soledad Canyon while compensating CEMEX for the cancelled contracts through the proceeds of the sale of surplus federal land in San Bernardino County to the city of Victorville. Sherman recently met with Santa Clarita city officials to discuss the legislation and strongly encourage the city to gain support for the bill from the environmental community, including the Sierra Club and its local volunteer groups. “The Soledad Canyon Mine Act will prohibit large-scale mining in Soledad Canyon that would have otherwise caused further degradation of the environment,” said Sherman. “Although there is much work ahead for final passage of the bill, Santa Clarita is well positioned to preserve this land as future open space,” added Sherman. Sherman noted that the bill was recently endorsed by the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club.
06.26.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) today announced a round of approved federal funds for road safety projects in the San Fernando Valley. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) awarded approximately $1.6 million in federal Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) funds for four safety improvement projects at intersections and stretches of roadway in the Valley. The four approved projects include: Install traffic signals at Roxford St and I-5 Southbound On and Off Ramps (Sylmar) Street and sidewalk improvements on Devonshire St. between Topanga Canyon Blvd. and Hanna Ave. (Chatsworth) Street and sidewalk improvements on Oro Vista Ave. between Foothill Blvd. and Hillrose St. (Sunland) Install new traffic signals, left-turn phasing, and curb ramps at Coldwater Canyon Ave./Sherman Way, Vanowen St./Woodman Ave., and Balboa Blvd./Sherman Way (Valley Glen and Lake Balboa) In February, the City of Los Angeles submitted project applications to Caltrans for funding. Congressman Sherman strongly urged Caltrans to fund the four projects in the Valley. The Highway Safety Improvement Program directs federal funds to city or county projects designed to significantly reduce fatalities and severe injuries on our nation’s roadways, as well as bikeways and pedestrian paths.
06.26.2008	San Fernando Valley - Almost eight-thousand San Fernando Valley residents participated in an innovative and interactive "Telephone Town Hall" Tuesday night hosted by Participating from the comfort of their homes and using the latest cutting-edge technology, residents from all over the district were able to call in and participate in a two-way conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed constituents’ questions and concerns on a wide variety of topics, like gas and energy costs, health care, the war in Iraq and environmental concerns. In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct participants to his district office (818/501-9200) for further assistance in regards to personal problems with federal agencies. At the end of the ninety minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voice mail. "Telephone Town Halls are becoming a regular part of my outreach with my constituents,” said Sherman. “These types of town halls allow me to interact with thousands of Valley residents in a very easy and relaxed manner. These days, we are all so busy. The technology that we use allows my constituents to participate from home without having to drive in congested traffic. Many who participated in this town hall had a chance to talk with me, one on one,” added Sherman. Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks).
06.24.2008	Washington, D.C. - The House Financial Services Committee today approved an amendment offered by Congressman Brad Sherman, Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism and Nonproliferation, to help stop lending by the World Bank to Iran. Sherman’s amendment would require the President to use all available means at his disposal to stop disbursements on previously authorized World Bank loans to Iran, and would also provide for tough measures in the event that new loans are approved by the World Bank for Iran. “Continuing this type of assistance when Iran is in the dock at the U.N. Security Council over its nuclear program is madness,” Sherman said. “The Treasury Department and the Bush Administration overall has to do more to try to prevent the World Bank from disbursing one more penny to Iran until it abandons its nuclear weapons program.” From 2000 to 2005 the World Bank approved some $1.35 billion in nine separate loans to Iran, some $670 million of which has not yet been disbursed. Sherman’s amendment would require that the President terminate any contributions for three of the organizations within the World Bank Group in the event that a new loan is approved for Iran. U.S. contributions to the International Development Association, which is the World Bank entity which provides assistance to the poorest nations, would not be affected. “We can convince Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program if they face absolute political and diplomatic isolation,” added Sherman. “I cannot think of anything that frustrates that policy objective more than World Bank loans to the regime in Tehran.” Sherman’s amendment was added to the text of H.R. 6303, which authorizes funding for the International Development Association and makes reforms to U.S. participation in the World Bank and various multilateral lending institutions.
06.18.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) applauded the vote by the Metro Board of Directors Planning and Programming Committee to approve a “Locally Preferred Alternative” for the Orange Line extension to Chatsworth. The route will extend the popular Orange Line from the Canoga Station north along the Metro-owned railroad right-of-way to the Chatsworth Metrolink Station. In May, the Orange Line averaged over 24,000 weekday boardings. “With gas prices rising, motorists are seeking fuel efficient and cost-effective means of traveling, and the Orange Line extension will provide Valley residents with an alternative to our congested roads and highways as climate change becomes more apparent,” said Sherman. “The Orange Line is the only major transit project which traverses the San Fernando Valley. To reduce the skyrocketing costs of construction and attract new riders to this successful service, Metro should begin construction of the Orange Line extension by 2010,” added Sherman. Following final action by the Metro Board of Directors on June 26, Metro staff will commence work on the project’s Final Environmental Impact Report and Preliminary Engineering. The Board will certify the final environmental review at the end of the year. If Metro begins construction by 2010, the project could be completed by 2013. The cost of the project is projected at $251 million adjusted for inflation in 2013. Metro has a commitment of $100 million in state Traffic Congestion Relief Program funds and $70 million in Prop 1B funds. Additional funds are identified in Metro’s Long Range Transportation Plan for the Orange Line extension, but the Board must redirect funds to start construction sooner. In the past, Sherman won more than $4.2 million in federal funds for Orange Line projects, including $1.9 million for bike paths along the route, $1 million for the Warner Center transit hub, $836,000 to build an Orange Line extension and pedestrian entranceway to Pierce College, and $500,000 for park-and-ride facilities along the route.
05.15.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, the House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation, originally introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade. This legislation’s aim is to help modernize the federal government’s export control policy by strengthening national security and helping American companies sell more defense hardware overseas to our allies. The Defense Trade Controls Performance Improvement Act, H.R. 4246, was introduced last year by Congressman Sherman and Congressman Don Manzullo. The text of this legislation was included in a larger security assistance bill, The Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Reform Act of 2008, H.R. 5916 that the House passed today. The Defense Trade Controls Performance Improvement Act would direct the State Department to hire more staff to ensure that there are no backlogs of license applications. By 2010, this legislation would increase by roughly 50 percent the number of officers reviewing export licenses. The legislation also streamlines the process by providing for a special licensing provision for spare parts and components for items already approved by the U.S. government for export. "The current export control process was designed for the Cold War. We must now reform it and address the national security priorities of the 21st Century." said Sherman. "This legislation will address the problems of our high-tech trade system, which today is underfunded and understaffed. While we do not want any of our technology to fall into the wrong hands, we also cannot afford to lose jobs and exports of legitimate products to our closest friends and allies because this country is too slow to simply issue a license." The Defense Trade Controls Performance Improvement Act remedies many of the deficiencies in the licensing of defense trade by: Directing the next President to review the U.S. export control system and offer recommendations to strengthen controls, improve efficiency, and reduce redundancies across federal agencies. Directing the next President to examine how our export control policies play a role in the disturbing trend toward greater outsourcing and off-shoring of defense production.Requiring the State Department to hire additional licensing officers to prevent backlogs and expedite the processing of licenses for our closest allies, and ensure a thorough national security review of every application. Creating greater transparency in defense trade license processing, making it easier for businesses to follow the law; and by creating a special licensing procedure for spare parts and components. Codifying performance goals for processing times of licensing actions. The Defense Trade Controls Performance Improvement Act now heads to a vote in the Senate.
05.08.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) released the following statement on the signing earlier today of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 (S. 2739) which included legislation that authorizes the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study to be conducted by the National park Service – a study that Congressman Sherman, a co-sponsor of the legislation, has long been fighting for. "Today's signing by the President allows for the continuing efforts to protect the natural resources of a very geographically and ecologically distinct region in Southern California. The study also will address the needs and interests of both private landowners and communities within the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Corridor. Finally, I want to commend my colleague Adam Schiff for all his efforts and vital role in the passage of this bill in Congress," stated Congressman Sherman.
05.08.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, with Congressman Sherman’s strong support, the House of Representatives passed a package of housing and tax bills that will provide crucial relief from foreclosure to many San Fernando Valley homeowners who are struggling to pay their mortgage loans. "I am very pleased that the House has taken this important step to help more families refinance out of bad loans so that they can stay in their homes and avoid foreclosure. The package of bills that we passed today is crucial to stabilizing the housing market, protecting property values, increasing homeownership opportunities, and addressing the credit crisis," said Congressman Sherman. H.R. 3221, The American Housing Rescue and Foreclosure Prevention Act of 2008, would use the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to guarantee up to $300 billion in new mortgages to refinance borrowers at risk of foreclosure into viable loans that they can afford. Willing lenders would write down their existing mortgage loans to 85% of the current appraised value of a homeowner’s property, and the borrower would receive a new FHA-insured loan. To qualify for such a loan, borrowers would have document their income and their ability to repay the new proposed loan under the FHA’s prudent underwriting standards. The bills would also permanently increase the loan limits for San Fernando Valley loans eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and for insurance by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) to the ceiling of $729,750 previously established for 2008 in the Economic Stimulus Act. Unless these bills become law, on January 1, 2009, the single family home conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would return to $417,000 and the FHA loan limit would fall to $362,790. "Allowing the temporary 2008 loan limits to expire would be a catastrophe for the Valley. It would significantly reduce the number of San Fernando Valley homeowners with access to the lower-cost financing that comes from having their loans purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It also would return the FHA to irrelevance for most prospective San Fernando Valley homebuyers and homeowners," said Sherman. The plan requires both homeowners and lenders to take responsibility. In order to qualify for refinancing and new government backed mortgages, lenders and mortgage investors will be required to take a loss, and borrowers must share any profit from the resale of a refinanced home with the government. Additionally, the new plan is open only to owner-occupied homes. Speculators, investors and vacation/second-home owners are not eligible. H.R. 3221 gives first-time homebuyers a refundable tax credit that works like an interest-free loan of up to $7,500 (to be paid back over 15 years), and an increased standard deduction of up to an additional $700 for property taxes for those taxpayers who do not itemize on their returns. The House also passed H.R. 5818, The Neighborhood Stabilization Act of 2008, which provides $15 billion in loans and grants to states to acquire vacant, foreclosed homes. The legislation will allow local communities to rehabilitate foreclosed properties, which currently drive down the price of surrounding properties, and place the homes back on the market as affordable housing. This package now returns to the Senate for further consideration. A presidential veto is possible.
05.07.2008	Washington, D.C. (May 1, 2008) - Lewis Chappelear, the 2008 California Teacher of the Year met with Congressman Brad Sherman following a White House Ceremony in which the California high school educator was recognized as one of four National Teacher of the Year finalist for 2008. This national award sponsored by the Council of Chief State School Officers has been presented in Washington, DC since 1952. While presenting Chappelear with a flag that had flown over the Capitol, Congressman Sherman praised the Monroe High School teacher saying, "Lewis has described teaching as 'being an ambassador for humanity.' We need more ambassadors like Lewis in our schools. We need teachers like Lewis to not only educate our children, but inspire them to greatness." Chappelear's school James Monroe High School in North Hills, California, is located in Congressman Sherman's district. The eight-year education veteran is currently teaching engineering and design and has been teaching at Monroe High School for seven years.
05.06.2008	Canoga Park - On Sunday, May 4th, sixty-five of the San Fernando Valley's most talented and visually expressive high school students displayed their artistic masterpieces at the Canoga Park Youth Arts Center as part of the 27th Annual Congressional High School Art Competition presented by Congressman Brad Sherman. Best In-Show was awarded to Austin Tallynn Carpenter, a sophomore from Valley Alternative High School, for her painting entitled “Surrounded by Darkness.” Austin will receive an all-expense paid trip to Washington, D.C. compliments of Southwest Airlines and Time Warner Cable to attend a ceremony with Congressman Sherman in June where her artwork will be displayed at the U.S. Capitol for one year. Crystal Gutierrez, a junior from High Tech High School and Thilina Fernando, a sophomore from Valley Alternative High School won first place in the categories of Photography and Painting respectively, for their works of art. High Tech High School was also awarded a $400 Arts Grant from Gelb Enterprises for having the most entries in this year’s contest. The award will help support High Tech’s art program. The two runner-ups’ artwork will hang in Congressman Sherman’s Washington D.C. and the Sherman Oaks District offices. Students wishing to compete in this year’s art competition had to live or attend a school in Congressman Sherman's district. Deane Leavenworth of Time Warner Cable served as the master of ceremonies for this year's Congressional Art Competition. The Canoga Park Youth Art Center and its director, Stewart Vaughn, administered the judging of this year’s competition. Sponsors of the event included: Keyes Motors, The Sherman Oaks Chamber of Commerce, Roll International, Westfield, The Valley Cultural Center, The Canoga Park Youth Art Center, The Canoga Park/West Hills Chamber of Commerce, Trader Joes, California Pizza Kitchen, and Gelb Enterprises.
04.30.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed bipartisan legislation, originally introduced by Congressman Brad Sherman, Chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee.

04.29.2008	Washington, D.C. - The House passed legislation today that authorizes the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study to be conducted by the National Park Service – a study that Congressman Sherman has long been fighting for. The bill passed the Senate earlier in April, and now heads to the President. This study will determine the potential impact of expanding the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include the mountains and valleys known as the Rim of the Valley Corridor, an area that includes the mountains encircling the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys, as well as areas within the Santa Susana Mountains, just north of Granada Hills. "The passage of this bill is the next step in the continuing efforts to protect the natural resources of this geographically and ecologically distinct region in Southern California,” said Congressman Sherman. “This legislation addresses the needs and interests of both private landowners and communities within the boundaries of the Rim of the Valley Corridor." Since coming to Congress, Congressman Sherman has worked to help expand the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, which is the nation’s largest urban national park. It is estimated that annually, there are over 33 million visits to the recreation area’s pristine parks and world-renowned beaches. The Rim of the Valley Corridor contains accessible recreation trails for the use and enjoyment of the millions of residents in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties. The expansion of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include this area would allow for the completion of the Rim of the Valley Trail. This trail will run 150 miles and offer sweeping vistas of the San Fernando Valley and Los Angeles basins. It will also link four mountain ranges. "I also want to commend my colleague Adam Schiff for all his efforts and vital role in the passage of this bill in Congress," stated Congressman Sherman. Local cities and agencies, as well as environmental groups, have taken strong positions in support of the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act, including the City of Los Angeles, the City of Santa Clarita, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, and the Sierra Club Angeles Chapter.
04.25.2008	Washington, D.C. - AARP thanked Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) for his co-sponsorship of H.R. 5613, the Protecting the Medicaid Safety Net Act of 2008, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday, April 23. The bill, as passed, places a moratorium until March 2009 on seven, damaging Administration-imposed Medicaid regulations that, if implemented, would result in increased costs or reduced health care services for people covered by Medicaid. If these harmful regulations are allowed to go into place, they also would severely impact state budgets at a time when states are already financially struggling. "My vote supporting the Medicaid Safety Net Act is a vote to ensure the health and safety of our most vulnerable citizens, seniors." said Sherman. AARP California State Director Tom Porter said, “Today’s vote is a victory for all California residents who rely on Medicaid as the safety net of our health care system. With 47 million Americans already uninsured, our country and our state cannot afford to make it any harder for our most vulnerable to pay for their health care." AARP applauded Congressman Sherman for recognizing proposed cuts by the White House that threaten the integrity of the Medicaid program. This legislation is now headed to the United States Senate for consideration.
04.25.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced today that the U.S. Department of Interior awarded $356,000 in federal funds to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Sherman had sought the funding from the U.S. Department of Interior for the environmental education and stewardship programs. The Interior Department awarded funds for these projects in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area: Outdoor Education Programs for 10,000 Urban Youth – This project provides services, supplies, materials and transportation for 10,000 students from LAUSD schools located in under-served communities in Greater Los Angeles so they can learn about the role of the National Park Service in conserving our natural and cultural heritage. Students can also interact with nature, which for a majority of students will be their first experience in nature. Stewardship Experience for Urban Youth through Watershed Restoration Activity – This program connects classroom theory and curriculum to field applications that promote long-term learning and stewardship of natural resources. BioBlitz – Create Environmental Stewardship through Discovery – The Santa Monica Mountains BioBlitz is a 24-hour inventory of the species in the Santa Monica Mountains. Teams of scientists and naturalists, along with volunteers, will comb the mountains' 150,000 acres, observing and recording as many species as possible. On Friday, May 30, Sherman will join the National Park Service, National Geographic and other park partners in welcoming scientists, naturalists, and volunteers as well as thousands of school children to the Santa Monica Mountains BioBlitz – a 24-hour inventory of the species in the Santa Monica Mountains. BioBlitz begins at 11:30 a.m. and is followed by a BioDiversity Festival at Paramount Ranch in Agoura. The goals of the BioBlitz are to add to species lists for as many taxonomic groups as possible and to increase public awareness about biodiversity in the Santa Monica Mountains. "Each year 33 million visitors from across Los Angeles and the world visit the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to access its pristine parks, hiking trails and world-renowned beaches," said Sherman. "As good stewards of the environment, we must work to protect wildlife and habitat in one the most diverse ecosystems in the world while offering recreational and educational opportunities for our youth and families." The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area – a unit of the National Park Service – is the world’s largest urban national park. It is located in the second largest urban area in the United States spanning 46 miles across Los Angeles from Point Mugu in the west to Griffith Park in the east. Since his election to Congress in 1996, Congressman Sherman has secured $20 million in federal funds for land acquisition and trail construction, including the 65-mile Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
04.25.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (Sherman Oaks) announced on Thursday that the Bob Hope Airport in Burbank will be awarded $3 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation to soundproof nearby homes from the roar of jet engines. "Residents living near the airport deserve peace and quiet in their homes during the day and evening hours, and this investment will go a long way in helping improve the quality of life for those residents," Sherman said. The $3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation, and together with funds from the airport authority will enable the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority to add 85 homes to the more than 1,400 that have been insulated to reduce the impact of aircraft noise. Measures to soundproof homes include replacing doors and windows, insulating attics, and improving weather stripping, and ventilation. The new grant brings the total amount of federal support for noise mitigation awarded to the Bob Hope Airport to $75.6 million. The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority has added $18 million in matching funds, and has committed another $2.8 million to pay for noise-abatement work not covered by federal grants.
04.17.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today sharply criticized the Bush Administration at a joint subcommittee hearing on Iran policy, noting that Iran’s nuclear program continues unabated while the Bush Administration still searches for an effective strategy to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb. "As we speak, Iran has more than 3,000 centrifuges installed, and is installing more. Yet we have not come close to imposing the type of sanctions that could cause them to even consider changing course on uranium enrichment." Sherman argued that the U.S. will have to stop pulling punches and will have to coerce countries – among them, our closest friends – to get behind a tough diplomatic and economic effort to stop Iran’s program. It will also mean a reordering of American priorities vis-à-vis China and Russia, the two main obstacles to tough U.N.–approved sanctions measures. "On the one hand we push policies that are anathema to Russia, such as the eastward expansion of NATO; on the other hand, we basically give China a free pass, allowing Beijing to violate trade rules and run up a massive trade surplus with the US. We never even hint that how we deal with these two key countries will be determined by their assistance on Iran issues. Is it any wonder both countries have worked to water-down all three of the U.N. Iran resolutions to near irrelevance?" "We need to link our China and Russia policies to our Iran policy if we want to get tough U.N. sanctions,” Sherman added. “But we also need to push Europe and our friends in Asia to stop doing business as usual with Iran, with or without the U.N." Sherman noted that President Bush has ignored the Iran Sanctions Act, which allows him to slap penalties on foreign firms that help Iran develop its energy sector; has failed to prevent the continued disbursement of $1.3 billion worth of World Bank loans to Iran; opposes legislation that would merely authorize states, private pension and mutual fund managers to divest from Iran; and even protects Iranian assets from being seized to satisfy the court judgments of victims of Iranian terrorism. "Unless we start causing some pain to Iran's government and its economy, not mere inconvenience, we will soon be faced with a nuclear adversary unlike any other we have faced in the past – one which we may not be able to deter," said Sherman.

04.10.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (CA-Sherman Oaks), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, issued the following statement today following the vote on the Columbian Trade Agreement which President Bush sent to Congress: "Today, House Democrats took the historic step of reasserting Congress' Constitutional control of U.S. trade policy. Earlier this week, President Bush tried to force a vote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement when he sent it to Congress against the objections of the Democratic majority. Under a special procedure called Fast Track, a free trade agreement is required to receive a vote within 90 legislative days after submission by the President without opportunity for amendment. The House voted to prevent this automatic vote. Earlier this year, Congress refused to give President Bush the right to negotiate new trade deals under Fast Track procedures. Today, the House demonstrated Congress’ ability to take away the President’s power to demand votes on outstanding deals with Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. The Colombia Free Trade Agreement is a continuation of a failed trade model that has led to the loss of over 3 million manufacturing jobs and an $800 billion annual trade deficit. Colombia is still the most dangerous country in the world in which to be a labor activist. American workers should not be asked to compete with countries that ignore core labor standards with impunity. This vote places Congress back in the driver's seat."
04.09.2008	Washington, D.C. - Today, the House passed House Resolution 1077, Calling Upon Chinese Government to End Crackdown in Tibet and Begin Substantive Dialogue. This resolution was introduced by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Congressman Brad Sherman released the following statement: "I am proud that I could vote yes on this House Resolution that calls for the Government of the People’s Republic of China to end its crackdown on nonviolent Tibetan protestors and the continuing cultural, religious, economic and linguistic repression inside Tibet. It is imperative for the Chinese Government to begin a results-based dialogue, without preconditions, directly with His Holiness the Dalai Lama to address the legitimate grievances of the Tibetan people and provide for a long-term solution that respects the human rights and dignity of every Tibetan. China must immediately release all Tibetans who are imprisoned for nonviolently expressing opposition to Chinese Government policies in Tibet. For those of us on the outside looking in, it will be vital and necessary for the Chinese Government to allow independent international monitors and journalists, free and unfettered access to the Tibet Autonomous Region and all other Tibet areas of China. We need to monitor current events in the area and verify that individuals injured during the protests are and will receive adequate medical care."
04.02.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today helped pass H.R. 5501, the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act. The act furthers America’s commitment to assisting men, women, and children in the least developed countries with HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care and increases the funds authorized to combat tuberculosis and malaria. "The memory of Chairman Lantos inspired us to make sure this vital program receives the necessary funding to meet the critical health needs of developing countries," said Sherman."Today, we are going far beyond our original commitment by authorizing $50 billion dollars in funding over the next five years to fight these terrible diseases." Five years ago, when this legislation was first passed, Congress authorized $15 billion in funding over five years. As a result of funding, an estimated 150,000 infants have avoided infections and nearly 1.5 million people have received life-saving drugs. The bill also authorizes the U.S. Department of Treasury to assist the finance and health ministries of developing countries struggling with these diseases by helping them create public finance systems to fund the health battle against these deadly diseases. "The best way to push back against these epidemics in developing countries," Sherman said, "is to not only provide resources, but to teach these countries how to help themselves." Congressman Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, strongly supported this bill as it made its way through the Committee and to its passage today by the House.
03.06.2008	Washington, D.C. - Rep. Peter Welch (VT-AL), Rep. Brad Sherman (CA-27), and 58 co-sponsors announced the introduction of legislation today to overturn the recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decision to deny California’s request for a waiver to adopt stricter automobile greenhouse gas emissions standards. With record high fuel prices and the scientific evidence of global warming overwhelming, the Right to Clean Vehicles Act will immediately grant California’s Clean Air Act waiver request, giving an additional twelve states the authority to implement tailpipe emission standards. Earlier this year, Senator Barbara Boxer (CA) introduced similar legislation in the U.S. Senate. Welch said, “The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision defied the science, defied the states, and defied common sense. With consumers feeling the pinch of record fuel prices and the evidence of global warming overwhelming, the Bush administration must lead, follow, or get out of the way.” “It is absurd that we must stand here today to introduce legislation forcing the Administration to do what it is required to do,” said Sherman. “The President and the Environmental Protection Agency need to stop wasting the American public’s time and allow California and the 12 other states that want to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles to do so.” The EPA denied California’s waiver request on December 19, 2007 after considering it since 2005. The twelve states waiting for the EPA waiver include Connecticut, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. The Governors of Arizona, Colorado, Florida and Utah have also committed to the standards. Original co-sponsors include: Reps. Peter Welch, Brad Sherman, Tom Allen, Howard Berman, Earl Blumenauer, Lois Capps, Dennis Cardoza, Yvette Clarke, Joe Courtney, Joseph Crowley, Susan Davis, Peter DeFazio, Rosa DeLauro, David Dreier, Keith Ellison, Anna Eshoo, Sam Farr, John Hall, Jane Harman, Maurice Hinchey, Paul Hodes, Mike Honda, Jay Inslee, Patrick Kennedy, Dennis Kucinich, Jim Langevin, John Larson, Barbara Lee, Zoe Lofgren, Edward Markey, Doris Matsui, Betty McCollum, Jim McDermott, Jim McGovern, Michael Michaud, George Miller, Brad Miller, Jim Moran, Chris Murphy, Jerrold Nadler, John Olver, Frank Pallon, Donald Payne, Linda Sanchez, John Sarbanes, Adam Schiff, Jose Serrano, Carol Shea-Porter, Albio Sires, Hilda Solis, Pete Stark, Ellen Tauscher, Mike Thompson, Chris Van Hollen, Henry Waxman, Robert Wexler, Lynn Woolsey, David Wu
02.13.2008	SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - Over seven-thousand San Fernando Valley residents participated in an innovative and interactive "Telephone Town Hall" last night hosted by Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks). Participating from the comforts of their homes, and using the latest cutting-edge technology, residents from all over the district were able to call-in and participate in a two way conversation with Congressman Sherman for ninety minutes. During this time, the Congressman addressed constituents’ questions and concerns on a wide variety of topics, from national issues like terrorism, immigration and health care to even discussing a local power outage that impacted parts of the San Fernando Valley just prior to the start of the Telephone Town Hall. In addition to answering policy questions, Congressman Sherman used the time to direct participants to his district office (818/501-9200) for further assistance as well as his website (www.house.gov/sherman) for further information. At the end of the ninety minute conversation, participants who were unable to ask a question were given the option to leave their own comments and questions for the Congressman by voice mail. "This ‘Telephone Town Hall’ allowed me to interact with thousands of Valley residents in a very easy and relaxed manner," said Rep. Sherman. "Today, we are all so busy. This technology that was used tonight allowed my constituents to stay home, and not be forced to drive in traffic to another event. And with tonight’s power outage, this format allowed me to go ahead with the event and not cancel it. Many who participated in this town hall had a chance to talk with me, one on one. I look forward to making this town hall format a regular part of my outreach with my constituents.”
02.11.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee (and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Terrorism, Non-Proliferation, and Trade) today released the following statement regarding the passing of Congressman Tom Lantos, Chairman of the U.S. House Representatives Committee on Foreign Relations: “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Tom Lantos. I served with him for more than a decade, both as members of the California delegation and of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman Tom Lantos not only made history in Washington, he was a living witness to history, having survived the Holocaust and fought in the anti-Nazi underground during World War II. His personal history added to the gravitas of everything he said and did. Tom was our nation’s most passionate, eloquent and respected advocate for human rights, democracy, and freedom. Tom never bowed to political pressure in the face of any humanitarian atrocity. The passing of Tom Lantos is a profound loss for me, the Congress, our nation and the world. My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Annette and the entire Lantos family.”
02.08.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that the United States Census Bureau will continue reporting and publishing Census data specifically for the San Fernando Valley after 2010. The Congressman, who led a community-wide campaign, pressed the Census Bureau to continue gathering and publishing the Valley Census data after the Census designation was threatened with elimination. Data is collected regarding the 1.8 million persons living in the San Fernando Valley because the Census Bureau has designated it as a Census County Division (CCD). The Census Bureau uses the CCD designation to compile data for sub-county areas that are distinct enough to deserve their own statistical tabulation. In April 2007, the Census Bureau announced that it was considering the elimination of some of the CCD designations. In response, last summer, Congressman Sherman and many Valley elected officials and organizations called upon the Census Bureau to continue providing specific census data for the San Fernando Valley. “The Census Bureau made the correct decision. Continuing the compilation of Census data for the San Fernando Valley will help community organizations, businesses and government leaders make better informed decisions affecting the Valley’s future,” said Sherman. “Many Valley leaders have used Census Bureau CCD information since it was first published in 2006. Mayor Villaraigosa and I relied upon data from the San Fernando Valley CCD report during a California Transportation Commission hearing. Using this data, we were able to show that Valley residents spend 7.4 percent longer commuting to work than the average Californian. In response to this Census data, along with lobbying efforts by Los Angeles officials, the California Transportation Commission approved funding for an additional lane on the northbound 405 freeway through the Sepulveda Pass, one lane in each direction in the Valley portion of the 5 freeway.” Last year in a letter to the Census Bureau, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stated that, “The statistics generated by the San Fernando Valley CCD are essential to effective governance… The work product of the San Fernando Valley CCD is widely known and used by all sectors of the Los Angeles Community.”Bob Scott, chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association (VICA), a leader in the drive for a Valley census, said the data will allow Valley cities to coordinate plans for their future, “We have worked many years to gain recognition for the 1.8 million residents of the San Fernando Valley. It gives us the information we need to deal with pressing issues of transportation, housing, education, healthcare and jobs.”The Los Angeles City Council in a resolution stated that, “These geographic subdivisions are used extensively by local government, business and non-profit organizations in analyzing local communities in support of grant funding applications, business location decision, and an untold number of other efforts.” The United Chambers of Commerce of the San Fernando Valley told the Census Bureau, “(The Valley data) establishes the demographic information needed to achieve economic growth… Many businesses and non-profits use this information to help them receive more federal dollars for the programs and services they provide.”Congressman Sherman wants to commend those who urged the Census Bureau to continue to publish Valley data including: the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors led by Supervisors Zev Yaroslavsky and Michael Antonovich, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Los Angeles City Council Members Wendy Greuel, Greig Smith, Dennis Zine, Tony Cardenas, and Richard Alarcon, VICA, Economic Alliance of the San Fernando Valley, CSUN San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center and many other Valley organizations.
02.07.2008	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Wednesday that he has nominated the following outstanding Valley students for admission to the nation’s elite military service academies. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, COTrevor Abbott (Tarzana), Billy Arana (Van Nuys),Edward Lixandru (North Hollywood), Elvin Petrosy (Sunland) andEdward Rubio (Porter Ranch) Naval Academy at Annapolis, MDBilly Arana (Van Nuys), Charles Buenaventura (North Hollywood),Sophie Cazarez (Reseda), Scott Grijalva (Winnetka), Edward Lixandru (North Hollywood), Elvin Petrosy (Sunland), Edward Polanco (Northridge) and Edward Rubio (Porter Ranch) U.S. Military Academy at West Point, NY Billy Arana (Van Nuys), Rahul Baldwin (Granada Hills), Charles Kamulali (Canoga Park), Rebecca Kratz (Northridge), Ryan Merkle (Granada Hills), Elvin Petrosy (Sunland), Edward Polanco (Northridge) and Edward Rubio (Porter Ranch) Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, NY (None) "I am so proud of these young men and women and very grateful for their willingness to serve our country at this critical time," Sherman said. The military academies are ranked among the best educational institutions in the country. In addition to a rigorous academic curriculum, an academy education offers cadets extensive hands-on training and an opportunity to participate in varsity and intramural sports, music groups, and clubs. Cadets also must live under a strict, personal and ethical code to develop the discipline necessary to become leaders in today's military. The service academies decide which of the Congressman's nominees to admit. Each academy generally is required to admit at least one of Sherman’s nominees, and due to the high quality of applicants from the Valley, each academy usually admits two or three. Some applicants receive nominations to attend two or three different academies. If nominees are accepted by more than one academy, they decide which one to attend.
01.02.2008	Washington, D.C. - I am deeply saddened by the news that Congressman Lantos is ill and will retire from Congress at the end of this term. I have the deepest admiration for his life of courage and accomplishment. I have been privileged to work under his leadership on the Foreign Affairs Committee, where we have served together since I came to Congress in 1997. He speaks with a voice of moral authority that is unparalleled in Congress. More importantly, he has been a great friend. Our prayers are with Tom, Annette and their entire family.
12.18.2007	Washington, D.C. - The Energy bill passed today by the House of Representatives includes the text of legislation by Congressman Brad Sherman to fund joint research by Americans and Israelis into alternative energy sources. The bill creates a grant program that would provide assistance to cooperative efforts by Israeli and U.S. government agencies, business, and academic institutions to develop technologies that would utilize alternative energy sources and increase energy efficiency. Congressman Sherman first introduced this legislation in 2004. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert praised the legislation before a joint session of Congress in May of 2006. “Both [Israel and the United States] share a desire for energy security and prevention of global warming,” Olmert said. “Therefore, through the United States - Israel Energy Cooperation Act and other joint frameworks, in collaboration with our U.S. counterparts, Israel will increase its efforts to find advanced scientific and technological solutions designed to develop new energy sources and encourage conservation.” This was the first time an Israeli Prime Minister has urged the passage of any legislation during a joint address to Congress. The government of Israel has also indicated that it is prepared to invest its own resources into this effort, and Israeli officials plan to discuss how to implement this legislation with the Administration and Congress. “Israel is an ideal research partner because Israel’s strategic position has required it to be at the cutting edge of research to reduce reliance on fossil fuels,” said Sherman. The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act (USIECA), which Sherman re-introduced in 2005 with Congressman John Shadegg (R-AZ), was included in the larger energy bill as an amendment offered in the Energy Committee by USEICA cosponsors Eliot Engel (D-NY), Shadegg and Anthony Weiner (D-NY) last June. Sherman worked closely with the American Jewish Congress to develop the legislation. That organization, along with AIPAC and other pro-Israel and Jewish groups, was instrumental in securing its passage. “The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, sponsored by Rep. Brad Sherman will foster private sector and academic research on alternative energy and help increase research on alternative energy, strategies and projects, and help increase research on energy-efficient technologies by building on existing U.S. and Israeli cooperative efforts,” stated Jack Haplern, Chairman of the American Jewish Congress Energy Task Force. “U.S.-Israeli joint research has already made significant scientific breakthroughs in medicine, bioengineering, and agriculture. Now, these two countries turn their scientific talents to the critical issue of energy improvement.”The Energy package passed by the House today has cleared the Senate. It will be sent to President Bush, who has indicated that he will sign the legislation into law.
09.18.2007	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman joined today with his colleagues to introduce the bipartisan Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act in the House of Representatives. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that counterfeiting and piracy cost the U.S. economy up to $250 billion each year and that intellectual property theft is directly responsible for the loss of over 750,000 American jobs. Additionally, the International Intellectual Property Alliance estimates that the United States suffers $9 billion losses in trade annually due to counterfeiting and piracy. In order to combat this problem, the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act would establish the Intellectual Property Enforcement Network (IPEN), which would replace the current approach to enforcement with a stronger, more centralized system. The bill requires information sharing and enforcement cooperation between all of the agencies relevant to protecting intellectual property rights, calls for the United States to work towards higher standards of enforcement with foreign governments, and mandates creation of a strategic plan to stop piracy. “The Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act treats the crisis of intellectual property theft with the seriousness it deserves,” remarked Sherman, Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade, and member of the House Judiciary Committee and its Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. “The staggering losses to the U.S. economy are more than enough reason to take strong action to stop intellectual property theft,” Sherman said. “But this is more than just an economic issue. This is also about public safety and national security. Bogus drugs and fake airplane parts are serious dangers in and of themselves, and more so since we know that terrorist groups have used the sale of counterfeit goods to finance their activities.” Sherman was joined at the press conference by primary cosponsors Congressman Steve Chabot of Ohio and Congressman Joe Donnelly of Indiana. "Innovation is the heart and soul of this country," said Chabot. "Protecting the ingenuity and creativity of Americans has made this economy what it is today. And while counterfeit and pirated goods do great harm to our economy, they also pose a serious threat to our families and children as consumers." “Taking others’ ideas and passing them off as your own does not promote fair trade and harms Hoosier businesses,” Donnelly stated. “I am proud to be a co-sponsor of The Intellectual Property Enforcement Act, and I will continue to work hard to ensure that American ingenuity continues to set our entrepreneurs apart from our foreign competition.” The Senate version of the Intellectual Property Rights Enforcement Act, S. 522, is sponsored by Senators Evan Bayh and George Voinovich. “The harm caused by the pirating of goods should not be underestimated,” Bayh said. “Not only does it cost U.S. jobs and undercut manufacturers and producers, but it also risks the health and safety of Americans by deceiving consumers into believing they are getting something they’re not. Knockoff pharmaceuticals, auto parts and electrical equipment pose real risks. To date, our government’s response has not equaled the seriousness of the problem. We need a tough legislative remedy that treats intellectual property theft with the urgency it demands.” “In the competitive global economy of the 21st Century, intellectual property is one area where the United States has a clear advantage over its foreign competitors,” Voinovich stated. “It is vital that the federal government coordinate its resources to protect companies – both large and small – from the blatant theft of their intellectual property to ensure continued economic growth for Americans.” Also participating at the press conference were representatives from a number of business and labor groups, including the AFL-CIO, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC), and the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA).
02.22.2007	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, chairman of a House panel on nuclear nonproliferation, called for strong United Nations sanctions on Iran after a U.N. panel reported Thursday that the regime is expanding its nuclear program. œNothing is more important to America's national security than an all-out diplomatic effort to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and we can block Iran's nuclear program only if we pass extreme Security Council sanctions, said Sherman, chairman of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency report detailing Irans defiance of an ultimatum to freeze the program said the government soon plans to activate hundreds of uranium-spinning centrifuges, the devices that enrich uranium. œThe mere adoption of strong sanctions at the United Nations would be of enormous political impact on the people of Iran. A ban on selling Iran refined petroleum products, for example, would dislocate its economy and bring enormous popular pressure on the government, Sherman said. A dramatic change in Russian policy, he stressed, is the only way the U.N. Security Council could adopt strong sanctions. The only way to get the kind of Russian support we need is by offering real changes on our policy toward issues in Russia's own geographic region--issues Russia cares a lot about, issues not of great significance to most of us in the United States, Sherman said. Sherman supports talks with Iran, so long as during the talks Iran suspends uranium enrichment. He also noted that unilateral U.S. concessions had failed to sway Tehran in the past.
02.20.2007	Sacramento, CA. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Tuesday urged the California Transportation Commission to provide funds for construction of a northbound carpool lane on the heavily-congested 405 Freeway through the Sepulveda Pass. œIt is imperative that Los Angeles receive its share of funding to construct projects that will relieve congestion, improve travel time for commuters and improve air quality in our region, Sherman said in a letter to the commissioners. The proposed carpool lane on the 405 between the 10 and 101 freeways was not among the projects selected by Transportation Commission staff. Before going to the state capital to press the case at a hearing, Sherman on Monday joined Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and other Los Angeles officials in urging Angelinos to call or write the Transportation Commission. The panel is expected to make a final decision later this month on which projects will receive the first $2.8 billion of a $19.9 billion transportation bond that California voters approved last fall. œLos Angeles County voted overwhelmingly for the bonds. We represent 33 percent of the states congestion. We ought to be getting a lot more than 12 percent of the states money, Sherman said. In a separate letter to Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sherman warned that $130 million in federal funds for the project would be in jeopardy if the state fails to provide its share of the construction costs. The federal funding is contingent on construction beginning by 2009. Moreover, Sherman told the governor, losing the freeway funds would be a blow to Californias overall effort to win a fairer share of federal funding. œIf we fail to start construction of the 405 Freeway by the federal deadline, the return of $130 million to Washington, D.C., will be just a part of the damage done to the states efforts to receive its fair share of federal funds, Sherman wrote to Schwarzenegger. œHow can I urge my colleagues from other states to provide federal funds for California if $130 million is returned unspent? What could do more to discourage California members fighting for federal funds than to see $130 million returned?
01.23.2007	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Tuesday became chairman of a Foreign Affairs Committee panel that oversees terrorism and nuclear nonproliferation. His subcommittees jurisdiction also was broadened to include overseas trade issues. Sherman took the gavel of the Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Trade Subcommittee as the 110th Congress neared completion of its committee lineup. Sherman earlier won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee, which oversees intellectual property matters important to the motion picture, television and music industries based in Southern California. He also will continue to serve on the Financial Services Committee. On the foreign affairs front, Sherman has been an outspoken critic of the Bush administrations failure to stop Iran and North Korea from pursuing atomic weapons programs. œPreventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons should be the primary objective of American foreign policy, Sherman said. œIrans unbridled nuclear ambitions and North Koreas atomic weapons are the real threats to Americans, and are actually far more important than Iraq. The portfolio of Shermans subcommittee was expanded to include trade matters. The panel will have jurisdiction over international economic policy generally, and specifically measures to promote, restrict or license exports. Sherman said an early focus of the subcommittee will be an investigation into costly delays in processing licenses to export sensitive goods. œObviously, we want to ensure that overseas sales of items that can harm our national security are heavily scrutinized, but the long delays are not the result of thorough review by vigilant government employees, he said. œInstead, applications languish because there are too few analysts. This serves neither national security, nor the interests of our exporting businesses.
01.11.2007	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, made the following remarks Tuesday on the House floor on legislation to implement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission: œI would like to thank Speaker Pelosi and our leadership for putting together an outstanding bill, and thank Mr. Lantos and the leadership of our committee for provisions within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee. œI expect to be the chair of the subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee that deals with terrorism and nonproliferation, and I want to focus on those matters in my short presentation here today. œThe most important issue facing the United States, and certainly the most important part of this bill, deals with preventing nuclear attack on American cities. Since a nuclear bomb is about the size of a person, it could be smuggled into the United States inside a bale of marijuana. Now, I know that this bill will deal with port security, but we cannot expect our ports or our borders to be airtight. The key is preventing the worst people from getting their hands on the worst weapons. This bill implements several provisions that will be helpful in that regard. œFirst, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Nunn-Lugar program to help Russia get security control over its thousands of arguably excessively loose nukes, the weapons left over from the Cold War. œSecond, it authorizes all funds necessary for the Global Threat Reduction Initiative that gets control of the 20 tons of highly enriched uranium at various nuclear reactor sites around the world, many of them unsecured. œBut I want to emphasize, this bill only authorizes funds and it will be meaningless unless we appropriate the funds. I look forward to an appropriation bill that does just that as quickly as possible. œThis bill imposes sanctions limiting the sale of U.S. weapons to those who provide centrifuges to Iran. I hope the administration will be able to report to us before they send the F-16s that Pakistan has verifiably and permanently halted its aid to the Iranian nuclear weapons program. œThis bill will do a lot, but we have to do more to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into the worst hands. œThe bill also contains important provisions dealing with public diplomacy and youth education. œI think that the United States should print the textbooks for the poorest nations in the world. In doing so, we can help parents in countries who are so poor that they make only a dollar a day or less who are required to provide textbooks for their kids or their kids cant go to school. At the same time, we can assure American taxpayers that our dollars are being spent to help kids and not to teach hate. So I look forward to a foreign aid bill that focuses on the textbook needs of those in the poorest countries in the world.
01.11.2007	Washington, D.C. - The House Steering and Policy Committee on Thursday appointed Congressman Brad Sherman to a seat on the House Judiciary Committee. œThe Judiciary Committee is an important forum for issues critically important to the motion picture, television and music industries, which are leading players in the San Fernando Valley economy, Sherman said. The panel has jurisdiction over enforcement of copyright, trademark, patent and other laws that protect the intellectual property rights of studio actors, writers, directors, producers, musicians and others in the entertainment industry. The Judiciary Committee also has jurisdiction over presidential succession, including legislation Sherman has championed to clarify who takes over in the event the president and the vice president are incapacitated. The existing law may sow seeds of confusion that could leave the country more vulnerable during an era of mounting terrorist threats to our government. One of the oldest standing committees in Congress, the Judiciary Committee was created in 1813 to consider legislation related to judicial proceedings. Today, the committee oversees the Justice Department. It also is charged with issues affecting civil liberties, federal law enforcement agencies, prisons, constitutional amendments, antitrust, and impeachments. The Committees weighty agenda has frequently placed it in a central role in American government. Sherman will continue to serve on the Foreign Affairs Committee, where he will chair the subcommittee on terrorism and nonproliferation, and on the Financial Services Committee.
12.07.2006	Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Census Bureau has completed a first-ever report on the San Fernando Valley using data from its American Community Survey. Prepared at the request of Congressman Brad Sherman and Los Angeles County, the report will help community organizations, businesses and government leaders make better-informed decisions affecting the Valleys future. Compared to the average American, Valley residents make more money, spend more of it on housing, and endure longer commutes to work. The more than 1.74 million people who live in the Valley exceed the populations of all but the top-four cities in the United States “ New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Houston. œI want to thank the Census Bureau for preparing this report, and we look forward to Valley-specific data as part of future census reports. Having specific and official data about the Valley will help to establish our Valley identity, and help us fight for state and federal funds. It will also help attract businesses to the Valley by showing that we offer an educated workforce and a strong consumer market, Sherman said. œThe report shows that Valley residents spend an average of 29 minutes commuting to work which is 7.4 % longer than the average Californian and 15.5 % longer than the average American. This should be important in seeking both federal transportation dollars, and funding under Proposition 1B, the newly passed $19.9 billion state transportation bond, Sherman said. œThe report also shows that there is significant poverty in the Valley (over 72,000 households with incomes under $15,000), justifying our requests for housing funds and for inclusion in tax-incentive empowerment zones, continued Sherman. œBusinesses are looking for an educated workforce. Now we can quantify that the Valley has over 107,000 people with graduate or professional degrees and another 227,000 with bachelor degrees, Sherman added. œAt the same time, the median home price in the Valley ($524,800) is higher than the City of Los Angeles, Los Angeles County or California, and is more than triple the U.S. median home price ($167,500). This information will help us make the case for Valley homeowners on a number of issues, such as increasing the conforming loan limit to make more low-cost mortgages available, and preserving the income tax deduction on mortgage interest. These two issues are particularly important to the typical Valley homeowner. The buyer of a $500,000 or a $600,000 home in the Valley is a local teacher or police officer “ not a millionaire, Sherman said. œThe place called the San Fernando Valley has been hiding in plain sight. Now we are giving the place an identity so people can get a better sense of what we are all about, said Robert L. Scott, chairman of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association (VICA). A leader in the drive for a Valley census, Scott said the information will help lure business to the region. œBefore now, anyone interested in the Valleys economic and demographic trends had to assemble partial and fragmented information from diverse sources which provided incomplete notions of the Valleys dynamics, added Daniel Blake, director of the San Fernando Valley Economic Research Center at California State University, Northridge. He called the report a œboon to the business community, policy-makers, politicians, the social services sector, and civic leaders. œThe bottom line for business is that better data means better decisions, said Dick Castner, executive director of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce western region. œThe census report on the Valley is packed with solid facts that will help guide smart businesses in determining where to locate. We have a rapidly changing economy in Southern California, especially in the San Fernando Valley, and you cant plan unless you have good, solid information. The entire report is available online at BradSherman.house.gov
11.05.2006	WASHINGTON - San Fernando Valley residents on average are better off, better educated, younger, and spend more of their income on their homes, according to Census Bureau data provided to Congressman Brad Sherman. The median household income in most of the Valley is $49,612, an amount that is $3,286 more than the national figure, according to the new report. The Valley figure also is greater than the median household income for Los Angeles County ($48,248) and the City of Los Angeles ($42,667). The preliminary census data examines 1.3 million people who lived in Valley districts represented by Sherman and Congressman Howard Berman in 2005. The Census Bureau will soon issue a report on the entire Valley, which has an estimated total population of about 1.8 million. The preliminary snapshot, available online at www.BradSherman.House.gov, showed that: Valley women slightly outnumbered men 661,629 to 659,700. The median age was just under 34 years old, compared to 36 for the country as a whole. More than 19 percent of people 25 and older had bachelors degrees, compared to 17 percent nationwide. Almost 72 percent of workers over 16 drove to work alone, less than the 77 percent national average. There were 734,864 whites (56.8 percent), 123,869 Asians (9.5 percent) and 56,957 blacks or African Americans (4.4 percent). Hispanics and Latinos of all races totaled 653,903 (49.5 percent). In the Valleys high-priced housing market, renters occupy almost half of the housing units. Nationally, one-third rent. And almost 45 percent of Valley homeowners with mortgages pay more than one-third of their household income on housing. Nationally, its 25 percent. œThe Census Bureau has provided an important preview of information that will help community organizations, businesses and all levels of government make better-informed decisions to shape the Valleys future, Sherman said. The preliminary report covers the more than 72 percent of the Valley population represented by Sherman and Berman. At the request of Sherman and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, the Census Bureau soon will publish a detailed report that for the first time will compile population and economic information for the entire Valley.
10.14.2006	RESEDA - Coach John Wooden was honored Saturday, his 96th birthday, at a ceremony formally naming the Reseda post office after the sports legend and long-time San Fernando Valley resident. œHis athletic genius is recognized in the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., where the sport was invented. I wanted to find a way to honor him here at home in the San Fernando Valley, where the coach has lived for three decades and where his family and friends know him best, said Congressman Brad Sherman, who steered legislation through Congress naming the Coach John Wooden Post Office. œThe bill I introduced last December passed the House in April, cleared the Senate in August and was signed into law by President Bush. That timing, believe it or not, is the legislative equivalent of a fast break, said Sherman, who attended UCLA during the Wooden era. Wooden was the guest of honor at the dedication ceremony also attended by the current UCLA mens basketball coach, Ben Howland, former UCLA basketball players, cheerleaders, and the alumni band. Wooden retired in 1975 after coaching the Bruins to 10 national titles, including seven in a row. Before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history, he was an All-American guard for the Purdue University team that captured the 1932 national championship. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. He also is a prolific author, whose many books include The Pyramid of Success. Sherman said he wanted to name the post office for Coach Wooden because of all he means to sports fans and Valley residents. As a bonus, the Postal Service began a major renovation of the Reseda facility after Shermans legislation was introduced. The improvements include exterior and interior paint, new signs, refurbished lobbies, fresh coats of paint on the familiar blue mail boxes, removal of newspaper vending machines and faÃ§ade improvements. Wooden lives in Encino, where the post office was named for Los Angeles Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn shortly after his untimely death in 2002. Coach Woodens daughter, Nancy Muehlhausen, lives in nearby Reseda and thought naming the Reseda post office after her father would be a fitting tribute. œThere is no disputing Coach Woodens place in sports history, Sherman concluded. œNow, the Coach Wooden Post Office will remind future generations here at home that he also is an important figure in San Fernando Valley history.
10.09.2006	Sherman Oaks, CA. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Monday condemned North Koreas nuclear test, but he also branded the development a œcolossal failure of U.S. diplomacy and called for stepped up international pressure on China, North Koreas powerful neighbor and closest ally. North Korea is now the most dangerous and unstable nuclear state, said Sherman, a senior member of the House International Relations Committee and the Ranking Democrat on the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. It is dangerous because theyre going to keep the first 12 nuclear weapons to defend themselves against Rumsfield, but the 13th is going to go up on E-Bay“ and there are some well financed terrorist organizations lining up to bid, Sherman said. Despite years of warning signs, Sherman added, the United States failed to exert meaningful diplomatic and economic pressure on China to rein in its impoverished neighbor. The Bush administration has hardly even tried to convince China that continued improvement in economic relations with the United States depends on Beijing putting real pressure on Pyongyang to curb its nuclear program, Sherman said. Unless you put trade issues on the table with China, you are not going to change the Chinese policy. At the same time, Sherman said the United States should be more forthcoming in discussing incentives for the North Koreans to dismantle their nuclear weapons program. Our approach to North Korea has been to refuse to provide the type of security guarantees“ including a non-aggression pact“ sought by Pyongyang, Sherman said. Because some in our government dream of a military invasion of North Korea, we have failed to seriously discuss a very important carrot. He also voiced sympathy for the North Korean people and the need to ensure any sanctions policy minimizes their suffering to the greatest extent possible. Kim Jong-il has 23 million hostages“ the innocent people of North Korea“ and in imposing sanctions we have to keep that in mind. However, we can turn off the luxury goods for his upper crust, Sherman said, and it may be necessary to turn off their supply of oil.
09.26.2006	Washington, D.C. - Millions of seniors and disabled who enrolled in the Prescription Drug Medicare Part D program now face the prospect of having to pay the full cost of their medicine. Coverage stops under most programs when the total cost for drugs exceeds $2,250 for the year. Those beneficiaries must pay all of their prescription medicine costs until their annual outlay reaches $5,100. œThis coverage gap “ the so-called doughnut hole “ is both irrational and unfair, said Congressman Brad Sherman. œI will continue to fight for improved and simplified prescription drug coverage under the Medicare program so that seniors may get the drugs they need. The coverage gap puts at risk 88 percent of those who signed up for the prescription drug benefit who are not eligible for extra help, according to a new House study. There are 299,396 seniors and disabled workers in California -- 79 percent of newly enrolled Medicare Part D beneficiaries -- at risk of falling into the gap, according to the report by the House Ways and Means Committee Democratic staff. The report also found that only 20,263 new enrollees in California gained full, uninterrupted coverage through expensive plans with premiums that were 270 percent higher on average. In addition, low-income beneficiaries may receive extra help that eliminates the gap. Unless the law is changed, the $2,850 coverage gap is projected to more than double the cost that many seniors could have to pay for their prescriptions to $6,730 by 2016. House Democrats have offered an alternative plan to fix the new prescription drug program that is simple, affordable and reliable. It would simplify the Medicare drug benefit.
09.18.2006	Washington, D.C. - The Child Care Resource Center has been awarded a $5 million federal grant to provide Head Start services to 700 children and their families in the San Fernando Valley, Congressman Brad Sherman announced Monday. Another $5.5 million will go to Volunteers of America for Head Start programs in the East Valley and elsewhere. In the West Valley, Child Care Resource Center will expand to serve about 500 children in Chatsworth, Canoga Park, North Hills, Reseda, Granada Hills, and Northridge. It also will serve some Head Start students in Pacoima. The center already provides Head Start services to about 500 children and their families under the Los Angeles County Office of Education at schools in Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks, Encino, and Tarzana. The Volunteers of America program will cover about 700 children and their families in Castaic, Newhall, Sylmar, San Fernando and Pacoima. œHead Start has been helping preschool children and their families for more than forty years, Sherman said. œChildren and their families in the Valley deserve the quality services that have made Head Start a success story. œThe Child Care Resource Center looks forward with great anticipation to extending the quality Head Start services we have provided to families for the past 12 years, said Stacy Miller, the centers vice president. Under the expanded program, the centers staff will concentrate on providing education, health, mental health, nutrition and other services to Head Start families. Classes will be in operation 4 to 5 days a week with children attending 3.5 hours each day.

08.31.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday said Iran must suffer the consequences for defying a United Nations deadline for freezing its nuclear program. The United Nations Security Council three months ago gave Iran an August 31 deadline to stop enriching uranium, a process that can produce material for atomic weapons. Sherman said the Security Council should impose stringent economic sanctions, and the United States should embargo all Iranian goods, punish American companies with subsidiaries operating in Iran, and enforce a law against foreign firms that invest in Iran’s energy sector. “It is highly unlikely that the Bush administration can pass significant sanctions. Bush's repeated failure to link the Iran issue to our positions on issues of great import to Russia and China means these two countries have inadequate incentive to support serious sanctions,” said Sherman. “The U.S. should remain ready to negotiate and be willing to offer improved relations if Iran abandons its nuclear weapons program and its support for terrorists,” he added. Sherman is a senior member of the International Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee.
08.25.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Friday urged Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to deny permission for former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to visit Washington. Sherman, a member of the International Relations Committee and the ranking Democrat on the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee, is a critic of Irans ties to terrorists and a proponent of strong sanctions to deter Tehrans nuclear program. The text of the letter is pasted below and attached. August 25, 2006 The Hon. Condoleezza RiceSecretaryUnited States Department of State2201 C Street, NWWashington, DC 20520 VIA FACSIMILE RE: Visa Application of Former Iranian President Dear Secretary Rice: It has come to my attention that the State Department has received an application for a visa from former Iranian President Mohammad Khatami to visit the United States. While I understand he has been invited to speak at the National Cathedral at the behest of the Center for Global Justice and Reconciliation, a visit by the so-called reformist president would no doubt be utilized for maximum propaganda benefit by the Iranian government in the current standoff over Irans nuclear program. Moreover, Khatami was the president of a country labeled the number one state sponsor of terrorism by the State Department every year during his presidency. We can certainly discuss to no end the degree to which Khatami œthe reformist may have wanted to change his countrys policies. But Khatami showed no interest in curtailing his countrys support for terrorism during his tenure as president, and certainly has not shown any now. He was and is a strong proponent of Iranian government material support for such terrorist organizations as Hezbollah, HAMAS and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Terrorist activity, including providing material support for terrorist organizations, is grounds for denying a visa. I suggest that Mr. Khatami should not be granted a visa as he was in effect one of the worlds top financiers of terrorist organizations while president of Iran. I would also suggest that, should you decide to process Mr. Khatamis application, he and any members of his delegation should be fingerprinted and photographed, given a rigorous interview, and their names sent through the myriad terrorist and security databases by consular, DHS, law enforcement and intelligence community officials. In short, Khatami and his delegations should be forced to undergo every security precaution that is taken with every Iranian national, many of them relatives of my constituents, who seeks to come to the United States. Moreover, these procedures should not be expedited for Khatami and his delegation. In conclusion, Madam Secretary, I respectfully request that you 1) deny Khatamis application for a visa; 2) should you decide to further process the applications of Khatami and his delegation, ensure that they are subjected to all security procedures to which Iranians are normally subjected; and 3) ensure that these procedures not be expedited for the benefit of Khatami and his delegation. Thank you very much for your attention to this matter and I look forward to your reply. Sincerely, BRAD SHERMANRanking MemberSubcommittee on International Terrorismand Nonproliferation
08.22.2006	Washington, D.C. - Saying it is œhigh time to call Irans bluff, Congressman Brad Sherman pressed Tuesday for strict economic sanctions if Iran refuses to meet an August 31 deadline for suspending its nuclear enrichment program. Sherman is a senior member of the International Relations Committee and the ranking member of the Terrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee. œIt is clear that the Iranian government has no intention of suspending enrichment by August 31, as required by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1696, Sherman said. After 11 weeks of delay, Iran formally responded Tuesday to a United Nations incentives package aimed at persuading Tehran to suspend uranium enrichment. Iranian officials offered what they called a "new formula" to resolve the dispute, but they have repeatedly expressed determination to push ahead with their nuclear program. œThe Iranian tactic is always to offer a glimmer of hope that some settlement can be achieved, and threaten all kinds of counter-measures if sanctions are imposed, Sherman said. œFor the past four years, Iran has played that game. It is high time the Security Council and concerned countries call their bluff unless Iran verifiably suspends enrichment efforts. œIt is time for the Security Council to ready a package of tough economic sanctions should Iran fail to do anything short of a full suspension by August 31. It also is time for the Bush administration to start using the tools at its disposal. It is time for the United States to impose an embargo on all Iranian goods, severely punish any American companies with subsidiaries operating in Iran, and actually enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act by imposing sanctions on foreign firms which invest in Irans energy sector. œThe U.S. should remain ready to negotiate with the Iranian government, and we should be willing to offer improved relations with Iran should Tehran agree to abandon its nuclear weapons program and its support for terrorists, Sherman said. œAt this point, however, Iran must be forced to take such discussions seriously. Right now, it is just a game for them, and we should stop playing.
08.17.2006	Washington, D.C. - President Bush on Thursday signed legislation authored by Congressman Brad Sherman that names a San Fernando Valley post office for the great UCLA basketball coach, John R. Wooden. œCoach Wooden is a man who has meant so much to basketball players, fans, to sports in general, and especially to those of us who have been his neighbors in the San Fernando Valley for these three decades, said Sherman, who attended UCLA during the Wooden era. œCoach Woodens leadership was not just on the court. He inspired so many by his testament to leadership, to success, to dedication, and to sportsmanship, Sherman said of the coach and author whose many books include The Pyramid of Success and Wooden on Leadership. The presidents signature was the final step in enacting into law the legislation that was introduced by Sherman on December 18, 2005. The House passed the bill on April 5, and the measure was approved by the Senate on August 2. Naming federal buildings is how Congress honors distinguished Americans whose achievements warrant lasting recognition. Wooden, 95, lives in Encino in Shermans congressional district. The Encino post office was named in 2002 for the late Los Angeles Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn. Coach Woodens daughter, Nancy Muehlhausen, lives in nearby Reseda, where the post office at 7320 Reseda Boulevard will be named the Coach John Wooden Post Office. Wooden, who retired in 1975, coached the Bruins to 10 national titles, including seven in a row. Before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history, he was a standout player for Purdue University and led the Boilermakers to a national championship in 1932. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Under Woodens guidance, the Bruins set all-time records with four perfect 30-0 seasons, 88 consecutive victories, 38 straight NCAA tournament victories, 20 PAC 10 championships. The post office will be dedicated to Wooden at a ceremony on his 96th birthday, October 14, 2006.
08.03.2006	Washington, D.C. - Legislation proposed by Congressman Brad Sherman to name a San Fernando Valley post office for legendary UCLA basketball coach John R. Wooden passed the Senate and was sent to President Bush on Wednesday night. The House passed Shermans bill on April 5 and sent it to the Senate. œWe are proud to recognize one of our Valley neighbors, the greatest coach of all time in any sport, Sherman said. œCoach Wooden has been deeply involved in the local Valley community and has inspired young and old. Wooden, 95, lives in Encino in Shermans congressional district. (The Encino post office was named in 2002 for Chick Hearn, the late Los Angeles Lakers sportscaster.) The coachs daughter, Nancy Muehlhausen, lives in nearby Reseda, where the post office will be renamed the Coach John Wooden Post Office. Naming federal buildings is how Congress honors distinguished individuals whose achievements warrant lasting recognition. Wooden coached the Bruins to a record 10 national titles before he retired in 1975. A mentor to his players and an inspiring example for all, Wooden shared his insights in numerous books, including The Pyramid of Success and Wooden on Leadership. œCoach Wooden taught the fundamentals of success on and off the basketball court, said Sherman, who attended UCLA between 1972 and 1975 during the Bruin basketball heyday and saw Wooden lead the team to two national championships, one in the coachs final season. Wooden played for Purdue University before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.
07.28.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman will host a town hall meeting on August 24 at Reseda High School. The congressman will discuss ways Democrats in Congress are working to provide a new direction for America. In many ways, we are headed the wrong way. Rising gas and health care costs are taking a toll on family budgets. The wages of many middle class families have not kept pace with inflation. Many families struggle to pay the rising price of a college education with less help from the federal government. At a time when Americans in uniform are making the greatest sacrifices imaginable for our country, Congress and President Bush have repeatedly passed tax cuts benefiting only the wealthiest tax payers “ the resulting deficits threaten to bury future generations in debt. Congressman Shermans popular town hall meetings often attract crowds of several hundred constituents. They are an opportunity for San Fernando Valley residents to hear a report from Sherman and for constituents to ask questions about federal and community issues. Shermans district office staff will be on hand to help constituents having problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. Free parking and refreshments will be available. Shermans congressional district includes roughly half of the San Fernando Valley. He sits on the Financial Services, International Relations and Science committees. Date: Thursday, August 24, 2006Time: 7:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.Location: Reseda High School 18230 Kittridge St., Reseda
07.26.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved and sent to the Senate bipartisan legislation by Congressmen Brad Sherman and John Shadegg to fund joint research by Americans and Israelis into alternative energy sources. œCutting-edge research by top scientists from the United States and Israel could reduce our reliance on foreign oil by promoting more efficient uses of traditional energy sources and by developing energy alternatives, Sherman said. The Shadegg-Sherman legislation would establish in the Department of Energy an International Energy Advisory Board to advise the secretary on the $20-million-a-year grant program authorized by the bill. The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act would encourage cooperation on research, development, and commercialization of alternative energy, improved energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. The bill received an important boost when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert commended the idea during a May 24 address to a special joint session of Congress. The United States and Isr ael, Olmert said, œshare a desire for energy security. The legislation would œincrease efforts to find advanced scientific and technological solutions designed to develop new energy sources, the prime minister added. Sherman called the prime ministers comments œa welcome contribution to the important discussion about how we can reduce our reliance on foreign oil. Sherman was the lone sponsor of the legislation in the last Congress, and reintroduced the bill with Shadegg earlier in this session of Congress. The measure would build on existing joint research efforts by the United States and Israel which already have yielded scientific breakthroughs in the fields of life sciences, medicine, bioengineering, agriculture, biotechnology and communications.
07.26.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday said efforts by President Bush to improve enforcement of the Freedom of Information Act have fallen short and he urged Congress to strengthen the law. œCompliance with the law remains spotty, Sherman said, œand the sad reality is that some agencies sometimes stonewall legitimate requests for public information, he told the House Government Reform Subcommittee on Government Management, Finance, and Accountability. The president last December 14, at an Oval Office ceremony attended by Sherman, signed an executive order requiring agencies to designate a senior official to oversee compliance with FOIA. Testifying before the House panel, Sherman said, œWe must do more to ensure that government is open to all the people, and that reporters and others who request information get timely responses. News organizations and ordinary citizens still face far too many bureaucratic backlogs and administrative hurdles to obtain information. Sherman is the primary Democratic sponsor of two pieces of legislation he offered along with Congressman Lamar Smith. Their Open Government Act would give agencies less leeway to avoid a 20-day time limit for determining whether to comply with a request for records. The existing law waives the deadline if an agency encounters unspecified œunusual circumstances. The Smith-Sherman legislation would remove the waiver unless disclosure within the 20-day time limit would endanger national security, divulge personal or proprietary information or would be illegal for other reasons. Another provision would make agencies in more instances pay legal costs related to efforts to pry open records, such as when courts overturn agency decisions to turn down information requests. Sherman also is the sponsor of the Faster FOIA Act along with Congressman Smith. That measure would establish an advisory commission of experts and government officials to study what changes in federal law and federal policy are needed to ensure more effective and timely compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.
07.19.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday joined Israeli Ambassador Daniel Ayalon at a rally to show solidarity with Israel as intensified fighting with Hezbollah guerrillas entered its second week. œThe Hezbollah terrorists bankrolled by Iran have a sordid history of inciting violence against Israel, Sherman said. œWe have to hammer it home again and again that the current Israeli response is not just a response to one incident one week ago, but to continued terrorist activity against Israel by Hezbollah and Hamas and their masters in Tehran. The rally was held as Congress offered support for Israel's response to Hezbollah missile attacks on targets in northern Israel and the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers that sparked the latest clash. A House resolution introduced Tuesday condemns Hezbollah for œengaging in unprovoked and reprehensible armed attacks against Israel on undisputed Israeli territory. The measure also supports œIsraels right to defend itself, including the right to conduct operations in Israel and in the territory of nations which pose a threat to it. At the rally in Washingtons Freedom Plaza, Sherman also rebutted calls for the release of women and minors held by Israel on terrorist charges. œTerrorist organizations have increasingly used minors and women to perpetrate suicide attacks, he said. Among many examples, Sherman said, was a woman arrested in 2001 for the bombing of a Sbarro pizza restaurant in Jerusalem that killed 15 people, including seven children, and teenagers caught carrying pipe bombs and attempting suicide attacks. An Israeli prison spokeswoman, Orit Stelster, said 64 women in Israeli jails œhave blood on their hands.
07.13.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday said Israeli military strikes against Lebanon were a measured reaction to the kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers, and he blamed Hezbollah sponsors in Iran for trying to provoke war in the Middle East. œThe kidnapping of two Israeli soldiers and the death of eight others in this latest outrage is an act of war by Hezbollah against Israel. It was unprovoked, vicious, and designed to further destabilize the situation in the Middle East, Sherman said during an appearance at the National Press Club with Israeli Ambassador Daniel Ayalon. œThe Israeli response is not just a response to this incident, but to continued terrorist activity against Israel by Hezbollah, Sherman added. œViewed in the wider context “ six years of continued Hezbollah aggression notwithstanding Israels withdrawal from Southern Lebanon “ the response is hardly disproportionate. In fact, no one can rightly say Israels response is disproportionate unless they think Israel should be doing more. At some point, Israel had to say enough is enough. Sherman, a senior member of the House International Relations Committee, also said Iran cannot escape responsibility. œThis is not only an act of war by Hezbollah, but an act of war by proxy by Iran, he said. The links between Hezbollah and the regime in Tehran are well documented. Hezbollah was created by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, and it receives most of its external support from the Iranians. œIt is highly unlikely that such a provocative act would be undertaken without the knowledge and approval of people at the highest levels of Irans government, Sherman said. The attack on Israel on Wednesday, Sherman said, was foreshadowed by a warning on Tuesday by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Israel would be hit by an "explosion" of Muslim anger. œThe fury of Muslim nations is getting more intense. It is likely to reach an explosion point soon. If this day arrives, the shockwaves of this blast will not be restricted within our regional boundaries and will strike the supporters of this fake regime.
07.12.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday blamed Iran for a border raid conducted by Hezbollah that triggered a swift Israeli military reaction in southern Lebanon and an intense search for two kidnapped Israeli soldiers. œThis is not only an act of war by Hezbollah, but an act of war by proxy by Iran, said Sherman, a senior member of the House International Relations Committee. The links between Hezbollah and the regime in Tehran are well documented. Hezbollah was created by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, and it receives most of its external support from the Iranians. Because Hezbollah is a proxy for Iran, major operations such as the kidnapping of Israeli soldiers normally would be approved or even planned by Tehran. œIt is highly unlikely that such a provocative act would be undertaken without the knowledge and approval of people at the highest levels of Irans government, Sherman said. The attack on Israel on Wednesday, Sherman said, was foreshadowed by a warning on Tuesday by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad that Israel would be hit by an "explosion" of Muslim anger. Ahmadinejad said: œThe fury of Muslim nations is getting more intense. It is likely to reach an explosion point soon. If this day arrives, the shockwaves of this blast will not be restricted within our regional boundaries and will strike the supporters of this fake regime.
07.11.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Tuesday that residents near the Burbank airport will receive an additional $2 million to muffle jet noise. The new grant from the U.S. Transportation Department is in addition to $10 million Burbank was awarded two months ago. The new grant brings to $57.2 million the total amount of federal funds awarded to insulate more than 1,000 homes near the Burbank airport, Sherman said. The airport authority has added $13.3 million in local funds, and has committed another $1.9 million to pay for noise-abatement work. With additional local funds, the latest $2 million federal grant will enable the airport authority to reduce the impact of jet noise at another 52 homes. œThis is an investment that will improve the quality of life for residents who live near the airport, Sherman said. Measures to make homes quiet enough for normal conversations may include replacing doors and windows, insulating attics, improving weather stripping and sound proofing, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Homeowners interested in finding out if their homes are eligible to benefit from the noise mitigation program may visit the congressmans web site at www.BradSherman.house.gov Under earlier noise mitigation projects, Luther Burbank Middle School, Glenwood Elementary, Mingay (Burbank Adult School), and St. Patrick's School were insulated.
07.05.2006	San Diego, CA. - Congressman Brad Sherman said a House hearing here Wednesday accentuates the Bush administrations failure to secure our borders and shines a spotlight on Republican Party discord that has blocked immigration reform in Congress. œOur colleagues look to our committee to oversee our State Department and foreign policy. What we are giving them instead is the first in a series of traveling political shows designed to inflame partisanship, Sherman said. œThe only upside is that these hearings will illuminate that the party that controls Washington, D.C., has failed to control our border “ or to adopt a regular legal system for America to get the number of workers it needs legally. Sherman is a senior Democrat on the House International Relations Committee and the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation. The panel follows the hearing at the Imperial Beach Boarder Patrol Station in San Diego with another on Friday in Laredo, Texas. œThese are the first in a series of immigration field hearings of various House committees mandated by the Republican leadership, Sherman said, œI am surprised that Republican leadership has embarked this a series of dog and pony shows. Theyve got some really mangy dogs and some really ugly ponies after six mangy years of failure to control our borders, and six ugly years of failure to devise and enforce an immigration policy. The Republican majority in Congress, Sherman noted, had thwarted proposals by Democrats to enhance border security that would have added 6,600 more Border Patrol agents, 14,000 more detention beds, and 2,700 more immigration agents along our borders. Sherman commended Congressman Edward R. Royce, the subcommittee chairman, who has been bipartisan in his approach to the important foreign policy matters. œIt is a shame that these field hearings have been swallowed up by the House Republican leaderships national political agenda. Here is the congressmans opening statement: Opening statement of Congressman Brad ShermanRanking Minority MemberHouse International Relations CommitteeSubcommittee on International Terrorism and NonproliferationBorder Vulnerabilities and International Terrorism, Part IJuly 5, 2006 San Diego, California Mr. Chairman, let me first thank you for graciously allowing members of Congress not on the International Relations Committee to participate in these hearings. I do not agree with us holding these hearings. But you have, as always, conducted yourself in a bipartisan fashion notwithstanding the partisan rancor surrounding the nation-wide gaggle of field hearings that have been scheduled on immigration-related issues this summer. I want to commend your work on the Committee; we have had a good working relationship, and I know that will continue. This is a critically important topic, but the way these hearings are designed, we simply are out of our jurisdiction. As an International Relations panel, we have jurisdiction over the foreign affairs agencies and laws of the United States. We oversee the Department of State, not the Department of Homeland Security. The subject of these hearings is more in the portfolio of the Homeland Security Committee, Appropriations Committee, Intelligence Committee or Judiciary Committee. I want to know how terrorists intend to get to our homeland to attack us. I want to know what we are doing diplomatically to urge other countries to improve their own immigration controls, so that Mexico, South and Central America are not gateways for terrorists. But we are not in Washington hearing from the State Department and foreign policy experts, as is the purpose of our committee. We are in San Diego and Laredo this week to hear from Border Patrol, from county Sheriffs, from border security and immigration experts and a citizen activist, focusing on matters that are within the jurisdiction of other committees. Our colleagues look to our committee to oversee our State Department and foreign policy. What we are giving them is the first in a series of traveling political shows designed to inflame partisanship. The only upside is that the hearing will illustrate that the party which controls Washington has failed to control our border “ or to adopt a regular legal system for America to get the number of workers it needs legally. I know that was not your intention when you planned these hearings, but thats what we have here, pursuant to the game plan of Republican House Leadership. That said, let me highlight what I view as the failings of current border control policy. On several occasions, we on this side of the aisle have tried to get more Border Patrol officers, more detention space for those awaiting deportation and, often working together with Republican colleagues from border states, on getting more help for the states and local government to beef up security. But, to paraphrase our colleague Tom Tancredo, we have had to drag the President kicking and screaming for more resources for border security. Since 2001, more than 2 million undocumented immigrants have come to the US. Notwithstanding the fact that he signed the 911 Act mandating that 2,000 more Border Patrol agents be added every year from 2006-2010, Bush requested only 210 in his 2006 budget. Just 210. The 2007 funding bill for Homeland Security would provide only an additional 1,200 next year. Even with the additional 1,000 agents provided recently by the emergency Katrina appropriations bill, we are still 800 agents short of the 4,000 promised in the 911 Act for 2006 and 2007. Canada is a known entry point for terrorists “ there is no need to rely on shadowy intelligence there. Remember the Millennium Plot to blow up Los Angeles Airport on New Years Eve? There is one agent for every five miles along our northern border “ a whopping total of 952 agents watch that expanse. Thats actually a decrease from the 1008 on that frontier in 2005. And then there is catch and release. Currently, we cannot simply return non-Mexicans who are detained crossing the Southern border. Mexico wont take them. These Other Than Mexicans (OTM) have to be held until we can process them back to their countries of origin, usually by giving them a plane ticket. But we dont have the detention space to hold them. About 165,000 OTMs were caught by border patrol in 2005. Seventy percent of these OTMs end up on the streets. Most dont bother to appear for their deportation hearing. And yes, some are from so-called œcountries of interest, where terrorism is a known threat. The 911 Act called for 8,000 more detention beds in 2006, a modest increase in itself. The 2006 funding bill only provided for 4000. A Democratic proposal to get to the 8,000 was rejected. The 2006 and 2007 funding bills combined leave us 5,000 beds short of what was called for by the 911 Act. I invited Sheriff Baca to appear today. One, hes my sheriff and I didnt want San Diego and Webb Counties to have all the fun. I wanted to hear about his Departments innovative Terrorism Early Warning Group, which is a model for federal-local cooperation. But he will also testify to how we have completely ripped off states and local governments by failing to take care of our own federal responsibility: the detention of criminal illegal immigrants. George W. Bush has repeatedly tried to cut or eliminate SCAAP “ the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program “ which reimburses states for the costs associated with jailing undocumented criminals. Since its the feds who didnt stop these criminals from entering our country in the first place, it should be our responsibility to help the states and local governments cover the costs of incarcerating them. Finally, I would like to conclude by saying that we simply cannot get a handle on border security until we figure out our broader immigration policy. We have two signs up on our border “ œHelp Wanted and œKeep Out. As long as we have a need for foreign labor, and lack a policy to address that need, we will have chaos at the border, illegal immigration and human smuggling. Will terrorists blend in with those entering our country illegally? Will they use the same smuggling networks to gain entry? It is certainly possible. With a normalized process for temporary workers and legal immigrants, we can focus our manpower and resources on those who are real threats to our security. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I also thank the witnesses and especially my colleagues for attending.
06.30.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said Friday that hearings next week on border security are political theater intended to paper over Bush administration failures and Republican Party dissension that has stymied immigration reform in Congress. œThe only good thing you can say about the Bush administration immigration policy is that it may not be as big a failure as its Iraq policy, Sherman said. Sherman is the ranking Democrat on the House Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, which has scheduled hearings next Wednesday in San Diego and Friday in Laredo, Texas. œThis Republican road show cant cover up six years of failure by the Bush administration to control our borders and the inability of Republicans in Congress to pass legislation to stem illegal immigration and regularize the immigration process, Sherman said. œThe hearings are an all-out effort by House Republican leadership to divert attention from their awful record. Sherman commended Congressman Edward R. Royce, the subcommittee chairman. He said he respects Royce and has a good working relationship with the chairman, who has been bipartisan in his approach to the important foreign policy matters that come before the panel. œIt is a shame that these field hearings have been swallowed up by the House Republican leaderships national political agenda.
06.29.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House voted Thursday for a proposal by Congressman Brad Sherman to expand long-term substance abuse programs for adolescents at Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace. The project was included in a bill to fund the Justice Department and other federal agencies that the House approved and sent to the Senate. Phoenix Academy is the only facility in Los Angeles County that provides long-term residential treatment for teenagers with drug and alcohol problems. The funding would be used to increase the number of residential beds for those who cannot afford specialized treatment. œIt is only because of committed legislators like Congressman Sherman that Phoenix Academy is able to help hundreds of Los Angeles most needy youth and their families each year, said Elizabeth Stanley-Salazar, managing director of Phoenix Academy in Lake View Terrace. œBecause of Brad Shermans support, Phoenix Academy is going to be able to help many more troubled teens turn their lives around. Phoenix Academy is part of a network of 29 drug-treatment facilities throughout California and others across the country. The academys one-year residential substance abuse treatment program is followed by a year of aftercare for adolescents with drug, alcohol, and behavioral issues. The substance-abuse treatment is combined with a course of academic study coordinated with the residents home school and directed by experienced, state-licensed teachers. Sherman made helping the academy a top priority in a request to the House Appropriations Committee. Along with Reps. Jane Harman and Grace Napolitano, Sherman sought $1.5 million, but the exact amount of the federal contribution wont be specified until later in the congressional appropriations process. œI believe that when the process is completed we will secure significant federal funds, Sherman said.
06.28.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday welcomed High Tech High School freshman Rosalyn Herrera to the Capitol, where her first-place entry in the San Fernando Valley Congressional District Student Art Competition went on public display. Her winning entry, entitled simply Green, is a color photograph of a young woman with long green hair posing in front of a wall covered by a leafy vine (see below). Irina Hermosa, also a student at High Tech High School in Lake Balboa, was the second place winner. Her photograph of a grasshopper on a white iris is on display in Shermans Capitol Hill office. Talina Gharibibian of AGBU Manoogian-Demirdjian School in Canoga Park, took the prize for third place. Her painting is on display at the congressmans Sherman Oaks office. œThe artwork shows off the strong talents of students in the San Fernando Valley, Sherman said. The congressman personally congratulated Herrera during a ceremony in the Capitol corridor where her work is now on a year-long display with paintings and photographs by other first-prize winners from around the United States. œI commend all the students who entered the competition and congratulate the winners, Sherman said. œOur excellent panel of judges also has my appreciation. The competition took place on May 13 at the Canoga Park Youth Art Center. The contest was open to all high school students in his congressional district. The judges chose from entries representing seven Valley high schools. The contest was judged by Stewart Vaughn, executive director of the Canoga Park Youth Art Center, Katie Himes of Time Warner Cable, and Dick Cooper of Telesis Community Credit Union. Herrera won a trip to Washington for her and her parents to take part in the unveiling ceremony. Southwest Airlines provided three round-trip tickets, and Time-Warner paid other travel expenses.
06.22.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday joined Israeli Ambassador Daniel Ayalon at a Capitol Hill press conference to congratulate Israels disaster relief and first-aid organization on its admission to the International Red Cross. œThis long overdue but historic moment in Middle East humanitarian cooperation ends nearly 60 years of injustice, said Sherman, who cosponsored congressional resolutions that pressed the case for Magen David Adoms acceptance into the International Red Cross. After a 57-year struggle, the International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent rejected Muslim group objections and voted to accept both the Palestinian Red Crescent and Magen David Adom as full voting members. To help pave the way for MDAs acceptance, the international organization, known around the world for its red cross and red crescent symbols, created an optional, third emblem, a red crystal, that could stand alone or frame the Israeli society's red star. American Friends of Magen David Adom, Sherman noted, has provided vital support for the MDA, and raised more than $90 million in the past five years to support its team of trained volunteer and professional medical responders.
06.20.2006	Washington, D.C. - A House committee on Tuesday approved bipartisan legislation by Congressmen Brad Sherman and John Shadegg to fund joint research by Americans and Israelis into alternative energy sources. œCutting edge research by top scientists from the United States and Israel could hold the key to reducing our reliance on foreign oil, Sherman said. œWe must promote efficient use of traditional energy sources as well as research into alternative energy sources, he added. The House Energy and Commerce Committee approved the Shadegg-Sherman legislation that would establish in the Department of Energy an International Energy Advisory Board. The board would advise the secretary on the seven-year, $20-million-a-year grant program authorized by the legislation. The committee action clears the way for consideration by the full House of the measure to encourage cooperation on research, development, and commercialization of alternative energy, improved energy efficiency, or renewable energy sources. The bill received an important boost last month when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert commended the idea during an address to a special joint session of Congress. Olmert said the United States and Israel œshare a desire for energy security. The United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act, the prime minister added, would œincrease efforts to find advanced scientific and technological solutions designed to develop new energy sources. Said Sherman, œThe comments by the prime minister were a welcome contribution to the important discussion about how we can reduce our reliance on foreign oil. The legislation builds on existing joint research efforts by the United States and Israel which already have made possible scientific breakthroughs in the fields of life sciences, medicine, bioengineering, agriculture, biotechnology and communications.
06.14.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday approved legislation to set aside $500,000 for safety improvements along the Metro Orange Line busway and $100,000 for a new transit center at California State University , Northridge. Congressman Brad Sherman won funding for the San Fernando Valley projects in a bill that the House passed 406 to 22 and sent to the Senate. œThe Orange Line has been a tremendous success story for the Valley and for the thousands of riders who board the buses every day, said Sherman, an early champion of the busway. œSafety improvements will burnish the busways reputation for efficient, economical service. The Orange Line has set ridership records that dramatically exceed estimates by transit planners. In May, almost 22,000 passengers a day on average boarded buses at stops along the 14-mile route between North Hollywood and Warner Center. Extending the Orange Line to Chatsworth, Sherman said, should be the next step. After the busway opened last October, however, there were several collisions involving cars whose drivers ran red lights or disobeyed other traffic rules. Bus drivers also have reported more than 2,300 near misses at busy intersections, according to the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. In order to make accidents less likely, the new funds Sherman secured will be used for various safety improvements. They include embedding bright lights in the busway pavement that will flash when buses approach and cross intersections. The lights will be installed where the Orange Line crosses Chandler near Ethel Avenue; Burbank and Fulton; Van Nuys Boulevard; Sepulveda Boulevard; Woodley Avenue; Balboa Boulevard; White Oak Avenue; Victory and Topham; Victory and Mason; Victory and Desoto, and at a mid-block pedestrian crosswalk at Lankershim Boulevard. In the past, Sherman won more than $4.2 million in federal funds for Orange Line projects, including $1.9 million for bike paths along the route; $1 million for the Warner Center transit hub; $836,000 to build an Orange Line extension and bus shelter at Pierce College, and $500,000 for park-and-ride facilities along the route. In this years transportation funding bill, Sherman won an additional $100,000 for a transit center at Cal State, Northridge. The new facility will be located at the main west campus entrance and provide a central location for commuters using mass transit to get to and from the university.
06.14.2006	Washington, D.C. - A House panel on Wednesday voted to block the Export-Import Bank of the United States from funding a proposed railroad that would link Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan while bypassing Armenia. The Export-Import bank is the federal government agency that helped finance the ill-conceived Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline to transport crude oil from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Congressmen Brad Sherman joined Congressmen Joseph Crowley and Edward R. Royce in offering the amendment. Their proposal would advance regional cooperation and economic integration for the South Caucasus by preventing taxpayer dollars from being spent on efforts that would deliberately exclude Armenia from commercial opportunities. Sherman said the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has been blunt about the bid to cut off Armenia. œIf we succeed with this project, the Armenians will end in complete isolation, which would create an additional problem for their future, their already bleak future, Aliyev said. According to preliminary estimates, the suggested railroad construction project in question would cost at least $400 million to $800 million and take years to construct. The existing line, which crosses Armenia, is already in working condition and could be operational in a matter of weeks at very little cost. Moreover, Ambassador-Designate Anne Derse recently indicated that the proposed railroad would œnot be beneficial to regional integration¦ By approving the amendment, the House Financial Services Committee sent a strong message that it does not endorse attempts to undermine U.S. policy goals in the region.
06.14.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday approved $150,000 sought by Congressman Brad Sherman for the Jewish Home for the Aging in Reseda. The funds were set aside in legislation to support Department of Housing and Urban Development programs. The appropriation will help finance renovation of a residential care building to bring the structure into compliance with modern safety and health codes. Sherman has been a long-time supporter of the Jewish Home for the Aging. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, he helped secure $720,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to repair the facilitys Alzheimers Pavilion. œWe are delighted to be the recipients of these much-needed funds. They will enable the Jewish Home to renovate an existing residential care facility to better accommodate seniors who need improved handicapped accessibility. As a result, we will be able to shelter and care for more of the elderly who are most vulnerable; those with cognitive impairment and physical handicaps, said Molly Forrest, Chief Executive Officer of the Los Angeles Jewish Home for the Aging. œWe thank Representative Brad Sherman and the federal government for their assistance, she added. œI have visited the Jewish Home for the Aging at least 20 times and I am happy to help the home and its residents, Sherman said. œSince its founding in 1912, the home has fulfilled its important mission of providing a place to live for those in the most vulnerable years of their lives. The appropriations bill now goes to the Senate.
06.14.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House agreed Wednesday to let Burbank have until next year to commit to spend $750,000 that Congress already set aside for the Burbank Empire Area Transit Center. Burbank has completed preliminary designs for the station and is undertaking state and federal environmental assessments, but the city needs additional time to explore land acquisition costs and study railroad right-of-way issues. The Burbank provision was in a report accompanying legislation that now goes to the Senate. Altogether, Sherman has secured almost $1 million for the project. The $750,000 that the House Appropriations Committee agreed to extend was initially included in a transit package approved for 2004. He won another $209,000 in a transportation funding bill Congress passed last year. The transit and bus facility near Burbank Airport would expand an existing Metrolink and Amtrak rail platform to include ticket kiosks, bicycle parking, restrooms, and bus loading areas. The facility would consolidate transit services now provided by four regional bus routes, the Metrolink commuter train, Amtrak, one local shuttle service and the airport. The new facility would consolidate stops for the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the BurbankBus service and streamline transfers to the nearby airport and train station. The project would expand mass transit alternatives for passengers traveling to and from the airport, and also would improve transit services for commuters who work at nearby retail and office developments. Sherman told House Appropriations Committee leaders that the project is œextremely important, and he said the city deserves an extension of time to complete the station design and to obligate the funds.
06.13.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman will host a town hall meeting on Middle East policy on July 6 at Temple Judea in Tarzana. Ehud Danoch, Consul General of the State of Israel, will be the congressmans special guest at the forum on recent developments in the Middle East, including terrorism, legislation affecting the region, and efforts by Iran to develop nuclear weapons. Both Congressman Sherman and Consul General Danoch will be available to respond to questions. Free parking and kosher refreshments will be provided. Congressman Sherman is a senior member of the House International Relations Committee. He is the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation. Sherman is a leading advocate of strong bonds between the United States and Israel. Date: Thursday, July 6Time: 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.Location: Temple Judea, 5429 Lindley Ave., Tarzana
06.07.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday urged students and parents who borrowed for their childrens college costs to consider consolidating student loans before July 1, when interest rates are expected to rise to their highest level in six years. Consolidation allows students and parents to combine separate loans and lock in a low fixed interest rate that could save borrowers thousands of dollars over the life of their loans. œInterest rates are expected to jump on July 1, Sherman said. œSmart borrowers could save thousands of dollars by locking in existing rates before then. Each year on July 1, the U.S. Department of Education adjusts the interest rates on outstanding college loans. Interest rates on student loans are expected to rise to more than 7 percent, and interest rates on parent loans are expected to rise to 7.8 percent. Student borrowers who consolidate outstanding loans before July 1 would be eligible for an interest rate as low as 4.75 percent, which would save nearly $3,500 over the life of the average loan. Parent borrowers who consolidate before July 1 would be eligible to lock in a rate as low as 6.1 percent over the life of their loan. Students and parents who have taken out at least one loan through the federal government's Federal Family Education Loan, Direct Loan or Perkins Loan programs may be eligible to lock in a low fixed rate if they consolidate by June 30. Borrowers with a direct loan from the Department of Education may call 1-800-557-7392 or apply on-line. Students, college grads or parents with bank loans may contact one of the companies that own or service the loans. For answers to frequently asked questions about consolidating student loans, click on https://www.house.gov/sherman/student_loan_consolidation.shtml . Rising interest rates, along with escalating tuition and shrinking student aid, have made college harder to afford for millions of Americans. Earlier this year, the Republican-led Congress cut $12 billion from federal student aid programs in order to help finance tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. The cut aggravated financial woes for students at four-year public colleges where average tuition and fees have risen 40 percent since 2001. The typical student borrower now graduates from college with a record $17,500 in education debt.
05.31.2006	Sherman Oaks, CA. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday welcomed an announcement by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today that the United States is willing to join multilateral talks with Iran over its nuclear programs if it suspends nuclear activities. The ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, Sherman noted that the new approach could be tailored to include the right mix of carrots and sticks aimed at inducing the Iranian regime to forgo development of nuclear weapons. œI have been a strong supporter of increased sanctions, which President Bush has not aggressively pursued, Sherman said. œThe U.S. has not taken the steps needed to increase the diplomatic and especially economic pressure on the Iranian regime. Apart from Iraq, that failure is probably the No. 1 foreign policy mistake of the Bush administration. œThat being said, I also favor laying out, especially for the benefit of the Iranian people, a series of actions the U.S. is willing to take in response to positive actions by the Iranian government to improve relations between Washington and Tehran “ the ˜carrots necessary for an effective policy. œI have also believed all along that, under the right conditions, the U.S. can deliver these messages directly to the Iranian regime. We should not be afraid of talking with the Iranians directly so long as we can verify that they have indeed suspended enrichment activities. Sherman noted that even if Tehran rejects this latest offer, with this proposal the U.S. is taking steps to demonstrate to the rest of the world that we are willing to be flexible and are willing to explore positive inducements for the Iranian regime, as well as punitive measures. œIt is clear that if we are going to lead the world down the right path in confronting Iran, the discussion cannot just involve punitive measures. We have to be willing to move in the other direction too.
05.24.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday approved an additional $2 million for a project championed by Congressman Brad Sherman to restore Bull Creek channel in the Sepulveda Basin. Sherman secured the $2 million in addition to $2 million that Congress set aside last year for work in the Anthony C. Beilenson Park in the Sepulveda Basin. Altogether, Sherman has won congressional approval of almost $6 million for the Sepulveda Basin, including $1.2 million for wildlife area restoration and $750,000 for Beilenson Park improvements. œThis important project will restore wildlife and native habitat in the creek channel, and add new trails and a pedestrian bridge to give park visitors better access to the area, Sherman said. The Army Corps of Engineers project also will help prevent future damage caused by intense flooding in the area around Bull Creek. The funding was included in an Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act passed by the House of Representatives and awaiting consideration by the Senate. The 2,097-acre Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area is a federally-owned flood control area. The Sepulveda Basin includes the largest recreation area in the Valley. The federal government leases 1,527 acres to the city of Los Angeles for recreational facilities that include a wildlife area, Woodley Park, Beilenson Park, three golf courses, Hjelte Sports Field, tennis courts, Balboa Recreation Center, a dog park, cricket fields, the Japanese garden center and numerous playing fields, picnic areas and other amenities.
05.24.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman of Sherman Oaks on Wednesday congratulated Sherman Oaks songbird Katharine McPhee, the American Idol finalist who made even Simon Cowell coo as she won legions of fans across America. œShe was McPhabulous. America caught McPheever, Sherman said. Sherman said he would present McPhee a flag that flew over the U.S. Capitol on May 24, the day of the American Idol finale. œShe took us all for a wonderful ride to somewhere over the rainbow, he added, œand in the process she burnished the reputation of the San Fernando Valley as the home of Americas top entertainment talent. From now on, Kat is what people will think of as the ultimate Valley girl. She made us proud. McPhee, 22, is a graduate of Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks. She survived elimination rounds on the popular Fox television show that attracted millions of viewers for the American Idol season finale.
05.24.2006	Washington, D.C. - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert on Wednesday lauded legislation by Congressmen Brad Sherman and John Shadegg to promote U.S. and Israeli cooperation on efforts to develop alternative energy technology. Sherman and Shadegg introduced bipartisan legislation to encourage companies and academic researchers from the close allies to work together on alternative energy projects. In his address to the special session of Congress, Olmert said the United States and Israel œshare a desire for energy security. The prime minister added that the United States-Israel Energy Cooperation Act would œincrease efforts to find advanced scientific and technological solutions designed to develop new energy sources. œThe comments by the prime minister are a welcome contribution to the important discussion about how we can reduce our reliance on foreign oil, Sherman said. œHis remarks underscored the importance of achieving energy independence by promoting efficient use of traditional energy sources as well as research into alternative energy sources. The Shadegg-Sherman legislation builds on existing bi-national efforts which have already made possible many scientific breakthroughs in the fields of life sciences, medicine, bioengineering, agriculture, biotechnology and communications. The measure would create a $20 million annual grant program administered by the Department of Energy to provide grants to joint ventures. Sherman introduced the same legislation as the sole sponsor in the last Congress, and reintroduced the legislation with Shadegg earlier in this Congress.
05.23.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Tuesday approved bipartisan legislation cosponsored by Congressman Brad Sherman to end all direct aid to the Hamas-run Palestinian Authority until Hamas renounces violence and recognizes Israels right to exist. œHamas ran on a platform of ethnic cleansing and genocide, pushing all Jews in the Middle East into the Mediterranean. They won on that platfom, and for us to see dollars going to a regime which is bent on ethnic cleansing and genocide would be absolutely absurd, Congressman Brad Sherman said. œThis legislation ensures that necessary humanitarian assistance is still able to reach the Palestinian people, while keeping American taxpayer dollars out of the hands of terrorists, he added. Sherman joined with Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and others in introducing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act. The House today approved the measure 361 to 37. Similar legislation is currently under consideration by the Senate. œMy fear is that the Senate will ultimately pass a weaker bill than we did in the House today, commented Sherman, who had fought to strengthen the House bill further in committee. The measure strengthens the current ban on contact with and funding of a Hamas-led government, while preserving necessary humanitarian aid to the Palestinian people. The prohibition will remain in place until the president can certify that the Palestinian Authority is not controlled by a terrorist group, and until Hamas agrees to fight terrorism, recognizes Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and accepts all previous agreements with Israel. Hamas -- designated a terrorist group by the United States, the European Union, Japan, Australia and many others -- won control of the Palestinian legislature during the January 2006 Palestinian elections. Hamas charter calls for the destruction of Israel and rejects any peaceful solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The new Palestinian legislature and Hamas Prime Minister have since approved the governments slate of new cabinet ministers, comprised almost entirely of Hamas members.
05.17.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, a leading proponent of hybrid cars that use less gasoline and reduce pollution, said on Wednesday that plug-in hybrids with rechargeable batteries may be the next wave in automobile technology. œWith gas prices soaring to more than $3 a gallon, Sherman said, œfuel-efficient, environment-friendly cars that get more than 100 miles per gallon could be the cars of the future. Sherman is a member of the House Science Committee, which is considering legislation to offer incentives to encourage the development of the next generation of hybrid vehicles. The committee heard Wednesday from a panel of experts, including Dr. Andrew Frank, a professor at the University of California, Davis. He said plug-in hybrids œtake hybrid technology and make it more efficient with a better transmission, bigger battery pack and smaller engine. Frank, director of the universitys Hybrid Electric Research Center, said plug-in hybrids could roll off assembly lines before the end of the decade. Since plug-in hybrids combine traditional internal combustion motors with battery power, motorists have the option of going on long trips of unlimited range or using electric power for shorter commutes. The batteries are charged at night using a standard household outlet. If a trip drains the batteries, the car automatically switches over to gasoline power. Electric energy is cheaper than gas, according to the California Cars Initiative, a group of entrepreneurs, environmentalists and engineers. CalCars calculated that electricity costs about one-third the current price of gasoline. Congress Sherman previously sponsored legislation to encourage hybrid vehicles that was incorporated into a highway bill Congress passed last year. It cleared the way for California and other states to let hybrid vehicles use car-pool lanes on freeways when the state determined there was extra capacity.
05.17.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday questioned Treasury Secretary John Snow about whether the Treasury Department is developing a plan to address a sudden, precipitous decline in the value of the U.S. dollar. Testifying before the House Financial Services Committee, Snow cavalierly dismissed the possibility as œremote. œYoure so confident in the smooth realignment of currencies that theres no reason to have a plan for a sudden and catastrophic decline in the dollar? Sherman asked. Snow said, œI think that prospect is remote. Sherman has urged Treasury and other government officials to address the possibility, acknowledged by many economists, that the dollars value could drop “ perhaps by as much as 20 percent in one week or 50 percent in one month “ due to balance of payments problems and other factors. Sherman has drafted and soon will introduce legislation to create a high-level task force to identify effective policies to put a brake on such a massive decline in the dollar and policies to deal with the aftermath of any major decline. œIf you had asked most foreign and defense policy experts prior to September 11 how likely it would be that a group of less than 20 al Qaeda terrorists could kill 3,000 people in the United States, the answer would have likely been ˜remote, Sherman said. œI believe that there is a less-than-remote possibility that the dollar will decline over the next several years. The question is by how much, and how quickly? œFor relatively little in expenditures of money and time, we should be able to come up with a plan to address sudden dollar decline, Sherman added. œWe seem to have an aversion to planning for traumatic events “ be they nuclear terrorism or an economic catastrophe. I see little downside to being prepared.
05.15.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Monday welcomed the State Department decision to upgrade diplomatic relations with Libya and remove it from a list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that placed sanctions on the Libyan regime and prevented deepening relations between the U.S. and Tripoli. Sherman, the ranking member of the House International Relations Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, was notified in advance of the State Department announcement. Sherman said the move is a logical step in the rehabilitation of the Libyan regime in response to Tripolis continued implementation of its decision to abandon nuclear and other unconventional weapons programs and its support for terrorism. He also said that the Libya experience is a model for other countries. œThe change we have seen in Libya is proof that multilateral sanctions do work, Sherman said. œWhen the international community is united and focused, punitive economic and political measures will have a positive effect. When a country like Libya takes the desired steps, the U.S. will likewise improve relations with that country. œIt seems every day I read articles in major newspapers, written by high profile foreign policy experts, arguing that sanctions will not work and that we need to ˜engage countries like Iran, Sherman added. œBut that is at best only half the equation “ Libya shows that a mix of carrots and sticks is the right approach to countries that support terrorism or seek to develop nuclear weapons. The State Department announcement sets off a 45 day review period, during which Congress will fully examine the decision and confirm that Libya has indeed given up support of terrorist organizations. Sherman also urged that Libya fully implement any settlement imposed by U.S. courts for the 1986 La Belle disco bombing, in which 3 American servicemen were killed and dozens wounded. œThe U.S. government has taken a tough stand on compensation for Lockerbie victims, but a relatively hands-off approach to La Belle victims, Sherman said. œI hope that the State Department will ensure that these victims and survivors are compensated.
05.10.2006	Washington, D.C. - In recognition of his ongoing support of the effort to rid the world of polio, Rotary International on Wednesday presented Congressman Brad Sherman with its Polio Eradication Champion Award. The United States has contributed $1.2 billion since the mid-1980s to eradicate polio. œGreat strides have been made, Sherman said. œNow, we must finish the job. Other members of Congress recognized this year were Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Elizabeth Dole, Barak Obama, Jack Reed, and Congresswoman Kay Granger. Polio, an infectious disease that can cause paralysis and sometimes death, still strikes children, mainly under the age of five, in parts of Africa and Southeast Asia. There is no cure for polio, so the best protection is prevention. For as little as 60-cents worth of vaccine, a child can be protected against this crippling disease for life. When Rotary began its polio immunization program in the mid 1980s, approximately 1,000 children were infected by this crippling disease every day. At the end of 2005, less than 2,000 children contracted polio all year, down from the 350,000 cases estimated in 125 countries in 1988. The Americas were declared free from polio in 1994, as well as the Western Pacific region in 2000, Europe in 2002 and most recently Egypt and Niger, in February of 2006. Once eradicated, polio will be the second disease after smallpox ever to be eliminated worldwide.Despite this success, the final phase of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative is proving to be the most challenging. Reaching every child with the vaccine, including those in high-density populations and in areas of civil unrest, maintaining political commitment in the face of a disappearing disease, and a multi-million dollar funding gap are the major obstacles that still must be overcome. Rotary International is the worlds first and one of the largest volunteer service organizations with 1.2 million members in more than 160 countries. In 1985, Rotary created PolioPlus and set one of the most ambitious goals in the history for global public health: to immunize the children of the world against polio.
05.08.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Monday that the Burbank airport will be awarded $10 million to shield nearby homes from the roar of jet engines. œThis is an investment that will improve the quality of life for residents who live near the airport, Sherman said. The $10 million grant from the U.S. Transportation Department will enable the airport authority to add hundreds of homes to the more than 1,000 that already have been insulated to reduce the impact of jet noise. Measures to make homes quiet enough for normal conversations may include replacing doors and windows, insulating attics, and improving weather stripping, ventilation and air conditioning systems. Homeowners interested in finding out if their homes may benefit from the noise mitigation program may visit the congressmans web site at www.BradSherman.house.gov Under earlier noise mitigation projects, Luther Burbank Middle School, Glenwood Elementary, Mingay (Burbank Adult School), and St. Patrick's School were insulated. The new grant brings to $55.2 million the total amount of federal support for noise mitigation awarded to the Burbank airport, Sherman said. The airport authority has added $13.3 million in matching funds, and has committed another $1.9 million to pay for noise-abatement work not covered by federal grants.
05.02.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced that U.S. Postal Service officials agreed to his request to extend final collection times at key San Fernando Valley post offices. The changes, which will help local businesses and others, were made in response to concerns Sherman expressed at meeting on February 23 with the Postal Service district manager. œI relayed concerns I had heard from many constituents about slow mail delivery. I am pleased that the Postal Service took the situation seriously and responded to my request, Sherman said. Among the service improvements, the drop-off deadline was extended to 8:00 p.m. at the Van Nuys Post Office, located at 15701 Sherman Way just west of the 405 Freeway. The Van Nuys Post Office is processing mail deposited later than anywhere in the Los Angeles area, according to the Postal Service. The deadline was 7:00 p.m. (The Los Angeles Airport Station Post Office is open for business until 11:00 p.m., but 7:00 p.m. is the last mail collection at that location.) The Postal Service also extended the deadline until 7:00 p.m. at the Canoga Park Post Office at 8201 Canoga Ave. near Roscoe Boulevard, and at the Woodland Hills Post Office at 22121 Clarendon St. near Topanga Canyon Boulevard. The last drop off at those offices had been 5:00 p.m. First-class mail sent from one Valley address to another usually is delivered the day after it is postmarked, so adding an extra hour or two each day for individuals and businesses to drop off mail will mean the mail reaches its destination sooner. In practical terms, the extended mail deadlines could be important to someone trying to avoid being charged a penalty on a credit card bill, to a business sending out hundreds of letters, or to a bride inviting people to her wedding.
04.28.2006	Washington, D.C. - I commend the efforts of Ambassador Crumpton and the Sate Department for its work on the 2005 Country Reports. This years report is an improvement over previous efforts. I note that once again Iran was identified as the most active state sponsor of terrorism, as it has for every year of the last decade. The report notes Irans support for Hezbollah, for Palestinian terrorist organizations and, most disturbingly, for jihadists in Iraq. The report describes Irans failure to prosecute senior members of al Qaeda it has œin custody. I am afraid the treatment of these œdetainees is far more disturbing than this report would lead the reader to believe. The Iranians have by most reports not detained these individuals, which include one of bin Ladens sons, to any meaningful degree. At most, they are under a form of house arrest that still allows them to communicate with fellow operatives. The man responsible for May 2003 attacks on a Western housing compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was in Iran at the time he planned those attacks. I once again call on the Bush administration to develop a strategy for reining in Irans support for terrorism as well as its nuclear weapons program. I am also concerned by the lack of negative information included about certain countries. The narrative on Saudi Arabia , for instance, is devoid of any criticism at all. While Saudi Arabia certainly works closely with the United States when it is in its interest to do so, it is a country that has failed to crack down on its own citizens support for terrorist organizations which attack Israel. The report also ignores significant Saudi support for jihadist activities and extremists in South Asia. Another example is the reports failure to mention Pakistans relationship with terrorist organizations fighting in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Indeed, while Pakistan is home to or a source of support for several terrorist organizations, the government is apparently without fault, according to the State Department. I call on the State Department to improve this report, as I have in the past, by emulating the State Departments Human Rights Country Reports, which include negative information about some of our closest allies. It will make this report a much more effective tool.
04.21.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, a member of the Asia Subcommittee of the House International Relations Committee, on Friday issued the following statement in reaction to statements made at a meeting between President Bush and President Hu Jintao of the Peoples Republic of China: œRegrettably, twice yesterday President Hu made clear that he has not changed his bellicose approach to the issue of Taiwan. Instead of dialogue, President Hu again offers nothing but ultimatums. President Hu said: ˜We will never allow anyone to make Taiwan secede from China by any means. œTaiwan is a friend of the United States and is a democracy. The future of Taiwan should be decided solely by the people of Taiwan. œChinas failure to stand with the United States against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, particularly with regard to Iran, stands in sharp contrast with Americas successful efforts to persuade Taiwan to remain non-nuclear.
04.19.2006	Washington, D.C. - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congressman Brad Sherman that a wave of baby boom retirements increases the importance of shrinking the federal budget deficit. The new Fed chairman also asserted, contrary to claims by the Bush administration and so-called supply-side economists, that "tax cuts do not wholly pay for themselves." "I am heartened." Sherman said, "by the chairman's honesty about soaring budget deficits and the reality check he provides on Bush administration fantasies about the budgetary impact of tax cuts for the wealthy." "The Fed chairman is above politics and he can speak his mind," Sherman added. "He can tell us what we should already realize, and that is that we have to cut spending if we can, and cannot continue to cut taxes on those at the very top if we are going to get rid of this federal budget deficit." Bernanke's statements came in a letter to Sherman, a member of the House Financial Services Committee. The letter elaborated on issues raised during testimony to the committee last February 15 during the new chairman's first appearance before Congress. Sherman asked Bernanke, "Can we count on your leadership, as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, to have as one of your top priorities the reduction of the nation's budget deficit?" Bernanke replied:" ...­[R]educing the federal deficit is very important, especially in light of the need to prepare for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. I urge the Congress to proceed on that effort in a timely manner and to pay particular attention to how its decisions on spending and tax programs will affect the U.S. economy in the long run." He deferred to Congress regarding specific tax and spending programs. Sherman also questioned Bernanke about tax policy. "I interpret your position to be that tax cuts do not pay for themselves, and that they do indeed reduce revenues," the congressman said. Bernanke said, "[U]nder normal conditions, tax cuts do not wholly pay for themselves." Here is the text of the chairman's letter to Sherman: BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THEFEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WASHINGTON D.C. 20551 Ben S. Bernanke CHAIRMAN April 18, 2006 The Honorable Brad Sherman House of Representatives Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Congressman: I am pleased to enclose my responses to the additional questions you submitted in connection with the February 15, 2006, hearing before the Committee on Financial Services, I am also enclosing for your reference a copy of my March 21 letter to you with responses to the questions you asked during that hearing. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Sincerely, Enclosures Chairman Bernanke subsequently submitted the following in response to written questions received from Congressman Brad Sherman in connection with the February 15, 2006, hearing before the Committee on Financial Services: 1) The Deficit Can we count on your leadership, as the new Chairman of the Federal Reserve, to have as one of your top priorities the reduction of the nation's budget deficits? Further, in the pursuit of this policy, are you willing to seek restraints on unwise tax cuts, as well as restraints on federal spending? As I stated in my hearing on the Monetary Policy report, I believe that reducing the federal deficit is very important, especially in the light of the need to prepare for the retirement of the baby-boom generation. I urge the Congress to proceed on that effort in a timely manner and to pay particular attention to how its decisions on spending and tax programs will affect the U.S. economy over the long run. However, I also believe that in my role as Chairman of the Federal Reserve, I should not be involved in making recommendations to the Congress regarding specific tax and spending programs. Those decisions are best made by elected officials. From both your written and oral testimony before the Committee, I interpret your position to be that tax cuts do not pay for themselves, and that they do indeed reduce revenues. Is that indeed your position? Tax cuts that reduce marginal tax rates will likely improve the efficiency of the economy and boost overall economic activity. Because they increase economic activity, cuts in marginal tax rates typically lead to revenue losses that are smaller than implied by so-called static analyses, which hold economic activity constant. However, under normal conditions, tax cuts do not wholly pay for themselves. Tax cuts tend to boost both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Aggregate demand may be stimulated by a tax cut, for example, if consumers spend a portion of the increase in their after-tax income. The demand side effects initially boost economic activity and revenues. But these effects dissipate over time as the economy's self-correcting forces and monetary policy work to bring the economy back to its sustainable potential. Cuts in marginal tax rates may have important supply-side effects by altering the incentives to work, save, and invest. In contrast to the aggregate demand effects, the supply-side effects will tend to build over time as capital accumulates and the added labor supply is absorbed. The economic literature supports the idea that work effort, saving, and investment respond to tax incentives but the sizes of the responses are in some dispute. One principle that economists generally agree upon is that the higher the initial level of the tax, the greater the economic benefit of a marginal tax rate reduction. Together, the demand-side and the supply-side impacts of a tax cut on activity imply that some portion of the initial drop in revenues following a tax cut will be offset, though the degree of offset depends critically on the nature of the tax cut and the behavioral responses that it induces. 2) Currency Values--Emergency planning In light of the fact that the United States consistently runs an enormous trade deficit, one would expect the inevitability of an eventual realignment in the value of the dollar in relation to other currencies. The reevaluation will have major impacts on our economy and, if this realignment does not occur smoothly and gradually, it is likely to have disastrous consequences both at home and abroad. While recognizing the Treasury's primary role in currency valuation, could you please address the following questions: What mechanisms can be established by the United States, and our trading partners, to react in a timely manner to address a sudden and precipitous decline in the value of the dollar? Would you envision such a response plan to mirror the "circuit breakers" that various securities and commodities markets currently employ when there is a sharp decline in the value of a particular security or commodity? What effect would a dramatic drop in the value of the dollar likely have on interest rates and the rate of inflation, both short- and long-term? Is the Federal Reserve prepared to react quickly and take those steps necessary to protect the U.S. economy -to the extent possible and practicable--in the event of a precipitous decline in the value of the dollar? Are we currently working with our trading partners to assure that there is indeed a smooth currency realignment and not a crash of the dollar? Has the Federal Reserve taken any steps to analyze what can be done in the event of a collapse of the dollar? Finally, those concerned with the U.S. trade deficit urge that the U.S. balance the Federal budget, encourage private saving, and seek to eliminate barriers to export. What other steps do you believe the United States can do to reduce our trade deficit? As I noted previously, current U.S. policy is to let markets determine the exchange value of the dollar. This is consistent with the general view that the economy performs best when markets are allowed to freely set prices of goods, services, and assets. It is very difficult to gauge the appropriate level of the foreign exchange value of the dollar and, accordingly, it is difficult to determine whether movements in the dollar are inconsistent with market fundamentals and/or pose concerns for the smooth operation of our nation's economy. For these reasons, stated U.S. policy has been generally not to intervene in currency markets except to counter disorderly market conditions. On occasions in the past, the United States has coordinated intervention with foreign governments, and such operations could be undertaken in the future if circumstances merited such actions. Officials in the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve maintain close and frequent contact with their counterparts abroad. Additionally, issues of global imbalances, external adjustment, and currency movements often have been discussed at international meetings of policymakers. Several measures have been identified which could contribute to the smooth adjustment of external imbalances, including increases in household and public saving rates in the United States, growth-enhancing structural reform in some of our industrial-country trading partners, greater reliance by emerging-market economies on domestic spending rather than exports as a source of growth, and increased flexibility of exchange rates in countries where such flexibility is lacking. Dismantling barriers to trade, and, more generally, keeping protectionism in check, would also be valuable. Such measures would be helpful, especially if the shift the relative attractiveness of U.S. and foreign assets in the eyes of global investors. Although U.S. trade deficits cannot continue to widen forever, these deficits need not engender a precipitous decline in the dollar, nor should such a decline, were it to occur, necessarily disrupt financial markets, production, or employment. The dollar fell sharply in the mid-1980s without triggering substantial economic dislocations. More generally, research by Federal Reserve staff has indicated that, historically, significant declines in currency values have not led to material increases in interest rates and inflation, nor to sharp declines in economic activity, in industrial economies. However, the possibility of a future disruptive correction of the U.S. trade deficit cannot be ruled out. The best way to protect the U.S. economy from such an event is to continue policies designed to maintain the stability of the financial system and the flexibility and resilience of the economy. Regardless of the future evolution of the trade balance, the Federal Reserve will work to ensure that prices remain stable and employment remains close to its maximum sustainable level. In the past, the Federal Reserve has reacted quickly to events that threatened those objectives, and it is prepared to [do] so in the future as well.
04.17.2006	Van Nuys, CA. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Monday told Angelenos how to find out about old undelivered tax refunds, as many rushed to meet the deadline for filing tax returns. According to the latest figures, over 6,435 Angelenos were sent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) refunds which remain undelivered. While the average undelivered IRS refund nationwide is $871, one Southern Californian stands to collect $60,632. Sherman will cosponsor legislation which will require the IRS to do more to find the owners of undelivered refunds nationwide. œTax refunds belong in the taxpayers pockets, not in a dark corner of the Treasury, said Sherman. Sherman, a certified public accountant who formerly served as Chairman of Californias Board of Equalization, spoke at the Van Nuys IRS Office to educate the public about tax refunds they may be due to receive, but that remain undelivered. In 2005, the IRS received more than 223 million individual tax returns and issued over 109 million refunds. The IRS saw 14,012 undeliverable refunds in California, averaging $884. Many undeliverable refunds result as college students file their taxes while away at school and move before the refund arrives. Deaths and marriages also may result in checks being returned to the IRS. In many cases, people may not know they are due a tax refund, perhaps because the IRS finds a math error in the taxpayers favor. A list of taxpayers from the Los Angeles area and statewide who are owed refunds is available on Shermans website, www.BradSherman.house.gov Shermans website lists taxpayers names, cities, state and zip codes. Though not required to search for persons entitled to undeliverable tax refunds, the IRS does note in their records which taxpayers did not receive their refund. If the individual files a new tax return within three years, the IRS will try to associate the old refund with the new return. Despite those efforts, IRS officials say they interpret federal law as prohibiting them from listing prospective recipients on their website and from actively seeking the owners of undelivered tax dollars. Waiting and hoping for taxpayers to surface isnt enough for Sherman, and that is why he is urging the IRS to step-up efforts to deliver over $12.4 million in unclaimed tax refunds to taxpayers in California. Nationwide, there are almost 84,290 unclaimed tax refund checks, totaling over $73 million. œCertainly, the IRS should take stronger steps than it currently does to reach taxpayers whom the government owes money. The information I announced today is one way to do that, Sherman said. Sherman has consistently cosponsored the IRS Refund Accessibility Act, which would direct the IRS to post the list on its website, and to direct the IRS to search out taxpayers who are owed a refund.
04.12.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday condemned Irans announcement that it has enriched uranium in defiance of international demands for a nuclear freeze, and he renewed calls on the Bush administration to tighten sanctions against Tehran. œIt is time for the Bush administration to exercise some real diplomatic leadership on this issue and convince other countries to stop doing business as usual with Iran until it abandons its program to enrich uranium, Sherman said. œIt is time for President Bush to stand up to corporate power, Sherman added. œNot only should we stop doing business with Iran through foreign subsidiaries, we should make it clear to China that their continued access to U.S. markets is dependent on cooperation on the issue. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted on Tuesday that Iran had joined the group of nuclear nations. On Wednesday, the deputy head of Iran's atomic energy organization said Iran informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that it will start operating 3,000 centrifuges by the end of this year 2006. Two-thousand centrifuges operating for one year are enough to produce the enriched uranium needed for a nuclear weapon. The House International Relations Committee recently approved Iran sanctions legislation containing a provision authored by Sherman which would end the practice of American companies doing business in Iran through foreign subsidiaries. Sherman is the ranking Democrat on the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation. The congressman has been a leading advocate for tough diplomatic and economic pressure on Tehran due to its nuclear program and its support for nuclear technology.
04.05.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday passed legislation authored by Congressman Brad Sherman to name a post office for John R. Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who lives in the San Fernando Valley. œWe are proud that one of our Valley neighbors is the greatest coach of all time in any sport, Sherman said after the House approved his legislation to name the Reseda Post Office the Coach John Wooden Post Office. Wooden, 95, lives in Encino in Shermans congressional district. His daughter, Nancy Muehlhausen, lives in nearby Reseda. (The Encino post office was named in 2002 for Chick Hearn, the late Los Angeles Lakers sportscaster.) Naming federal buildings is how Congress honors distinguished individuals whose achievements warrant lasting recognition. The bill now goes to the Senate, where it is expected to win easy passage. As UCLA fell to Florida on Monday in the national title game, Wooden watched from a hospital where he had been admitted on Sunday. Sherman wished him a speedy recovery. Wooden coached the Bruins to a record 10 national titles before he retired in 1975. A mentor to his players and an inspiring example for all, Wooden shared his insights in numerous books, including The Pyramid of Success. œThe coach taught the fundamentals of success on and off the basketball court, said Sherman, who attended UCLA in the early 1970s during the Bruin basketball heyday. Wooden was a standout college player at Purdue University before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach.

03.30.2006	Washington, D.C. - A House panel Thursday approved legislation by Congressman Brad Sherman to name a Valley post office after UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a long-time San Fernando Valley resident. œWith the Bruins once again in the Final Four, the timing couldnt be better, Sherman said. œIts now time for full-court press to dunk this bill through the last legislative hoops. The House Government Reform Committee advanced the measure to name the Reseda Post Office the Coach John Wooden Post Office. The quick committee passage came after every member of the California congressional delegation cosponsored Shermans bill. The action leaves the legislation on the verge of final passage by the full House. As a UCLA undergrad in the early ˜70s, Sherman watched the Wooden-coached Bruins win Pac-10 and NCAA championships each season while he was a student. Under the guidance of Coach Wooden, the Bruins had four perfect 30-0 seasons, 88 consecutive victories, won 38 NCAA tournament games, 20 Pac-10 championships, and 10 national championships, including a winning streak of seven in a row. Off the court, Wooden shared his wisdom in books like Wooden on Leadership, My Personal Best: Life Lessons From an All-American Journey and Inch and Miles: The Journey to Success. œThe coach taught his players and all of us how to be successful in life, Sherman added. Wooden was a standout college player at Purdue University before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history. Wooden was named College Player of the Year in 1932, when he starred on the Boilermaker team that won the national championship. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Wooden, 95, has lived in Encino for the past three decades. (The Encino Post Office was named for Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn in 2002.) Woodens daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen, lives in Reseda.
03.21.2006	Washington, D.C. - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke on Tuesday issued the following written response to a question from Congressman Brad Sherman about a loophole that lets commercial firms buy industrial banks. œ¦The Board has encouraged Congress to review the exemption in current law that allows a commercial bank to acquire an FDIC-insured industrial bank (ILC) chartered in certain states without regard to the limits Congress has established to maintain the separation of banking and commerce, he said. œContinued exploitation of the ILC exception threatens to remove this important policy decision from the hands of Congress, Bernanke added. Sherman said, œChairman Bernankes statement clearly urges Congress to prevent regulators from mixing banking and commerce. He clearly urges us to close the ILC loophole which Wal-Mart is trying to exploit to get into the banking business. Sherman is a member of the House Financial Services Committee. He asked Bernanke about Wal-Mart at a Feb. 15 hearing. The full statement from Bernanke is attached. Bernanke on Wal-Mart
03.16.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said Thursday that House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert falsely lumped him among supporters of the so-called Patriot Act. œThe speaker should be ashamed of his ham-handed effort to score cheap political points, Sherman said. In a March 13 press release, Hastert listed Sherman among Democrats who the speaker claimed had œvoted with House Republicans in favor of the Patriot Act. In fact, Sherman last Dec. 14 voted with the majority of House Democrats against reauthorizing the law. Over the opposition of Sherman and others, the conference committee report was adopted in the House by a vote of 251 to 174. It later passed the Senate and was signed by President Bush. On March 7, Sherman voted for a separate bill that made minor improvements intended to safeguard civil liberties of certain individuals and businesses investigated under the controversial anti-terrorism law. That bill passed 280 to 138. The vote on the civil liberties provisions was the vote Hastert, in a fit of partisan zeal, mischaracterized. During debate on those technical changes, in fact, House Judiciary Chairman James F. Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) emphasized that separate legislation renewing the Patriot Act already had cleared Congress and stressed that the measure before the House only added protections for civil liberties.
03.16.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman will host a town hall meeting on Sunday, March 26 at Reseda High School. These popular meetings often attract crowds of several hundred constituents. They are an opportunity for San Fernando Valley residents to hear from Sherman on the Medicare prescription drug program, Social Security, education, and other issues before Congress. The congressman also will take questions from constituents on other federal and community issues. Shermans district office staff will be on hand to help constituents having problems with federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration and Department of Veterans Affairs. Free parking and refreshments will be available. Shermans congressional district includes roughly half of the San Fernando Valley. He sits on the Financial Services, International Relations and Science committees. Date: Sunday, March 26, 2006Time: 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.Location: Reseda High School 18230 Kittridge St., Reseda
03.15.2006	Washington, D.C. - The House International Relations Committee on Wednesday passed legislation to curb development of a nuclear weapons program in Iran by tightening economic sanctions. The measure included a provision by Congressman Brad Sherman to prohibit foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations from conducting business with Iran. Current law prohibits American firms from undertaking most transactions with Iran, but some companies, including Halliburton, have used wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries to skirt the law. It is a disgrace that American companies have cynically used Bermuda-triangle style corporations to avoid our sanctions laws, Sherman said. œIt is high time that this practice was expressly outlawed. Shermans provision strengthened the sanctions bill that he originally cosponsored to reauthorize provisions of the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. The bill would make it more difficult for the administration to ignore violations, and require the president to apply sanctions unless he finds a vital national security interest to waive them. Since the sanctions law was enacted in 1996, there has been widespread investment in Irans energy sector in projects which could have triggered sanctions. Instead, both the Clinton and Bush administrations turned a blind eye to violations. The new measure would require the State Department to consider evidence of violations, and to explicitly decide whether violations occurred. The bill also would authorize assistance for democracy and human rights activists in Iran, another provision Sherman has strongly supported. This bill is an important first step in developing an effective Iran policy, Sherman said. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen this bill and our Iran policy overall. Sherman said he would propose a ban on all imports from Iran, seek to bar access to U.S. capital markets by firms that violate the law, and require the Bush administration to oppose World Trade Organization membership for Iran until it abandons its nuclear weapons program.
03.10.2006	WASHINGTON” Congressmen Brad Sherman and 38 other members of Congress on Friday told federal bank regulators that a bank owned by Wal-Mart would undermine the nations financial system. In a letter to Martin Gruenberg, acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the congressmen said Wal-Mart's application to open a bank in Utah should be rejected. œThe mixing of banking and commerce has been terrible for the Japanese economy, and it is a practice we should not start here, Sherman said. In the letter, the congressmen said, œWe have grave concerns about Wal-Marts record as a corporate citizen and believe its ownership of a bank will have a serious negative impact on local communities. œGranting Wal-Mart an industrial bank charter would violate long-standing U.S. policy¦of maintaining the separation of banking and commerce, the letter added. The congressmen also expressed concern that a Wal-Mart bank œcould threaten the stability of the nation's payments system," according to their letter. Losses to the FDIC, which insures bank deposits, would be crippling if Wal-Mart encountered financial troubles, the congressmen added. œConsider the consequences if Enron or WorldCom had owned a bank, they said. Wal-Mart is trying to open a so-called industrial loan bank, chartered and regulated by the state. The FDIC has agreed to hold public hearings on the application.
03.01.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday, speaking at a House hearing on the proposed takeover of terminal operations at six United States ports by a Dubai company, demanded that the UAE prohibit œcontributions by its citizens to Hamas and other organizations listed on the U.S. State Department terrorist list. Sherman also demanded that the state-owned Dubai Ports World, and the UAE cease participation in a boycott of Israel. œWe cannot even begin to consider allowing the UAE government to control several of our ports while the UAE openly facilitates financing terrorism, said Sherman. He said the UAE had permitted a œtelethon for terrorists, facilitated funding for the militant Hamas organization, and noted that emirate leaders had ties to Osama bin Laden. The Bush administration ignored a law requiring a review of security implications surrounding the ports deal, Sherman added. He blamed White House bungling for damaging U.S. relations with the Arab world, and asserted that the president and others are œnow engaged in a whitewash attempt to cover up their mistakes. He said he will propose legislation to block the takeover of American ports by any company owned by a foreign government unless that government fully cooperates in the war on terrorism and enforces laws against funding organizations on the State Department lists of terrorist groups.
02.25.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday helped mark the opening of a Lake View Terrace branch of the Pacoima Development Federal Credit Union. The congressman joined Los Angeles City Councilman Alex Padilla and leaders of the Valley Economic Development Center at an open house. A member of the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Sherman helped the credit union obtain its charter to serve the northeastern San Fernando Valley. œThe people of Pacoima and Lake View Terrace and the surrounding area deserve fair and reliable financial services, Sherman said. œI welcome the opening of the Lake View Terrace branch of an institution that is making a difference in the lives of Valley residents. With 130 members and more than $2 million in deposits, the credit union offers financial services to more than 200,000 residents in the northeastern San Fernando Valley, where predatory lenders once preyed on consumers. Before the credit union opened, financial services in the community were very limited. Area residents, including more than 18,000 people in Lake View Terrace, were forced to drive to financial institutions in Sylmar, Sunland or Sun Valley for basic banking transactions. Membership in the credit union is open to anyone who lives, works, runs a business, attends school, or worships in the region. A wide array of financial services is provided by the credit union, including car loans, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money orders, cashier checks, direct deposit, free check cashing and wire transfers. The credit unions main office is still under construction. A grand opening is expected later this year.
02.16.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday applauded a State Department proposal to devote $75 million to support democracy and human rights activists, labor unions and broadcasters trying to affect change in Iran. Sherman also renewed his calls for tough diplomatic and economic action aimed at the regime. œIt is important that we communicate with the Iranian people, and it is high time the Bush administration took this much-needed step, Sherman said, œbut it also is important that we couple this action with a credible drive to impose multilateral sanctions against Tehran. Sherman has called on the Bush Administration to enforce the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, which punishes foreign oil companies that invest in Iran. He has called on the Bush administration to push European and Asian allies to adopt their own sanctions against Iran. œA complete Iran policy will be a two-pronged effort, Sherman said. œIn addition to supporting democracy and human rights in Iran, we also must apply economic pressure on the government to dry up investments and deny technology to Iran. Sherman added that he hopes that legislation on Iran will be moving through the House of Representatives soon, and will include both Rices requested funding and provisions providing for enhanced sanctions against the Iranian regime. The House, meanwhile, on Thursday passed overwhelmingly a resolution condemning the government of Iran for violating its international nuclear nonproliferation obligations and expressing support for efforts to report Iran to the United Nations Security Council. Sherman joined Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and other colleagues on the House International Relations Committee in introducing the resolution. It condemns Irans failures to comply with its nuclear nonproliferation obligations.

02.15.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Wednesday that he has nominated outstanding Valley students for admission to the nations elite military service academies. œI am proud of these young men and women, and grateful for their willingness to serve our country at this critical time, Sherman said. Shermans nominees to the military service academies are: Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colo. Michael Ahn, Granada Hills; Earl Lo, Northridge; Bryant Mata, Northridge; Michael Schwartz, Northridge, and Brandon Scott, Chatsworth. Naval Academy at Annapolis, Md. Michael Ahn, Granada Hills; Bryant Mata, Northridge; Michael Maxwell, Burbank; Nadir Montano, Reseda; Michael Schwartz, Northridge, and Brandon Scott, ChatsworthU.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y. Michael Ahn, Granada Hills; Michael Kim, Northridge; Bryant Mata, Northridge; Michael Schwartz, Northridge, and Shant Shahnazarian, Northridge. Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, N.Y. Earl Lo, Northridge, and Bryant Mata, Northridge. The service academies decide which of the congressmans nominees to admit. Each academy generally is required to admit at least one of Shermans nominees, and due to the high quality of applicants from the Valley each academy usually admits two or three. Some applicants receive nominations to attend two or three different academies. If nominees are accepted by more than one academy, they decide which one to attend. An education received from one of the military academies is ranked among the best in the country. In addition to a rigorous academic curriculum, an academy education offers cadets extensive hands-on training and an opportunity to participate in varsity and intramural sports, music groups, and clubs. Cadets also must live under a strict, regimented personal and ethical code to develop the discipline necessary to become leaders in today's military.

02.06.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Monday criticized President Bushs proposed $2.7 trillion budget that the congressman said would shortchange ordinary Americans next year while giving more tax breaks to the rich. The budget deficit, meanwhile, was projected to soar to an all-time high of $423 billion by the end of this year, the administration projected. œBy squandering budget surpluses he inherited, Bush has turned lemonade into a lemon, Sherman said. œHe took a budget that was $236 billion in surplus the year before he took office and plunged it deep into a sea of red ink. The Presidents budget plan calls for $50 billion for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2007. The total 2007 funding for these conflicts is certain to be much higher. In 2005, the U.S. spent more than $105 billion; for fiscal 2006, the Bush administration is expected to ask for $70 billion, on top of $50 billion already provided by Congress in December for these two conflicts. œClearly, the president is understating the budget deficit in his 2007 budget by between $50 billion and $70 billion by asking us to believe that Iraq and Afghanistan will cost less than half in 2007 what they were in 2006 and 2005, Sherman said. Instead of restoring common-sense fiscal policies to stanch the deficit, the Bush budget blueprint for 2007 would sweeten tax breaks that would cost the Treasury an estimated $1.7 trillion over the next decade. Unless Congress blocks parts of the Bush budget, programs that would fall under the budget knife include education, local law enforcement, housing, transportation, pension security, and health care for senior citizens, veterans, the disabled and the poor. Altogether, Bush wants to scrap or make deep cuts in 141 programs. œBush wants most Americans to tighten their belts while he would let wealthy taxpayers and big corporations gorge on more tax breaks, Sherman said.

02.04.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday welcomed a United Nations nuclear watchdog agency vote to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council over Tehrans nuclear program. Sherman, however, predicted that China would use its permanent seat on the council to stymie any meaningful action against Iran. Beijing has extensive economic and diplomatic ties with Tehran. œIt is clear that China will defend Iran with its veto, so Iran knows it will not face any Security Council sanctions, said Sherman, a senior member of the House International Relations Committee. œWe need to subtly inform China that it cannot count on open access to the U.S. markets while it protects Irans nuclear program. Sherman added, œIt is time to take the Iranian nuclear threat seriously and for the Bush administration to show some backbone in dealing with Tehran. The presidents efforts in this area have been incredibly lame. This president has done nothing in five years to stop or even slow down Irans march toward nuclear weapons. A leading critic of the Bush administrations refusal to enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act, Sherman renewed his call for a total embargo on Iranian goods sold to the United States. (Americans spend some $150 million a year on Iranian products). While the Bush administration has been preoccupied in Iraq, Sherman said, Iran has long posed a greater threat to stability in the Middle East than Iraq under Saddam Hussein. He also warned of potential calamities far worse than the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks if Iran develops nuclear weapons and equips terrorists with easily concealable bombs. œWe need to act now, before Iran develops a nuclear bomb, before it arms terrorists with a weapon that could wreak unheard of havoc, said Sherman, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation.
02.04.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday welcomed a United Nations nuclear watchdog agency vote to report Iran to the U.N. Security Council over Tehrans nuclear program. Sherman, however, predicted that China would use its permanent seat on the council to stymie any meaningful action against Iran. Beijing has extensive economic and diplomatic ties with Tehran. œIt is clear that China will defend Iran with its veto, so Iran knows it will not face any Security Council sanctions, said Sherman, a senior member of the House International Relations Committee. œWe need to subtly inform China that it cannot count on open access to the U.S. markets while it protects Irans nuclear program. Sherman added, œIt is time to take the Iranian nuclear threat seriously and for the Bush administration to show some backbone in dealing with Tehran.

02.01.2006	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday joined colleagues in introducing legislation to rein in unethical lobbyists and reform the culture of corruption in the Republican-run Congress. œPeople are fed up. Enough is enough, Sherman said. œA stream of scandals involving Republican congressmen and Republican lobbyists has laid bare the ugly truth about how unethical lobbyists ply crooked congressmen with extravagant gifts and favors to get their way. The Open Government Act of 2006 is a reaction to a string of ethics controversies. Two months ago, eight-term California Republican Randy "Duke" Cunningham pleaded guilty to accepting $2.4 million in bribes, mainly from defense contractors. Other shoes are expected to drop in the wake of a guilty plea by the infamous Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was a close ally of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, who himself faces corruption charges in Texas. The ethics reform package would ban all gifts to members of Congress from registered lobbyists. It also would tighten laws against the practice of lobbyists paying for members travel. Former members of Congress and their staffs, as well as former executive branch officials, would be barred from lobbying for two years after they leave office --double the current one-year restriction. The bill also would toughen public disclosure requirements for lobbyists by requiring more information, accessible on the Internet, that would have to be filed quarterly instead of twice a year. Moreover, the measure would stiffen civil and criminal penalties for lobbyists who break the rules. The so-called K-Street Project, created by DeLay to stack lobbying firms with Republican loyalists, would be shut down. A new House Office of Public Integrity would audit compliance with lobbying disclosure rules.

12.19.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Monday that he introduced legislation to name a post office after legendary UCLA basketball coach John Wooden, a long-time San Fernando Valley resident. œPassing this bill through all the hoops in Congress should be a slam dunk, Sherman said. Sherman, who saw the Wooden-coached Bruins win Pac-10 and NCAA championships each season while he was a student at UCLA, introduced legislation to name the Reseda post office the Coach John Wooden Post Office. œI had the great privilege of watching John Wooden coach Bill Walton and the virtually invincible Bruins to one national championship after another after another in the early ˜70s, Sherman said. œThe coach led UCLA to victory so often that someone said he made the concept of the NCAA tournament a farce. Under Woodens guidance, the Bruins had four perfect 30-0 seasons, 88 consecutive victories, 38 straight NCAA tournament victories, 20 Pac-10 championships, and 10 national championships, including a winning streak of seven in a row. œThe sports columnist Jim Murray once said Coach Wooden was so square he was divisible by four, Sherman said, œbut the truth is his Pyramid of Success multiplied the talents of his players and others inspired by the coachs inspirational leadership. Off the court, Wooden shared his wisdom in books like Wooden on Ledership, My Personal Best: Life Lessons From an All-American Journey and Inch and Miles: The Journey to Success. œThe coach taught his players and all of us how to be successful in life, Sherman added. Wooden was a standout college player at Purdue University before he became the most successful coach in college basketball history. Wooden was named College Player of the Year in 1932, when he starred on the Boilermaker team that won the national championship. He is one of only three people enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as both a player and a coach. Wooden, 95, has lived in Encino for the past three decades. (The Encino post office was named for Lakers sportscaster Chick Hearn in 2002.) His daughter, Nancy Anne Muehlhausen, lives in Reseda.
12.14.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman at the White House on Wednesday commended President Bush for taking steps to improve public access to government records, but he said Congress should enact additional measures to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act. The president signed an executive order requiring agencies to designate a senior official to oversee compliance with the law that for 40 years has provided an important tool for reporters and citizens to obtain information about the government. The order also makes agencies establish service centers to streamline handling of requests for documents. œThe president has taken an important first step, but more needs to be done to assure timely access to government records, Sherman said. The primary Democratic sponsor of legislation with Congressman Lamar Smith, Sherman said Congress should enact key provisions of their bill. Under the Smith-Sherman Open Government Act of 2005, agencies would have less leeway to avoid a 20-day time limit for determining whether to comply with a request for records. The existing law waives the deadline if an agency encounters unspecified œunusual circumstances. The Smith-Sherman legislation would remove the waiver unless disclosure within the 20-day time limit would endanger national security, divulge personal or proprietary information or would be illegal for other reasons. Another provision would make agencies in more instances pay legal costs related to efforts to pry open records, such as when courts overturn agency decisions to turn down information requests. The current law makes agencies pay attorney fees when the news media or others who sought government records œsubstantially prevailed. Under the Smith-Sherman proposal, the definition of those eligible to recoup legal costs would cover any requestor who obtained a œsubstantial part of requested relief, or caused an agency to change its position on the disclosure of records.
12.03.2005	VAN NUYS - Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday saluted more than 50 soldiers of the 311th Corps Support Command Army Reserve unit based in Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. œI am grateful for the service and sacrifices made by citizen soldiers called up for active duty, Sherman said. Sherman participated in a Welcome Home Warrior-Citizen awards program in Van Nuys. He presented a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to Major General Paul Mock, the former commanding general of the 311th COSCOM. Command Sgt. Maj. Michele Jones, the highest ranking enlisted member of the Army Reserve and the first woman to hold this position, also participated in the ceremony. The award program was established to honor soldiers deployed to the Middle East after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
11.29.2005	SHERMAN OAKS - Congressman Brad Sherman said home buyers in the San Fernando Valley will benefit from a higher cap announced Tuesday on the value of mortgages that may be purchased by government-backed enterprises designed to encourage home ownership. œThis is a step in the right direction, but many more middle-class homeowners in Southern California and other high-priced housing markets deserve a fairer shake, Sherman said. The cap on mortgages that may be purchased by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the government-chartered mortgage enterprises, will rise from $359,650 to $417,000 for 2006, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight announced. The annual adjustment will make an estimated 466,326 more homeowners eligible for lower interest rates. The new cap on so-called œconforming loans still falls far short of the $600,000 median price for a single-family home in the San Fernando Valley in October, when single-family homes and condominiums tied record highs in both categories, according to the Southland Regional Association of Realtors. Sherman, a member of the House Financial Services Committee, has championed legislation to raise the œconforming loan ceiling for borrowers in Southern California and other areas with above-average home prices. The federally-chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow more cheaply than rival mortgage finance companies. The rate on "conforming loans" they may purchase from private lenders is usually at least a 0.25 percentage point lower than the interest rate the lenders charge on "jumbo loans." The savings are passed along to borrowers.
11.18.2005	Washington, D.C. - The House on Friday approved nearly $1 million for transportation and economic development projects in the San Fernando Valley, Congressman Brad Sherman announced. He said legislation that won final House approval includes $500,000 for a low-emission hybrid shuttle bus demonstration project at the Burbank Airport. The project will evaluate the feasibility of converting the airports fleet of diesel buses to low-emission hybrid vehicles. The shuttle fleet ferries passengers between the airport parking lots and the terminal. œThis is one more step toward keeping California on the cutting edge of the drive to cut air pollution, Sherman said. Another $200,000 was set aside for a project to relieve congestion at the intersection of Burbank and Sepulveda Boulevards, one of the most widely-used intersections in the San Fernando Valley. The intersection includes ramps that carry traffic on and off the 405 Freeway. The measure also earmarked $200,000 in seed money for the Valley Alliance for the Arts, which seeks to build a new performing arts center. The center has launched a drive to raise $80 million to create a premier venue for musical performances by local, national and world-renowned artists. The planners envision an 1,800-seat concert hall for symphonies, popular and jazz concerts, ballet, Broadway-style musicals, Las Vegas-style shows and other performances. There also would be space for exhibits, and a 500-seat childrens center. A performing arts center could serve a potential audience of 2.5 million patrons from the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles and surrounding areas.
11.18.2005	Washington, D.C. - House Republicans are poised to hand out more tax breaks for the wealthy after voting 217 to 215 early Friday to cut $50 billion from student loans and health care for seniors, the disabled and poor. "The gall," said Congressman Brad Sherman. "This is Robin Hood in reverse. They are taking from the poor to give to the rich." With college tuition skyrocketing, the budget would chop more than $14 billion from student loans, driving up costs for the 496,822 student borrowers in California. "This is the second jolt of bad news this week for California university students," Sherman said. Regents decided Wednesday to raise fees by 8 percent next year, the fifth straight year of higher costs at California universities. The budget also would reduce Medicaid by $12 billion, including a $1.24 billion cut for California alone. The result would reduce health care for 9.3 million uninsured California children, seniors and others who rely on Med Cal. For the first time, states could charge premiums and co-payments on children's health care. The budget also would strip billions in federal funding for child support enforcement, bad news for single parents struggling to provide for their children. And it would take food stamps away from about 225,000 people, throw 40,000 children out of the school lunch program, and reduce spending on environmental protection and housing programs. "Last night's $50 billion in cuts to education and health care cannot be justified as reducing the federal deficit because this afternoon the Republicans plan to pass $56 billion in tax cuts, primarily for the very wealthy." Sherman said.}
11.17.2005	Washington, D.C. - The U.S. Census Bureau has agreed to a request by Congressman Brad Sherman to compile demographic data about the San Fernando Valley next year. The Census Bureau had wanted to wait until the next decade to report on the Valleys population and economic data, but Sherman pressed the director to speed up the process. Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky led the effort at the board of supervisors to have the Census Bureau issue a special report on the Valley. œThe Census Bureau has come to the long-overdue conclusion that the Valley has a distinct character and the director has informed me that by next summer the bureau will compile a special report on our region, Sherman said. œI commend Supervisor Yaroslavsky for his leadership and hard work. In a letter to the congressman, Census Bureau Director Charles Louis Kincannon said a special report on the San Fernando Valley will be prepared in the summer of 2006. What the director said would be a œone-time special tabulation will provide a treasure-trove of information that the Census Bureau calls the American Community Survey. The survey of population, socio-economic and housing characteristics produces a report the bureau calls œthe cornerstone of the governments effort to keep pace with the nations changing population. The report supplements and updates the massive survey of the American population that the Census Bureau undertakes once every 10 years. The information helps local governments, organizations and businesses make informed decisions about where to build roads, schools, and senior centers, for example. It also provides data that may be used to analyze business trends and help companies make smarter business decisions. The report for the first time will compile population and economic information examining the entire Valley, which is made up of five cities “ San Fernando, Burbank, Glendale, Calabasas and part of Los Angeles “ and unincorporated portions of Los Angeles County.
11.17.2005	Washington, D.C. - In a stinging rebuke to Republican leaders, the House on Thursday voted down a bill to cut $1.5 billion from critical education, health care and job training programs. œThe House sent a clear message to the Republican leadership and to President Bush, Congressman Brad Sherman said. œYouve gone too far. Your priorities are out of whack. You have lost touch with the American people. Its time to stop showering the wealthy with tax breaks while shortchanging schools, health clinics and job training programs. The 224 to 209 vote against the $142.5 billion spending bill threw a monkey wrench into Republican plans to preserve tax cuts for the wealthy by sharply paring spending. Twenty-two moderate Republicans joined the fully united Democrats in voting against the measure. Proposing what would have been the first cut in federal school support in a decade, the measure would have chopped $784 million from the No Child Left Behind Act that Bush once ballyhooed. It also provided a scant 1 percent more for special education “ a reduction in the federal share of total special education funds. The same bill would have frozen for a fourth straight year the maximum Pell Grant to college students. œThis would have been bad news for California students, who just learned that fees are set to go up 8 percent next year, the fifth straight year of higher college costs, Sherman said. In all, there are 496,822 student borrowers in California. With 7.4 million Americans out of work, the legislation would have cut $125 million from a community college program to train 100,000 workers for high-skilled jobs. œThis budget bill was cut with a chainsaw instead of a scalpel, Sherman said.
11.16.2005	Washington, D.C. - The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday considered legislation by Congressman Brad Sherman to offer tax relief to individuals who donated to relief groups helping victims of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. œI believe this is the least we can do as a country to show our appreciation to the unselfish outpouring of support for the victims of these two major natural disasters and to encourage additional contributions from ordinary Americans, Sherman said in presenting the legislation to the panel that writes tax laws. Under Shermans proposal, individuals who do not itemize deductions “ generally those who file 1040A and 1040EZ returns “ could nevertheless deduct from their taxable income the amount they donated to charities or churches helping victims of the devastating hurricanes. A middle-class renter who responded to the tragedy by giving $25 to the Red Cross, for example, could add that amount to the standard deduction and subtract the total from the taxpayers taxable income for this year and in 2006. The Red Cross has received approximately $1.52 billion this year for hurricane relief efforts. The average donation was about $100. œThis is a small, reasonable initiative that I am sure will have great meaning to our fellow citizens who are assisting the people of the Gulf region who continue to suffer from the double tragedies of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, Sherman said. The special tax deduction would have a minimal impact on the federal budget. It is designed to encourage donations next year, but would expire after 2006.
11.10.2005	WASHINGTON “ In an embarrassing rebuff, House Republican leaders Thursday were forced to scrub a scheduled vote on a budget that would slash spending on student loans and cut health care for seniors, the disabled and the poor. œThis budget was so bad that some of Speaker Hasterts usually loyal band of lockstep yes-men said ˜No, Congressman Brad Sherman said. At a time when college tuition is skyrocketing, the Republican budget proposed taking more than $14 billion from student loans “ increasing the costs for the 496,822 student borrowers in California. The plan would raise student loan interest rate caps and drive up interest rates and fees on student borrowers who consolidate their loans. When the number of families with no health insurance is growing, the proposed budget would cut Medicaid by $10 billion. That reduction would have a severe negative impact on the more than 9.3 million California children, seniors and others who rely on Med Cal for their health care. Among the proposed cuts, the budget would for the first time allow states to charge premiums and co-payments on childrens health care. It would inevitably deprive many children from poor families of health care services. The budget also would severely reduce federal funding for child support enforcement, which would result in a reduction of more than $4.8 billion in child support collections in California over the next 10 years “ paring child support payments to single parents who are struggling to provide for their children. In order to pay for their additional tax breaks for the wealthy, Republicans also called for cutting, after adjusting for inflation, a wide range of other vital services ranging from education to child care to housing to environmental protection. The $50 billion in proposed budget cuts even failed to offset more than $70 billion in proposed new tax cuts for the wealthy, forcing the overall budget even deeper into deficit territory. œClearly, Californians simply cant afford this Republican budget, which would give tax breaks to millionaires while harming the college students, children, mothers, and working families of our state, Sherman said.
11.09.2005	Washington, D.C. - The House on Wednesday voted for proposals by Congressman Brad Sherman to restore the Bull Creek channel in the Sepulveda Basin and to fund youth programs in Northridge and Van Nuys. Sherman won $2 million for the Bull Creek project located in a section of the Sepulveda Basins Anthony C. Beilenson Park. œThis project will restore wildlife and native habitat in the channel and add new trails and a pedestrian bridge, Sherman said. The Sepulveda Basin is a federally-owned flood control area. Operated by the City of Los Angeles, the basin includes athletic fields, parklands, golf courses, a wildlife reserve and other recreational facilities. The Senate also is poised to approve the $2 million project in the Army Corps of Engineers budget and send the funding measure to the White House. The new round of funding is in addition to more than $1.9 million Sherman secured in prior years for the Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area. Completing action on a separate spending bill, the House earmarked $100,000 for the Devonshire PALS (Police Activity League Supporters) youth center in Northridge. Devonshire PALS will run the program in coordination with the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department and community volunteers. The center will provide after-school and weekend services for more than 800 San Fernando Valley youths. It will provide educational programs, tutoring, field trips, computer training, cultural activities and sports. Business and community leaders in the Valley also have launched a campaign to raise other funds to build the new PALS youth center. Another $100,000 was set aside for the Van Nuys-based New Directions for Youth to assist in its mission to help at-risk youths throughout the San FernandoValley become productive adults. The appropriation will fund the development of a Community Technology Center to provide computer access and job training services. The earmarks for the San Fernando Valley youth service programs were included in a bill to fund the Justice Department and other federal agencies.
11.01.2005	WASHINGTON “ Congressman Brad Sherman said Tuesday that Californians would bear the brunt of higher taxes on middle-class homeowners under a White House panels plan to severely curb mortgage interest deductions. œIt is not fair to pile a bigger tax load on the backs of middle-class homeowners in the San Fernando Valley in order to preserve tax breaks President Bush has given to the wealthiest Americans, said Sherman, cosponsor of a House resolution that denounces changing the mortgage deduction. The President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended limiting the mortgage deduction as part of a proposal to streamline the current income tax code. In another sharp blow to California taxpayers, the panel urged repealing the federal deduction for state and local taxes. That proposal would cost Californians $13 billion more a year in federal taxes, California Treasurer Phil Angelides has estimated. œTaking away the federal deduction would be a bitter pill for Californians whose state income tax rate is one of the highest in the country, Sherman said. œIt would cost Californians more than taxpayers from just about anywhere else. Under the home mortgage proposal, the deduction would be turned into a credit equal to 15 percent of the mortgage interest paid. The current $1 million limit on mortgages eligible for the tax break would shrink to the average regional price of housing, ranging from $227,000 to $412,000. In the San Fernando Valley, the median price of a previously-owned home sold in September was $590,000, according to the Southland Regional Association of Realtors. œWe have a lot at stake in preserving the deduction for home mortgage expenses, Sherman said. A tax overhaul package that preserves tax cuts for the top 2 percent of Americans is expected to top the agenda of congressional Republicans next year as they search for issues to bolster their reelection chances. œThe White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill want a tax hike on people who work so they can preserve tax cuts for people with real wealth, Sherman said. œThis hog wont fly.
10.29.2005	NORTH HOLLYWOOD “ Joining in a celebration on Saturday to launch the new Metro Orange Line, Congressman Brad Sherman said extending the line to Chatsworth may be the next logical step in improving mass transit in the San Fernando Valley. œThe opening of the Orange Line is great news for the Valley, Sherman said. œWe have a lot to celebrate, but we also have an opportunity to build on this success story. We should plan for a future when efficient and convenient mass transit is a reality for more and more riders. Sherman secured more than $4.2 million in federal funds for Orange Line projects. He won $1.9 million for bike paths along the route. Another $1 million helped construct the Warner Center transit hub. An additional $836,000 has been set aside to build an Orange Line extension and bus shelter at Pierce College. And $500,000 was earmarked for park-and-ride facilities along the route. Assessing future transportation needs for the Valley, Sherman said the top priority is to find state and local resources to take advantage of $135 million in federal funds already approved for a new, northbound car-pool lane on the 405 Freeway through the Sepulveda Pass. Extending the Orange Line to Chatsworth, he said, has the potential to be another major transportation priority for the Valley. A Chatsworth extension hinges, he cautioned, on the success of the Woodland Hills to North Hollywood busway that is opening this weekend. Transit planners have envisioned extending the Orange Line from Woodland Hills to the Chatsworth Metrolink station. The route would be along a 4.5-mile stretch of the same Southern Pacific Railroad line that the new Orange Line route follows. The Metropolitan Transit Authority already owns the railroad right of way.
10.27.2005	WASHINGTON, D.C. “ Congressman Brad Sherman voted Thursday against closing and reconfiguring hundreds of military bases and letting the Pentagon shift thousands of jobs from Naval Base Ventura County to the Naval Air Weapons Station at China Lake. The House cleared the way for the first round of base closings in a decade when it rejected by a vote of 324 to 85 a resolution to disapprove recommendations of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission. President Bush last month went along with the commission that voted to move the armaments research, development, acquisition, testing and evaluation functions from Point Mugu to the Navy station 150 miles away at China Lake. More than 2,200 military and civilian government jobs and as many as 3,500 private sector jobs could be affected by the transfer. œThe unfortunate consequence of this decision will be a brain drain, Sherman said. œMost of the civilian workers simply will not move from Ventura County to China Lake. It is a shame that the Pentagon is willing to waste the skills of so many talented people in Ventura County. Sherman also questioned the estimated savings projected by the Pentagon, and said U.S. military bases in Germany should be closed before shutting or reconfiguring installations critically important to the economies of communities across the United States. China Lake is located in the district of Congressman Bill Thomas, the influential chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. œApparently, logic doesnt count when a powerful Republican is involved, Sherman said. œThe commission concluded that skilled technical experts will move from Ventura County to China Lake in the Kern County desert, Sherman said. œObviously they havent been to Ventura County or China Lake. Naval Base Ventura County includes a naval air station, naval air warfare center, naval satellite operations center, and naval surface warfare center. It is credited with generating over 15,000 direct and indirect jobs, and is important to the economy of the entire San Fernando Valley and Ventura County region.
10.27.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday condemned Irans new president for declaring that Israel œmust be wiped off the map. A member of the House International Relations Committee, Sherman called on President Bush to strictly enforce sanction laws against Iran and companies investing there. He also pressed for the administration to articulate a coordinated strategy to counter the regimes support of terrorists and to deal forcefully with the grave threat posed by Irans nuclear weapons program. œFive years into the Bush administration, and four years after the great wake-up call provided by the September 11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. still does not have a coherent strategy for dealing with the twin threats from Iran “ support for international terrorism and the development of nuclear weapons, Sherman said. Sherman also commended Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon for calling on Thursday for Iran's expulsion from the United Nations. At the very least, he said, Iran should not be allowed to participate in the U.N. until it apologizes for its statements, abandons its nuclear weapons program and stops supporting terrorists. Sherman has been a leading advocate for increasing international pressure on Iran while helping dissident Iranians and human rights advocates working for democratic reforms. He authored legislation, the Iran Freedom and Democracy Support Act, and has consistently called on the Bush administration to implement sanctions against foreign firms doing business in Iran under the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. The Iranian news agency reported Wednesday that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told students at a conference on "The World Without Zionism" that attacks by Palestinians would destroy Israel. The remarks were designed to inflame passions at an annual anti-Israel demonstration held on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan. Iran has refused to recognize Israels right to exist, and has supported Palestinian militant groups, such as the Islamic Jihad, that have staged suicide bombings, including one that killed five Israelis on Wednesday.
10.27.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said the new Metro Orange Line that opens on Saturday will spur economic growth and provide low-cost, efficient transportation in the San Fernando Valley. Sleek new buses also will connect the Valley to the regional Los Angeles bus and rail rapid transit network. œThe opening of the Orange Line is great news for the Valley, Sherman said. œIt will help workers and businesses. It will help college students and senior citizens. It will help protect the environment and grow the economy. It will help bikers and hikers. It will help people save money on high-priced gasoline. And it should reduce traffice a bit on the 101 Freeway. New businesses and housing already are under construction along the 14-mile busway that whisks passengers on a 40-minute ride from Woodland Hills to North Hollywood. The busway also conveniently links existing shopping centers and commercial hubs, including Warner Center, Van Nuys Civic Center and North Hollywood. Sherman secured more than $4.2 million in federal funds earmarked for Orange Line projects. He won $1.9 million for bike paths along the route. The Orange Line includes a 14-mile bikeway, and bike lockers are located at every station along the route. Another $1 million helped construct the Warner Center transit hub. The terminal serves riders on the Orange Line, the Ventura Boulevard Metro Rapid Bus, Ventura Countys Conejo Connection and other local and regional bus routes. An additional $836,000 has been set aside to build an Orange Line extension and bus shelter at Pierce College. The new bus extension and campus gateway will improve transit access to the 18,000-student community college and the adjacent 7,000-student West Valley Occupational Center in Woodland Hills. And $500,000 was earmarked for park-and-ride facilities along the route.
10.20.2005	WASHINGTON “ Congressman Brad Sherman said the House on Thursday tried to rob rights from victims of firearm violence, including the 1999 victims of Buford Furrow Jr., who wounded five people in a shooting rampage at a Granada Hills community center and then killed a letter carrier in Chatsworth. The House voted 283 to 144 to pass and send to President Bush legislation to shield gun manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits. œThe bill grants the makers, distributors and sellers of guns unreasonable immunity from lawsuits by families harmed by gun violence, Sherman said. œThe minute President Bush signs this bill he will be putting his thumb on the scales of justice in favor of the big gun manufacturers. Sherman said the bill that he opposed also would insulate from lawsuits: A gun dealer who negligently sells a gun to a felon listed on the National Criminal Instant Background Check System. The manufacturer of the latest cop-killer handgun (the Five-seveNÂ® Pistol) and its ammunition that can penetrate from 200 yards away many of the Kevlar bulletproof vests used by police officers. A gun dealer who sells 80 guns in one transaction to a consumer who œsays that he doesnt plan to resell any of them. A dealer who sells guns to someone he knows is on the terrorist watch list. The manufacture of a gun advertised as œfinger-print proof.Bush is expected to sign the legislation, which also intends to require the dismissal of pending lawsuits. Gun victim lawyers have said they will challenge the constitutionality of the law. The U.S. Supreme Court in January cleared the way for victims of Furrows shooting spree to sue the companies that made his guns, Glock Inc. and China North Industries. A follower of the racist Aryan Nation, Furrow wounded five people on August 10, 1999, when he sprayed gunfire at the North Valley Jewish Community Center. Later that same day, he killed letter carrier Joseph Ileto because, he told police, Ileto looked œAsian or Latino. Furrow was spared the death penalty when he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five life terms in prison.
10.12.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said Wednesday that a recommendation by President Bushs tax panel to limit mortgage interest deductions would be a severe blow to San Fernando Valley homeowners. œIn parts of the Valley where home prices are more than double the national average we have a lot at stake in preserving the deduction for home mortgage expenses, Sherman said. The President's Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform on Tuesday discussed lowering the limit on mortgages eligible for the interest deduction. A uniform cap below the current $1-million limit would be especially unfair to homeowners in California, which has some of the nation's highest home prices. œThis is a risky recommendation. It is tantamount to slapping middle-class Californians with a huge tax increase, said Sherman, who supports the current tax deduction for mortgages. œThe presidents panel is out of touch with families who have worked hard to achieve the American dream of home ownership, he added. œI will fight this misguided proposal and hope to see it soundly rejected. The home mortgage deduction is critical to the economy of the Valley. It provides benefits even for people who do not own homes by spurring economic development. A change in tax laws that undercuts home values also would hurt senior citizens whose equity in their homes is critical to retirement plans. œIn the Valley, most people have most of their wealth tied up in the value of their home, Sherman said. œIf home values drop by a quarter to a third, our communities would suffer from top to bottom. The presidents tax commission is scheduled to make its final report by Nov. 1.
09.29.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday praised California emergency responders who aided hundreds of people forced to evacuate from their homes while firefighters battled flames that whipped through the Chatsworth area. "One of the lessons learned from the debacle of Hurricane Katrina is that the way to deal with a disaster is to have an efficient and coordinated response involving all levels of government," said Sherman, whose congressional district includes some of the 17,000 charred acres. He pledged to help secure any federal assistance needed for the emergency response operation that has been spearheaded by local firefighters and U.S. Forest Service crews. "Another lesson from this horrible hurricane season is to take evacuation orders seriously," Sherman added. There were no serious injuries reported as of Thursday afternoon when more than 450 people had been evacuated from Agoura Hills, Northeast Oak Park, Bell Canyon, Box Canyon and Woolsey Canyon Road. The American Red Cross said the evacuees were taken to five shelters, including the Mason Recreation Center in Chatsworth and Canoga Park High School, where a Sherman aide was on hand to offer assistance. As flames and smoke fanned by the seasons first Santa Ana winds spread for a second day, the worst of the fires were in the Chatsworth area on the northwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley. One home burned and others were threatened in Valley canyons.
09.21.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Wednesday that Congress recently approved $460,000 to construct a bicycle and pedestrian path along the Los Angeles River in Sherman Oaks. The new path will be built from Kester Avenue to Sepulveda Boulevard. It will extend an existing bicycle and pedestrian path along the river west of Kester Avenue . Sherman said the riverside bike path would compliment plans under consideration by Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and the City Council to build parks and restore sections of the river to its natural state. œThe Los Angeles River has been neglected for too long. Visionary leaders in our community have begun to realize the potential of this natural resource, Sherman said. The new federal funds were earmarked at Shermans request in a nationwide transportation bill approved by Congress on July 29. The congressmans office worked on the project in coordination with Los Angeles City Councilmember Wendy Greuel. In prior years, Congressman Sherman secured $500,000 for bike paths in Agoura Hills, $250,000 for Calabasas, $236,000 for the City of Westlake Village, and $1.9 million for the Metro Orange Line bike path.

09.15.2005	Washington, D.C. - The House International Relations Committee on Thursday adopted a pair of resolutions calling on Turkey to acknowledge the slaughter of Armenians by Ottoman Turks around the time of World War I. œIt is long past time for us to criticize the Ottoman Empire for the first genocide of the 20th century, said Congressman Brad Sherman, a member of the prestigious panel. œIgnoring genocide is the last act of genocide, Sherman added. œWhere would modern Germany be if it was ruled by a government denying the Holocaust? One resolution calls on Turkey to acknowledge the actions of the Ottoman state from 1915 to 1923, when the extermination campaign claimed about 1.5 million Armenian lives. It also urges Turkey to build closer relations with Armenia. The second measure calls on U.S. presidents to take the Armenian genocide into account in determining this countrys foreign policy. Both resolutions, which are opposed by the Bush administration, were approved by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Similar measures have cleared committee before, but were stymied by House leaders who blocked consideration by the full House. Sherman urged House leaders to permit votes on the latest resolutions. The committee votes coincided with visit of Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to the US. œIt is an act of friendship with the people of Turkey that we pass these resolutions, Sherman said. œTurkey can move forward only by truthfully acknowledging its past.
09.14.2005	WASHINGTON “ The House voted Wednesday to give the public access to a national registry of sex offenders. Congressman Brad Sherman introduced similar legislation during his first year in Congress. Shermans Child Protection Act, first proposed in 1997, called for creation of a national hotline to give the public access to a nationwide list of registered sexual predators. His bipartisan proposal was modeled on a statewide registry in California that provides parents a way to protect children from sex offenders convicted in California. œA national registry will allow parents everywhere, who are the first line of defense for their families, to get the information that they need to protect their children from sexual predators convicted anywhere, Sherman said. œCalifornia has an excellent system, he added, œbut a national registry will arm parents no matter where they live with information about predators no matter where they were convicted. Sherman worked with Kids Safe of Granada Hills, a national leader in the fight against child abuse, to develop his original legislation. Under the version that the House approved 371 to 52, a national sex offender registry would be maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The registry would include every person required to register in any jurisdiction's sex offender registry. œFor eight years Ive been working for a system so parents, day-care centers and others could check to see if a particular individual has been convicted of a sexual offense anywhere in the country, said Sherman. œFinally, parents will have this important tool to protect their children, he concluded.
09.08.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman called Thursday on President Bush to fire Michael D. Brown, the Federal Emergency Management Agency director in charge of the badly bungled federal response to Hurricane Katrina. Despite warnings for days that the killer hurricane was gathering strength and threatened to swamp New Orleans, Brown failed to move sufficient rescuers and supplies into position before the storm struck. He was inexcusably sluggish in the critical hours after Katrina slammed ashore. He remained unforgivably oblivious for days to the thousands of victims stranded in fetid conditions at the New Orleans Convention Center. œHe was clueless. His performance was feckless. He should be jobless, Sherman said. œThe president shouldnt fire Brown to punish him. He should get rid of him to make room for someone who can handle the enormous job that remains to be done. Sherman said the president should replace Brown with James Lee Witt, who headed FEMA with distinction after the 1994 Northridge earthquake and other natural disasters, or former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who decisively led New York after the September 11 terrorist attacks that demolished the World Trade Center. The inept federal response to Hurricane Katrina is in stark contrast to the disaster agencys swift and efficient response to the Northridge earthquake, which struck without warning. The FEMA response to the quake began 15 minutes after the earth shook. A headquarters emergency support team was activated 90 minutes after the quake. FEMA coordinated the response of 27 federal agencies, and a service center was quickly opened to help victims. In short, we saw results, said Sherman, who represents Northridge and surrounding areas in the San Fernando Valley. œYou would think that 11 years after one of the nations worst natural disasters, our response would be even more rapid and effective, not slower and less efficient. Sherman also said he will cosponsor legislation to establish an independent commission to study the federal response to Hurricane Katrina.
08.25.2005	Sherman Oaks - A commission evaluating Pentagon plans to close and consolidate military bases voted Thursday to shift thousands of jobs from Naval Base Ventura County to the Naval Air Weapons Station at China Lake. œThis is an enormous disappointment, said Congressman Brad Sherman. œThe unfortunate consequence of this decision will be a brain drain because most of the civilian workers simply will not move to China Lake. It makes no sense to waste the skills of the talented people already doing these jobs in Ventura County. The Base Closure and Realignment Commission voted 6 to 1 to go along with a Pentagon proposal to transfer functions from Point Mugu to the Navy station 150 miles away at China Lake. As many as 2,856 military and civilian government jobs and another 3,500 private sector jobs are at stake in the transfer. China Lake is located in the district of Congressman Bill Thomas, the influential chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. œApparently, logic doesnt count when a powerful Republican is involved, Sherman said. œIt certainly didnt in last months transportation bill when House Republicans allocated more than twice as much to Bill Thomas Bakersfield as they did to all of Los Angeles. The commission action also was at odds with its vote on Wednesday against a separate proposal to move jobs to Point Mugu from the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Corona. In that case, the panel reasoned that 850 employees would not relocate from Corona to Ventura County. œThe commissions reasoning is inconsistent, said Sherman. œThey say skilled technical experts wont move to Ventura County from Corona, but will move from Ventura County to China Lake in the Kern County desert. Obviously they havent been to Corona., Ventura County or China Lake. The commission must send its final list to President Bush by Sept. 8. If he accepts the list, Congress has 45 days to reject it or the base closings and consolidations automatically take effect. Naval Base Ventura County has played an important role in the national defense. After September 11th, Point Mugu supported aircraft patrolling the skies above Los Angeles. The base also has supplied fire fighting support and transport for civilian response forces during man-made and natural disasters in the Los Angeles region. The facility that includes a naval air station, naval air warfare center, naval satellite operations center, and naval surface warfare center is credited with generating over 15,000 direct and indirect jobs by the local Chamber of Commerce. œThis base is important to the economy of the entire San Fernando Valley/Ventura County region, said Sherman.
08.22.2005	Sherman Oaks - Congressman Brad Sherman on Monday released a report showing President Bushs plan to cut off enrollment in health care programs for veterans would deny coverage for an estimated 113,000 Californians, including 2,000 veterans in his San Fernando Valley congressional district. Thousands more veterans would face increased costs in order to remain eligible for the health care they were promised. Bushs proposal fails to keep pace with inflation and fails to provide funds for expected enrollment increases. Leading veterans groups have called the plan œtightfisted and œmiserly. The president wants to stop enrolling veterans whose injuries are not service related and who earn more than $24,644 a year. He also would slap some veterans with new annual fees and higher payments for prescription drugs. The president called for enrollment cutoffs and steeper fees in the Veterans Affairs Department budget that he submitted to Congress in February. Five months later, the Bush administration admitted a $2 billion shortfall in health care programs for veterans, but a supplemental budget request still sought to cut enrollment and raise fees. A report prepared for Sherman by the Special Investigations Division of the House Committee on Government Reform found that: Â· The Bush plan would prevent an estimated 500 veterans in the 27th Congressional District from enrolling in the VA healthcare system. Â· Another 1,500 Valley veterans, unable to afford increased payments the administration proposed, would drop their enrollment in the VA system. Â· Many more California veterans remaining in the system would be forced to pay more for their health care. On average, costs would go up $390 annually. Some veterans would pay as much as $550 or more a year. Total increased costs for veterans in Shermans congressional district would be about $650,000 annually. A copy of the report is available on Shermans web site at https://www.house.gov/sherman/sherman_veterans.pdf
08.21.2005	Encino - Congressman Brad Sherman on Sunday saluted a Marine Corps Reserve unit that includes troops sent to Iraq after they were mobilized in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. œI am grateful for your service and appreciate the sacrifices of those who were called up for duty in the war, Sherman told the Marines. He called the reserve unit œa credit to California. Sherman spoke at a Family Day ceremony for about 140 Marines in the 2nd Battalion, 23rd Marines, 4th Marine Division and their families and guests. Sherman presented a flag flown at the U.S. Capitol to Lt. Col. Paul Lebidine, who next month will relinquish his command of the unit. He also presented a flag to Maj. Stefan Dirghall on behalf of his company. The mission of the Marine Corps Reserve division is to provide trained combat and combat support personnel during war and at times of national emergency.
08.19.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Friday helped break ground on a major expansion of the Providence Holy Cross Emergency Department and Trauma Center. œThis is a very important project for a hospital that is expanding to meet the critical health care needs of the growing and aging population in the San Fernando Valley and beyond, said Sherman. Providence Holy Cross is the second busiest hospital in Los Angeles. It operates one of only two remaining trauma centers in the Valley. Recent hospital closings in Granada Hills and Northridge along with the shuttering of four other hospitals in Los Angeles County in the past two years have driven more patients to the Mission Hills hospital. The congressman said he is hopeful that Congress will earmark some of the $1.5 million he sought in federal assistance for a new imaging facility that is part of the expansion project. Imaging equipment combines X-ray and computer technology to create pictures of tissue that help medical experts spot cancer, diagnose traumatic injuries and avoid unnecessary surgery. The hospital has called the new imaging facility œa critical component of the expansion because patients currently experience œsignificant wait times even after they have been transferred to an œoverwhelmed and œobsolete imaging center located a full city block away and across the street in a trailer. The expansion of the emergency department and trauma center will add 6,600 square feet to the facility, and double the size of the department from 16 beds to 34 beds.
08.10.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday urged Los Angeles County officials to make the company that owns Sunshine Canyon Landfill accept long-term responsibility for the sites safety. œThe public should not be left holding the bag, Sherman told the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission. The panel is considering a conditional use permit for Browning-Ferris Industries to continue operating the San Fernando Valley landfill. The county currently requires the landfill owner to maintain insurance for 30 years after the dump shuts down. Sherman called that œinadequate to guard against the true long-term dangers to the environment. He noted that the landfill, located within a few miles of two major fault lines, also is near a groundwater basin that supplies drinking water for the Los Angeles region. œThe possibility of a landfill failure at Sunshine Canyon is very real and would have disastrous public health consequences, Sherman said. œIn the highly populated setting of the San Fernando Valley, clean up costs could easily exceed $100 million. He urged county officials to support a proposal by a coalition of Valley residents, labor unions and environmental organizations to œensure that the conditional use permit issued by the county contains meaningful protections for the public health and public coffers. Sherman has consistently opposed expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill and supported alternatives that would allow the landfill to be closed permanently.
08.10.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman secured $800,000 for projects in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in legislation that President Bush signed on Wednesday. The funds are expected to be used to complete the Backbone Trail, and to improve access in Tarzana for San Fernando Valley residents entering the mountain trail network. œThe park is a national treasure right here in the Valleys back yard. Sherman said. œImproving the trails will let hikers and other park visitors enjoy the mountains even more. "Congressman Sherman always remembers the Santa Monica Mountains", said National Park Service Superintendent Woody Smeck. "The congressmans help comes at a great time. An estimated $200,000 would allow the National Park Service to build the last 1.5 miles of the 60-mile Backbone Trail. Once completed, the trail will be a vital link to more than 480 miles of trails through 80,000 acres of parkland. Another $400,000 would help the National Park Service pay for the last parcels of private land along the Backbone Trail. In addition, $200,000 is expected to pay for better access to the park by improving trailhead facilities at Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park in Tarzana. Since he was elected to Congress, Sherman has won over $22 million for projects to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
08.10.2005	Washington, D.C. - A transportation bill signed Wednesday by President Bush includes a provision by Congressman Brad Sherman that cleared the way for California to allow hybrid vehicles on High Occupancy Vehicle lanes. œThis gives California a way to ease freeway congestion and promote the use of more fuel-efficient cars, Sherman said. The California Department of Motor Vehicles announced Wednesday that it was moving ahead with plans to issue special stickers to owners of hybrid vehicles that would allow them to drive in HOV lanes with only one person in the car. Until today, federal law had limited HOV lanes to vehicles with a driver and at least one passenger, vehicles fueled by natural gas and electric cars. Under the Sherman provision of the bill Bush signed, California was able to implement a law to allow solo drivers of hybrids on carpool lanes. Sherman and Congressman Darrell Issa, a California colleague, introduced the hybrid provision that the president approved. Sherman emphasized that the measure gives states the flexibility to decide when and where hybrid vehicles would be exempt from HOV regulations. He said California and other states could limit or restrict the exemption in areas where HOV lanes are already at full capacity. œI believe it is important that the states have the flexibility to regulate the hybrid use of HOV lanes within their state, Sherman said. œIn some areas, it may not be favorable to have hybrids in HOV lanes due to congestion. In other areas, allowing hybrids in HOV lanes may provide additional incentives for consumers to use this technology. In either case, the decision should be left up to the states, and the federal government should permit the states to make this decision. The congressman congratulated Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for quickly taking advantage of the change in federal law. œI agree with the governor that the waiver and sticker program is another example of Californias leadership role in the areas of clean air, alternative fuel systems. The California Department of Motor Vehicles has posted on its web site a form for hybrid vehicle owners to apply for stickers that will allow single-occupant hybrid cars on diamond lanes. More information is available at https://www.dmv.ca.gov/
07.29.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman announced Friday that he secured more than $13 million for San Fernando Valley road improvements and mass-transit projects, including $9,083,185 for the West Valley. The highway bill includes: Â· $4.1 million to resurface and improve roads and transit in the Northwest Valley. Â· $6 million to resurface and improve roads and build bike paths in the Southwest Valley. Â· $1.7 million to resurface and improve roads in Sherman Oaks, Van Nuys, and East Valley. Â· $765,000 for construction and enhancement of trails in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. Â· $500,000 for 5 Freeway improvements from Route 134 to Route 170. Here is a list of 27th Congressional District projects:
07.28.2005	Washington, D.C. - A transportation bill headed for final passage by Congress would clear the way for California and other states to allow hybrid vehicles on HOV lanes. Congressman Brad Sherman earlier this year introduced hybrid car legislation along with a California colleague, Congressman Darrell Issa. œThis will give California and other states a way to ease freeway congestion and encourage the use of more fuel-efficient cars, Sherman said. Current federal law limits HOV lanes to vehicles with a driver and at least one passenger, vehicles fueled by natural gas and electric cars. The California law, authored by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, allows solo drivers of hybrids that get at least 45 miles per gallon to use carpool lanes. The state law was to go into effect last January 1, but implementation has been delayed until the federal law was changed. The measure included in the Surface Transportation Act, like Shermans original proposal, would allow states to regulate when and where hybrid vehicles would be exempt from HOV regulations. A state could limit or restrict the exemption in areas where HOV lanes are already at full capacity. œI believe it is important that the states have the flexibility to regulate the hybrid use of HOV lanes within their state, Sherman said. œIn some areas, it may not be favorable to have hybrids in HOV lanes due to congestion; in other areas, allowing hybrids in HOV lanes may provide additional incentives for consumers to use this technology. In either case, the decision should be left up to the states, and the federal government should permit the states to make this decision.
07.26.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said Tuesday that a proposed trade treaty with Central American nations and the Dominican Republic would cost American jobs, fail to protect foreign workers, harm the environment, and cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars. Sherman was among a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers opposing the Central American Free Trade Agreement who were joined at a Capitol Hill rally by representatives from religious, business, labor, environmental and human rights organizations. With a close House vote scheduled later this week, he urged the news media to investigate how the Bush administration is wooing members of Congress to vote for the agreement. Take a look at the lobbying thats going on on CAFTA, Sherman told reporters at the rally. Explain to Americans that this is not just bad trade policy, it is bad government. The pact would increase access to U.S. markets for textiles, sugar and other industries. It would follow in the failed footsteps of the North American Free Trade Agreement that Sherman said has cost America manufacturing jobs, hurt the value of the dollar and put upward pressure on interest rates. We are here to put the brakes on a process designed to lead to the hemisphere-wide expansion of the failure that is NAFTA, Sherman said. A fair trade treaty could promote economic growth at home and improve the lives of poor workers in developing countries, Sherman said. But this agreement fails to protect the rights of working people in a region where young workers labor long hours in hazardous conditions for poverty-level wages. The Congressional Budget Office reported that the agreement would cost taxpayers about $4.4 billion over the next 10 years. In addition to the Dominican Republic, the agreement would cover trade relations between the United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua.
07.22.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Friday released a new report https://node/2 detailing how San Fernando Valley residents would face steep Social Security benefit cuts under a proposal by President Bush. œThis study brings home the bad news that the presidents plan to privatize Social Security would hurt middle-class workers in the San Fernando Valley, Sherman said. œThe presidents plan would undermine retirement security by cutting guaranteed benefits for future retirees, and his risky privatization accounts wont make up the difference. The report prepared by the House Government Reform Committee at Shermans request analyzed the impact of the presidents proposal to peg Social Security benefits to prices instead of wages. The study specifically examined the impact on workers in Californias 27th Congressional District, which includes roughly one-half of the San Fernando Valley. The report found that the presidents plan would: Cut benefits for more than 190,000 wage earners, 67 percent of all workers in the district. Cut benefits by an average of $2,340 per year for wage earners between 35 and 55 years old, and by an average of $5,000 per year for younger wage earners. More than 49,000 wage earners in the district would face benefit cuts of more than 20 percent a year. Reduce lifetime benefits by more than $15 billion for current wage earners in the district. The analysis shows that middle-class families in Congressman Shermans district would be hit hardest by the benefit cuts. According to the report, more than 72 percent of the cuts will come from middle-class workers who earn between $30,000 and $90,000 annually. The Social Security Trust Fund has accumulated more than $1.7 trillion in reserves that are held in Treasury bonds. According to the Congressional Budget Office, even if no changes are made Social Security will be able to pay full benefits for the next 50 years. œWe have time to come up with a bipartisan solution that will strengthen the Social Security system for generations to come, Sherman said.
07.21.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday urged House colleagues to join him in calling on Great Britain to keep out of England a radical sheik who has advocated terrorism. Sheik Yussuf al-Qaradawi, a Qatari-based cleric, has hailed those who commit suicide bombings, called for the murder of Jews, and advocated the use of children in terrorist attacks. In an interview about Palestinian suicide operations against Israelis, he told the BBC in 2004 that he œconsiders this type of martyrdom operation as an evidence of Gods justice He is scheduled to appear at an August 7 conference in Manchester. œHis presence there would send the wrong message and undercut the efforts of moderate voices seeking to marginalize those who advocate terror in the name of their faith, Sherman said. Sherman drafted a letter to Prime Minister Tony Blair and circulated it to other members of Congress for their signatures. œMr. Prime Minister, the letter said, œwe applaud the leadership you have demonstrated in urging your countrymen to denounce all forms of terrorism. We urge you to use whatever authority at your disposal to prevent this cleric from entering the United Kingdom. The letter also expressed sadness at recent terrorist attacks in London, and extended sympathy to the British people. In what may have been copycat attacks just two weeks after the London terror bombings claimed 56 lives, assailants attempted to set off explosives at three subway trains and a bus on Thursday. œOur hearts go out to the British people, Sherman said. British Home Secretary Charles Clarke said earlier this week that extremist preachers who glorify terrorism could be subject to new restrictions his office is prepared to implement. He also said he would consider using his powers to ban al-Qaradawi from the country, the London Telegraph reported. Shermans effort was welcomed by a leader of The Simon Wiesenthal Center, one of the largest international Jewish human rights organizations. œWe applaud Congressman Sherman and his colleagues for taking a leadership role in urging a unified stance against all suicide terrorism, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the centers associate dean.
07.20.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman joined Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen on Wednesday in calling for justice for 52 Americans taken hostage in 1979 in Iran. Sherman is the ranking member of the House International Relations Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation. œI have long supported efforts to hold the Iranian regime and other sponsors of terrorism accountable for their actions and to provide compensation to their victims. Unfortunately, the U.S. government has become the main impediment to obtaining that accountability and compensation. These claimants, and other plaintiffs seeking compensation from Iran, prevailed in the courtroom only to be thwarted by their own government when it came time to collect. œIn this case, our own State Department has effectively sided with the Iranian regime against its own employees. What type of message does that send to those who serve our government and our military? And what message does it send those who seek to kill Americans? œThis legislation seeks to solve that dilemma by abrogating the Algiers Accord with respect to these victims. This agreement has governed much of U.S.-Iran relations since the breach in diplomatic relations, and abrogation gives many of us pause. We believe in the sanctity of treaties and executive agreements. œBut an agreement entered into under duress is void from its onset. The U.S. had the proverbial gun to its head when it made this agreement. Some of the hostages here today had real guns pointed at their heads, and we had little or no choice but to sign this document if we were to get them home safely. œI would also point out that Iran and its proxies have conducted and supported attacks designed to kill Americans “ the 241 Marines in Beirut, the 19 American servicemen at Khobar Towers, and dozens of Americans visiting Israel over the years. I would say that these murders abrogate the Algiers accords. œThe State Department will use whatever legal argument it can to prevent collection from the Iranian regime and its leading personalities. This legislation removes one legal impediment with respect to one class of victims. It will also provide for limited awards to prevent this class from depleting Iranian assets. This is important because we will need to provide for compensation for the other victims of Iranian terror, and I am afraid we will need to further hobble the State Departments legal operations if all victims are going to see some measure of justice.
07.20.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman said Wednesday he will introduce legislation to allow Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to stay on the job after his current term expires early next year. During a Greenspan appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, Sherman said the law setting Federal Reserve Board term limits should be changed so the chief of the nations central bank could remain in office for five more years after his term expires next January 31. œDoes my wife have a vote in this? Greenspan asked. œThank God she does not, Sherman said, œalthough she may have a vote on whether you accept another five years. Widely admired throughout the world, Greenspan has chaired the board that sets monetary policy for the United States for more than 18 years. œHe has done an outstanding job and the markets would be better, the economy would be better if he stays on. Sherman added. œWhether he would be willing to do that I dont know, but certainly we in Congress should do our part. It would be better if our statutes allowed him to stay on. Unless the Fed chiefs term is extended, Greenspans testimony before the House panel and a follow-up session with senators would be the last of his twice-a-year economic forecasts for Congress. Sherman also asked Greenspan to develop a plan to cope with a possible sudden decline in the value of the dollar.
07.14.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday urged a commission reviewing Pentagon plans for military base consolidation to stop an œimpractical shift of thousands of jobs from a Navy installation at Point Mugu to China Lake. œIt does not make logistical or economic sense, Sherman said of the proposed transfer of weapons and electronic warfare functions from Naval Base Ventura County to the Naval Air Weapons Station located 150 miles away at China Lake. The shift would affect more than 6,300 jobs, including 2,856 military and civilian government jobs and another 3,500 private sector jobs, Sherman told the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in written testimony submitted during a hearing in Los Angeles. The base is economically important to the entire Ventura County and San Fernando Valley region. The congressman also said the Defense Department had made a œhighly questionable assumption that many of the civil service and contract employees would move to China Lake. œThe likely loss of experience, expertise and intellectual capital from employees unwilling to relocate would take the Navy years to reconstitute, he said. In a separate letter to Anthony Principi, the commission chairman, Sherman called the relocation plan œsomething the nation can ill afford in this era of the global war on terrorism. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld last May proposed a sweeping plan to close or reduce forces at 62 major bases and hundreds of smaller installations to save money and streamline the armed services. The Los Angeles hearing was an opportunity for Southern California leaders to present their views to the nine-member commission, which will have held 19 similar sessions across the country before it produces a final list of targeted bases by Sept. 8. The commission must send its revised list to the president, who has to approve it in its entirety or send it back to the commission for more work. After the president signs off on the list, it then goes to Congress, which must accept it or reject it as a whole.
07.13.2005	Washington, D.C. - {President Bush should keep his word and fire top White House aide Karl Rove for leaking information about a Central Intelligence Agency undercover operative, Congressman Brad Sherman said Wednesday. œThe president said he would fire any White House staffer who leaked the identity of an undercover operative, Sherman said. œNow that Karl Rove has been exposed as one of the leakers, the president should keep his word without delay and without making more excuses. Bush on Wednesday dodged questions about Roves role in revealing that Valerie Plame, the wife of a Bush administration critic, worked for the CIA. Rove referred indirectly to Plame in a July 11, 2003, conversation with Time magazine, which published an article that identified her as a CIA operative. The leak was part of a ham-handed White House attempt to undercut the credibility of the CIA agents husband, Joseph Wilson. A former ambassador, Wilson had forcefully disputed Bush claims that then Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was developing nuclear weapons. A special prosecutor is investigating whether anyone in the White House broke the law by revealing the identity of a CIA operative. œIt does not matter whether Roves actions meet all of the elements to constitute a felony; what he did was terribly wrong, Sherman said. œIt matters even less whether Rove used Valerie Plames name, or merely referred to her as ˜the wife of Ambassador Joseph Wilson. President Bush, Sherman added, should heed the words of his father. The former president and former CIA director forcefully declared in a 1999 speech, œI have nothing but contempt and anger for those who betray the trust by exposing the names of our sources. They are, in my view, the most insidious of traitors. Sherman also cited testimony at a congressional hearing two years ago by former CIA agents who called the exposure of agents by political operatives œtreacherous, if not treasonous. The White House leaks, the three ex-agents lamented, had œset a sickening precedent.
07.09.2005	UNIVERSAL CITY - Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday thanked and honored soldiers from the U.S. Army Reserve returning home to Los Angeles after serving in Iraq and Kuwait. Ninety soldiers of the U.S. Army Reserve 311th Corps Support Command, based in West Los Angeles, planned and coordinated supply shipments to combat troops in Iraq. Their service to the country was recognized during a ceremony attended by the congressman and military commanders. The congressman presented the unit a flag flown over the United States Capitol. œWe are all grateful for your service, and proud to welcome you home, Sherman said. He called the soldiers œa credit to California and said they had œplaced themselves in danger to keep America safe. Each soldier was presented a ˜Welcome Home Warrior-Citizen award in recognition of their service. They also received an encased American flag, a commemorative coin, a lapel pin and a ˜Welcome Home Warrior-Citizen flag. The ˜Welcome Home Warrior-Citizen award was approved by Congress and President Bush. Soldiers who receive the award have served for at least 180 days in Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom. Unlike other military awards, the ˜Welcome Home Warrior-Citizen awards honor not only the soldiers but also their families and employers. œThese awards pay tribute not only to the bravery of our soldiers, but also to the selflessness of their families and the places where they work. Sherman said. œThey have lived apart for a time so we all can live together in freedom and safety.
07.08.2005	EL SEGUNDO - Congressman Brad Sherman and other community leaders showed support Friday for more than 700 striking janitors who clean offices at Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman facilities in Southern California. Seeking better wages and health care for their families, the janitors threw up pickets on Wednesday. œJanitors paid a decent wage for jobs that come with health insurance provide a stable and reliable workforce. Thats good for the companies, good for the workers and good for our communities, Congressman Sherman said. œWe need to send a clear message that our community supports justice for janitors, he told a rally outside the three defense contractors plants near Los Angeles International Airport. The congressman also helped pass out bags of donated groceries to strikers and their families. Sherman noted that the Pentagon pumps billions of taxpayer dollars into the coffers of the defense and aerospace industry giants. œIts just not right for these huge defense contractors to turn around and make California taxpayers pick up the health care tab when the janitors or their children get sick, he said. The striking janitors are members of the Service Employees International Union. They have been paid roughly $1,000 a month. Custodians elsewhere in the Los Angeles area make up to $4 an hour more, or some $1,600 a month. The strikers also are bargaining for health insurance for their families like the benefits offered to workers by other cleaning service companies in the Los Angeles area. The striking janitors are employed by Aramark Corp., Somers Bulding Maintenance Inc., and Servicon Systems Inc. Those companies provide cleaning services for the three major defense and aerospace firms. œUp and down the state of California, about 25,000 janitors earn decent wages at companies that also provide good health benefits, Congressman Sherman said. œJanitors who clean at huge and profitable companies like Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman shouldnt have to choose between putting food on the table and taking a sick child to the doctor.
07.02.2005	MALIBU CREEK STATE PARK “ A new shuttle bus service today begins taking hikers, bicyclists, beach goers and sight seers through the Santa Monica Mountains to stops along the Pacific coast. œThis is another reason to celebrate on Independence Day, said Congressman Brad Sherman, who secured $110,000 in federal funds for the shuttle. œThe park shuttle service will allow thousands of people a convenient way to visit the mountains and beaches, the congressman added. The shuttle route straddles two counties. The nine stops include Malibu Creek State Park, Tapia Park, Malibu Lagoon State Beach, Solstice Canyon, Zuma Beach, Peter Strauss Ranch, Paramount Ranch and trailheads along Malibu Canyon Road and Kanan Road. Sherman joined federal and start park officials at a dedication ceremony at Malibu Creek State Park. Later on Saturday, the congressman will join officials of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in dedicating the Victory Boulevard entrance to the Upper Las Virgenes Open Space Preserve. Formerly known as Ahmanson Ranch., the 2,900-acre site is located in West Hills at the western end of Victory Blvd. The new entrance provides easy access with parking for San Fernando Valley residents. Hikers will be able to access trails throughout the property.
07.02.2005	WEST HILLS, Calif. “ Congressman Brad Sherman, who was at the forefront of a battle against private development of the Ahmanson Ranch, today helped dedicate a new entrance to the property that is now a major wildlife refuge. He joined officials of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy in dedicating the Victory Boulevard entrance to the Upper Las Virgens Canyon Open Space Preserve. The new entrance provides easy access with parking for San Fernando Valley residents. Hikers will be able to access trails throughout the 2,900-acre property. Earlier today, the congressman took part in opening a new shuttle bus service for hikers, bicyclists, beach goers and sight seers in the Santa Monica Mountains. The shuttle bus route also includes stops along the Pacific coast. œThe park shuttle service will allow thousands of people a convenient way to visit the mountains and beaches, the congressman added. Congressman Sherman secured $110,000 in federal funds for the shuttle. The shuttle route straddles two counties.

07.01.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Friday issued a statement on the retirement of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor and the process for selecting a replacement: œJustice OConnor has been a symbol of moderation on the Supreme Court. President Bush should replace her with someone who, like Justice OConnor, is in the mainstream not the extreme. œHe should reject pressure from those in the right-wing fringe of his own party who want an activist justice to turn back the clock on landmark rulings that protect individual rights and civil liberties. œIn the best interest of the court and the country, the president should pick a consensus nominee and avoid a drawn-out confirmation battle in the Senate.
06.29.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday called on President Bush to fill a $1 billion funding gap in the budget for veterans health care. œToo many veterans already are waiting too long for the healthcare they were promised and deserve, Sherman said. œWe must fix this problem and fix it now The looming shortfall emerged during a midyear budget review by the Veterans Affairs Department. The problem was acknowledged only grudgingly by a department official testifying one week ago at a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. In a letter to Bush, Sherman and other Democratic members of Congress said an additional $1.3 billion should be provided this year for veterans health care programs. They also said the administration should make more realistic budgets in the future. œFunding for veterans health care beyond 2007 is cut significantly below the amount needed merely to account for inflation, the congressmen said in the letter delivered to the White House. The budget crunch occurs at a time when the nations population of veterans grew by 300,000 this year because of recent troop buildups for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. In addition, Sherman has separately sought additional funds for the Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center to purchase new medical equipment. Amid the Veterans Affairs Departments mounting fiscal woes, a top official has launched a crackdown on VA hospitals and clinics that have not hung photographs of Secretary Jim Nicholson. According to a memorandum leaked to the press, the official ordered subordinates to œgive this your highest priority. œOne thing ought to be clear, Sherman said. œThe highest priority of the Veterans Affairs Department must be caring for veterans, not stroking the ego of a Bush cabinet secretary. The Department of Veterans Affairs has to get its priorities straight.
06.28.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman, a member of the House International Relations Committee, issued the following statement on Tuesday after President Bush delivered a speech on the 27-month-old war in Iraq: I am a fervent environmentalist, but even I know youre not supposed to recycle speeches. The president said nothing tonight that he hasnt said many times before. We need to talk about withdrawal from Iraq, not necessarily by a specific date but in terms of specific milestones.
06.25.2005	Washington, D.C. “ Congressman Brad Sherman on Saturday congratulated Canoga Park for winning the All-America City Award for 2005. œThis designation will put Canoga Park on the map and help attract business and investment in the community as people understand what a great job they are doing, Sherman said. The selection of Canoga Park as one of only 10 All-America City Award winners in the nation was announced Saturday at a ceremony in Atlanta, Ga. The event honored communities that employed collaboration and innovation to overcome challenges. The All-America City Award, presented by the National Civic League, has encouraged and recognized civic excellence since 1949. It honors communities of all sizes in which community members, government, businesses and non-profit organizations have worked together to address critical local issues. George H. Gallup called the award he founded œa Nobel Prize for constructive citizenship. Previous winners of the award have attracted and retained businesses that generate jobs and a stronger tax base. The award also has helped communities attract and retain residents who want a healthy community. Congressman Sherman secured federal funding for the redevelopment and revitalization of Sherman Way, an important commercial and transportation corridor in Canoga Park. Canoga Park is a San Fernando Valley community that is part of the City of Los Angeles. œThe people of Canoga Park can be proud to live in an All-America City and deserve the great reputation that comes with the award, Sherman said.
06.23.2005	Washington, D.C. “ Congressman Brad Sherman on Thursday voted to restore $100 million that a committee tried to cut from the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The full House voted 284 to 140 in favor of an amendment to keep the public broadcasting appropriation at $400 million. The proposed 25 percent reduction, according to the Association of Public Television Stations, would have severely impacted every public television and radio stations ability to provide educational, cultural and informational programming in local communities and throughout the nation. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is the taxpayer-funded agency that provides critical dollars to public broadcasting across the country. The corporation supports television stations that offer important public affairs programs, such as The News Hour with Jim Lehrer. The cuts also would have eliminated the successful "Ready to Learn" program, which supports children's shows, including Arthur, Sesame Street, Dragon Tales, and other popular educational programs. The corporation also supports radio stations that carry National Public Radio programs. Corporation grants account for a substantial portion of member stations operating budgets. The grants support local program production and help pay day-to-day bills. œWhile I have voiced concerns about the fairness of NPRs coverage of issues in the Middle East, I nevertheless believe that public broadcasting provides a valuable national service, Sherman said. According to a survey by the nonpartisan Roper polling firm, Americans rank PBS as the second œmost valuable service taxpayers receive, outranked only by national defense.
06.22.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman on Wednesday urged college students and recent graduates to consider consolidating their student loans before June 30. A money-saving opportunity to consolidate student loans and lock in record-low interest rates expires in one week. New rates take effect on July 1. œStudent loan interest rates are expected to make the biggest jump in years. In order to consolidate your loans and save thousands of dollars, you must act soon, Sherman said. "This could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lock in low rates and save thousands of dollars. As of July 1, the interest rate on the government's largest loan program, the Stafford student loan, is scheduled to jump nearly two percentage points from the current all-time low. Consolidating several Stafford loans by June 30 would lock in the loans' lower rate and extend the repayment period. A student who took out a $20,000 Stafford loan at todays rate would pay $110 per month. Interest over 20 years would total $6,300. A student who misses the June 30 deadline would pay interest totaling about $12,700 over two decades. In addition to saving money, consolidating your college loans and locking in a low rate could improve other aspects of the financial futures of recent college graduates. Lower monthly payments improve graduates' credit scores so lenders are more likely finance a condo or a car for ex-students who owe smaller percentages of their salary. In order to consolidate, students and graduates need to know all of their outstanding loans and the interest rates. The information is available at the National Student Clearinghouse Web site at https://www.studentclearinghouse.org. Another place to learn more about loan consolidation is the Education Department web site at https://www.loanconsolidation.ed.gov/ .
06.17.2005	Washington, D.C. - Defying President Bush, the House voted Friday to cut U.S. contributions to the United Nations in half unless it carries out reforms. Congressman Brad Sherman said the organization must be overhauled, but he voted against the bill by International Relations Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde that would reduce U.S. aid unless the United Nations meets a list of demands. Sherman supported an alternative proposed by Congressman Tom Lantos that would have given the secretary of state authority to withhold dues without making the cuts mandatory. œThe question is what strategy do we use? Sherman told the House during floor debate on the two approaches. œDo we use the straight-jacket strategy where we dont trust the administration, or do we adopt the Lantos approach where we empower the administration, state our goals, allow the administration to withhold a substantial part of our dues and then begin to negotiate? he asked. œThe answer depends upon whether you think the Bush administration is tough enough and sufficiently dedicated to U.N. reform, Sherman said. œBush has shown us his attitude toward getting tough with the U.N. by uttering two words; John Bolton, the congressman added. The presidents nomination of Bolton, a ardent U.N. critic, to be the U.S. ambassador to the world body has become entangled in controversy in the Senate, but Sherman noted that œwhoever represents us at the U.N. will reflect an administration that wants Bolton. Eight former U.S. ambassadors to the United Nations weighed in against the Hyde bill. They said in a letter to members of Congress that withholding dues would ''create resentment, build animosity and actually strengthen opponents of reform.'' The approach taken by the bill also was rejected by a commission headed by former House speaker Newt Gingrich and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell. The measure that the House passed is expected to languish in the Senate, where no similar legislation is under consideration. The U.S. is the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations. œWe need to make sure we get our moneys worth, not throw in the towel, Sherman said.
06.16.2005	Washington, D.C. - The House on Thursday voted for a proposal by Congressman Brad Sherman to help build a new youth center in Northridge. œThe new youth center will provide an atmosphere where the youth and families will feel safe, Sherman said. œThe result will be less crime, less gang participation, a safer community and happier families, he added. The project was included in a bill that the House approved 418 to 7 to fund the Justice Department and other federal agencies. The Los Angeles Police Department will run the juvenile delinquency prevention program designed to provide after-school and weekend services for more than 800 San Fernando Valley youths. The new $3.3 million, 5,000-square-foot center will provide educational programs, tutoring, field trips, computer training, cultural activities and sports. Sherman made helping the project a top priority in an April 8 request to the House Appropriations Committee. He sought $525,000, but the exact amount of the federal contribution wont be specified until later in the congressional appropriations process. œI believe that when the process is completed we will secure significant federal funds for the youth center in Northridge Sherman said. Business and community leaders in the Valley have launched a campaign to raise other funds to construct the new youth center. Devonshire PALS (Police Activity League Supporters) will run the program in coordination with the Devonshire Division of the Los Angeles Police Department and community volunteers. The police department will provide a full-time officer to plan programs. A reserve officer and other program volunteers will assist the officer in supervising the children.
06.14.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today welcomed Tyler Bailey from Cleveland High School in Reseda to the Capitol, where his first-place entry in the 27th Congressional District Student Art Competition is on display. Emily Eisen, a student at High Tech High School, and Leslie Lee, from Cleveland High School, were the second and third place winners in the San Fernando Valley congressional district. œThe work of all the participants is a magnificent representation of our many talented students in the San Fernando Valley, Sherman said. The congressman congratulated Tyler during a ceremony in the Capitol corridor where his work is on display with first-prize winners from around the United States. œI commend all the students who entered the competition and express my congratulations to the contest winners. I also want to once again thank our excellent panel of judges. The competition took place on May 21st and was open to all high school students in the 27th Congressional District. There were 19 participants. The event was judged by Stuart Vaughn of the Canoga Youth Art Center, Deane Leavenworth of Time Warner Cable, Dick Cooper of Telesis Credit Union, and Todd Brown of Channel 1 News. He won an all expense paid trip for him and his parents to Washington, DC for the unveiling, donated by Time Warner Cable. The Telesis Credit Union donated I-Pods for all the winners.
06.13.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman today criticized Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneggers plan to call for a costly special election this November, and he said the timing is intended to let the governor skirt rules on how regular election campaigns are bankrolled. œIm an accountant, but you dont have to be one to know the governor is wasting money, Sherman said. œThe governor is wasting up to $80 million in taxpayer money and more private sector money because he wants these important issues decided in a low-turnout special election. He also wants to avoid the ethics rules that would apply to him if these issues were decided in a regular election, Sherman added. œAll of these issues could have waited until the regularly scheduled June election, or the governor could have worked to move the primary to February or March to deal with all of these issues. A majority of California voters oppose a special election this November 8. A recent survey found more than 60 percent prefer putting the issues on the ballot next year.
06.09.2005	Washington, D.C. - A House committee today adopted a proposal by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) encouraging the State Department to urge the Palestinian Authority to remove anti-Semitic statements from textbooks for Arab school children. A basic level of respect for all religions must form the foundation for building a peaceful future in the Middle East, Sherman said. The Palestinian Authority has improved textbooks, he said, but recent revisions still fail to acknowledge the existence of the State of Israel and do not even mention Jews in a discussion of religious tolerance. The Sherman Amendment to the State Department authorization bill links continued support for the Palestinian Authority to the removal of language in the textbooks that fosters anti-Semitism. Sherman raised the issue directly with President Mahmoud Abbas when the Palestinian leader met last month with members of the International Relations Committee. Another amendment the committee adopted would increase support for pro-democracy and human rights groups in rogue nations that support terrorists. This is a common sense way to shine a light on efforts to promote democracy and human rights in some of the darkest corners of the world, he said. A third Sherman Amendment the committee adopted would require the Secretary of State to take stronger measures to block World Bank loans to the government of Iran. œIf we are serious about convincing the Iranians to abandon their nuclear program, we should stop aid, trade and investment until they abandon the program, he said. Sherman also added language to the bill to promote dismantling a nuclear black market network headed by Pakistans former chief nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan. This worldwide security threat must be thwarted, the congressman said.
06.05.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) addressed the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco/Southern California Association of Realtors Homebuyers Fair. Congressman Sherman highlighted his work in Washington on raising the Conforming Loan rate --- the limit on the size of loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy in --- in high-cost areas like the San Fernando Valley. œOwning a home is something every family aspires to. As a member of the Financial Services Committee, I have worked continuously in Washington to make that opportunity possible for more Valley residents, Sherman said. œIncreasing the conforming loan limit will help homebuyers in the Los Angeles area at no cost to the taxpayer. If local banks can sell the loans they extend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the interest rates on those loans will be roughly Â¼ percent lower than loans their institutions can currently purchase. This will result in savings of thousands of dollars for Los Angeles homebuyers who borrow $500,000 or more to buy a home. œThe Los Angeles areas current median home price is $477,300, up from $423,500 a year ago. I supported raising the conforming loan limit in designated high-cost areas to either the median home price of that area or 150% of the current limit. So the conforming loan limit in Los Angeles would be raised to $477,300, up from the current $359,650, Sherman continued. œFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are supposed to help average families buy homes, but they cannot currently help anyone with a home loan over $359,650. Many modest homes in the San Fernando Valley, and around the Los Angeles area, sell for well over that amount. With this legislation those two entities can finance mortgages in Los Angeles up to $509,230, Sherman explained. Shermans comments referred to the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005 (H.R. 1461), which recently passed the House Financial Services Committee and is expected to be considered by the full House in June.
05.26.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) applauded the inclusion of $2 Million for Bull Creek Channel Ecosystem Restoration in the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill passed by the House of Representatives late Tuesday. Bull Creek flows through Anthony C. Beilenson Park, an eighty acre park within the Sepulveda Basin, to the Los Angeles River. œThis funding will improve Beilenson Park substantially. It will prevent future damage caused by intense flooding in the area around Bull Creek, said Sherman. œIn addition, park patrons will have better access to the area. New pedestrian trails and a bridge will allow San Fernando Valley residents greater ability to enjoy the amenities the park has to offer. œI will continue to work to ensure that these important funds are included in the final bill. This project will further enhance Bull Creek through environmental restoration and by providing recreational benefits for thousands of park-goers. Several years ago Sherman secured $1.96 million in federal funds for the Sepulveda Basin to restore the wildlife area and to construct the Anthony C. Beilenson Park Extension Project. The Beilenson Park extension will provide a turnaround drop off area that includes handicapped parking spaces, a plaza with concrete benches, shade trees and restrooms. The 2,097-acre Sepulveda Basin is a federally owned flood control area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers currently leases 1,527 acres to the city of Los Angeles for recreational purposes. Recreational facilities include a wildlife area, Woodley Park, Beilenson Park, three golf courses, Hjelte Sports Field, tennis courts, Balboa Recreation Center, a dog park, cricket fields, the Japanese Garden Center and numerous playing fields, picnic areas and other amenities. The Energy and Water Appropriations bill currently awaits action in the Senate.
05.25.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hailed the passage of the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005 (H.R. 1461) by the House Financial Services Committee today. The bill included a Sherman proposal to increase the conforming loan limit --- the limit on the size of loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy --- in high cost areas, including the Los Angeles area. The Sherman provision will make loans easier to obtain and will lower interest rates in areas where the median home price far exceeds the national average. Sherman has pursued this issue in previous Congresses through stand alone legislation. œIncreasing the conforming loan limit will help homebuyers in the Los Angeles area at no cost to the taxpayer. If local banks can sell the loans they extend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the interest rates on those loans will be roughly Â¼% lower. This will result in savings of thousands of dollars for Los Angeles homebuyers who borrow up to $500,000 to buy a home, Sherman said. œThe Los Angeles areas current median home price is $477,300, up from $423,500 a year ago. The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act will raise the conforming loan limit in designated high cost areas to either the median home price of that area or 150% of the current limit. So the conforming loan limit in Los Angeles would be raised to $477,300, up from the current $359,650, Sherman continued. œFannie Mae and Freddie Mac are supposed to help average families buy homes, but they cannot help anyone with a home loan over $359,650. Many modest homes in the San Fernando Valley, and around the Los Angeles area, sell for well over that amount. With this legislation those two entities can finance mortgages in Los Angeles up to $509,230, Sherman explained. The Federal Housing Finance Reform Act will now be considered by the full House of Representatives and then go to the Senate.
05.25.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Sherman met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and delivered a letter expressing his concern over anti-Semitic portions of Palestinian textbooks and a failure to promote peace in the region. œThe United States has provided $1.4 billion in aid to the Palestinian people since 1993. However, the US cannot continue to support the Palestinian Authority, whether directly or indirectly, if the education system does not create the conditions necessary for peace, Sherman wrote.
05.24.2005	Sherman Oaks, CA - Congressman Brad Sherman congratulated Tyler Bailey from Cleveland High School, Emily Eisen from High Tech High School, and Leslie Lee from Cleveland High School. These students placed first, second and third respectively in the 27th Congressional District Student Art Competition. œThe work of all the participants is a magnificent representation of our many talented students in the San Fernando Valley. The three winners in particular make me regret that the Capitol only has room for one piece of artwork, Sherman said. œI commend all the students who entered the competition and express my congratulations to the contest winners. I also want to thank our excellent panel of judges. œI look forward to welcoming Tyler Bailey and his parents to Washington, DC for the unveiling of his digital photograph on June 14th. As I walk the halls of the Capitol complex during this next year, it will be gratifying to see a small piece of the San Fernando Valley hanging on the wall, Sherman continued. œI am also excited that all three winners will ride in the Canoga Park Memorial Day Parade on May 30th. I look forward to meeting them at the parade, Sherman added. The competition took place on May 21st and was open to all high school student in the 27th Congressional District. There were 19 participants. The event was judged by Stuart Vaughn of the Canoga Youth Art Center, Deane Leavenworth of Time Warner Cable, Dick Cooper of Telesis Credit Union, and Todd Brown of Channel 1 News. Tyler Bailey won an all expense paid trip for him and his parents to Washington, DC for the unveiling, donated by Time Warner Cable. The Telesis Credit Union donated I-Pods for all the winners.
05.17.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) called upon the Department of Defense to review its Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) net job loss figure in their Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Report. A review of the Report demonstrates that NBVC will have a job loss as high as 6,373 positions. Factoring in the anticipated job gains, the net loss is an estimated 5,495 positions at NBVC. In contrast, Appendix C of the Report, which was widely cited by the press, indicates a net loss of only 1,515 jobs. œThe Report is internally inconsistent on the economic effect on Ventura County, said Sherman, a CPA. œDo we lose a net of 1515 jobs or 5495? Or is it somewhere in between? The Defense Department has promised to provide me with revised and reliable figures soon. œIt is clear from this mistake that the Department of Defense has not fully considered the impact of the proposal on Americas military preparedness or on our communities, Sherman added. œThe much larger job loss figure makes it apparent that the realignment proposal is too drastic for such an important facility. I once again call on the BRAC Commission to reconsider the recommendation. Congressman Sherman has previously sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in support of NBVC. In addition, he joined with the entire California delegation and Governor Schwarzenegger in calling upon Secretary Rumsfeld to consider the importance of Californias military installations in meeting 21st Century challenges. NBVC is made up of Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. After September 11th, Point Mugu supported aircraft patrolling the skies above Los Angeles. Point Mugu aircraft have also provided fire fighting support and transported military and civilian response forces during man-made and natural disasters in the Los Angeles region. The BRAC Commission is currently reviewing the Secretarys suggestions and will be conducting hearings throughout the country. Their final recommendations will be presented to the President in September. If he accepts the list, Congress will have 45 days to reject the entire list, or else it takes effect.
05.13.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) called upon the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission to reject a recommendation by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld that certain functions currently performed at the Naval Base Ventura County (NBVC) be œrealigned and moved to other facilities. That suggestion was part of a list of recommendations that Secretary Rumsfeld sent to the Commission today. NBVC is one of 24 California facilities targeted for closure or realignment. œAlthough I am pleased that Secretary Rumsfeld did not recommend closure of this critical facility, I am disappointed that he has suggested reducing the size of the Department of Defenses commitment to the base, Sherman said. œThe Secretary certainly managed to ignore political pressure. Despite a Republican President, Republican Governor, and Republican Congressman, Ventura Naval Base still stands to lose over 1500 jobs under the realignment plans. Sherman previously sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld in support of NBVC. In addition, he joined with the entire California delegation and Governor Schwarzenegger in calling upon Secretary Rumsfeld to consider the importance of Californias military installations in meeting 21st Century challenges. Sherman stated that he, œWill continue to fight to ensure that the military importance of this facility if made known to the BRAC Commission, the President, and fellow Members of Congress. Naval Base Ventura County is made up of Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. After September 11th, Point Mugu supported aircraft patrolling the skies above Los Angeles. Point Mugu aircraft have also provided fire fighting support and transported military and civilian response forces during man made and natural disasters in the Los Angeles region. The facility includes a naval air station, naval air warfare center, naval satellite operations center, naval surface warfare center, and more. It is credited with generating over 15,000 direct and indirect jobs by the local Chamber of Commerce. œThese jobs are important to the entire Valley/Ventura County region, said Sherman. The BRAC Commission will take up the Secretarys suggestions, holding hearings throughout the country. Their final recommendations will go to the President in September. If he accepts the list, Congress will have 45 days to reject the entire list, or else it takes effect.
05.13.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) expressed skepticism at Defense Secretary Rumsfeld including the Navy-Marine Corps Reserve Center Encino in his list of recommendations for the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission. Over 240 reservists drill at the facility, and over a quarter of them have been mobilized since September 11th. œThe BRAC Commission must closely examine the value of the Navy-Marine Corps Reserve Center Encino, Sherman said, œMaking sure our fighting men and women have the best available training facilities should be a top priority. I will continue to reach out to the President and the BRAC Commission to ensure that the facilitys future is carefully examined. œShould the recommendation to close the Training Center be ratified, I will work with L.A. City to find the best use for the closed facility, Sherman added. The Reserve Center is located in the Sepulveda Basin. The Army Corp of Engineers owns the Basin and leases most of it to the Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation for a nominal amount. œIf the Reserve Center is closed. I will work to have the military lease the Reserve Center site to the City of Los Angeles for a nominal amount for recreation/educational purposes, Sherman said. The Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Center Encino opened in 1971, replacing a nearby facility in North Hollywood. There are currently 33 military personnel assigned full time to the facility. Together with the reservists who train there, the Center is a boost to the Valleys economy. After the Northridge earthquake, the Center housed a California Conservation Corps staff. The Centers classrooms are currently used by the Los Angeles police and fire department for training. The BRAC Commission will consider the Secretarys suggestions, holding hearings throughout the country. Their final recommendations will go to the President in September. If he accepts the list, Congress will have 45 days to reject the entire list, or else it takes effect.
03.22.2005	Sherman Oaks, CA. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) hosted a Town Hall Meeting on Social Security with special guest, Max Richtman, Executive Vice President of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare (NCPSSM). Over 450 people attended the community meeting at the ONEgeneration Center in Reseda, where Sherman and Richtman spoke about the current and future health of Social Security. œAll Americans should seek a comfortable retirement including IRAs, 401(k)s and similar accounts, said Sherman. œHowever, any sound retirement plan starts with an inflation-adjusted lifetime annuity “ a monthly check for life that you cannot lose, and you cannot outlive. This is what Social Security provides “ and it thus guarantees a base level of income, even if all else fails. Richtman, one of the nations foremost experts on Social Security, discussed how partial privatization of the program would affect current and future retirees. His organization, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, works to protect, preserve, promote, and ensure the financial security, health, and the wellbeing of current and future generations of maturing Americans. œThere is no free lunch in privatizing Social Security. Diverting money out of Social Security will create an even larger solvency problem, said Richtman. œThe privatizers fill part of this funding gap by dramatically cutting Social Security benefits for younger generations. They cover the rest by borrowing more money, thereby increasing the burden on young taxpayers by trillions of dollars over the next half-century. After Sherman and Richtmans opening remarks, attendees were allowed to make comments and ask questions. Audience members concerns were numerous, but focused mainly on the solvency of Social Security. There are over 136,000 San Fernando Valley residents who receive Social Security benefits. In light of the recent publicity on living wills, Sherman made available forms that a person can use to appoint a durable power of attorney for health care decisions. He also included instructions on how to complete the forms and where to go for free and low-cost legal assistance. In addition, members of Congressman Shermans staff were on hand to help constituents with any problems they may have with Social Security, Medicare and other federal agencies.
03.10.2005	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks, CA) applauded the inclusion of a provision that would permit high-mileage hybrid vehicles to use diamond lanes (HOV) in the Transportation Equity Act, H.R. 3. This provision is similar to the legislation that Sherman and his Republican colleague, Darrell Issa (R-Vista, CA) introduced earlier this year “ The Hybrid Vehicle HOV Access Act, H.R. 444. The provision in H.R. 3 would enable California to implement the recently-passed state law that allows high-mileage hybrids to use diamond lanes. Current federal law permits only high-occupancy (usually two persons), natural gas and electric vehicles to use HOV lanes. The California law, authored by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, allows 45 miles-per-gallon hybrids to use carpool lanes. The law was to go into effect January 1, but implementation has been indefinitely delayed until new federal legislation passed. H.R. 3 would permit states to regulate when and where high-mileage hybrid vehicles would be exempt from HOV regulations within the state. This means that a state could limit or restrict this exemption in areas where the HOV lanes are already at full capacity. œI believe it is important that the States have the flexibility to regulate the hybrid use of HOV lanes within their state, said Sherman. œIn some areas, it may not be favorable to have hybrids in HOV lanes due to congestion; in other areas, allowing hybrids in HOV lanes may provide incentive for consumers to use this technology. In either case, the decision should be left up to the states “ and the federal government should permit the states to make this decision. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 3 earlier today, and the bill will move to the Senate for their consideration.
03.10.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced today that the House of Representatives authorized $16 million for transportation projects in his district in the Transportation Equity Act, H.R. 3. Shermans district includes most of the West San Fernando Valley, and much of the South Valley. œI went to my colleagues seeking funds to repave and improve roads, provide lighting, and improve safety throughout my district, said Sherman. œWe secured $4.5 million for roads, lighting and safety in the Northwest Valley, $4 million in the Southwest Valley, $2.8 for roads in Van Nuys/Sherman Oaks and $700,000 million for roads elsewhere in the Valley. œWe also secured funds for transportation projects at Pierce College, Burbank Airport and Mission College. We secured federal funds toward adding a lane each on the 5 Freeway from the 134 to the 170, and we secured funds for the Reseda Blvd. Bus Transit Route. Finally, we secured $1 million to buy land and build trails in the Santa Monica Mountains, added Sherman. The House of Representatives passed H.R.3 earlier today, and the bill will move to the Senate for their consideration.

02.03.2005	Washington, D.C. -Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks, CA) has been reappointed to the House Committee on Science. Sherman is expected to serve on the Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics. In this session of Congress, the Committee will be dealing with a variety of issues important to the economy of the San Fernando Valley. This includes the vital reauthorization of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA contracts lead to more than $350 million for businesses in the San Fernando Valley every year. The Rocketdyne Plant, currently moving from Canoga Park to Chatsworth, builds the engines for the space shuttle and puts over $400 million into the Valley economy. There are reports that Boeing may sell the plant to United Technologies Corp. Shermans appointment to the Science Committee is extraordinary because he already serves on two major committees, International Relations and Financial Services. Sherman is the only one of the four Valley congressmen to serve on three committees. œServing on a third committee is a substantial time commitment, but the Science Committee is important to the nation and especially to the San Fernando Valley, Sherman said. œI am honored that my colleagues have asked me to serve on the Science Committee. In addition to overseeing NASAs work, the Committee on Science has jurisdiction over all non-defense federal scientific research and development (R&D). The Federal agencies that fall under the Committees jurisdiction (either completely or partially) include: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Department of Energy (DOE), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Science Foundation (NSF), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Fire Administration, and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
02.01.2005	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressmen Darrell Issa (R-Vista, CA) and Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks, CA) introduced legislation that would allow states to permit hybrid vehicles to use carpool lanes (high-occupancy vehicle lanes). This legislation, the Hybrid Vehicle HOV Access Act, would enable California to implement the recently passed law that allows high-mileage hybrids to use carpool lanes. Currently, federal law permits only high-occupancy (usually two persons), natural gas and electric vehicles to use HOV lanes. The California law, authored by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, allows 45 miles-per-gallon hybrids to use carpool lanes. The law was to go into effect January 1, but implementation has been indefinitely delayed until new federal legislation is passed. Issa quote: œStates should be allowed to permit all hybrids to use HOV lanes, or, to limit this privilege to high-mileage hybrids, or, if they choose, not allow any hybrids at all, said Sherman. œThe California bill works particularly well for California. Other states have different needs. I believe that the increased use of hybrid vehicles presents an opportunity to reduce our dependence oil imports and improve air quality. Both Issa and Sherman introduced versions of this bill last session but neither was passed into law before the 108th Congress adjourned.

01.20.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement on President Bushs inaugural address today: œDuring the campaign, the President gave us the rhetoric of General George Patton. In his inaugural address, he gave us the oratory of Jimmy Carter. Perhaps the policies of President Carter will follow. œI strained to see President Carters face as President Bush crystallized the theme of his address stating: ˜We will encourage reform in other governments by making clear that success in our relations will require the decent treatment of their own people. Americas belief in human dignity will guide our policies. œOn domestic issues, President Bush seemed to equate ending slavery with ending Social Security as we know it. I would respond: œIts a cold day in Washington. It will be a cold day in Hell before we privatize Social Security.
01.07.2005	Washington, D.C. - The South/South-East Asian tsunami disaster that occurred on December 26 is one of the largest natural disasters in recorded history. With an estimated 150,000 dead, and millions left homeless and threatened with disease, hunger and thirst, the global community is rallying together to help the victims. In the San Fernando Valley, there are community organizations and religious centers gathering donations of clothing, medical supplies, and money for the relief efforts. œFirst of all, I would like to extend my deepest condolences to the people of South and Southeast Asia and eastern Africa, and to the Valley families who have lost loved ones in this disaster said Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman). œThe level of devastation in these areas has reached almost unimaginable proportion. I commend the Valley organizations that are working to the assist the victims. I hope that everyone in the Valley will join the effort to help during this very difficult time. œMany of my constituents have called my office in Washington and Sherman Oaks to ask how they can help. In response, I have put together a partial list of organizations in the Valley and nationally, that are collecting clothes, financial donations, medical supplies and other non-perishable items, said Sherman.

01.03.2005	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) released the following statement on the death of his colleague Congressman Robert T. Matsui (D-CA): œIt is with great sorrow that I join my fellow Members in mourning the passing of our colleague, Bob Matsui. Both California and America have lost a respected leader and more importantly, a good man who was committed to his constituents, his family and his nation. œBob was a dedicated colleague who worked tirelessly on the behalf of our seniors. He always fought for Americas children, to create economic justice, and to protect Social Security. His work, accomplishments, and life are an inspiration to all Americans. œI have been honored to serve with and know Bob. I send my sincerest condolences to his wife, Doris, and family.
11.22.2004	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks) announced the approval of almost $2 million in federal funds to help improve Valley roads and enhance facilities that provide services for seniors, veterans and youth. Sherman secured funding for projects ranging from an additional lane for the 101 Ventura Freeway Van Nuys Boulevard off-ramp, to expansion of the North Valley YMCA, to digital equipment for High Tech High in Van Nuys that were included in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill, which passed Congress on Saturday. œI am pleased that I was able to secure funds that will help ease Valley traffic congestion and provide community services for residents, said Sherman. The bill includes the funding for the following Valley projects: One million dollars will be provided for the construction of the additional lane to the northbound 101 Ventura Freeway at Van Nuys Blvd off-ramp. The Valley is ranked as one of the most heavily congested areas in the country, and the 101/405 Interchange was recently named the most congested bottleneck in the country. The Northeast Valley Health Center (NEVHC) will receive $70,000 to undergo extensive renovations and acquire equipment at a Park Primary Health Center in Canoga Park. NEVHC currently operates ten licensed clinics throughout the San Fernando and Santa Clarita Valleys, and provides health care services to families who are medically underserved, regardless of their ability to pay. El Proyecto del Barrio has been allocated $180,000 to develop a medical wing for HIV patients on the second floor of its Winnetka clinic. For ten years, El Proyecto del Barrio has provided medical care for HIV clients in the San Fernando Valley. High Tech High, on the campus of Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, will receive $390,000 to purchase video equipment, computers, digital peripherals, software and furniture for students in the classroom. High Tech High connects high school students and teachers to resources in the œreal world of advanced technology that reaches far beyond the capabilities of traditional schools. The North Valley YMCA in Porter Ranch will receive $75,000 to add 40 more parking spaces, a warm water therapy pool, a two-floor expansion for a youth room, and several multi-purpose exercise rooms to meet increased demand. The Omnibus Appropriations Bill is expected to be approved by the Senate and will be sent to the President for his signature.
11.19.2004	Washington, D.C. - Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) introduced legislation that would allow states to permit hybrid vehicles to use diamond lanes (high-occupancy vehicle lanes). This legislation, the Hybrid HOV Access Act, would enable California to implement the recently passed law that allows high-mileage hybrids to use diamond lanes. Currently, federal law only permits high-occupancy (usually two persons), natural gas and electric vehicles to use HOV lanes. The new California law, authored by Assemblywoman Fran Pavley and signed by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, allows 45 miles-per-gallon hybrids to use diamond lanes. However the California law cannot go into effect without new federal legislation. œMy legislation encourages the use of hybrid vehicles. It allows the states to decide whether to allow hybrids to use the diamond lanes. It also allows states to decide that only high-mileage hybrids are permitted to use diamond lanes, said Sherman. œI am pleased that my approach has the support of Governor Schwarzenegger, and am working to build support in Congress, especially among California Republicans, added Sherman. Governor Schwarzenegger expressed last week in Japan that œwere the number one state really interested in energy-efficient cars¦ diamond lanes [should be] open to those cars... He also cited the new California law while encouraging Japanese automakers to build new hybrid vehicle plants in California. œOpposition to the bill comes from those who insist that if a state allows high-mileage hybrids to use the diamond lanes, it must allow all hybrids, even potentially hybrid Hummers. I think the California law, which opens the diamond lanes only to hybrids that get 45 mpg, ought to be allowed to go into effect, said Sherman. Late last year, Sherman introduced legislation that would extend the $2,000 tax deduction for hybrid vehicle purchases for three more years. This provision was included in the comprehensive tax bill that President Bush signed into law on October 22, 2004. For information or a copy of the legislation, contact Sharon Singh at 202.225.5911 or Sharon.Singh@mail.house.gov
11.18.2004	Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Brad Sherman (D-CA) introduced a constitutional amendment to reform the of Congress in electing the President of the United States when no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, or when the electoral college is tied. œShould the electors fail to elect a president, the House of Representatives votes by state delegations. Thus, the 85 Members from California and Texas would be equal to the two Members from Wyoming and Vermont. This scenario is unfair and undemocratic, Sherman said. Shermans legislation states that when the House of Representatives is called to elect the President, each Member of the House should have one vote. œA split Electoral College would occur in a time of great national division, and potentially at a time of national crisis. It is critical that whoever is selected president has the support of the American people. A scenario in which the President could be selected by Members of Congress representing less than a third of this nations population “ where the 500,000 people who live in Wyoming have the same effect in the election as the 34 million living in California “ is unacceptable and dangerous, Sherman said. In order to take effect, a constitutional amendment must receive a 2/3 vote in both the House and the Senate and then be ratified by the state legislatures of 3/4 of the states. For a copy of the legislation, contact Sharon Singh at 202.225.5911 or Sharon.Singh@mail.house.gov
