03.14.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, 114 House members led by Reps. Walorski (R-Ind.), Kind (D-Wis.), Foxx (R-N.C.) and Craig (D-Minn.) sent a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in support of keeping agricultural products as a key negotiating objective in any proposed trade agreement with the European Union (EU). The European Commission has specifically excluded agricultural products in draft negotiations and Commission officials continually state their unwillingness to include agriculture in the negotiation process. “As you know, agriculture is the source of a great number of trade barriers and irritants in the U.S.-EU trading relationship. Thus, an agreement with the EU that does not address trade in agriculture would be, in our eyes, unacceptable,” the members wrote. “We want to voice our strong support for the inclusion of agriculture in the upcoming discussions and to reiterate that an agreement that fails to include agricultural products would be deficient, significantly jeopardizing Congressional support.” The full text is below. Dear Ambassador Lighthizer, We write today to urge you to insist on the inclusion of agricultural products in upcoming trade negotiations with the European Union (EU). As you know, agriculture is the source of a great number of trade barriers and irritants in the U.S.-EU trading relationship. Thus, an agreement with the EU that does not address trade in agriculture would be, in our eyes, unacceptable. The United States and EU share one of the largest trading relationships in the world, but there are many ways in which the two sides can further grow and improve this relationship. Nowhere is this more evident than in trade in agricultural products. Exports from hardworking American farmers and ranchers across the country face barriers to the EU market, including high tariffs, unscientific sanitary and phytosanitary measures, and protectionist policies on geographical indications that hurt American exports not only to the EU but also to countries all over the world. We were encouraged to see that the negotiating objectives for the EU that your office released in January included specific objectives on agricultural goods. At the same time, we were deeply disappointed that the European Commission’s draft negotiating mandates specifically excluded agricultural products and that Commission officials continue to state publicly that they will not discuss agriculture in the negotiations. We want to voice our strong support for the inclusion of agriculture in the upcoming discussions and to reiterate that an agreement that fails to include agricultural products would be deficient, significantly jeopardizing Congressional support. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Sincerely, ### Walorski represents the 2nd Congressional District of Indiana, serving as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Ron Kind represents Wisconsin’s Third Congressional District. He serves on the Trade and Health subcommittees of the House Ways and Means Committee. U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor. U.S. Rep. Angie Craig represents Minnesota’s 2nd Congressional District. She serves on the House Committees for Agriculture, Transportation and Infrastructure and Small Business.
03.07.2019	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the House passed an amendment to H.R. 1 introduced by Rep. Foxx (R-N.C.) and Rep. Rouda (D-Calif.) which would codify a Senate rule that requires transparency for sources of compensation for Congressional fellowships. While House ethics rules currently bar fellowship programs from giving an “undue advantage to special interests,” the House of Representatives lacks a reporting requirement to expose conflicts of interest. The Foxx-Rouda amendment would mandate that all Legislative Branch offices disclose the rate and source of compensation for Congressional Fellows to their chamber’s respective ethics committee. Foxx stated, “It’s no secret that access to policy makers influences what policy takes shape. And it should not be a secret where funding for personnel in the Legislative Branch comes from. Taxpayers have a right to know if Congressional Fellows are working on legislation pertaining to the very interest group they are being paid by to support their work in Congress, and this amendment would require just that.” Rep. Rouda said, “I was especially proud to work with my Republican colleague Rep. Virginia Foxx to harmonize a Senate rule with the rules of the House to shore up Congressional ethics. The people of Orange County sent me to Congress because they were disillusioned with the nature of our partisan politics. I’m pleased that I could find common ground with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this common-sense amendment.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor. U.S. Rep. Harley Rouda represents California’s 48th Congressional District.
02.27.2019	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R - N.C.) voted in favor of S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act. This legislation reflects a bipartisan Senate-House agreement that includes important provisions to increase access to federal lands for sportsmen. It clarifies that all Bureau of Land Management and National Forest System lands shall be open to hunting, recreational shooting and fishing unless explicitly closed for safety or other reasons decided with public input. Rep. Foxx stated, “This bill delivers for public lands and surrounding communities across the country. Opening the door to more fishing, hunting and other outdoor recreation in our public lands will support the over 260,000 outdoor industry jobs statewide. It also takes the important step of reauthorizing the Blue Ridge National Heritage Area to preserve our nation’s most visited—and most beautiful—national park. The work to comprehensively address the National Park Services’ maintenance backlog does not end here, but I am pleased to send this important legislation to the President’s desk.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
02.19.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Foxx (R-N.C.) voted in favor of H.J. Res. 31. This bill provides remaining appropriations to the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies of the federal government for Fiscal Year 2019. It includes $22.54 billion for border security, including 55 miles of new physical barriers, surveillance, technology and personnel to combat illegal immigration and human and drug trafficking. It also funds additional immigration judge teams to address the backlog of immigration cases in the judicial system. Rep. Foxx stated, “This bill reflects a bipartisan compromise between the House and Senate to fulfill Congress’s responsibility to maintain a fully functioning government and provide for the nation’s security. While it does not provide the full amount necessary to secure our borders, it’s a long way from the $1 Speaker Pelosi was willing to provide toward a physical border barrier. Therefore, it is important to take this step and continue increasing border security at every opportunity.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
02.05.2019	WASHINGTON – Tonight, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) issued the following statement on President Trump’s State of the Union address: “We are in the era of opportunity. America is in the midst of the longest period of continuous jobs growth on record, with American workers and families reaping the benefits. Since President Trump’s election, the U.S. economy has gained 5.3 million more jobs, unemployment continues to hold at historic lows and wages are rising as opportunity abounds. Republicans are working with the President to continue these positive trends in our country. “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been leading the way to lower the cost of health care for Americans. We passed Association Health Plans to let small businesses band together to get health care, strengthened Health Savings Accounts, provided long-term funding for CHIP and passed historic legislation to fight the opioid scourge. Now, we need to tackle the high cost of prescription drugs by working as diligently in this area as we have to increase health care choices and affordability over the past couple of years. “The President has followed through on his promise to negotiate new trade agreements that benefit American workers, farmers and businesses. As we’ve done with job growth in our country, we need to direct attention to increasing our competitive edge on the global scale. I support the President’s pursuit of overdue reforms that favor free trade and accountability for America’s trade partners. “Thankfully, in a culture where the value of life has been eroded, the President supports the rights of the unborn and newborns. State legislators now use their power to eliminate the right to life and promote the idea that life is dispensable, even in the case where a child is viable and the mother’s life is not in danger. All life deserves protection under the law, and I will continue to fight to protect the rights of the unborn and newborns of our society from the atrocities of abortion and infanticide. “We’ve always been a nation of immigrants, and yes, we need safe and legal immigration that President Trump calls for. We need to know who’s coming into this country. We need to know why they want to be in this country, and we want them to be contributing members of our society. So, we need to fix our broken immigration system by making sure our borders are secure and that those who want to join the greatest country in the world will share America’s successes and help our country of opportunity become even greater.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
01.28.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R - N.C.) introduced H.R. 805, the Robo Calls Off Phones Act (Robo COP) Act. The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do Not Call registry to prohibit automated campaign messages from dialing telephone numbers on the national registry. Rep. Foxx stated, “Every election season Americans are inundated with pre-recorded campaign calls that flood their home phone lines. Just as unsolicited sales calls from telemarketers are an unwelcome intrusion for many Americans, political robocalls are often viewed as a nuisance and come at inconvenient times for many individuals and families. The Robo COP Act would eliminate a special carveout for political campaigns, making politicians play by the same rules as everyone else who makes robocalls. Just as individuals are able to opt out of unsolicited sales calls, they should have the right to opt out of receiving campaign robocalls.” The legislation would apply only to unsolicited, political robocalls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
01.25.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, President Trump announced an agreement to fund the federal government until February 15, 2019. Rep. Virginia Foxx stated, “Today’s agreement temporarily ends the unfortunate partial government shutdown, but it is not the end of negotiations to keep the government open permanently and protect our national security. My hope is that Democrats will set aside politics and follow through on their pledge to discuss real solutions after re-opening the government. The conference committee being formed to determine funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security provides Congress an opportunity to negotiate bipartisan approval of the funding necessary to secure our southern border. Congress should follow its own example from the bipartisan passage of the Secure Fence Act of 2006 mandating a physical barrier. I remain committed to exploring every possible tool available to protect our border, and I am very pleased that those who have been so negatively impacted by this partial shutdown will see their services and paychecks restored. Now, Congress must fulfil its number one duty to bolster national security by passing Homeland Security appropriations that strengthen and secure our porous southern border.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
01.18.2019	WASHINGTON ­­– Yesterday, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R – N.C.) introduced H.R. 661, the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Act of 2019. The bill would codify President Trump’s Protecting Life in Global Health Assis­­­tance (PLGHA), formerly known as the Mexico City Policy. The PLGHA requires foreign NGOs to agree, as a condition of receiving global health assistance, that they will not perform or actively promote abortion. Rep. Foxx stated, “The U.S. is the largest provider of global health funding in the world, and every dollar of funding we provide should be spent on health care that affirms the dignity of human life. When we provide funding to foreign abortion providers and simply say the money cannot be spent on abortion, we are only subsidizing the costs of providing abortion in other ways. Supporting the termination of human life in the names of ‘global health’ and ‘economic development’ must end for good, and this bill would do just that.” Yesterday, Senator Mike Lee (R – UT) also introduced a companion bill, S. 190, Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Act of 2019. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor.
01.17.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 150, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act, with 422 aye votes. Sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R – N.C.) and Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D – Los Angeles), the GREAT Act will streamline the federal grant reporting process by mandating the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to develop a standardized, government-wide reporting system for federal grant recipients. By replacing outdated, disconnected grant documents with searchable open data, the GREAT Act will increase transparency from grantmaking agencies, reduce compliance costs for grant recipients, and improve congressional oversight of grants awarded by the executive branch. “As a former researcher, librarian and college president, I have been grant-writing for all of my professional life,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx. “It’s hard to believe that the same challenges I faced at the beginning of my career are the same ones faced by federal grant recipients today. The grant reporting process is riddled with antiquated reporting methods that hinder efficiency for grant recipients and transparency for taxpayers. The GREAT Act will bring federal grant reporting into the 21st century with searchable documents and open data.” “The federal government spends an enormous part of its yearly budget — over $600 billion — on grants issued to state and local governments, agencies, small-businesses, and non-profit organizations,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez. “These federal dollars touch almost every aspect of American society, highlighting the need to streamline the grant reporting process and make it as transparent as possible to the public. By leveraging technology, the GREAT Act will make the grant reporting process more equitable, efficient, and accessible. I’m proud to have worked across the aisle with Rep. Virginia Foxx to make government work better for the people.” Originally introduced in the previous Congress as H.R. 4887, the GREAT Act passed by voice in the House of Representatives on September 27, 2018 but was not passed in the Senate before the end of the 115th Congress. Supporters of the GREAT Act include: Bipartisan Policy Center Action (BPC Action) American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) American Library Association (ALA) Association of Government Accountants (AGA) Association of Research Libraries (ARL) Data Coalition Demand Progress Government Accountability Project (GAP) Government Information Watch Grant Professionals Association (GPA) National Grants Management Association (NGMA) National Taxpayers Union (NTU) Native American Finance Officers Association (NAFOA) Project On Government Oversight (POGO) R Street Institute, Senior Executives Association (SEA) Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the Senior Republican of the House Committee on Education and Labor. U.S. Rep. Jimmy Gomez represents California’s 34th District.
01.09.2019	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) introduced H.R. 296, the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act. This bill codifies President Trump’s Protect Life Rule that excludes abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, from receiving Title X funding. H.R. 296 prohibits awards of federal family planning grants to entities that perform elective abortions and increases reporting requirements for the Department of Health and Human Services for more transparency and accountability. Rep. Foxx stated, “When the Title X Family Planning Program was created in 1970, Congress made it clear that abortion was not an acceptable form of family planning, stating, ‘None of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.’ Since then, the original intent of the law has been undermined as Title X funds have routinely contributed to employee salaries, facility costs, and medical supplies for abortion providers. The Protect Life Rule was an important step to end this exploitation of the law, and the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act will make sure taxpayer dollars don’t subsidize abortion providers under any future Administrations.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is Ranking Member of the House Committee on Education & Labor.
12.22.2018	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after the U.S. Senate failed to consider the House-passed continuing resolution funding the federal government by the December 21 deadline. The House passed its continuing resolution on Thursday, December 20, which included $5.7 billion for a border wall and fully funded the federal government through February 8, 2019. “This shutdown was preventable, and it is a shame that a strong border securing our nation is no longer the bipartisan priority it once was. Under President Bush, the Secure Fence Act passed handily in the House and Senate, 283-138 and 80-19 respectively. Congress should not be divided on keeping the government open while fulfilling our duty to protect our nation. Nor should we allow politics to disrupt the services owed to American taxpayers. It is my intention to continue working with all parties interested in solutions to end this shutdown and make progress toward a border wall. I hope that Senate Democrats are willing to cooperate.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
11.28.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) cosponsored H.R. 7059, the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act. The bill appropriates the full amount of funding requested by President Trump to construct a wall along the Southern border, including technology and infrastructure improvements. Additionally, it affirms Congressional opposition to abolishing ICE, supports border patrol agents, penalizes sanctuary cities and combats transnational crimes including human and drug trafficking. Rep. Foxx stated, “As a nation built upon the rule of law, it is crucial for our national security and integrity that we strengthen and secure our Southern border. Congress should fully cooperate with President Trump’s request for border wall funding because national security is the number one job of the federal government. To keep America safe, we must go further to prevent illegal immigration and other crimes carried out across our Southern border. I am proud to cosponsor the Build the Wall, Enforce the Law Act because it gives priority to our national security, will make our country safer and ensure our immigration system is fairer for those who desire to come here lawfully.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
10.18.2018	TOBACCOVILLE – Today Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC05) toured Tobaccoville Manufacturing of Reynolds American Inc. (RAI). She met with business leaders and employees to hear first-hand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is impacting business practices and workers. Rep. Foxx voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which became law on December 22, 2017. Rep. Foxx stated, “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a win-win for workers and business leaders. Not only are workers keeping more of their hard-earned money, local businesses are expanding and passing on their tax savings to workers. As I toured R.J. Reynolds' manufacturing operations, I met employees who received $1000 bonuses and saw the company’s new investments in research and development—both made possible thanks to the tax cuts. I am proud to support this company’s strong commitment to employees’ success with pro-growth and pro-business legislation.” “RAI and its operating companies thank Congresswoman Foxx for working to protect North Carolina manufacturers and jobs. Comprehensive tax reform benefited the employees and companies in her district and throughout the country. Tax reform put $1,000 directly into the pockets of many working families here in North Carolina when we declared a bonus for our employees and to invest half of the tax savings in potentially reduced risk products in order to further our vision of transforming tobacco,” stated Nancy Hawley, Executive Vice President - Operations of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.

10.09.2018	WASHINGTON – In light of the misinformation circulating about my vote against the FAA Reauthorization Act, many constituents have asked for an in-depth explanation of my stance. First, to set the record straight, I do support Hurricane Florence relief funding and have taken several steps to ensure that North Carolinians receive the help they need. On September 26, I voted to provide $8.8 billion to FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund to ensure FEMA remains able to effectively assess the damage and administer disaster relief during this time of recovery. I also had signed two letters to President Trump that requested approval of North Carolina’s State of Emergency declaration and federal assistance. That same day, I voted against the FAA Reauthorization Act because it was not a disaster relief bill—as many are incorrectly asserting—and it was nowhere close to the conservative principles that have long guided my voting. Rather, it was a Christmas tree full of many unrelated pieces of legislation that contained all sorts of bad public policy. It contained bills that would never pass on their own merits and were inserted into what was considered a “must pass” bill to reauthorize the FAA. My constituents have consistently expressed their frustration to me when members of Congressional leadership take this tactic. It is important to follow regular order and resist this manner of pushing through legislation. For these reasons, along with 22 other brave members of the House, both Republican and Democrat, I opposed the legislation. Among the terrible policies in the FAA bill, a couple of pieces of crony capitalism stand out. One such provision subsidizes private sector investments in foreign nations, putting taxpayers on the hook for risky investments similar to the Ex-Im Bank which I have long opposed. Another was the BUILD Act, which establishes a mandatory fee for concrete masonry products to enable government-aided advertising. What is being touted as ‘disaster relief,’ is an appropriation for the Community Development Block Grant (CBDG) program that will not support immediate relief projects. These funds are often not available for 12-18 months after the disaster, and it is a disservice to victims to place them in the category of ‘disaster relief.’ As we learned with Hurricane Sandy, these funds will be used years down the road to fund unrelated pet projects. Furthermore, these kinds of grants are notorious for performing extremely poorly for taxpayers. In fact, there are still $700 million CBDG funds unaccounted for after Hurricane Katrina 14 years ago. I want hard-working taxpayers’ dollars to be spent wisely and to help the people who need help. CDBG does neither of these effectively. Going forward, I will continue to work with my colleagues to provide meaningful disaster relief to those harmed by Hurricane Florence as I have done in the past.
09.27.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday the House passed H.R. 4887, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act, sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) and Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles). In 2017, the federal government awarded $662.7 billion in grant funding to state agencies, local and tribal governments, agencies, non-profits, universities, and other organizations. The GREAT Act mandates the Office of Management and Budget develop a modern, standardized reporting system for recipients that easily translates into open data. These 21st century reforms will bring increased transparency to how taxpayer dollars are spent and improve Congressional oversight of grants awarded by the Executive branch. Rep. Foxx stated, “To get the most out of each taxpayer dollar, the federal government has to keep pace with the technological advances that make our digital society ever-more efficient. That means implementing new, uniform data standards for federal grant reporting and leaving behind antiquated document-based methods. The GREAT Act requires the Executive branch to take these necessary steps, which will lead to decreased compliance costs for grant recipients and increased public scrutiny of grant spending. Rep. Gomez has been an outstanding partner in co-authoring this bill and I thank him for his hard work on getting it passed in the House.” Rep. Gomez stated, “Every year, the U.S. government issues over $600 billion in federal grants to state and local governments, agencies, small-businesses, and non-profit organizations. It’s important that every grant dollar issued is tracked and held to account, but the grant reporting process is riddled with complexities and redundant paperwork. The GREAT Act will modernize the way the government does business by standardizing and simplifying grant reporting information into searchable open data. This will make the grant reporting process more transparent, efficient, and accessible to everyday Americans. I’m proud to have worked alongside Rep. Virginia Foxx to write the GREAT Act and have it passed by voice in the House of Representatives.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Rep. Jimmy Gomez represents California’s 34th Congressional District. He currently serves on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee.
09.26.2018	WASHINGTON – Today Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted in favor of an appropriations package for Fiscal Year 2019, which combines the Defense and Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bills with a continuing resolution that extends funding for remaining departments of the federal government at Fiscal Year 2018 levels until December 7, 2018. Rep. Foxx stated, “Today, for the first time in over twenty years, Congress has approved 75% of all discretionary spending before the end of the fiscal year. This includes the entire defense budget, which means the Department of Defense has more fiscal certainty to rebuild and strengthen our military than it’s had in two decades. The bill also provides a well-deserved pay raise to our country’s selfless warfighters—the largest increase in nine years. Additionally, this bill delivers funding for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund, making $8.8 billion available to assist with Hurricane Florence relief. As our state continues to sustain Hurricane Florence’s devastation, it is crucial to ensure FEMA remains able to administer disaster relief in the recovery ahead and effectively assess the damage. The power of the purse is one of Congress’ greatest duties and we will continue to work on the appropriations bills that remain. Nevertheless, today marks significant progress made in Republicans’ fight to return to regular order and our promise to responsibly steward the tax dollars of the American people.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
09.14.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, North Carolina’s entire Congressional delegation, led by Senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr, sent a letter to President Trump requesting that the administration swiftly approve Governor Cooper’s request for an expedited Major Disaster Declaration as Hurricane Florence brings historic flooding and destruction to counties across North Carolina. “The severity of damage and number of areas impacted is rapidly increasing and is forecast to worsen drastically in the coming days,” the members wrote. “Accordingly, we sincerely appreciate your timely consideration of this expedited Major Disaster Declaration request.” “Although the totality of devastation will continue to unfold, it is imperative that North Carolina has the resources now to begin the recovery process,” the members continued. “We again respectfully request you approve this Major Disaster Declaration consistent with the intended purposes of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Stafford Act to allow our local and state officials, in coordination with federal partners, to begin rebuilding our great state.” Full text of the letter to the President is below. September 14, 2018 Dear Mr. President, As Members of Congress representing the people of North Carolina, we write in support of Governor Cooper's request for an expedited Major Disaster Declaration for the State of North Carolina under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act for events occurring since September 14, 2018, and which are still occurring. The expedited Major Disaster Declaration is for both individual assistance and public assistance, including direct federal assistance for counties across North Carolina. Hurricane Florence has only begun to make landfall and has already inflicted tremendous damage across North Carolina’s coastal counties. The severity of damage and number of areas impacted is rapidly increasing and is forecast to worsen drastically in the coming days. Accordingly, we sincerely appreciate your timely consideration of this expedited Major Disaster Declaration request. Currently 76 counties have declared local states of emergency, 22 counties are under a hurricane warning with an additional 23 counties under tropical storm warnings. Due to evacuations, the state has already opened 131 shelters, housing over 6,900 residents. Additionally, 2,800 National Guardsmen have been activated and numerous search/rescue and high water rescue teams have been deployed. Although the totality of devastation will continue to unfold, it is imperative that North Carolina has the resources now to begin the recovery process. We thank you for granting our advanced emergency declaration request on September 10, 2018, and we commend your administration for its diligence and assistance thus far. We again respectfully request you approve this Major Disaster Declaration consistent with the intended purposes of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Stafford Act to allow our local and state officials, in coordination with federal partners, to begin rebuilding our great state.

09.10.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, North Carolina’s entire Congressional delegation, led by Senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr, sent a letter to President Trump requesting that the administration approve Governor Roy Cooper’s Emergency Declaration in advance of Hurricane Florence’s landfall. “Hurricane Florence poses an imminent and dangerous threat to North Carolina, and its approach necessitates the state to once again activate the State Emergency Response Team and numerous other state resources,” the members wrote. “An Emergency Declaration will provide the needed assistance to the state and local communities to allow them to properly prepare for the effects of Hurricane Florence. We respectfully request you approve this declaration and enable North Carolina to prepare for the potential disaster, consistent with the intended purposes of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Stafford Act.” Full text of the letter to the President is below. September 10, 2018 Dear President Trump, As Members of Congress representing the people of North Carolina, we write in support of Governor Cooper's request for an Emergency Declaration under Section 501(a) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. We respectfully request your immediate consideration and approval of this Emergency Declaration as the state prepares for Hurricane Florence. Since April 2018, North Carolina state and local emergency management agencies have responded to tornado damage in Guilford and Rockingham Counties and major flooding and mudslides in 34 of our western counties. Hurricane Florence poses an imminent and dangerous threat to North Carolina, and its approach necessitates the state to once again activate the State Emergency Response Team and numerous other state resources. An Emergency Declaration will provide the needed assistance to the state and local communities to allow them to properly prepare for the effects of Hurricane Florence.

07.24.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the House passed H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act by a bipartisan vote of 283 - 132. This legislation permanently repeals the 2.3 percent excise tax on the value of medical devices sold domestically. According to the Tax Foundation, the medical device tax cost approximately 21,800 jobs from 2013 to 2015. Although the tax was suspended in calendar years 2016-17 and 2018-19, it was scheduled to take effect again December 31, 2019. Foxx stated, “Many medical device manufacturers in North Carolina’s fifth district have reported how the medical device excise tax hinders medical innovation, costs jobs, decreases research and development, and slows capital expansion. A fundamentally flawed policy, the medical device excise tax was intended to pay for Obamacare’s massive costs to taxpayers. Instead, it burdens those taxpayers and innovators who are the back bone of our economy and forces them to pass off higher prices to consumers. As an original cosponsor of this legislation, I’m pleased to restore stability to the medical device industry so that it can envision future investments in our state and serve patients with greater clarity going forward.” ### U.S. Rep.

07.23.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the president signed into law H.R. 951, introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC). H.R. 951 provides a six-year extension to the deadline for commencement of the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project in Wilkes County, NC. Since the project requires extensive coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilkesboro Hydropower asked for an extension of the commencement deadline to retain valid licensure for the project. Rep. Foxx stated, “Increasing energy availability and reducing reliance on non-renewable energy is an important goal for rural development and economic growth. As a strong supporter of renewable energy, I applaud Wilkesboro Hydropower’s aim to refurbish the W. Kerr Scott Dam into a source of hydroelectricity. Now that the project has been granted another six years to begin construction, my hope is that Wilkes County will see the Kerr Scott Hydropower Project underway in the near future.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
07.17.2018	WASHINGTON – As one of democracy’s most important defenses, the press must be protected to report freely, yet be held to high standards. So, it’s unfortunate to have to call into question a paper’s accuracy and fairness, especially on the issue of Russia’s malicious attempt to influence the 2016 election. Late last night, the Winston-Salem Journal failed to meet these standards with its willfully uninformed editorial on the Helsinki Summit. Instead of focusing on its position criticizing the president, the editorial board attacked members of congress for allegedly failing to respond to the summit. That charge was leveled in spite of the fact that the Journal never reached out for a statement on the summit, as several other local media outlets did. The outlets that asked received the following statement at 4:41 p.m.: “The findings of our nation’s intelligence agencies and the House Committee on Intelligence leave no doubt that Russia maliciously attempted to influence our elections. The U.S.-Russia Summit was an opportunity to hold Putin accountable for his attacks on our country’s interests and to put him on record for his indiscretions. His disregard for American values and tyranny precludes a relationship necessary to achieve diplomatic goals. This was an opportunity for the president to take a strong stance for American interests and condemn the actions of a foreign adversary.” Several hours later, the Journal’s editorial claimed I said nothing, while at the same time other media outlets were reporting my statement. Regardless of its view on my positions, the Journal has a responsibility to its readers and the Forsyth County community to report honestly and to allow them to draw their own conclusions. Recently the Journal, unlike other local media outlets, also failed to report on the visit of a federal cabinet secretary, U.S. Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, to Winston-Salem where he had important conversations with the Second Harvest Food Bank, Forsyth Tech, local contractors, and an opioid addiction recovery center. Readers deserve better than this pattern of malpractice. While I cannot ensure the media always lives up to its standards, I can and will continue to ensure constituents are able to hear from me directly through personal correspondence, social media, and the many public events I attend.
07.13.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the House passed H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act (UMITA) introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) by a bipartisan vote of 230 - 168. UMITA strengthens the bipartisan Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) by closing loopholes that allow the federal government to work around the transparency process. It also expands the scope of UMRA cost analyses to the private sector. Rep. Foxx stated, “Americans are tired of far-off Washington bureaucrats making decisions behind closed doors without understanding the real-word consequences. The weaknesses in our current law have allowed federal regulators to escape public scrutiny and remain unaccountable for mandates’ true economic costs. Taxpayers deserve to know whether the costs of compliance will make it harder for businesses to stay afloat and for state and local governments to achieve citizens’ priorities. UMITA restores transparency and forces regulators to think carefully about the indirect costs of mandates before passing them on to North Carolinians. Additionally, this bill provides the public opportunity to suggest alternatives that don’t drain state and local government coffers. Every regulation should be deliberative and economically defensible, and I am pleased that a bipartisan majority of my colleagues agree UMITA will make our regulatory environment work better for the American people.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
06.29.2018	WASHINGTON – Thursday night, the U.S. Senate passed H.R. 951, introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC). H.R. 951 provides a six-year extension to the deadline for commencement of the W. Kerr Scott Hydropower Project in Wilkes County, NC. Since the project requires extensive coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Wilkesboro Hydropower, LLC sought relief from Congress to extend the deadline for commencement of construction and avoid forfeiting licensure for the project. H.R. 951 previously passed the House by a voice vote on June 12, 2017 and now awaits the president’s signature. Rep. Foxx stated, “As a federal representative, I give great importance to advocating effectively for the needs of North Carolina businesses to realize their potential in serving the community and expanding the economy. The W. Kerr Scott Dam Project is a perfect example of such a situation where I was pleased to support Wilkesboro Hydropower’s project to develop renewable energy in Wilkes County. The corporation plans to refurbish the W. Kerr Scott Dam into a source of hydroelectricity, currently used only as a system for flood control and water supply. This project will go a long way to increase overall availability of energy and reduce reliance on non-renewable sources. As a strong supporter of renewable energy, I hope to see construction begin soon.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
06.28.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the House passed H.R. 6157, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2019. This legislation is consistent with funding levels set in the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2019 and provides a $17.1 billion baseline increase in funding from Fiscal Year 2018. Rep. Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement in support of its passage. “After years of negligence under the Obama Administration, our military suffers a readiness crisis leaving it underpaid, overworked and ill-prepared to face security threats from our foreign adversaries. Our nation’s brave warfighters deserve assurance that their sacrifices for our country will be met with adequate resources and compensation. This legislation provides our troops with the largest pay increase in nearly a decade, fulfills the department’s request for increased personnel, and funds substantial equipment procurement and defense research and development. Congress must continue to rebuild our armed forces and restore military readiness, and I believe this measure will effectively do so.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
06.22.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the House passed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 396 - 14. This bill establishes new public health policies and reforms Medicaid and Medicare to combat the country-wide opioid epidemic. Building upon the 21st Century Cures Act and the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act passed last Congress, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is the capstone effort of this Congress, containing provisions from over 50 bills that previously passed the House. Rep. Foxx stated, “As an original cosponsor of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, I endorsed this bill due to my firm belief in the importance of combating the opioid scourge wreaking havoc across the country. It takes a fiscally responsible and comprehensive approach, providing agencies and communities with the guidance and resources necessary to advance this fight. We know this addiction is preventable and treatable, and Congress remains committed to supporting the citizens combatting this disease on the front lines of our communities in every way it can.” To learn more about the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, click here.

06.14.2018	WASHINGTON – Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) and Rep. Lloyd Smucker (R-PA) today sent a letter to Department of Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta regarding the national opioid public health emergency. The letter urged the Secretary to fight the scourge of addiction by using the Job Corps program to engage young adults and improve their employment outcomes and recovery efforts. “The prospect of a job increases hope and encourages Americans recovering from and responding to the opioid epidemic, and a robust local economy also helps a community rebuild itself,” wrote Chairwoman Foxx and Rep. Smucker. “Leveraging our existing workforce development infrastructure to provide Americans the skills they need to overcome addiction and pursue their American dream is a critical part of combating this epidemic.” Background: Yesterday, the House of Representatives voted to approve several Education and Workforce bills designed to combat opioids, and provide relief to those who have been impacted by the opioid abuse of a coworker or loved one. These bills play a crucial role in the fight against opioids, and will address the needs of people who have traditionally been left behind by the epidemic. To read Chairwoman Foxx and Rep. Smucker’s letter to Secretary Acosta, click here. To learn more about the Committee’s opioid legislation, click here.
06.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act, by a bipartisan vote of 210-206. Under the Impoundment Control Act, the president can identify balances of unobligated funds that he or she does not expect agencies to spend and request Congress rescind these funds. President Trump requested a recsission of $14.7 billion, which the House honored in the legislation passed yesterday. Rep. Foxx said of its passage, “The Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act represents a good government approach to cut wasteful government spending, and I’m proud to have cosponsored this legislation. In some cases, agencies sit on funding for years with no plans to spend it and we should maintain this practice of returning those unused funds to the U.S. Treasury. The success of our current economy shows that empowering the American people with lower taxes and regulatory relief boosts employment and spurs prosperity. If we want to see sustained expansion of our economy, Congress must continue to reduce spending and curtail the government debt that hurts our nation’s progress.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
05.25.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, members of North Carolina’s Congressional Delegation sent a letter to Governor Roy Cooper requesting information on the distribution of Hurricane Matthew recovery funds provided to the state of North Carolina through the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) Program. In the letter to Governor Cooper, members of the Congressional Delegation ask for clarification on why the State of North Carolina has been slow to allocate Hurricane Matthew recovery funds, with HUD recently designating North Carolina as a “slow spender” not within the monthly spending pace required to fully use the funds by the closeout date of August 2023. Since the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Matthew’s landfall, North Carolina’s Congressional Delegation has been working on a bipartisan basis to secure federal funding to assist in the state’s ongoing recovery efforts. In February, the N.C. Congressional Delegation secured roughly $168,000,000 in CDBG-DR funds to support North Carolina’s family and community needs, including housing, infrastructure, and jobs. This additional CDBG-DR funding added to the $236,500,000 that the N.C. Congressional Delegation has secured in past spending bills. “It is deeply concerning that these federal disaster dollars are not being released when many North Carolina families are still living in temporary housing provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA),” the members wrote. “We strongly urge your office in consultation with North Carolina Emergency Management to distribute funding quicker. Timely and efficient administration of these secured funds is critically important to families and businesses across North Carolina still recovering from hurricane Matthew. Any further delay may also have unacceptable consequences on any future disaster aid requests.” Full text of the letter to Governor Cooper is below. May 25, 2018 Dear Governor Cooper: As members of the North Carolina Congressional delegation, we write to request additional information about the distribution of funds provided to the State through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Community Development Block Grant – Disaster Relief (CDBG-DR) Program. It is our understanding that to date, North Carolina has received $404 million from HUD for 2016 Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts, but as of May 2018, nearly two years later, the State has failed to allocate significant portions of these funds. Our Congressional delegation remains committed to the successful recovery of our state and its families and businesses. On October 8, 2016, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in North Carolina, devastating the central and eastern areas of our state. The severity of the flooding impacted homes and businesses far beyond the boundaries of the 100-year floodplain. The storm caused power outages in more than 800,000 households, displaced nearly 3,750 residents from their homes, shutdown 635 roads and 34 school systems, and tragically took the lives of 28 North Carolinians. Immediately in the aftermath, North Carolina’s Congressional delegation began working with your office, the relevant federal agencies, and colleagues on the Appropriations Committees to ensure that impacted North Carolinians received the federal assistance necessary to begin the rebuilding process. On January 18, 2017, HUD announced $198.5 million in CDBG-DR funding for North Carolina’s recovery efforts. The CDBG-DR grant program supports a variety of disaster recovery activities including housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, and infrastructure repair. On May 18, 2017 and August 1, 2017, HUD released $6.1 million and $31 million, respectively, in CDBG-DR funding to North Carolina. The State received its final allocation of $168 million on April 11, 2018 as a result of the North Carolina delegation’s continued work to include the funds in the fiscal year (FY) 2018 federal budget. Our offices invested significant time and resources to assist those impacted by Hurricane Matthew. During and after the storm, we made every effort to support the agencies and nonprofits who came to North Carolina to assist our residents. Therefore, it is troubling to learn that these CDBG-DR funds are delayed in reaching those in most need of assistance. It is even more frustrating to learn that according to HUD, our state is not within the monthly spending pace required to fully use the assistance by the target closeout date of August 2023 and has been designated a “slow-spender.” North Carolina has the potential to lose millions of dollars in disaster relief aid if it continues to allocate funds at this rate. This leads us to the following questions: 1. Is the state action plan, required by HUD to receive CDBG-DR dollars, finalized for the funds released on or prior to August 1, 2017, and is that $236 million in CDBG-DR assistance available to the state of North Carolina? Have you submitted to HUD a state action plan for spending the additional $168 million in CDBG-DR funds for approval? 2. How much of the available CDBG-DR funds have been spent to date? What is the timeline for getting the remaining CDBG-DR dollars to those in need? 3. What are the primary goals of your administration when spending the CDBG-DR funds? Have you determined if housing redevelopment and rebuilding, business assistance, economic revitalization, or infrastructure repair are the most pressing needs of our residents? Are these goals and priorities consistent with those made available to the public, as required? 4. What public awareness campaigns have been conducted by your office to bring awareness to these available funds to maximize education and understanding for our constituents who would be eligible for these CDBG-DR funds? It is deeply concerning that these federal disaster dollars are not being released when many North Carolina families are still living in temporary housing provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). We strongly urge your office in consultation with North Carolina Emergency Management to distribute funding quicker. Timely and efficient administration of these secured funds is critically important to families and businesses across North Carolina still recovering from Hurricane Matthew. Any further delay may also have unacceptable consequences on any future disaster aid requests. The North Carolina Congressional delegation remains ready to work with your office to ensure the successful and complete recovery of our state and its resilient residents. Sincerely, Thom Tillis Richard Burr Walter B. Jones Virginia Foxx Richard Hudson David Rouzer Robert Pittenger George Holding
05.24.2018	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-NC, voted today in support of the H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (NDAA). This legislation sets policies and authorizes appropriations for the Department of Defense. Foxx said of the NDAA, “National security is the primary role of the federal government, and today the House of Representatives fulfilled that role by reauthorizing and strengthening our national defense. After years of negligence under the Obama Administration, our military suffers a readiness crisis leaving it underpaid, overworked and ill-prepared to face security threats from our foreign adversaries. The NDAA for FY19 equips America’s warfighters with the resources they need to defend our country, including the largest pay raise in nearly a decade. While we can never truly repay the selfless sacrifices of our servicemen and women, I was pleased to see the House pass this bipartisan legislation to provide them with adequate funding and much-deserved compensation. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
05.22.2018	On Thursday, Rep. Virginia Foxx facilitated a meeting with the US Forest Service and the Bear Hunters Association of NC and Daniel Boone Bear Club. Representatives of those organizations along with Rep. Foxx’s District Director, Robert Meek, attended the meeting. Questions have been raised recently regarding the rules for hunting in and around the Daniel Boone Bear Sanctuary. The association and bear club sought clarification of the rules from the US Forest Service and the NC Wildlife Commission. Rep. Foxx said of the meeting, “the responsibilities of being a federal representative go far beyond the votes taken in Washington. I was glad to bring the US Forest Service and NC Wildlife Commission to the table with bear hunters in the Fifth District for a productive conversation. The meeting resulted in a plan to clarify hunting rules and notify the bear hunting organizations in Avery County. Until the matter is resolved for all parties, I will continue to be involved and encourage a solutions-driven dialogue.” (L-R): Captain Lee Dillivan, Allen Nicholas, Robert Meek, Bud Smith and Ben Vance
05.10.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the House passed H. Res. 835, a resolution introduced by Reps. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Albio Sires (D-NJ), Michael McCaul (R-TX), and Nita Lowey (D-NY).

Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Statement by Representative Sires: “I would like to thank my colleagues Rep. Foxx, Rep. McCaul, and Rep. Lowey for their work and commitment to getting this important and timely House resolution passed.

Sires is a member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and sits on the Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats. Statement by Representative McCaul: “Yesterday’s egregious attacks against Israel by Iran exemplifies why we must remain steadfast in our support for our Israeli partners. Since its independence in 1948, Israel has thrived in a turbulent region surrounded by few who recognize its existence as a state and enemies who issue threats of annihilation on a regular basis. With the passage of this resolution in the House, there should be no confusion amongst the international community as to where our relationship stands now and where it will be in the future. As we approach the 70th anniversary of Israel as a state, we must reflect on our strong bilateral relationship, and continue working together to advance our common interests internationally.” U.S. Representative Michael McCaul represents Texas’ 10th Congressional District is Chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security and a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Statement by Representative Lowey: “In just 70 years, Israel has overcome seemingly impossible odds to become a light unto the nations. Despite these achievements, Israel is continually treated unfairly at the United Nations and other international fora. With the passage of H.Res. 835, the House of Representatives is sending a strong message of support for the ironclad U.S.-Israel relationship, the expansion of Israel’s diplomatic relations, and a negotiated two-state solution to the Middle East conflict.” U.S. Representative Nita Lowey represents New York’s 17th Congressional District and is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee and its State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee.

04.11.2018	Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement today after Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) announced his plan to retire at the close of the 115th Congress: “Serving the people of Wisconsin has been a tremendous honor for Speaker Ryan and he has served them well. He accepted the Speaker’s gavel and took on the burden of leadership for the good of our conference and our nation – not out of personal or political ambition. He truly has a servant’s heart. There are many accomplishments and legislative victories which history should attribute to Speaker Ryan’s leadership, including leading the fight on tax reform and rebuilding our military. Republicans have a long track-record of lauding family values as one of our core principles. Speaker Ryan’s decision to spend more time with his family is fulfilling that principle, and he will leave the House as he entered it, a conservative champion for all our shared principles. For as long as I have known Paul, I have known him to be a man of faith and family. I understand his decision to return to Wisconsin and his family, but I will dearly miss my friend.”
02.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) offered the following statement in regard to the death of Reverend Billy Graham: “Mark 16:15 of the Good Book instructs us to, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.’ This is a charge that Reverend Graham took seriously and a charge which he spent a lifetime endeavoring to obey. Reverend Graham will be remembered by millions of people for millions of reasons – this is a testament to the lives he touched. From advising many Commanders-in-Chief as America’s pastor, to preaching the gospel to the masses, the Reverend Graham was compassionate and served as a blessed shepherd through the years. Reverend Graham will be remembered as a talented, inspiring and dedicated North Carolinian. While I was saddened to learn of Reverend Graham’s passing, I rejoice that he has gone to join the Lord whom he loved so dearly.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
02.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 3851, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act, authored by Representative Virginia Foxx, by a vote of 407-0. This bipartisan legislation bolsters the abilities of national courts, and the U.S. Government in particular, to bring perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide to justice. Representative Foxx issued the following statement: “A number of courts and tribunals around the world have made it their mission to investigate and convict terrorists and perpetrators of human rights abuses. Unfortunately due to certain limitations, not all courts are equally equipped to accomplish this task. Each year, the War Crimes Rewards Program – run by the State Department – designates financial incentives to individuals in exchange for information regarding the whereabouts of fugitives from international criminal tribunals. While this program has been successful, I have fought to strengthen our domestic courts in the fight against those who commit crimes of atrocity, such as ISIS. In order to bring these fugitive terrorists to justice, we must arm domestic courts with the ability to prosecute these criminals under the United States’ banner of justice, rather than relying solely on international tribunals. This legislation is critical to ensuring that the members of our justice community at home are fully prepared to take on ISIS fugitives, and will hopefully protect future victims from ISIS genocide and the world’s worst human-rights abusers.” Specifically, H.R. 3851: · Amends the Department of State Rewards Program · Allows rewards to be paid for arrests or convictions of foreign nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide under the statutes of individual countries – including the United States. The current program only allows for rewards to be furnished solely for the actions of international tribunals. · Expands the scope of rewards to maximize public awareness against the world’s most serious human rights abusers.
02.01.2018	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Rep. Jimmy Gomez D-C.A., this week introduced H.R. 4887 the bipartisan Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act that will streamline federal grant reporting by replacing outdated documents with open data, increase transparency from grantmaking agencies, and reduce compliance costs. Reps. Foxx and Gomez, as well as relevant groups, issued the following statements in support of the GREAT Act: Representative Virginia Foxx: “As a former educator and college president, I know first-hand the difficulties federal grant applicants face when it comes to compliance with grant reporting. The task is cumbersome, laborious, and laden with inefficiency. That’s why we’ve introduced the GREAT Act. The GREAT Act will simplify the grant reporting process for grantors and grantees by transforming standard information – used in reporting and compliance – into searchable open data. Ultimately, this will result in greater transparency and reduce compliance costs for non-profits, universities and many other stakeholders. Since the U.S. Government awards more than $600 billion every year to state and local governments, agencies, and a wide variety of other organizations, it is imperative that we are accountable for every tax dollar awarded. By making the collected data open and searchable, small businesses will no longer be forced to spend meaningful man-hours on filling out duplicative paperwork and instead will be empowered to focus on their core objectives. Hardworking American taxpayers deserve to know where their tax dollars are going – and the GREAT Act will not only make that goal possible, but realized.” Representative Jimmy Gomez: “It is no secret that the federal government needs to modernize the way it conducts business. By leveraging technology, we can make the federal grant reporting process more transparent and efficient while breaking down barriers for new federal grant applicants that seek funding opportunities. That’s why we’re introducing the GREAT Act, which will help level the playing field by simplifying grant reporting data into searchable open data. With a more equitable and streamlined process, the GREAT Act will help us increase access to grants and open new opportunities for recipients.” Hudson Hollister, Executive Director, the Data Coalition: “In its current form, grant reporting is overly complex and riddled with flaws. The GREAT Act will solve this problem. The proposed legislation will require the adoption of a government-wide open data structure for all the information grantees report. Ultimately, replacing documents with data will alleviate compliance burdens for the grantee community, provide instant insights for grantor agencies and Congress, and enable easy access to data for oversight, analytics, and program evaluation.” Ann Ebberts, Chief Executive Officer, Association of Government Accountants: “The Association of Government Accountants (AGA) supports the technological transformation of federal grant reporting. Technology can reduce manual reporting burdens and complexity for the 70,000 financial management professionals we represent at federal, state, local, and tribal governments, many of whom work on grant compliance and audits. From 2015 to 2017, we partnered with the White House OMB and the Department of Health and Human Services to support the DATA Act pilot program which showed how data standardization can transform grant reporting. The collaborative process leveraged by OMB and Treasury for the progress made in DATA Act reporting provides a model that can be built on and expanded for this grant reporting and transparency effort. We are pleased and eager to work with Congress, the executive branch, and our members to achieve the next step: the creation of a single, government-wide data structure to give all grantees certainty and the potential to automate.” Richard Fenger, Open Government Subcommittee Co-chair, Federal Demonstration Partnership (The FDP is a collaboration between Federal granting agencies and institutions that carry out research grants, including universities and other non-profit organizations): “We all share the desire to reduce administrative burden and minimize costs, while ensuring that we maximize the use of public funds for their intended purposes. Data standardization efforts around key data elements that foster transparency will be essential towards achieving efficiency. The GREAT Act is clearly a positive step beyond simply extending previous transparency efforts, and will certainly lead to future efficiencies. In due course, the GREAT Act will help move information from a costly form-based ecosystem, over to a collection of standardized core data elements independent from of the forms where they reside.” Shelly Slebrch, Executive Director, the National Grants Management Association: “Streamlining requirements for reporting across the Federal government is essential to moving grant reporting forward. New data technologies are part of that solution.” *** Specifically the GREAT Act: *Requires the creation of a comprehensive and standardized data structure, or “taxonomy”, covering all data elements reported by recipients of federal awards, including both grant and cooperative agreements. *Tasks the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) with implementation. *Issues guidance to grantmaking agencies on how to leverage new technologies and implement the new data standards into existing reporting practices with minimum disruption. *Amends the Single Audit Act to provide for grantee audits to be reported in an electronic format consistent with the data standards. *Provides exceptions and restrictions by requiring each grantmaking agency to begin collecting grant reports using the new data standards within three years. *Ensures that no data outside the scope of grant reporting will be collected and that personally-identifiable or otherwise sensitive information will not be published. ### U.S. Rep.

01.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in support of H.R. 4712, the Born Alive Abortion Survivor’s Protection Act, which guarantees legal protection and medical care for abortion survivors, safeguards mothers from prosecution and holds abortionists accountable. Representative Foxx issued the following statement in support of the measure: “Today is a victory for the pro-life community. The Born Alive Abortion Survivor’s Protection Act advances the culture of life by imposing criminal and financial penalties upon abortionists who intentionally or negligently deny health care to survivors of attempted abortions. Innocent children born in spite of attempted abortions often are at the highest risk of harm, so it is incumbent upon all of us who value life to protect these defenseless children and their mothers.” *** Representative Foxx spoke about the Born Alive Abortion Survivor’s Protection Act on the House Floor.

12.19.2017	Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This final tax plan agreed upon by the United States House and Senate reduces tax rates for all income levels, spurs economic and job growth, and repeals Obamacare’s individual mandate for health insurance. Foxx issued the following statement in support of H.R. 1: “For the last three decades, hardworking American taxpayers have been weighed down by an unfair, complicated, and burdensome tax code. With today’s passage of H.R. 1, that cumbersome tax code is now a thing of the past. Simply put, Congress made a promise to the American people to provide tax relief and we have delivered on that promise by reducing rates for individuals at all income levels and roughly doubling the standard deduction. The reduction in tax rates for businesses and job creators – whether big or small – will unleash more opportunities and bigger paychecks for employees. With Christmas right around the corner, repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate will be a great gift for hardworking Americans. This will enable families to choose a health care plan that’s right for them, without fear of incurring a tax penalty. Shortly, the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will be sent to the President’s desk for signature and the American people will begin the New Year with the assurance of more jobs and bigger paychecks.” To learn more about H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, please visit: www.fairandsimple.gop
12.06.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., voted in favor of H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 which allows qualified individuals with a concealed weapons permit to carry or possess a concealed handgun in other states that allow concealed firearms. Representative Foxx released the following statement in support of the measure: “When the Founding Fathers penned the Second Amendment, the right of people to keep and bear arms was intended to empower individuals – a principle that has been solidified by recent Supreme Court decisions. As a lifelong defender of the Constitution, I was pleased to support the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which rightly protects Second Amendment freedoms of law-abiding Americans and their right to defend themselves on the road as well as at home. Responsible gun-owners who hold a concealed carry permit from their state’s jurisdiction should be empowered to travel to other states that allow concealed firearms without fear of prosecution – and this bill accomplishes exactly that.”
11.16.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in support of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, legislation that simplifies the U.S. tax code, significantly reduces tax rates for the middle class, and brings about economic and job growth by increasing America’s competitiveness. Foxx issued the following statement in support of H.R. 1: “Thirty-one years ago, President Reagan signed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and history shows that economic prosperity followed. Today, the House passed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, paving the way for a simpler and fairer tax code with reduced rates for hardworking Americans, families, and businesses. The current tax code is cumbersome and convoluted, so the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act simplifies the tax code by getting rid of loopholes in order to lower rates for families and individuals. Now, the standard deduction is roughly doubled, meaning the first $12,000 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples will be tax free. Small business – the backbone of the American economy – will be provided with much needed relief as the tax rate on small business and on small business investment is significantly reduced. Furthermore, this legislation makes all American businesses more competitive on a global scale. A simpler and more competitive tax system will spur economic growth and job creation. North Carolinians are projected to see a real increase in take-home pay, to the tune of $2,366. I was pleased to support H.R.1, which will enable most residents of the 5th District to file their taxes on something as simple as a postcard, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with the President to deliver on our promise of lower taxes and higher wages.”
11.14.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., voted today in support of the Conference Report to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018. This legislation authorizes appropriations and sets policies for the Department of Defense. Representative Foxx served as a conferee on the Conference Report, a position designated by the Speaker of the House because of her role as Chairwoman of the Education and Workforce Committee. “As legislators, one of the most important duties we have is to provide for the common defense,” said Foxx. “Under the Obama administration, our military experienced a readiness crisis that left troops overworked and ill-prepared to face the vast array of threats to America’s security. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY’18 will restore troop levels, equip America’s warfighters with the tools they need to defend us, and permanently preserve the special survivor indemnity allowance to the 60,000 surviving military spouses. While we can never truly repay the debt that we owe the nation’s servicemen and women, the NDAA for FY’18 includes the largest pay raise for the troops in almost a decade. I was very pleased to support this legislation to support the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines that defend us from tyranny.” ###
11.07.2017	WASHINGTON – Representatives Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Danny K. Davis D-I.L., along with Senators Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Pat Toomey R-P.A., today introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Sugar Policy Modernization Act, legislation that would phase market reforms into the U.S. sugar program. Representative Virginia Foxx: “Our nation’s antiquated sugar program seeks to prop up prices for the sugar industry at every turn, sticking consumers with the bill. The way our current system is set up, taxpayers and manufacturers bear all of the risks in the form of bailouts, uncertainty and shortages, while the sugar industry reaps guaranteed rewards,” said Foxx. This program personifies crony-capitalism at best, and gross negligence at worst. Manufacturers and consumers have previously bailed out the program to the tune of $260 million and the Congressional Budget Office estimates that if left unchanged, the program will cost taxpayers over $100 million. That’s why we’ve introduced the Sugar Policy Modernization Act which finally gets the sugar program to a zero-cost program by ending special-interest bailouts,” said Foxx. Representative Danny K. Davis: "This job killing subsidy program is like a vampire, refusing to die while continuing to enrich a handful of well-connected plantation owners at the expense of hundreds of thousands of confectionary jobs in the United States," Congressman Davis said. “In 1987 Brach's, located in the 7th Congressional District, was Chicago's sixth-largest manufacturer, with 4,000 workers, the average worker spent 27 years in a Brach's plant. Largely due to the sugar subsidy those jobs, those careers, are gone now and the old Brach's factory in the industrial park on Chicago's Westside which once employed over 1,000 workers is a wasteland. The continuation of the sugar program today puts 7000 Illinois manufacturing jobs at risk while the cost to taxpayers has skyrocketed and will continue to grow." Senator Jeanne Shaheen: “Reform of the federal sugar program is long overdue. Our current policies create heavy costs for consumers and put American jobs at risk,” said Senator Shaheen. “This bipartisan bill will help make reasonable, commonsense changes to the federal sugar support program to cut wasteful spending and help grow American businesses. It’s time for Congress to put special interests aside and work to reduce costs and protect American workers in New Hampshire and across the country.” Senator Pat Toomey: “The current sugar program is a bad deal for American consumers and federal taxpayers. It is time to reform this government corporate welfare program that hikes food costs for families and threatens thousands of well-paying jobs in Pennsylvania.” said Senator Toomey. “I thank Senator Shaheen and Representatives Foxx and Davis for their hard work as we advance this bipartisan bill, which will rein in our flawed sugar policies and save taxpayer dollars.” Specifically, the Sugar Policy Modernization Act would: · Lift restrictions on the domestic production and sale of refined sugar. · Reduce taxpayer liability to loan forfeitures when sugar processors decide not to payback their USDA loans. · Ensure that the domestic demand for sugar is considered when the USDA administers the sugar program. · Bring market forces into the U.S. sugar market and phase out supply-management policies. ### U.S. Rep.

10.26.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of the House budget resolution as amended by the United States Senate. This legislation establishes the budget for the United States Government for FY’18 and paves the way for comprehensive tax reform. Foxx released the following statement in support of the budget: “As someone who was raised in abject poverty, I know too well the devastating effects that our current tax code has on low-income and middle class Americans. For the first time in thirty-one years, the American people will finally begin to reap the benefits of tax reform – and this budget paves the way for that tax relief Americans desperately need. By doubling the standard deduction and lowering rates, many of our lowest-income citizens will be relieved of paying federal income taxes entirely and middle class families will be able to keep more of their paychecks – to spend as they see fit – instead of sending those funds to Washington. The median household income for a family in the Fifth District of North Carolina is $45,000. Our tax reform framework is estimated to yield an additional $4,000 a year on average for families like those. This increase in take-home pay will make a huge improvement in the quality of life for families and individuals around the country. We are working around the clock to deliver a modern tax code that will bring jobs and much needed capital back to the District by making the corporate tax rate for job creators more competitive. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate and with the President to pass a pro-growth, fair, and simple tax reform package that will give taxpayers what they need – bigger paychecks and higher wages.”
10.20.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., will host a U.S. Service Academy Day on Saturday, Oct. 28, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Historic Broyhill building, 3450 Clemmons Road, Clemmons, NC. The event will help familiarize students with the application and nomination process for applying to the nation's five military service academies. “North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District has a noble tradition of military service, and it’s an honor to help some of the community’s finest students contribute to this legacy by attending our country’s prestigious military service academies,” said Foxx. “This event will give prospective applicants the opportunity to meet with representatives from each academy. This is a great opportunity for students to receive more information about how to navigate the application and nomination process to our nation’s distinguished service academies.” Representatives from all five academies will be in attendance to explain more about their requirements for admittance. High school students of all ages and their parents are encouraged to attend. Individuals wishing to attend are asked to RSVP to Maxwel Terzano at 336-778-0211 or Maxwel.Terzano@mail.house.gov
09.28.2017	WASHINGTON – Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. and Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y. and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, today introduced bipartisan legislation to empower national courts and governments in their fight to bring perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide to justice by the swiftest and most effective means possible. Statement by Representative Foxx: “Each year, the War Crimes Rewards Program notices awards of millions of dollars to individuals around the globe for information concerning the whereabouts of fugitives from international criminal tribunals. Informants worldwide are encouraged to turn in critical information about war criminals and severe human rights abusers which result in monetary rewards. This program is an important tool in the fight to bring the perpetrators of global atrocities to justice. We are introducing the War Crimes Reward Expansion Act in hopes of preventing future victims of war crimes committed by the likes of Joseph Kony. The most egregious abusers of human rights should fear the full weight of the justice that America and its allies can bring to bear. While it’s important to rely on international tribunals in extraordinary circumstances, sovereign states should maximize the prosecutorial tools at their disposal.” Statement by Representative Engel: “The War Crimes Rewards Program is a proven tool in America’s effort to bring the perpetrators of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide to justice. It has helped lead to arrests in cases from the former Yugoslavia to Rwanda, but heinous criminals in many other parts of the world continue to evade justice,” said Rep. Engel. “That’s why I support the War Crimes Reward Expansion Act, which will clarify that rewards can be paid for arrests and convictions whether they take place under domestic or international law. By doing so, we are sending a clear message that America will continue to stand against human rights abusers and war criminals abroad.” Specifically, H.R. 3851 would: · Amend the Department of State Rewards Program · Allow rewards to be paid for arrests or convictions of foreign nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide under the statutes of individual countries – including the United States – in addition to the laws of international tribunals · Expand the scope of rewards that can be paid to individuals for providing information that leads to the arrest, conviction, or prosecution of perpetrators for gross violations of international human rights law
09.14.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of H.R. 3354, The Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act for FY’18, a bipartisan spending bill to appropriate funds for the federal government. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 211-198. “The Constitution which is the bedrock of American society, entrusts Congress with the power of the purse. As legislators that is among our most important responsibilities. Today, the House fulfilled its responsibility to the people and successfully passed twelve government funding bills and scored some major conservative victories in the process. ‘The Making America Secure and Prosperous Act,’ furthers many conservative principles as it rightly protects the sanctity of human life, rejects liberal demands for spending increases, and bolsters our national security. I was pleased to support this bill which keeps our North Carolina economy competitive.” ###
09.12.2017	WASHINGTON – Today, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., released the following video honoring the fallen of September 11th, 2001. A clip and full text of the speech are below, Please click the image above to view Rep. Foxx's speech Remarks: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the nearly three thousand souls that were taken from us much too soon on September 11th, sixteen years ago. Like many others, the events of September 11th 2001, are forever etched in my memory. On that day I was in Raleigh, North Carolina, serving in the State Legislature and recall an aid coming in to share the news. Naturally, when hearing about the first plane hitting the World Trade Center we all thought a terrible accident had occurred. My colleagues and I were in a state of shock and grief when we heard about the second plane, and the subsequent attacks that followed. What I remember most, is the feeling of abject horror and disbelief we experienced on that day. That horror is still felt by the family members that were left behind, robbed of their loved ones who were violently taken too soon. I often think of the brave first-responders who ran towards danger, with thought of little else other than to save their fellow Americans. The terror attacks seemed surreal, and yet the aftermath has a finality which does not dissipate with time. As years pass, the shock of the attack have diminished but the memory of the feeling of hope that arose from the acts of selfless Americans is stronger. In my mind, one of the very worst events in human history became overshadowed as the very best in us – as a people – was made evident through countless acts of kindness and dignity. It is this dignity we must hold on to in order to truly honor the fallen. From the first-responders, citizens, volunteers and finally the devoted souls on board Flight 93, I remember the moments in which the very best parts of Americans shown brightest. These moments include when our citizens were no longer categorized by their differences, but were defined by their shared determination not only to survive – but to overcome an unthinkable tragedy. If a student asks me about my memories of September 11th, I always tell them honestly of the horror I felt, and I tell them of the hope that emerged as our people did their level best to turn evil into good. While I will never forget September 11, 2001 and the lives that were forever lost to us on that day sixteen years ago, I take some comfort in knowing that a loving and never-changing God, called them to Heaven to live in His presence, forever. Now, more than ever before, we must recall the sacrifices made by so many in the aftermath of September 11th, and recall that freedom is never truly freely given. It is earned, it is hard fought for, and it is something we must all work together to continue to achieve. May God bless all of those who lost their lives on September 11th, those who were left behind, and those who continue to fight for our freedom. ### U.S. Rep.

06.28.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised the Trump administration’s proposal to rescind the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. “Federal agencies frequently place burdensome regulations on the American public, and the ‘Waters of the United States’ rule was no exception,” said Foxx. “It would have threatened the livelihood of North Carolina’s farmers and saddled local governments with exorbitant compliance costs. This common sense decision by the Trump administration is welcome news.” In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that would have significantly broadened the federal government’s power to regulate waters and adjacent lands under the Clean Water Act. The rule would have given the federal government jurisdiction over puddles, roadside ditches, irrigation ditches and storm and wastewater systems. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
06.12.2017	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed legislation by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time period during which the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company is required to begin construction of its hydropower project at W. Kerr Scott Dam. “Congress needs to make sure onerous regulatory burdens don’t stand in the way of accessing or advancing all forms of American energy,” said Foxx. “Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company has worked to ensure its project meets the requirements outlined by the federal government and this legislation is consistent with previous congressional action to spur hydropower development at Corps facilities.” On July 17, 2012, the agency granted the company an original license for the project on the Yadkin River in Wilkes County. However, Section 13 of the Federal Power Act requires Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company to begin construction within four years of license issuance. The project has required extensive coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and there were delays in the review process for the design plans. As a result, Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company was not able to start construction of the amended design within the statutory deadline. Foxx’s legislation extends the time period during which the company is required to commence the construction of the project for up to three consecutive two-year periods from the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. H.R. 951 passed the House by voice vote. Identical legislation has been introduced in the Senate. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
06.08.2017	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed legislation that includes language by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., to shed light on how policies from federal financial agencies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers. The language is part of H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act, which replaces the Dodd-Frank Act with reforms that include ending taxpayer-funded bailouts of large financial institutions, imposing tougher penalties on those who commit financial fraud and requiring greater accountability from Washington regulators. “Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch state and city budgets and make it harder for businesses to hire,” said Foxx. “Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of the rules they create.” Building on her efforts with H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, Foxx worked to include similarly-purposed provisions in the Financial CHOICE Act. The provisions in the bill ensure that federal financial agencies are subject to the requirements of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to report and consider the costs – in dollars and jobs – passed on to state and local governments and to the private sector. It further directs those agencies to identify regulatory alternatives and select the least costly alternative for rules that do impose unfunded mandates. “The one-size-fits-all approach and hundreds of regulations resulting from Dodd-Frank have significantly impacted access to desperately needed capital and have driven up compliance costs,” said Foxx. “The Financial CHOICE Act provides regulatory relief to small businesses and job creators while also ensuring Washington is held accountable to hardworking American taxpayers.” ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
05.24.2017	WASHINGTON - Rep. Virginia Foxx, chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Rep. Tim Walberg (R-MI), chairman of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions, issued the following joint statement on the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report on the American Health Care Act (AHCA). The report confirms that the AHCA further lowers premiums, reduces the deficit, and delivers tax relief for the American people. "The American people desperately need relief from a failed health care law that has increased costs, taken away choices, destroyed jobs, and burdened small businesses. Republicans are committed to delivering that relief. As this report shows, the American Health Care Act represents an important step toward lowering health care premiums, easing the burden on hardworking taxpayers, and putting people back in control of their health care. "It is important to remember that the AHCA is just one step in a broader effort to help every American access high-quality, affordable health care coverage. For example, the House has also passed the Small Business Health Fairness Act to make it easier for small businesses to provide affordable health care coverage to their employees. As we continue on this rescue mission, it is our hope the Senate will take up these positive reforms that will empower working families with lower health care costs and more choices." ###
05.23.2017	WASHINGTON - Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, issued the following statement after President Trump released his budget for fiscal year 2018: "Students, workers, and small businesses cannot succeed in an economy that is crippled by too much government and too much debt. During the last eight years, we were told time and again that more spending on more programs would lead to more prosperity. Hardworking taxpayers were burdened by new programs they couldn’t afford, yet they never experienced the prosperity they were promised. "For too many years, the federal government has not lived within its means because policymakers have not set real priorities. The president’s budget proposal reflects the consequences of this failed approach, as well as the urgent need for tough choices and bold solutions to pursue a more responsible course. "As I said earlier this year, no one will agree with every proposal outlined in this budget. It is now up to Congress to review the details and establish important priorities. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to advance much-needed reforms that deliver relief for America’s taxpayers and empower families and job creators to succeed." ###
05.04.2017	WASHINGTON - Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, issued the following statement after the House passed the American Health Care Act: "For seven long years, families and small businesses have suffered the devastating consequences of Obamacare. Costs are skyrocketing, choices are diminishing, small businesses are struggling, and jobs are being destroyed. That’s what the American people have been forced to live with, and that’s why Republicans promised to provide a better way. We are on a rescue mission, and this vote is an important step in repealing a failed law and delivering free-market, patient-centered solutions. "Today’s action represents an important moment for our country and a central part of our broader effort to deliver health care relief for working families. Already, the House passed reforms that will empower small businesses to band together to offer working families greater access to affordable health coverage. These are the kind of smart, responsible health care solutions that the American people need, and we are determined to deliver." ### U.S. Rep.

04.10.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced legislation to prevent tax-favored health savings accounts from being used to fund elective abortion. “Few things demean the sanctity of human life more than elective abortion,” said Foxx. “It is unconscionable to force millions of taxpayers who hold that view to provide tax advantages for abortion expenses, particularly when such advantages are barred for other controversial uses.” Individuals with high deductible health insurance plans are eligible to open health savings accounts. Contributions to the accounts are tax deductible while the interest or other earnings on the assets in the accounts are tax-free. Participants can withdraw funds from the accounts on a tax-free basis to cover qualified medical expenses. Congress has already established limits on withdrawals from health savings accounts by establishing qualified medical expenses. Certain procedures such as elective cosmetic surgeries have been excluded from eligibility. Similarly, H.R. 2019 removes elective abortion as a qualified medical expense. Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., is an original co-sponsor of the legislation. ### U.S. Rep.

03.16.2017	Voluntary employee wellness plans have long helped lower health care costs for working families and promote the health and wellbeing of employees. Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, introduced the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act (H.R. 1313) to provide regulatory clarity so employers can have the certainty they need to continue offering their workers the option of participating in employee wellness programs. Unfortunately, critics of the bill are spreading false information to deny workers that option. Below are some basic facts to help set the record straight. What does the Preserving Employee Wellness Programs Act do? This legislation would protect the ability of workers and their families to continue to voluntarily participate in employee wellness programs. Millions of Americans are already enrolled in these programs, which have been in place for years as a means to promote a healthy workforce and help families control their health care costs. A bipartisan provision in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) encouraged greater use of voluntary employee wellness programs by expanding permissible rewards for participating workers. The bill would reaffirm wellness program policies under the ACA, giving employers more clarity and certainty on the rules governing these programs. Why is regulatory clarity needed? Regulatory clarity is needed due to a number of enforcement actions and regulatory steps taken by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in recent years. The EEOC’s actions contradict the ACA and the rules promulgated by the Obama administration implementing the ACA. As a result, employers and employees who want to participate in these programs are caught in a regulatory Catch-22: Either follow the ACA guidelines and be in violation of the EEOC rules, or vice versa. By reaffirming the policies outlined in the ACA, H.R. 1313 will provide private-sector employers the legal certainty they need to continue offering these voluntary programs. Does H.R. 1313 allow employers to force their employees to submit to genetic testing? No. Wellness programs have always been completely voluntary. They were voluntary under the Democrat-passed ACA, as well as under regulations issued by the Obama administration. They remain voluntary under H.R. 1313, offering employees a way to control their health care costs. These programs have been in place for years and typically involve health-risk assessments to help improve the health and well-being of those who choose to participate. As Snopes has reported: “HR 1313 does not allow employers to force all their workers to submit to genetic testing.” Does the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) allow employers to acquire genetic information as part of an employee wellness program? Yes. While the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 provides strong safeguards protecting an employee’s genetic information, the law has always provided a clear exception for voluntary participation in employee wellness programs. The law clearly states: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to request, require, or purchase genetic information with respect to an employee or a family member of the employee except — where … health or genetic services are offered by the employer, including such services offered as part of a wellness program …” Under H.R. 1313, can employers discriminate based on genetic information acquired through a wellness program? No. Discrimination based on genetic information is illegal under existing federal law and would remain illegal under H.R. 1313. Under the bill, employers would still be required to follow anti-discrimination policies in the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 that state: “It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer — (1) to fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge, any employee, or otherwise to discriminate against any employee with respect to the compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment of the employee, because of genetic information with respect to the employee; or (2) to limit, segregate, or classify the employees of the employer in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive any employee of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect the status of the employee as an employee, because of genetic information with respect to the employee.” Again, these strong protections will still be enforced under H.R. 1313. Why do employee wellness programs even involve “genetic information” in the first place? Private-sector employee wellness programs are designed to improve the health and well-being of workers, which is why workers voluntarily provide health-related information when they choose to participate. For example, many programs include health-risk assessments. Disease management programs, which are among the most successful wellness programs, often include diagnostic testing and screening for conditions or diseases. An employee at risk for a certain disease may choose to enroll in one of these programs to help maintain a healthy lifestyle, and the program may involve a blood test and questions about their family medical history. These types of tests and assessments — which only occur after an individual has voluntarily decided to participate in the program — help ensure the program effectively improves the health of those workers who choose to participate. Will employees who voluntarily provide genetic information receive privacy protections? Yes. Section 206 of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 includes strong confidentiality protections that govern an individual’s genetic information, such as the legal requirement to treat the information as “a confidential medical record.” These protections would still apply under H.R. 1313. Furthermore, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) has long governed the privacy of individuals enrolled in group health plans, and this would continue to be the case under H.R. 1313. Recognizing this is very personal, sensitive information, the bill protects the right of workers to voluntarily choose whether to participate in these programs. Does H.R. 1313 penalize or increase premiums for employees who choose not to participate in a wellness program? No. In programs that offer incentives, those who choose to enroll can receive a reduction in their health insurance premiums. Those who decline to participate are not forced to pay any additional health care costs, nor will they experience any increase in their health insurance premiums. In no way are those who decide not to participate in a wellness program worse off. This has always been the case under employee wellness programs — including those promoted by President Obama’s signature health care law — and the same is true under H.R. 1313. Does H.R. 1313 allow employers to charge smokers more for health insurance than non-smokers? No. As is already the case under current law, employees have a choice on whether or not to enroll in a smoking cessation program that provides a reduction in their health insurance premiums. If they choose not to enroll, they are not paying any more for health care premiums than non-smokers who choose not to enroll.
02.28.2017	WASHINGTON - Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, issued the following statement in response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress: "Tonight the president outlined a positive vision for our country, one that reflects the renewed hope and optimism many Americans now share about the future. For too long, government bureaucrats have pursued an extreme, partisan agenda that favored powerful special interests and left countless working families behind. Fortunately, under unified Republican leadership, those days are now over and our best days are once again ahead of us. "The president’s address also highlighted the need for bold solutions to help solve our nation’s toughest challenges. There is no shortage of ideas for how to better support working families, help all students receive an excellent education, create good-paying jobs, and expand access to affordable health care coverage. In fact, Congress is already taking steps to tackle these and other national priorities. "As we look to the work that lies ahead, I urge my Democrat colleagues to become constructive partners in the process. The American people are looking for leadership that will help move the country in a better direction. As the president reaffirmed tonight, it’s time to move forward as one nation with one common purpose: building a stronger, brighter future for our country and its citizens. Our committee will continue to play a leading role in this important effort." ###
02.16.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of a resolution of disapproval that blocks an Obama administration regulation forcing states to include abortion providers as recipients of Title X grant distributions. “States have always had the freedom to direct funds away from abortion providers,” said Foxx during remarks on the House floor. “Not only does this regulation ignore the American people's wish that their tax dollars be directed away from abortion providers, it also denies states the flexibility to choose to allocate Title X funds in a way that meets the needs of their citizens.” On December 16, 2016, the Obama administration finalized a rule that prevents states from eliminating abortion providers from Title X health care funding. Title X is a family planning program authorized in 1970 that was intended to provide family planning services to low income women. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress may pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent, with the full force of the law, a federal agency from implementing a rule or issuing a substantially similar rule without congressional authorization. This week the House approved five resolutions of disapproval, in addition to the eight it has already passed in the 115th Congress, to undo the most harmful aspects of President Obama's administration. ### U.S. Rep.

02.01.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced legislation to stop the intrusion of political robocalls in homes across America. H.R. 740, the Robo Calls Off Phones Act or Robo COP Act, expands the types of unsolicited calls restricted by the national Do Not Call Registry to include political robocalls, giving the American people the opportunity to opt out of the bothersome campaign season interruption. “Every campaign season, like clockwork, families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robocalls,” said Foxx during remarks on the House floor. “Removing the exemption for political robocalls is a matter of fairness that will help bring some peace and quiet to homes throughout campaign season.” The Robo COP Act directs the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do Not Call registry to prohibit pre-recorded campaign messages from being sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. The legislation applies strictly to unsolicited, political robocalls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. ### U.S. Rep.

01.30.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today issued the following statement regarding President Trump's executive order entitled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States:" "We have always been a country that welcomes immigrants. However, it is also important to remember that national security is the number one job of the federal government. Given shortcomings in the current screening process, I joined a bipartisan House majority in supporting legislation to strengthen the vetting process for individuals seeking entry to the United States through the Visa Waiver Program or as refugees. The Executive Order signed by the president on Friday came with little clarity and caused much uncertainty for foreign travelers. Additional implementing guidance is needed to ensure that the order can be applied in a fair and equitable manner." ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce.
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that permanently prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion or abortion coverage. “This common-sense measure restores a longstanding agreement that protects the unborn and prevents taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of elective abortions,” said Foxx. “It reflects the will of the American people and is the product of what has historically been a bipartisan, bicameral consensus in Congress.” H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, passed the House by a vote of 238 to 183. It codifies the Hyde amendment, which has been regularly attached to annual appropriations bills for nearly 40 years to prevent federal funding of abortion with limited exceptions. The legislation makes the Hyde Amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide. Click here to view Foxx’s remarks on the House floor in support of the bill. Foxx also praised the Trump administration for reinstating the Mexico City Policy via executive order. Originally introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the policy requires nongovernmental organizations to agree as a condition of receiving any federal funding that they “would neither perform nor actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.” “The American people do not want the government to spend their hard-earned tax dollars counseling women in foreign countries to have abortions,” said Foxx. “President Trump has restored a common-sense policy and sent a powerful message about his dedication to protecting the unborn.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.20.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding the inauguration of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States: “Today is a very exciting and positive day for the people of the United States. We pride ourselves on the peaceful transfer of power, and I believe this tradition is a strong statement to people all over the world who value freedom. We are a privileged nation and we must never be casual with the freedoms we have inherited. “President Trump and Vice President Pence have been granted a sacred, public trust. They care deeply about this country, and I am confident they will work hard to uphold the resilient tradition of liberty and limited government inscribed in our Constitution. They will meet the trials ahead with strength and resolve, and I will do everything I can to help them.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.12.2017	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, issued the following statement after the Senate passed the FY 2017 budget resolution, including legislative tools aimed at providing relief from the president’s failed health care law: "This vote marks the next step in an important process to repeal Obamacare and provide a stable transition to a patient-centered health care system. The American people refuse to accept the unsustainable status quo. Relief is on the way for families currently facing fewer choices and higher costs and for small businesses burdened by misguided mandates. I look forward to moving this process forward in the House to deliver the high-quality, affordable health care Americans desperately need." ### U.S. Rep.

01.03.2017	WASHINGTON – Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, today introduced legislation to shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers. “Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch state and city budgets and make it harder for businesses to hire,” said Foxx. “This legislation will help restore transparency and hold Washington bureaucrats accountable for the true cost — in dollars and in jobs — that federal dictates pose to the economy. Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of the rules they create.” “This follows the work I did in the Texas State Legislature, where I also passed legislation to stop unfunded mandates from the state government to local governments. We want to help our local governments and businesses by relieving unnecessary and costly red tape so that budgets, projects and jobs aren’t halted,” said Cuellar. “This bill would require the federal government to measure and consider the total cost of the regulations they impose. Rep. Foxx and I will work in a bipartisan manner to stop unfunded mandates to local government.” H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, would increase transparency about the costs imposed by unfunded mandates and would hold the federal government accountable for considering those costs before passing them on to local governments and small businesses. Foxx has introduced this legislation in the past five Congresses, and it has successfully passed the House with bipartisan support on four separate occasions. The legislation would expand the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. Current loopholes within UMRA allow certain regulatory bodies to escape public reporting requirements and encourage others to forego publicizing regulatory proposals. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act would correct this. Specifically, H.R. 50 would: • Impose stricter and more clearly defined requirements for how and when federal agencies must disclose the cost of federal mandates; • Ensure those who will be affected have the opportunity to weigh in on proposed mandates; • Equip Congress and the public with tools to better determine the true cost of regulations; and • Provide an accountability mechanism to ensure the federal government and its independent regulatory agencies adhere to the provisions set forth by H.R. 50 and its predecessor, UMRA. The legislation also would require the federal government to report how legislative changes to existing federal grant programs might shift costs to state, local and tribal governments. For instance, grant programs which are administered by states can be altered by federal legislation. Under H.R. 50 the federal government would be statutorily required to report how such changes would impact state or local government budgets.

12.08.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., incoming chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, and Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., current committee chairman, released the following statements after President-elect Donald Trump announced his nomination of CKE Restaurants CEO Andy Puzder for Secretary of Labor: “Andrew Puzder is a terrific choice to serve as the next secretary of labor,” Chairwoman-designate Foxx said. “Through a long, distinguished career in the private sector, Mr. Puzder has a deep understanding of what it takes to create good-paying jobs and how federal policies can affect the ability of workers and employers to succeed. Mr. Puzder will play a key role in delivering reforms that will help more Americans climb the ladder of opportunity after years of extreme regulations and sluggish economic growth. There is a lot of work ahead to strengthen protections for workers, improve retirement security, lift the regulatory burden on small businesses, and restore balance and fairness to labor policies. I look forward to working with Mr. Puzder to advance these important priorities and congratulate him on this nomination.” “I want to congratulate Andrew Puzder on his nomination to serve as the next labor secretary,” Chairman Kline said. “His impressive record in the private sector will be extremely valuable as Congress continues to tackle the challenges facing working families and small businesses. Although we were able to work with the current administration on a number of key issues, years of flawed policies and overreaching regulations have made it harder for individuals to succeed. I’m confident Mr. Puzder has the experience and leadership necessary to turn the page and advance positive reforms that will put our nation back on a path toward growth and prosperity.” ###
12.02.2016	WASHINGTON – With approval of the full Republican conference, the House Republican Steering Committee has selected Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., as the chairwoman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce in the 115th Congress. “My colleagues have entrusted me with a significant responsibility, and I look forward to building on the foundation established by leaders such as John Kline and John Boehner and continuing their legacy of honest, dogged work confronting the challenges facing America’s schools and workplaces. The committee will continue to work towards fostering the best opportunities for students to learn, workers to succeed and employers to grow,” said Foxx. “At all times, we will strive in our service to hold government institutions to the highest standards of accountability and transparency, with a constant eye towards eliminating waste and inefficiency. Our creative, ambitious pursuit of good policy will be guided by the Constitution with solutions centered on securing and protecting access to high quality education and safe and productive workplaces for all Americans.” “I want to congratulate Virginia Foxx on her selection to serve as the next chair of this great committee, an opportunity she has earned through many years of dedicated public service,” said Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., current chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. “In recent years, we have advanced important reforms that will make a positive difference in the lives of students, workers, teachers, and employers, and Virginia has played a vital role in those efforts. I am proud of the work the committee has accomplished, and I have no doubt it will continue to deliver real results for the American people under Virginia’s strong leadership.” An educator by trade, Foxx spent most of her career as a teacher and administrator in North Carolina’s higher education system. Her first foray into public office was service on her local school board. Prior to entering Congress, Foxx also operated an independent nursery and landscaping business with her husband Tom. She currently serves as the chairwoman of the House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education and vice chair of the House Rules Committee. ###

It will be an informative experience for all who attend.” Representatives from all five academies will be in attendance to explain more about their requirements and expectations. The event also will allow local students the opportunity to ask questions and receive advice about the admissions process. High school students of all ages and their parents are encouraged to attend. Individuals wishing to attend are asked to RSVP to Richard Moxley at 1-866-677-8968 or Richard.Moxley@mail.house.gov. ### U.S. Rep.

09.29.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced legislation that ensures Congress has the opportunity to take action when mandatory programs exceed their cost estimates. “Washington has a serious spending problem and increases in mandatory spending are the largest cause of our worsening fiscal outlook. These programs often come in significantly over budget and Congress has little ability to address the unexpected spending levels,” said Foxx. “This legislation will protect taxpayers from unexpected mandatory spending increases and make the federal government more accountable.” H.R. 6248 limits future authorizations or reauthorizations of mandatory spending programs to 110 percent of the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimates its cost to be when Congress approves it. Social Security, health, poverty and veterans programs are limited to 120 percent of that cost estimate. If a program reaches its spending limit, the Office of Management and Budget would issue a stop payment order to the Treasury Department to halt that program’s operation until Congress is able to reconsider the program. Reporting requirements included in the legislation ensure Congress has adequate warning that a program may reach its limit so reforms or offsets can be considered before any stop payment order is initiated. ### U.S. Rep.

09.28.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted to delay the effective date of the Department of Labor’s controversial overtime rule for six months. “All too often the executive branch enacts policies that sound wonderful but impose unintended consequences and burdens that make the lives of hardworking Americans more difficult,” said Foxx during remarks on the House floor. “This regulation will require companies to reclassify a significant portion of their workforce, eliminating flexibility in work times, bonus compensation and opportunities to advance. It will also impose significant compliance costs that will only serve to further bury job creators under red tape. While members of both political parties want to see all Americans earn more, we cannot ignore the financial consequences of this rule.” House and Senate leaders introduced legislation earlier this year to require the department to pursue a more balanced and responsible approach to updating federal overtime rules. However, the administration instead issued an extreme rule that will stifle workplace flexibility, threaten upward mobility and burden small businesses. H.R. 6094, the Regulatory Relief for Small Businesses, Schools and Nonprofits Act, delays implementation of the rule by six months, providing workers, small businesses, nonprofits and colleges and universities with more time to prepare for the dramatic changes that will result from the department’s final rule. ### U.S. Rep.

09.14.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that strengthens whistleblower protections, reforms the disability benefits appeals process at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and provides additional authority to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to reprimand employees for performance or misconduct. “As I travel North Carolina’s 5th District, I hear a similar refrain. No matter where I go, constituents tell me horror stories of their experiences with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans are frustrated with the lack of service they’re receiving. They’re angry because they can’t get an appointment or a phone call returned. And they’re outraged, as I am, that the Obama administration is doing little to solve the multitude of problems that have been revealed,” said Foxx. “Congress has continued to enact major reform legislation, including the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act, but we need a president who will truly commit to reforming the VA and give America’s veterans a meaningful, decisive plan to right the many wrongs.” H.R. 5620, the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act, provides increased flexibility to remove VA employees for poor performance or misconduct as well as strengthens accountability of Senior Executive Service employees to address reports of widespread mismanagement at the VA. The bill enhances protections for whistleblowers by providing employees an additional method to report whistleblower complaints and provides supervisors with the opportunity to address problems at the lowest levels. It also eliminates bonuses for senior VA employees for five years to pay for the bill. Additionally the legislation streamlines the VA’s outdated appeals process, protects veterans’ due process rights, allows veterans to retain the original effective date of their claims throughout the appeals process and provides faster appeals decisions for veterans. ### U.S. Rep.

09.13.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised House passage of legislation to strengthen career and technical education. “For far too long, there has been a discrepancy in what students are learning in the classroom and what employers say they need in the workplace,” said Foxx, chair of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and a former community college president. “This bipartisan bill goes a long way toward ensuring that individuals who pursue a technical education have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.” The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act has provided federal support to state and local career and technical education programs for more than 30 years. H.R. 5587, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, updates the law to reflect today’s economic needs and the challenges that students and workers currently face. The legislation empowers state and local community leaders through increased flexibility and by reducing burdensome state and local requirements. It also improves alignment with in-demand jobs by supporting innovative learning opportunities, building better partnerships and encouraging stronger engagement with employers. Additionally H.R. 5587 increases transparency and accountability by ensuring secondary and postsecondary programs deliver results and providing parents, students and stakeholders a voice in setting performance goals and evaluating the effectiveness of local programs. Finally it ensures a limited federal role by reducing the Secretary of Education’s authority, limiting federal intervention and preventing political favoritism. “Educational success is about more than just a degree. It’s about preparing students for a satisfying life and teaching them the quantifiable skills that employers need in their employees,” said Foxx during remarks on the House floor. “The Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act will help students reach those goals.” ### U.S. Rep.

09.07.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that prevents the executive branch from funding activist organizations with payments from mortgage settlement cases. “Unelected bureaucrats have no business using these settlement funds to subsidize special interest groups with little accountability,” said Foxx. “Once again the Obama administration is undermining the will of Congress. They are taking money away from deserving victims and diverting it to groups that align with the administration’s positions.” An investigation by the House Judiciary Committee discovered the U.S. Department of Justice has been requiring defendants entering into settlement agreements with the federal government to donate money to left-leaning activist groups. Non-victim third-party groups have received over $880 million dollars as part of settlement agreements in the past two years. In some cases, the Obama administration is using these mandatory donations to restore funding that Congress specifically cut. H.R. 5063, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, bars all government agencies from requiring defendants to donate money to outside groups as part of their settlement agreements with the federal government. It ensures money recovered by the government goes directly to victims or is returned to the Treasury where it is subject to the congressional appropriations process. ### U.S. Rep.

08.23.2016	WASHINGTON – Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee Chairman Phil Roe (R-TN) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following joint statement today after the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) released a decision in Columbia University regarding unionization of graduate students: "For years, the board has discarded established labor policy to advance a culture of union favoritism at any cost, and this intrusion into our nation’s colleges and universities is the latest example. At a time when many Americans are already struggling to obtain a higher education, it’s disturbing that a group of unelected bureaucrats is creating new barriers to success. This partisan, short-sighted decision may have powerful union leaders cheering, but it will have far-reaching, negative consequences for schools and the students they serve. "Teaching and research programs for graduate students are important learning opportunities that help individuals gain knowledge and skills to succeed in the future. Not only will today’s decision limit these programs, but it will increase college costs and impose new obstacles on hardworking men and women trying to build their careers. We will continue working to push back on the NLRB’s activist agenda and to make it easier—not harder—for more Americans to pursue the dream of higher education." ###
07.13.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that protects rights of conscience for health care providers who choose not to participate in elective abortion. “Given the controversial nature of elective abortion, Congress has long restricted taxpayer funding for these procedures. It is unacceptable for state governments and subsidiary agencies to use taxpayer funds to coerce providers into performing or facilitating elective abortions,” said Foxx. “This bill ensures that health care providers are protected and can continue serving their patients, customers and communities without threat of government coercion or retaliation.” Congress has an extensive history of providing bipartisan conscience and freedom protections consistent with the nation’s founding principles and Constitution. The Weldon amendment is a longstanding protection in appropriations law that provides that states and localities receiving federal funds may not discriminate against a health care entity on the basis that they do not “… provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.” However, states such as California and New York have recently mandated that all insurance plans under their authority, including those offered by churches and religious organizations, must include coverage for elective abortion, and the Office of Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has refused to enforce the Weldon amendment. S. 304, the Conscience Protection Act, reaffirms the protections found in the Weldon amendment and makes clear that federal, state and local governments, including subsidiary agencies, cannot discriminate against health care providers who choose not to provide abortions. Additionally the legislation allows discriminated individuals and entities to obtain necessary legal relief. ### U.S. Rep.

07.11.2016	WASHINGTON – The U.S. House of Representatives today approved bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that will help students gain access to the facts they need to make an informed decision about where to pursue higher education. “Each year, families across the country face difficult decisions about where they can afford to send their children to college and what institution is the best fit for them. Students must wade through massive and often conflicting amounts of information in order to make an informed choice,” said Foxx, who serves as chair of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education. “Taking time to fully understand the available data can be an aggravating task that may get put off and ultimately ignored, often with disastrous consequences. This bill will improve the information students and their families need to make smart decisions about their education, providing a more complete picture of student populations on our nation’s college campuses.” H.R. 3178, the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act, improves consumer information to provide a more complete picture of all student populations, streamline existing transparency efforts at the federal level to reduce confusion for students and require better coordination by federal agencies to avoid duplication and confusion. It passed by voice vote. Specifically the legislation: • requires the Secretary of Education to create a consumer-tested College Dashboard that would display only key information students need when deciding which school to attend; • ensures the College Dashboard includes information on the completion rates of all students, including contemporary students and Pell Grant recipients; • instructs the Secretary of Education to provide a link to the College Dashboard page of each institution listed on a student’s FAFSA to make sure students know this information is available; • directs the Secretary of Education to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure all published higher education data is consistent with the information available on the College Dashboard; • improves current policies governing institutional net price calculators to give students a more accurate picture of the total cost of attending a particular institution; • streamlines and eliminate unnecessary information and federal transparency initiatives; and • respects the deep concerns that Americans have about government intrusion into their private lives by prohibiting any personally identifiable information provided by users from being sold or made available to third parties. ### U.S. Rep.

07.07.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised the House Committee on Education and the Workforce’s unanimous passage of legislation that strengthens career and technical education. “For far too long, there has been a discrepancy in what students are learning in the classroom and what employers say they need in the workplace,” said Foxx, chair of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and a former community college president. “This bipartisan bill goes a long way toward ensuring that individuals who pursue a technical education have the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.” The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act has provided federal support to state and local career and technical education programs for more than 30 years. H.R. 5587, the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, updates the law to reflect today’s economic needs and the challenges that students and workers currently face. The legislation empowers state and local community leaders through increased flexibility and by reducing burdensome state and local requirements. It also improves alignment with in-demand jobs by supporting innovative learning opportunities, building better partnerships and encouraging stronger engagement with employers. Additionally H.R. 5587 increases transparency and accountability by ensuring secondary and postsecondary programs deliver results and providing parents, students and stakeholders a voice in setting performance goals and evaluating the effectiveness of local programs. Finally it ensures a limited federal role by reducing the Secretary of Education’s authority, limiting federal intervention and preventing political favoritism. ### U.S. Rep.

07.06.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today announced the selection of Kristen Crews of Clemmons and Douglas Smith of Kernersville as the recipients of her 10th annual “Teacher in Congress” internship. Crews and Smith will arrive in Washington on July 8 for a week of intensive learning, curriculum development activities and hands-on experience in America’s federal government. “This program will provide Kristen and Douglas with a tangible way to give students a look inside the federal government,” said Foxx. “Their week in Washington will equip them to teach in new ways about our roles in a republic and hopefully inspire the next generation of North Carolina public servants with a vibrant civics education.” Crews teaches Advanced Placement U.S. History as well as American History I and II at Reagan High School in Pfafftown where she has been on staff for six years. She is the assistant volleyball coach and serves as the sponsor of the school’s Debate Club and North Carolina YMCA Youth and Government delegation. She is a graduate of Meredith College and earned a master’s degree from Salem College. Smith will teach American History I and II during his second year at East Forsyth High School in Kernersville. He previously taught at Northeast Guilford High School in McLeansville where he served as the Fellowship of Christian Athletes advisor and Bartlett Yancey High School in Yanceyville where he was the student government advisor. He is a graduate of Greensboro College. The “Teacher in Congress” internship was created to offer educators a glimpse of the workings of Congress and the federal government while experiencing the day-to-day life of a member of Congress. By supplying teachers with hands-on opportunities, the internship will help local schools enhance their civics and history curriculum. ### U.S. Rep.

07.06.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that improves access to health care through much-needed modifications to health savings accounts and provides targeted relief from Obamacare. “Health savings accounts foster a real sense of ownership and control over health care decisions,” said Foxx. “This legislation makes common-sense improvements to mechanisms that allow Americans to save for health care expenses and budget according to their specific needs.” H.R. 1270, the Restoring Access to Medication Act of 2015, repeals the Obamacare prohibition on using tax-free funds from health savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter medication without a prescription. The legislation also allows both spouses to make catch-up contributions to the same health savings account, provides more flexibility between incurring certain medical expenses prior to the establishment of a health savings account and increases the maximum contribution limit to a health savings account to match the combined annual limit on out-of-pocket and deductible expenses under their health savings account-qualified insurance plan. Additionally H.R. 1270 expands the federal government’s ability to recover funds from people who receive improper Obamacare subsidy overpayments. ### U.S. Rep.

06.16.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, today introduced a resolution (H. J. Res. 95) under the Congressional Review Act to protect workers, students, nonprofit organizations, and small business owners from the consequences of the Department of Labor’s controversial overtime rule. Concerns have been raised that the department failed to streamline existing overtime regulations and instead finalized a rule that will stifle workplace flexibility, threaten upward mobility, and burden small businesses. Additionally, nonprofit organizations and colleges and universities have warned this costly mandate will hinder their ability to serve their communities. “Our nation’s overtime rules need to be modernized, but the Department of Labor’s extreme and partisan approach will lead to damaging consequences that the American people simply cannot afford,” Rep. Foxx said. “This resolution will protect workers, students, small business owners, and vulnerable individuals from a rule that will do more harm than good.” “The Department of Labor has finalized a rule that will limit opportunities for workers, make it harder to realize the dream of a college education, and jeopardize important services for individuals in need,” said Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN). “We have a responsibility to do everything we can to ensure this doesn’t happen. I want to thank Representative Foxx for introducing this resolution and for her leadership in protecting workers, students, and vulnerable Americans from this fundamentally flawed rule.” BACKGROUND: In May, the Department of Labor released its final overtime rule, which increases the salary threshold for overtime eligibility from $23,660 to $47,476 per year. House and Senate leaders introduced legislation earlier this year to require the department to pursue a more balanced and responsible approach to updating federal overtime rules. However, the administration issued an extreme rule that will: •Stifle workplace flexibility by shifting employees into hourly status and requiring them to track their hours. •Limit opportunities for workers to climb the economic ladder by forcing employers to scale back hiring, eliminate entry-level management positions, and reduce opportunities for on-the-job training and career development. •Hurt younger Americans who will face higher college costs, fewer jobs, and new obstacles as they begin their careers. •Jeopardize crucial services for individuals in need by dramatically increasing costs on nonprofit organizations serving their communities. •Create new hurdles for small businesses that have limited resources to comply with the department’s costly mandate and will continue to confront a confusing and complex regulatory scheme that the administration failed to streamline. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress may pass a resolution of disapproval to prevent, with the full force of the law, a federal agency from implementing a rule or issuing a substantially similar rule without congressional authorization. The resolution would block the Department of Labor’s overtime rule, which is scheduled to go into effect December 1, 2016. To read the resolution, click here. To learn more, click here. ###
06.16.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would fund a number of important resources for America’s military personnel and their families. “Providing for the common defense of the United States of America is the federal government’s primary duty,” said Foxx. “This bill maintains the nation’s defense readiness and gives our men and women in uniform the resources they need to carry out their missions.” H.R. 5293, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2017, will provide $517.1 billion for the nation’s military and defense initiatives as well as $58.6 billion for overseas contingency operations. It provides a 2.1 percent pay raise for service members, which is above President Obama’s request of 1.6 percent. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 282-138. ### U.S. Rep.

06.14.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that prohibits the IRS from requiring nonprofit organizations to include information on contributors in annual filings. “Taxpayers shudder at the mere mention of the IRS, and that image hasn’t been helped since the federal government’s most feared agency admitted to singling out conservative groups for unprecedented, invasive scrutiny,” said Foxx. “As Americans, we expect our government to preserve, protect and defend our rights - not target them for political gain and control. The legislation we passed today will further curb the ability of the IRS to hinder free speech and civic participation among the public.” Form 990 is a document submitted to the IRS annually by 501(c) organizations to verify their tax-exempt status, and Schedule B is a portion of IRS Form 990 that lists the type and value of contributions and the name and address of donors who give more than $5,000 per year. Previously IRS employees have leaked the Schedule B form and the personally identifiable information of conservative donors. H.R. 5053, the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, protects the identity of individuals who contribute to tax-exempt organizations by repealing the Schedule B requirement from the Form 990 filing. ### U.S. Rep.

Each year it is an honor to nominate some of the area’s finest young men and women to attend America’s prestigious military academies and contribute to this legacy,” said Foxx. “These appointments are a testament to their hard work, discipline and strong desire to serve our country.” Each member of Congress may nominate qualified young people to the nation's service academies. Those nominees who are accepted into the academies are awarded full four-year scholarships that include tuition, books, room and board, medical and dental care.

06.13.2016	WASHINGTON – House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following joint statement regarding the Department of Education's new proposed regulation affecting student borrowers: "When a school commits fraud against a student, there should be a fair process in place to hold the school accountable and provide relief to students. Congress has given the administration the tools it needs to do just that, and the administration has been urged time and again to use those tools in a responsible way. Yet once again, the department is rejecting the reasonable approach for an extreme, partisan approach. This vague and subjective regulatory scheme—which totals more than 500 pages—threatens to ensnare institutions that are following the law and serving the best interests of their students. Taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars in discharged loans, and ultimately, students will have a harder time accessing the education they need to succeed in life. This proposed regulation should be withdrawn and current protections for students should be enforced in a fair, responsible manner." ###

04.28.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of a disapproval resolution to stop the Obama administration from implementing its flawed fiduciary rule, which affects financial advisors and retirement investments. “We have a retirement savings crisis in this nation, and it is vital that every American has access to high-quality advice and an array of financial products available at a low cost,” said Foxx during remarks on the House floor. “The Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule will significantly impact the ability of Americans to receive advice on how to save for retirement and make it more difficult for businesses, in particular small businesses, to establish retirement plans.” The Department of Labor has issued a rule that expands the department’s complex pension rules to cover IRAs and changes the definition of who is classified as a financial advisor. The rule, which contains more than 1,000 pages of new regulations, makes it cost-prohibitive to offer advice or services to low and middle-income Americans by increasing compliance costs and the risk of litigation. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 established a process through which Congress can overturn regulations issued by federal agencies by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. H.J. Res. 88 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 234-183. ### U.S. Rep.

04.27.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of bipartisan legislation that will strengthen the U.S. economy by eliminating unnecessary taxes that drive up the cost of American-made goods and services. “Manufacturing is vital to North Carolina’s 5th District and I am committed to ensuring that the industry can compete fairly at home and abroad,” said Foxx. “A number of North Carolina businesses utilize tariff reductions to decrease costs, and this legislation helps create an economic environment in which those businesses can create jobs and thrive in the global marketplace.” H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act of 2016, creates an open and transparent process for the House to consider manufacturing tax breaks through the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB). Through the MTB process, Congress temporarily suspends or reduces tariffs for certain imported resources and materials that are not made in the United States. Under the new process, local businesses will petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission and explain their need for a specific tariff reduction or suspension. After the panel receives these petitions, it will solicit comments from the public and the administration. Following analysis of the petition, the International Trade Commission will issue a public report to Congress with its recommendations regarding products that meet the MTB standards. The House Ways and Means Committee will examine the panel’s recommendations and draft a MTB proposal. As required by House rules, the committee must certify that there are no spending earmarks and publish a list of any Limited Tariff Benefits. While the committee can exclude products from its final proposal, it cannot add products that were not recommended by the commission. Congress then will consider the MTB within existing rules. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

04.21.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised the passage of several pieces of legislation in the House that will make the IRS more accountable to hardworking American taxpayers. “Another Tax Day has come and gone, and millions of Americans have been reminded of how confusing, complex and unfair the U.S. tax code is for hardworking families and small businesses. The legislation passed by the House this week will hold IRS employees accountable for their actions and increase congressional oversight of the IRS,” said Foxx. “However, we need a total rewrite of the tax code, and I will continue advocating for comprehensive tax reform that ensures a smaller, simpler income tax burden for all American families.” The IRS collects user fees for a variety of programs and services, and under current law, the IRS has authority to allocate money from its user-fee account as the agency sees fit. In fiscal year 2015, the IRS deliberately diverted resources away from taxpayer services and towards other agency functions, including implementation of the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act of 2016, ensures that every dollar the IRS collects from filing fees and other user assessments is subject to congressional approval before it is spent. In 2015, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that the IRS repeatedly rehires former employees who had well-documented conduct or performance issues. These issues include failure to file taxes, accessing taxpayer information without authorization and abuse of IRS leave and property policies. H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act of 2016, prohibits the IRS from rehiring an employee who has been fired for certain forms of misconduct. The inspector general also reported that only 39 percent of the 1,580 IRS employees found to be willfully noncompliant with tax laws between 2004 and 2013 were terminated, resigned or retired. This is despite current law which requires the IRS to terminate an employee who willfully fails to file a federal tax return or willfully understates federal tax liability. H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, suspends the hiring of new IRS employees unless the Treasury Secretary certifies that no IRS employees have serious tax delinquencies with respect to their own tax obligations. In fiscal year 2015, the Government Accountability Office reported that only 38 percent of callers wanting to speak to an IRS representative were able to reach one, the agency’s lowest level in years. The GAO recommended that the IRS create a comprehensive customer service strategy to determine appropriate levels of service. H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable Metrics Act, requires the IRS to complete a customer service strategy before paying out any more employee bonuses. ### U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement on the Department of Labor’s final fiduciary rule, which affects financial advisors and retirement investment: “The federal government should not implement regulations that make it more difficult for hardworking Americans to save money for the future. The simple truth is that the Department of Labor’s rule will reduce access to investment options and will increase costs for people saving towards retirement.” ### U.S. Rep.

03.15.2016	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed legislation by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to extend the time period during which the Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company is required to begin construction of its hydropower project at W. Kerr Scott Dam. “Congress needs to make sure onerous regulatory burdens don’t stand in the way of accessing or advancing all forms of American energy,” said Foxx. “Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company has worked to ensure its project meets the requirements outlined by the federal government and this legislation is consistent with previous congressional action to spur hydropower development at Corps facilities.” On July 17, 2012, the agency granted the company an original license for the project on the Yadkin River in Wilkes County. However, Section 13 of the Federal Power Act requires Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company to begin construction within four years of license issuance. The project has required extensive coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and there were delays in the review process for the design plans. As a result, Wilkesboro Hydroelectric Company will not be able to start construction of the amended design within the statutory deadline. Foxx’s legislation extends the time period during which the company is required to commence the construction of the project for up to three consecutive two-year periods from the date of the expiration of the extension originally issued by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. H.R. 3447 passed the House by a vote of 406-3. Identical legislation has been introduced in the Senate. ### U.S. Rep.

02.26.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that revises a number of existing programs to expand access to, and opportunities for, hunting, fishing and recreational shooting on federal lands. H.R. 2406, the Sportsmen’s Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act of 2015, also eliminates red tape, safeguards against new regulations impeding outdoor sporting activities on public lands and protects Second Amendment rights. It passed the House by a vote of 242-161. “Federal agencies frequently place burdensome regulations on the American public,” said Foxx. “This legislation ensures that future generations will have the opportunity to safely access federally-controlled land and waters for recreation.” Among its provisions, H.R. 2406 requires the Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service to open federal lands for recreational hunting, fishing and shooting and report any closures to Congress. The bill also encourages federal land management agencies to cooperate with state and local governments to maintain recreational shooting ranges. The legislation protects Second Amendment rights by allowing individuals to carry firearms on land owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and to transport crossbows across National Park Service lands. Additionally it limits the authority of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate ammunition, angling lures and other hunting equipment. ### U.S. Rep.

02.26.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding the Obama administration’s declaration that it will not enforce provisions in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act combating the boycotts, divestment and sanctions movement targeting Israel: “It is the responsibility of the president of the United States to uphold the letter and intent of the laws passed by Congress. The Obama administration’s actions are outrageous, and I am deeply concerned with the president’s animosity toward Israel, one of our strongest allies. House Republicans will use our oversight capacity to ensure these provisions are enforced.” ### U.S. Rep.

02.24.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., is encouraging high school students in North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District to submit entries for the 2016 Congressional Art Competition, which is a nationwide high school visual art competition to recognize talented young artists and promote the valuable role meaningful art plays in our society. “Every year our country’s top young artists have the chance to display their work in the United States Capitol where it will be seen by visitors from around the world,” said Foxx. “North Carolina’s artists are among the best in the nation, and I always look forward to seeing the strong talent of our local young people.” The following are guidelines for the competition: • Only high school students residing in the 5th Congressional District may compete. Students may be enrolled at public, private or home schools. • Each submission must be accompanied by a completed Congressional Art Competition release form. • All artwork must be original and may not violate any U.S. copyright laws. • All artwork must be two-dimensional. • Artwork must be framed by the artist at the time of submission. When framed, the piece can be no larger than 28 inches high, 28 inches wide and 4 inches deep. • Acceptable mediums include: paintings, drawings, collages, prints, mixed media, computer-generated art and photographs. • The deadline for submissions to Foxx’s office is Friday, April 15, at 5 p.m. • Entries should be submitted to Foxx’s Clemmons office at 3540 Clemmons Road, Suite 125, Clemmons, NC 27012.

02.23.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding President Obama’s plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay and transfer up to 60 prisoners to the United States mainland: “Bringing dangerous terrorists to the American homeland has been consistently rejected by bipartisan majorities in Congress. President Obama’s stubborn insistence on fulfilling an ill-advised campaign promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay distracts from ongoing threats to American national security and highlights the failures of his foreign policy agenda.” ### U.S. Rep.

02.09.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding President Obama’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2017: “The national debt is nearly $19 trillion – that’s approximately $58,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Our country is in the middle of a fiscal crisis driven by reckless borrowing and runaway government spending. However, President Obama continues to ignore these realities and the magnitude of the problems we face. “Despite proposing to raise taxes by $3.4 trillion over the next decade, the president’s irresponsible budget never balances because it still spends too much. He offers the American people more of the same ineffective, one-size-fits-all federal dictates. “Something has to change, or the legacy we leave to our children and grandchildren will be a crushing debt burden and a weaker, less secure and less prosperous nation. Washington owes the American people a responsible budget that reins in wasteful federal overspending and guarantees accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars, and I will continue to do all I can to make this a reality.” ### U.S. Rep.

02.02.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation to increase congressional oversight and prohibit sanctions relief for institutions and individuals supporting terrorism or Iran's ballistic missile program. “It’s clear that the Iran nuclear agreement has strengthened that country’s extremist regime,” said Foxx. “This legislation holds the Obama administration accountable for the assurances they made that American sanctions on Iran for its support of terrorism, its human rights abuses and its ballistic missile program will continue to be fully enforced.” H.R. 3662, the Iran Terror Finance Transparency Act, would block the president from offering sanctions relief to an individual or bank until certifying that such entity has not conducted a significant transaction with a terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps or in support of either Iran’s ballistic missile or its conventional weapons programs. The legislation would also prohibit the Obama administration from lifting Iran’s designation as a “Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering Concern” until it certifies that the Government of Iran is no longer supporting terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery or engaging in illicit financial activities. Additionally H.R. 3662 would provide Congress greater insight into how the Treasury Department licenses specific U.S. companies to do business in Iran and would apply the Congressional Review Act to provide Congress the ability to disapprove of Iran-related changes to the Code of Federal Regulations. Finally the bill would clarify that Iran’s proxies - Hezbollah, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad - are defined as terrorist organizations for the purposes of financial sanctions against Iran. ### U.S. Rep.

02.02.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted to override President Obama's veto of legislation that would dismantle his deeply flawed health care law and cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood. The vote to override the veto of H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, fell short of the required two-thirds majority in a 241-186 vote. “While today’s vote was unsuccessful, it’s evident that Republicans have a path forward to undo these harmful policies,” said Foxx. “With a Republican in the White House, it will be possible to remove the heavy hand of the federal government from Americans’ health care and to end the stream of taxpayer dollars that flows to an organization that brutally kills precious, unborn lives.” The legislation would have effectively repealed the mandate for individuals to have medical coverage as well as the mandate for employers to offer medical coverage to workers or face penalties. It would have eliminated the 2.3 percent tax on medical devices as well as the 40 percent excise tax, known as the “Cadillac” tax, on high-cost employer plans. Additionally the bill would have abolished the slush fund that gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services billions of dollars to spend each year with little accountability. It would have repealed the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the annual fee on health insurers. H.R. 3762 also would have barred Planned Parenthood from receiving mandatory federal funds for one year and redirected those funds to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Center (RHCs), which outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1. ### U.S. Rep.

01.13.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of a disapproval resolution seeking to stop the Obama administration from implementing its flawed “Waters of the United States” rule, which would negatively impact North Carolina farmers and landowners. The measure passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 253- 166. “Federal agencies frequently place burdensome regulations on the American public, and the ‘Waters of the United States’ rule is no exception,” said Foxx. “This resolution would prevent an out-of-touch administration from threatening the livelihood of North Carolina’s farmers and saddling local governments with exorbitant compliance costs.” In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that would significantly broaden the federal government’s power to regulate waters and adjacent lands under the Clean Water Act. The rule would give the federal government jurisdiction over puddles, roadside ditches, irrigation ditches and storm and wastewater systems. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 established a process through which Congress can overturn regulations issued by federal agencies by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The Senate passed the disapproval resolution, S.J.Res. 22, on Nov. 4 by a vote of 53-44. A disapproval resolution must be signed by the president before it can go into effect. ### U.S. Rep.

01.12.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., tonight issued the following response regarding President Obama's final State of the Union address: “For the past seven years, President Obama has given us 47,625 words of meaningless promises. Tonight’s State of the Union address was more of the same empty words. “President Obama has never adequately focused on what really matters in this country - keeping America safe and defending our cherished freedoms. Instead he wants to maintain the status quo and continues to promote top-down, one-size-fits-all federal dictates that stymie economic growth. It’s clear he doesn’t understand the solutions that will get our nation back on track begin with the American people, not Washington bureaucrats. “President Obama promised hope and change, but his failed agenda has brought the wrong kind of change and many North Carolinians are losing hope. Fortunately, Republicans are committed to restoring confidence in America and empowering her people to make their own decisions and pursue their own dreams.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.07.2016	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed legislation that includes language by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., to ensure unfunded mandates are incorporated into regulatory reform. “The issue of unfunded mandates is frequently overlooked in the debates about reforming our regulatory system and carrying out federal policies,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “It is all too easy for Washington bureaucrats to write off concerns expressed by a handful of local governments or a small subset of private businesses. But these decisions have real costs and real effects on the individuals, families and communities we each represent.” H.R. 1155, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome (SCRUB) Act of 2015, would establish a Retrospective Regulatory Review Commission to identify and recommend to Congress existing federal regulations that should be repealed to reduce unnecessary regulatory costs to the U.S. economy. Foxx’s amendment, which passed by voice vote, adds consideration of unfunded mandates to the commission’s review of existing rules. H.R. 712, the Sunshine for Regulatory Decrees and Settlements Act, would increase accountability and transparency in the federal regulatory process by providing increased scrutiny of sue-and settle rulemakings cases, mandating increased reporting requirements for planned rulemaking and providing for simplified summaries of proposed rules. Foxx’s amendment, which passed by voice vote, adds unfunded mandates to the reporting requirements for planned rulemaking by federal agencies. A strong advocate of shedding light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector entities, Foxx has introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act in the past four Congresses. It has passed the House with bipartisan support on four separate occasions, including by a vote of 250 to 173 on Feb. 4, 2015. According to the American Action Forum, the U.S. government created 79,230 pages of new regulations in the federal register in 2015 with a total of $98.9 billion in regulatory costs. ### U.S. Rep.

01.06.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would dismantle President Obama’s deeply flawed health care law and cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood. “The so-called Affordable Care Act has proved to be anything but affordable for North Carolinians, who have faced some of the largest premium increases in the country,” said Foxx. “The simple truth is that the president’s government takeover of our health care system has increased barriers to care, limited patients’ choices and wasted taxpayer dollars. The American people were sold a bill of goods that has proven to be a list of empty promises, and it’s time to undo this harmful law.” The House voted to concur with the Senate’s amendment to H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, by a vote of 240-181. The bill now goes to President Obama. The legislation would effectively repeal the mandate for individuals to have medical coverage as well as the mandate for employers to offer medical coverage to workers or face penalties. It would eliminate the 2.3 percent tax on medical devices as well as the 40 percent excise tax, known as the “Cadillac” tax, on high-cost employer plans. Additionally the bill would abolish the slush fund that gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services billions of dollars to spend each year with little accountability. It would repeal the law’s expansion of Medicaid and the annual fee on health insurers. H.R. 3762 also would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving mandatory federal funds for one year and redirect those funds to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Center (RHCs), which outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1. “We all know money is fungible, and the federal funds that Planned Parenthood receives, mostly from Medicaid, ultimately subsidize their abortion services. No organization that performs divisive practices like abortion, particularly in such a gruesome, profitable manner, should receive taxpayer dollars,” said Foxx. “Fortunately, there are many more options for women's health care. With more than 13,000 publicly supported locations, Federally Qualified and Rural Health Centers are a better investment for the American people.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.05.2016	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement after President Obama announced new executive actions to restrict Second Amendment rights: “As citizens of the United States, we are afforded basic rights and privileges under the Constitution. One of these fundamental rights is the Second Amendment, and its guarantee to keep and bear arms is clear. Today, in yet another attempt to erode our basic liberties, President Obama announced plans to undermine the will of Congress and challenge the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. “Just like his unilateral actions on immigration, this proposal is an overreach of the president’s Constitutionally-granted executive authority. It is also an attempt to distract from his failed policies to combat terrorism and improve the economy – issues I’m hearing about from my constituents every day. Congressional refusal to pass bad policy does not transfer legislative authority to the president, and I will fight against this attempt to diminish our constitutional rights. “Guns are one of many tools that people use to commit horrific crimes, but the problem of evil cannot be legislated away. It is important that any legislative response – whether it’s at the federal, state or local level - ensures that the constitutional rights of all citizens are protected. ” ### U.S. Rep.

12.18.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of the bipartisan “omnibus” spending bill to appropriate funds for the federal government. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 316-113. “As a legislator, I am often responsible for making a decision on the legislation before me rather than the legislation I’d like to see,” said Foxx. “While an omnibus spending bill is not ideal, this legislation includes a number of conservative victories and advances Republican priorities in spite of a divided Washington.” Among the provisions included in the bill is language that lifts the government’s 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports, which will help shift energy dependence of emerging democracies away from bad actors like Russia and Iran. The legislation also strengthens national security by tightening requirements under the visa waiver program and increasing resources for our military so that troops have what they need to carry out their mission. Additionally the bill rejects funding for new or expanded EPA regulatory programs and holds the agency to its lowest spending levels since 2008. It also prohibits new funding for Obamacare and prevents a taxpayer bailout of Obamacare’s risk corridor program. Earlier this year Senate Democrats vowed to block consideration of spending bills, causing the regular appropriations process to come to a halt and forcing this year-end omnibus legislation. “Completing the appropriations process is Congress’ constitutional duty. It’s my sincere hope that next year the Senate will stop invoking the threat of harmful government shutdowns and complete its work under regular order as the House has done for the past five years, subjecting the vast federal bureaucracy to congressional oversight and allowing the elimination of wasteful spending on ineffective programs,” said Foxx. ### U.S. Rep.

12.17.2015	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed bipartisan legislation that includes language by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., to correct a technical limitation preventing the rollover of tax-deferred retirement funds into existing SIMPLE IRA accounts. The language is part of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act, which provides permanent tax relief for American families, college students, charities, small businesses and enterprises on the forefront of innovation. “Individuals should be able to consolidate their retirement funds in a way that best meets their needs, and I’m pleased this legislation includes language that will simplify retirement planning and ensure a complex tax code does not prevent sensible financial planning decisions,” said Foxx. “This legislation is an important first step on the long road to ensuring our tax system works for Americans, not against them.” SIMPLE IRAs face a 25 percent early withdrawal penalty during the first two years of their existence compared to 10 percent for other IRAs. In order to prevent account holders from unknowingly rolling their IRA funds into SIMPLE IRAs and being surprised by an increased early withdrawal penalty, current law prohibits rolling funds over into a SIMPLE IRA from other retirement accounts. However, SIMPLE IRAs have the same early withdrawal penalty as other IRAs after that initial two-year period, and consumers and financial planners have struggled with the rollover restrictions as they attempt to consolidate accounts. Foxx’s language allows for rollovers into SIMPLE IRA accounts that have met the two-year threshold. By making a number of temporary tax provisions permanent, the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act delivers certainty to American taxpayers and makes it easier for employers to plan ahead, hire new workers, grow their businesses and invest in their communities. ### U.S. Rep.

12.08.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of bipartisan legislation that would help the Department of Homeland Security identify and stop terrorists with Western passports from entering the United States. “National security is the number one job of the federal government, and this bipartisan legislation is one step toward reducing the risk that terrorists pose to our nation,” said Foxx. “We need a comprehensive review of how foreigners gain admittance to the United States – whether through the refugee process, border crossings or visas – so we can take the necessary steps to protect America and her people.” H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of 2015, passed the House by a vote of 407-19. The legislation is designed to strengthen the security of the Visa Waiver Program to better ensure that individuals entering the United States through the program are not security risks while also maintaining the program’s ability to facilitate legitimate foreign business travel and tourism. The Visa Waiver Program allows citizens of 38 participating countries to travel to the United States without a visa for stays of 90 days or less when they meet certain requirements. ### U.S. Rep.

12.03.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding her vote against the conference report for a five-year surface transportation package costing more than $300 billion that also includes language to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank: “This legislation does not address the growing gap between the Highway Trust Fund’s revenues and expenses, instead expanding that gap to increase federal transportation spending. That spending relies on $70 billion from taxpayers through a transfer from the General Fund that is offset with gimmicks. It is the wrong way to proceed. We need a long-term solution that reevaluates the federal government’s transportation priorities and makes aggressive reforms on federal regulations and mandates. It’s past time to correct the federal government’s role in transportation programs and give states more control. “As I previously shared when voting against stand-alone legislation reauthorizing the bank, I believe the Export-Import Bank conflicts with core conservative principles on the free market and unfairly allows the government to pick winners and losers while requiring taxpayers to bear the risks of private companies’ activities.” ### U.S. Rep.

12.02.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation to improve K-12 education by replacing No Child Left Behind with new policies to help every child access a high-quality education. “As a grandmother, educator and former school board member, I know students are best served when teachers, parents and administrators are the driving force behind improving education,” said Foxx. “This legislation does just that by reducing the federal footprint in the nation’s classrooms and restoring control to the people who know their students best.” The House passed the conference report accompanying S. 1177, the Every Student Succeeds Act, by a vote of 359-64. The Senate is expected to consider the conference report next week. Foxx participated in the committee that ironed out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the legislation. The compromise between the House-passed Student Success Act and the Senate-passed Every Child Achieves Act of 2015 gets Washington out of the business of running schools. It protects state and local autonomy by prohibiting the Secretary of Education from coercing states into adopting Common Core and by preventing the secretary from imposing requirements on states and school districts through executive fiat. The legislation eliminates the burdensome, one-size-fits-all accountability system that has done more to tie up states and school districts in red tape than to support local efforts to educate children. It also reduces the size of the federal education bureaucracy by eliminating 49 ineffective and duplicative federal programs and requiring the Secretary of Education to reduce the department’s workforce accordingly. The legislation also provides eligible school districts the ability to have federal, state, and local funds follow students to the schools they attend, which will encourage excellent schools to enroll students who are harder to serve. “Currently states are forced to choose between the fundamentally flawed policies of No Child Left Behind, which doubled down on federal programs, mandates and spending, and the Obama administration’s controversial temporary, conditional waiver scheme, which has imposed the administration’s preferred policies and heightened the level of uncertainty shared by states and school districts,” said Foxx. “America’s students deserve better. By reversing Washington’s one-size-fits-all micromanagement of classrooms, Congress is giving parents, teachers and local education leaders the tools they need to repair a broken education system and help all children reach their potential.” ### U.S. Rep.

11.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., will present the family of Willis Tom Bradshaw with the medals he earned during service in World War II on Saturday, Nov. 28, at 4 p.m. in Foxx’s Clemmons office. Bradshaw was a Seaman Second Class in the U.S. Navy Reserve. He was killed in action on Nov. 13, 1942, when the USS Juneau was sunk during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. “It was a privilege to assist the Ford family in obtaining these medals,” said Foxx. “As a country, we are uniquely blessed. We live in a nation where each one of us has the opportunity for nearly limitless fulfillment and prosperity in the world’s finest democracy. That freedom and opportunity has been made available to us because of the sacrifices of people like Willis Tom Bradshaw.” Bradshaw’s daughter Bonnie Ford of Clemmons will receive her father’s World War II Victory Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Pin and a replacement Purple Heart, a medal given to members of the military wounded or killed by enemy action or in action against the enemy. Ford was seven years old when her father was killed. She will be accompanied by her son and daughter-in-law Dennis and Susan Ford as well as her granddaughter Paige Ford. In addition to helping residents of North Carolina’s 5th District navigate the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Foxx’s office is available to assist veterans and their families with replacing military medals that have been lost or stolen as well as obtaining medals that still need to be presented. Foxx’s Clemmons office is located at 3540 Clemmons Road, Suite 125, Clemmons, NC 27012. The medal presentation is open to members of the media. ### U.S. Rep.

11.19.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would strengthen the vetting system for Syrian and Iraqi refugees being admitted to the United States. “Obama administration officials have said there are inherent shortcomings in the current screening process for refugees, especially those fleeing embattled Middle East countries where government databases are unreliable or nonexistent,” said Foxx. “Comparing an individual's information against such deficient data leaves significant intelligence gaps and exposes the United States to insufficiently vetted individuals. This legislation is a first step toward understanding and addressing those security risks.” H.R. 4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act of 2015, would put in place the most robust national-security vetting process in history to ensure terrorists do not exploit humanitarian programs to enter the United States. The legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security, in unanimous concurrence with the FBI Director and the Director of National Intelligence, to certify to Congress that each refugee from Iraq and Syria is not a security threat. The bill also would require the FBI Director to certify that an individual has received a background investigation that is sufficient to determine that the refugee is not a security threat to the United States. The Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General would be required to independently assess the refugee approvals and provide an annual report detailing its findings to Congress. ### U.S. Rep.

11.17.2015	WASHINGTON-- This afternoon, the ten Republican members of North Carolina's U.S. House of Representatives delegation released the following statement in response to Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris and Governor Pat McCrory's request that the Obama Administration cease sending Syrian refugees to North Carolina. The joint statement was issued by Congresswoman Renee Ellmers (NC-2), Congressman Walter Jones (NC-3), Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Congressman Mark Walker (NC-6), Congressman David Rouzer (NC-7), Congressman Richard Hudson (NC-8), Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-9), Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10), Congressman Mark Meadows (NC-11), and Congressman George Holding (NC-13). “Last Friday we were horrified to watch the terrorist attacks unfold in Paris. To see innocent lives taken by a group of radical Islamic terrorists was sickening and our prayers go out to all those impacted by this unspeakable tragedy. “In the days since, we have been deeply troubled to learn one of the terrorists who committed this atrocity may have come to Europe posing as a Syrian refugee. With the massive influx of Syrian refugees to Europe, this was always a threat and, regrettably, now it’s been realized. “Given this development we have serious concerns about the ongoing resettlement of Syrian refugees to the communities we represent across North Carolina. As a delegation, we join with Governor McCrory in calling for the Obama Administration to immediately cease sending Syrian refugees to our state. We believe this is a common sense step and applaud Governor McCrory for his leadership on the issue. “The Paris attacks highlighted that ISIL is not contained and still poses a grave threat to Western Democracies. Blocking the flow of Syrian refugees until we can better understand and address security risks they may pose is a necessary step to protect our state and homeland.” ###
11.17.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, today was appointed by House Speaker Paul Ryan to participate in the committee that will iron out the differences between the House and Senate versions of legislation to improve K-12 education by replacing No Child Left Behind. “It is a privilege to serve on this conference committee, and I'm glad North Carolina will have a seat at the table,” Foxx said. “As a grandmother, educator and former school board member, I know America’s students are best served when those at the local level are the driving force behind improving education. I look forward to working with my colleagues as we take positive steps toward ensuring local educators have the flexibility required to meet the diverse needs of their students.” The House passed H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, by a vote of 218 to 213 on July 8, 2015. The legislation is a long-term solution that would prevent future federal overreach into elementary and secondary education, support effective teaching in the classroom, provide parents a stronger voice in education and restore local control. The Senate passed a separate bill to reform and reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In her role as a House conferee, Foxx will work with her Senate and House colleagues to produce the final version of the bill. ### U.S. Rep.

11.11.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement to commemorate Veterans Day: “On Veterans Day we rightly single out the members of our military past and present to honor them with the respect and gratitude they deserve. The veterans that we honor today are a reflection of American greatness. Liberty is bought and paid for by the incomprehensible generosity of these patriots. “In November we also honor the commitment and sacrifices of our military families by celebrating Military Family Month. Through deployments, separations and moves across the country and overseas, these families inspire us as they endure the extended absence of their loved ones with grace, strength and devotion. “America is the land of the free because we are the home of the brave. I thank our veterans for seeing the value of freedom and rising to America’s defense with unfailing strength. I thank our military families for standing with our service members, supporting that great bravery and sharing in the sacrifice.” ### U.S. Rep.

Howard Coble: “Howard Coble was a dedicated public servant and a champion for his constituents. He never backed down from a challenge to do what was right for North Carolina and always pushed Washington to work better for those he represented. Howard was the essence of what it means to be a southern gentleman: someone who simply exuded kindness, charm and compassion. He was a man of integrity and principle, a representative who stood for what is right and who fought on behalf of what makes America great. He will be missed, but his legacy of service and devotion to North Carolina will continue to be the standard that current and future leaders follow.” ### U.S. Rep.

10.28.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding her vote against the federal budget agreement that would suspend the debt ceiling through March 2017: “Every time the federal government approaches its debt limit, like clockwork, liberal politicians – from the White House down – begin threatening ‘default’ unless the government is able to continue with its spending binge. Such gamesmanship is a disservice to everyone. “Our country is in the middle of a fiscal crisis driven by reckless borrowing and runaway government spending. The national debt is nearly $18.5 trillion – that’s approximately $57,000 for every man, woman and child in America. Something has to change, or the legacy we leave to our children and grandchildren will be a crushing debt burden and a weaker, less secure and less prosperous nation. “Unfortunately, the budget agreement passed by the House ignores our fiscal realities and the magnitude of the problems we face. Filled with creative accounting, gimmickry and faux savings, it is not a responsible way to get the federal government’s finances in order and improve America’s long-term fiscal health.” ### U.S. Rep.

10.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding her vote against reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank: “As a former small business owner, I certainly understand the many challenges that companies face to be successful in an internationally competitive business environment. However, the Ex-Im Bank conflicts with core conservative principles on the free market and unfairly allows the government to pick winners and losers while requiring taxpayers to bear the risks of private companies’ activities. It is very unfortunate that the federal government entered this line of business in the first place, and I wish that our efforts were put towards ensuring other nations cease these policies of economic distortion instead of reauthorizing a federal agency whose operations are a step back from the free enterprise system that has made our nation the envy of the world.” ### U.S. Rep.

10.27.2015	WASHINGTON House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement in response to two higher education regulations the administration finalized earlier today: Today’s announcement continues the administration’s pattern of micromanaging higher education through the regulatory process. Neither proposal solves the underlying problems that need to be addressed. In fact, the department has made some of our higher education challenges worse. As we have seen over the last six years, piling more federal programs and regulations on top of a broken higher education system is not in the best interests of students, families, taxpayers, and institutions. The best way to improve higher education is to improve the law, and that is precisely what we remain committed to. ###
10.23.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would dismantle President Obama’s deeply flawed health care law and temporarily cut federal funding to Planned Parenthood. “The so-called Affordable Care Act has proved to be anything but affordable for North Carolinians, who have faced some of the largest premium increases in the country,” said Foxx. “The simple truth is that the president’s government takeover of our health care system has increased barriers to care, limited patients’ choices and wasted taxpayer dollars. It’s time undo this harmful law.” H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, passed the House by a vote of 240-189. The legislation would rescind the mandates for individuals to have medical coverage and employers to offer it to workers or face penalties. It would eliminate the 2.3 percent tax on medical devices as well as the 40 percent excise tax, known as the “Cadillac” tax, on high-cost employer plans. Additionally the bill would abolish the slush fund that gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services billions of dollars to spend each year with little accountability. It would repeal the requirement for large employers to automatically enroll new full-time employees in coverage they may not want or need. H.R. 3762 also would bar Planned Parenthood from receiving federal taxpayer dollars for one year and invest that money in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) and Rural Health Center (RHCs), which outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics 20 to 1. “We all know money is fungible, and the federal funds that Planned Parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion services. No organization that performs divisive practices like abortion, particularly in such a gruesome, profitable manner, should receive taxpayer dollars,” said Foxx. “With more than 13,000 publicly supported locations, Federally Qualified and Rural Health Centers are a better investment for the American people.” ### U.S. Rep.

10.07.2015	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed a resolution introduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that creates a special House panel to investigate abortion practices at providers such as Planned Parenthood and the sale of unborn children’s tissue. “The creation of this panel ensures the House exercises one of its most fundamental constitutional responsibilities, oversight of the use of federal funds and compliance with federal law,” said Foxx. “Undercover videos have revealed that an organization that receives hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars annually, Planned Parenthood, has also been taking the remains of unborn children and selling them to tissue collection firms. Its staff has reportedly even altered their medical procedures to more effectively dismember unborn children. How can we in Congress ignore these charges?” H. Res. 461 passed the House by a vote of 242-184. The panel will examine medical procedures and business practices of entities involved in fetal tissue procurement; federal funding and support for abortion providers; practices of providers of second and third trimester abortions, including partial birth abortions; medical care provided to children born alive as a result of an attempted abortion; and necessary changes in law or regulation identified by the investigation. “Even if these abortion providers somehow managed to comply with all federal laws while dismembering children, it’s clear that we need to learn more about their barbaric tactics so we can amend those laws and ensure practices like these never happen again, particularly by organizations receiving millions from U.S. taxpayers,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. ### U.S. Rep.

09.29.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would give states much-needed flexibility to prevent Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from participating in their Medicaid programs. “Over the past few months, extremely disturbing information has come to light about the activities of abortion providers and their sale of unborn children’s hearts and other organs for compensation,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “In light of those discoveries, states should have the right to decide whether their Medicaid funds support a provider whose atrocities have shocked our national conscience and devalued human life.” H.R. 3495, the Women’s Public Health and Safety Act, passed the House by a vote of 236-193. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that $390 million of the $450 million in taxpayer funds that Planned Parenthood receives annually is provided through Medicaid. ### U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today announced that she will host a benefits workshop for seniors on Friday, Oct. 16, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Davie County Senior Center, 278 Meroney Street, Mocksville, NC 27028. “As the open-enrollment period for Medicare approaches, this workshop will include timely information for beneficiaries and their families,” said Foxx. “Seniors in North Carolina’s 5th District should make plans to join us and learn more about opportunities to help them have a healthier and happier retirement.” The open-enrollment period for Medicare beneficiaries will start on Oct. 15 and end on Dec. 7. This is the only time during the year, except in unique circumstances, when current Medicare enrollees are able to make changes to their existing coverage. Local organizations as well as state and federal agencies will be available to answer questions and provide information on the benefits they have available for seniors, including the Social Security Administration; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; North Carolina Housing Finance Agency; Davie County Sheriff’s Department Fraud Unit; Davidson County Community College’s Davie Campus; Forsyth County Senior Services; Davie County Silver Sneakers; and American Red Cross.

09.24.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding Pope Francis' address to a joint meeting of Congress: “It’s easy to see why people around the world have embraced Pope Francis. His example of love, mercy and compassion is one that we all should strive to emulate. “The United States, and the world, are facing difficult challenges, and Pope Francis is correct that the gravity of these challenges demands that we work together to find solutions that respect our differences and conscience. “It was gratifying to hear Pope Francis speak today for those who cannot by urging us to ‘protect and defend human life at every stage of its development’ and recognize the vital importance of a strong family to our nation’s progress and prosperity.” Pope Francis is the first leader of the Holy See to address Congress. Due to the unprecedented nature of his visit, Pope Francis' address was broadcast live to members of the public, including constituents from North Carolina’s 5th District, on the West Front of the Capitol. Carol Markey, a member of St. Leo the Great Catholic Church in Winston-Salem, was Foxx’s guest in the House gallery. ### U.S. Rep.

09.18.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would temporarily bar federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood and strengthen protections for babies that survive abortion. “This is a very emotional issue for those of us who value life so much. In these days of 3-D ultrasounds and high-definition screens, it is impossible to hide the humanity of these child victims. They have fingers and toes, heartbeats and organs developed enough that tissue collectors will pay $60 a specimen for them,” said Foxx. “What is heartening, in the face of this contentious debate, is the principle that the truth always comes out. Abortionists can no longer hide in the dark back rooms of their facilities and sell unborn children piece by piece under an illusion that no one will ever know their crimes.” H.R. 3134, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, would place an immediate moratorium on all federal funding of Planned Parenthood for the span of one year while Congress conducts a full investigation into the organization’s activities. H.R. 3134 passed the House by a vote of 241-187. Americans can stay up-to-date on the House’s investigations into Planned Parenthood at http://www.gop.gov/solution_content/plannedparenthood/. “While Planned Parenthood does not receive direct federal funding for abortions, investigations are warranted, as a recent report from the Government Accountability Office shows that the organization receives an average of $500 million taxpayer dollars each year for other lines of business,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “Money is fungible, and the federal funds that Planned Parenthood receives ultimately subsidize their abortion services. No organization that performs divisive practices like abortion, particularly in such a gruesome, profitable manner, should receive taxpayer dollars, and this legislation advances that principle.” H.R. 3504, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would require health care practitioners present at the time of birth to administer professional skill, care and diligence to preserve the life and health of the child who is born alive after a failed abortion attempt. H.R. 3504 passed the House by a vote of 248-177. “This small, but important, step ensures the protection and preservation of precious, newborn life by providing for criminal penalties when that life is lost as a result of negligence,” said Foxx. “These tiny, vulnerable lives deserve the protection afforded all other persons under the law, and this bill ensures that their lives are protected.” This week Foxx also joined three House colleagues in introducing H.R. 3515, the Dismemberment Abortion Ban Act, which would prohibit doctors from performing dismemberment abortions, which involves using steel tools to tear apart a well-developed unborn child by brute force. ### U.S. Rep.

09.11.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted against legislation to approve the nuclear agreement between Iran and a group of six nations led by the United States. H.R. 3461 failed by a vote of 162-269. “The United States must continue to stand between Iran and nuclear weapons capability. Unfortunately, the deal presented by President Obama legitimizes Iran’s nuclear achievements and strengthens its extremist regime,” said Foxx. “This nation cannot risk the continued existence of Israel and the stability of the Middle East in order to win praise for renewed engagement with Iran.” Foxx also voted in favor of legislation that would prevent President Obama from lifting sanctions against Iran. H.R. 3460 passed the House by a vote of 247-186. “The agreement gradually removes the key barriers that prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons capabilities, from growing its economic influence in the Middle East and from continuing its state funding of terrorist organizations that threaten the security of this country and the well-being of our allies,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “By removing crucial economic sanctions, we will allow billions of dollars to flow into Iran. It is expected that much of this windfall will pass through the Iranian economy to entities like Hezbollah, which has dedicated itself to war with Israel since the early 1980s.” On Sept. 10, Foxx voted in favor of a resolution asserting that the Obama administration did not provide information required for congressional review of the Iran nuclear deal. H. Res. 411 maintains that Congress is required to be provided access to all documents related to the agreement, including the two secret side deals forged between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 243-186. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

It will be an informative experience for all who attend.” Representatives from all five academies will be in attendance to explain more about their requirements and expectations. The event also will allow local students the opportunity to ask questions and receive advice about the admissions process. High school students of all ages and their parents are encouraged to attend.

08.04.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today presented U.S. Marine Corps veteran Brett Bush of Ashe County with the Purple Heart, a medal given to members of the military wounded or killed by enemy action or in action against the enemy. Bush served eight years as a U.S. Marine, earning the rank of sergeant. He was wounded in Afghanistan on Nov. 26, 2010, during his third tour. Bush was sworn in as a trooper for the North Carolina State Highway Patrol in January 2015 and serves in Forsyth County. “It is always an honor to assist veterans, and it was a privilege to help Sgt. Bush obtain the Purple Heart that he earned for his service,” said Foxx. “America’s troops do not take risks for their own gain. They do so for others – for their colleagues, for their families and for their country. Liberty is bought and paid for by the incomprehensible generosity of patriots like Sgt. Bush, who has continued to serve the public good by helping maintain the safety of the highways of North Carolina.” In addition to helping residents of North Carolina’s 5th District navigate the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Foxx’s office is available to assist veterans with replacing military medals that have been lost or stolen as well as obtaining medals that still need to be presented.

07.30.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced legislation that would help students gain access to the facts they need to make an informed decision about where to pursue higher education. “Currently students and families must wade through massive and often conflicting amounts of information in order to make an informed decision about college. As a result, taking time to fully understand the available data can be an aggravating task that may get put off and ultimately ignored, often with disastrous consequences,” said Foxx, who serves as chair of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education. “My legislation would streamline the overwhelming maze of information with a consumer-tested College Dashboard that provides students with key information, including enrollment, completion, net price, average loan debt and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data.” H.R. 3178, the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act, would improve consumer information to provide a more complete picture of all student populations, streamline existing transparency efforts at the federal level to reduce confusion for students and require better coordination by federal agencies to avoid duplication and confusion. The legislation would: • require the Secretary of Education to create a consumer-tested College Dashboard that would display only key information students need when deciding which school to attend; • ensure the College Dashboard includes information on the completion rates of all students, including contemporary students and Pell Grant recipients; • instruct the Secretary of Education to provide a link to the College Dashboard page of each institution listed on a student’s FAFSA to make sure students know this information is available; • direct the Secretary of Education to coordinate with other federal agencies to ensure all published higher education data is consistent with the information available on the College Dashboard; • improve current policies governing institutional net price calculators to give students a more accurate picture of the total cost of attending a particular institution; and • streamline and eliminate unnecessary information and federal transparency initiatives. ### U.S. Rep.

07.29.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of several pieces of legislation designed to help veterans and increase accountability at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “It is critically important that we provide high-quality, timely care for those who have sacrificed so much in service to our country,” said Foxx. “This week Congress continued its efforts to meet our responsibility to America’s veterans, but we cannot transform the VA alone. It is the president’s responsibility to ensure changes are made within the agency and employees are held accountable for their actions. America’s veterans deserve a meaningful, decisive plan from the Obama administration to right the many wrongs that have been committed.” This week the House approved: • H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act of 2015, which would provide the VA Secretary with increased flexibility in removing employees who fail our veterans • H. J. Res 61, the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015, which would make it easier to hire veterans by exempting those who already have health insurance from being counted as full-time employees under Obamacare; • H.R. 675, the Veterans’ Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act, which would provide an annual cost-of-living adjustment for veterans receiving disability compensation; and • H.R. 1607, the Ruth Moore Act of 2015, which would update regulations for veterans seeking financial compensation for mental health conditions linked to sexual assault while they were serving in the military. Additionally, the House passed legislation to fund the nation’s highway and transit programs for three months that also includes a provision that would temporarily relieve a $2.5 billion shortfall at the VA, preventing VA hospitals from closing in August. ### U.S. Rep.

07.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has joined 64 of her House colleagues in co-sponsoring legislation that would permanently cut off taxpayer funding for abortion providers. “With so many Americans fundamentally opposed to abortion, organizations that perform elective abortions should not receive taxpayer dollars,” said Foxx. “While there are currently restrictions that prohibit the use of taxpayer dollars to fund elective abortion directly, we know that money is fungible and that federal funds support these organizations’ entire operations, including elective abortion.” H.R. 3197, the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act, would prohibit federal funding to any entity unless it certifies that it will not perform abortions during the period for which funding is provided and that it will not provide any funds to entities that do perform abortions. “Few things demean the sanctity of human life more than elective abortion,” said Foxx. “Until the day when a culture of life takes hold in the United States and all children are protected under the law, it remains my solemn duty to stand up for life. Regardless of the length of this journey, I will continue to speak for those who cannot.” ### U.S. Rep.

07.23.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would ban so-called sanctuary cities from receiving certain taxpayer-funded grants from the U.S. Department of Justice. The term “sanctuary cities” refers to nearly 300 communities that have adopted laws or policies that limit the extent to which local authorities can assist the federal government on immigration matters. “By undermining federal immigration law, these communities are needlessly risking the safety of American citizens,” said Foxx. “The problem is compounded by the Obama administration’s tacit endorsement of these so-called sanctuary policies and its lack of enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws. Under the administration’s policies, thousands of criminal aliens have been released into American communities. This bill is a good first step but more must be done. It’s time to stop President Obama from shutting down immigration enforcement.” H.R. 3009, the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act, passed the House by a vote of 241-179. Under the legislation, federal grants that would be unavailable to sanctuary jurisdictions include the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (Byrne-JAG). ### U.S. Rep.

07.21.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would give Congress and the public access to key data from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “America’s veterans deserve better than the inexcusable mismanagement we’ve seen over the last few years, and this legislation will help ensure Congress has access to information that is essential to holding the VA accountable,” said Foxx. “It is critically important that we provide high-quality, timely care for those who have sacrificed so much in service to our country. Congress will continue our efforts to reform the VA, but the Obama administration needs to change its culture and end the agency-wide pattern of misconduct and neglect.” H.R. 2256, the Veterans Information Modernization Act, would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit an annual report to Congress regarding the delivery of health care, medical services and nursing home care by the VA health care system. The bill also would establish the Veterans Expedited Recovery Commission to study, survey and evaluate the VA’s ability to effectively treat veterans with mental health issues and would require the VA to submit an action plan for implementing complementary and alternative medicine treatments based upon a final report by the commission. Additionally H.R. 2256 would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to create an identification and tracking system for medical biological implants and would clarify which types of biological implants the VA may procure. Finally the legislation would amend the VA’s definition of a “homeless veteran” to include a veteran or veteran’s family who is fleeing domestic or dating violence, sexual assault, stalking or other dangerous situation in their residence, has no other residence and lacks the resources to obtain other permanent housing. H.R. 2256 passed the House unanimously. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

07.15.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced no-cost, bipartisan legislation to correct a technical limitation preventing the rollover of tax-deferred retirement funds into existing SIMPLE IRA accounts. “This legislation will simplify retirement planning and ensure a complex tax code does not prevent sensible financial planning decisions,” said Foxx. “Individuals should be able to consolidate their retirement funds in a way that best meets their needs. This legislation is a small but important first step on the long road to ensuring our tax system works for Americans, not against them.” In 1996, federal legislation established a new type of employer-sponsored retirement plan known as a SIMPLE IRA. These plans were designed to give small businesses a retirement option for their employees without the administrative burdens of other employer-sponsored retirement plan types. SIMPLE IRAs face a 25 percent early withdrawal penalty during the first two years of their existence compared to 10 percent for other IRAs. In order to prevent account holders from unknowingly rolling their IRA funds into SIMPLE IRAs and being surprised by an increased early withdrawal penalty, current law prohibits rolling funds over into a SIMPLE IRA from other retirement accounts. However, SIMPLE IRAs have the same early withdrawal penalty as other IRAs after that initial two-year period, and consumers and financial planners have struggled with the rollover restrictions as they attempt to consolidate accounts. H.R. 3050 would allow for rollovers into SIMPLE IRA accounts that have met the two-year threshold. The Joint Committee on Taxation has previously estimated this legislation would have a “negligible effect” on federal tax revenues. Rep. John Larsen, D-Conn., is an original co-sponsor of Foxx’s legislation. ### U.S. Rep.

07.14.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding the announcement of a final nuclear agreement with Iran: “Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is critical to securing peace in the Middle East and protecting U.S. interests, and I remain deeply concerned that this agreement simply delays Iran’s path to a nuclear bomb and further empowers the world’s largest state sponsor of terror. In return for marginally slowing the pace of its nuclear ambitions, the agreement appears to reward Iran with billions in sanctions relief. With my colleagues in Congress, I will carefully review the proposed agreement and do all in my power to make certain that the deal prevents Iran from gaining nuclear weapons capabilities and ensures that international inspectors can validate their adherence to the negotiated terms.” ### U.S. Rep.

07.10.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of bipartisan legislation that seeks better, faster, safer and more innovative approaches to treat diseases and medical conditions that currently lack effective therapies. “It currently takes 15 years for a new drug to move from the lab to the local pharmacy. Great strides have been made in research and treatment of many diseases, but there is still much we have to learn,” said Foxx. “By accelerating the discovery, development and delivery of life saving and life improving therapies, we can transform the search for faster cures.” H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, would modernize clinical trials to expedite the development of new drugs and devices, remove regulatory uncertainty in the development of new medical apps and break down barriers to facilitate increased research collaboration. The legislation includes significant investments in medical research, which Foxx believes is critical to understanding the causes of diseases and how to best treat people suffering from them. The 21st Century Cures Act would fully pay for these new investments with savings in other areas and includes permanent entitlement reforms that would save taxpayers an additional $500 million over the next 10 years. It also gives Congress the ability to review programs and prioritize spending where it is needed most. Additionally the legislation would apply the Hyde amendment and other restrictions that protect the sanctity of life to taxpayer dollars included in the bill. The Hyde amendment has been regularly attached to annual appropriations bills for nearly 40 years to prevent federal funding of elective abortion with limited exceptions. ### U.S. Rep.

07.10.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation that will create an official identification card for veterans. “Many veterans have contacted me over the years expressing their frustration at having to carry official Department of Defense discharge papers to prove their military service,” said Foxx. “This legislation makes it easier for our veterans to access services available to them and better protects them from identify theft.” H.R. 91, the Veterans Identification Card Act 2015, unanimously passed the House and the Senate and has been sent to the president’s desk for his signature. The legislation will make it easier for veterans to prove their military service without having to produce a service record or other valuable document. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs currently offers identification cards only to those who have served at least 20 years in the Armed Forces or those who receive medical care for a service-connected disability. As a result, many veterans have to document their military service through official records, which contain sensitive personal information that leaves them at unnecessary risk for identity theft. ### U.S. Rep.

07.09.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of bipartisan legislation that addresses the growing economic and environmental threats of catastrophic wildfire by expediting and improving forest management activities in federal forests. “As a member of the National Parks Caucus and someone who loves the outdoors, it is my desire to protect the bountiful natural resources of our beautiful nation and pass them along to the next generation,” said Foxx. “This legislation will improve the health of overgrown, fire-prone federal forests by implementing proactive management standards.” H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, would simplify environmental process requirements, lessen project planning times and reduce the cost of implementing forest management projects while ensuring robust protection of the environment. A 2012 Forest Service report estimated between 65 million and 85 million acres of forest are facing some level of threat of wildfire and are in need of restoration. ### U.S. Rep.

07.08.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today announced the selection of Heather Hahn of Wilkesboro and William Dinkins of Winston-Salem as the recipients of her ninth annual “Teacher in Congress” internship. Hahn and Dinkins will arrive in Washington on July 10 for a week of intensive learning, curriculum development activities and hands-on experience in America’s federal government. “This program will provide Heather and Bill with a tangible way to give students a look inside the federal government,” said Foxx. “Their week in Washington will equip them to teach in new ways about our roles in a democratic society and hopefully inspire the next generation of North Carolina public servants with a vibrant civics education.” Hahn teaches Civics and Economics as well as American History at Wilkes Central High School. She previously taught at Mooresville Senior High School in Mooresville and Southwest Guilford High School in High Point. She is a graduate of Appalachian State University. Dinkins has taught at Mount Tabor High School since 1999 and currently teaches Civics and Economics. He is a graduate of Florida State University and earned a master’s degree from Appalachian State University. The “Teacher in Congress” internship was created to offer educators a glimpse of the workings of Congress and the federal government while experiencing the day-to-day life of a member of Congress. By supplying teachers with hands-on opportunities, the internship will help local schools enhance their civics and history curriculum. ### U.S. Rep.

07.08.2015	WASHINGTON –Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation to improve K-12 education by replacing No Child Left Behind with new policies to help every child access a high-quality education. The House passed H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, by a vote of 218 to 213. The Student Success Act, which reforms and reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, is a long-term solution that would prevent future federal overreach into elementary and secondary education, support effective teaching in the classroom, provide parents a stronger voice in education and restore local control. “As a grandmother, educator and former school board member, I know students are best served when those at the local level are the driving force behind improving education. North Carolina teachers, parents and administrators – not Washington bureaucrats – should be in charge of making education decisions in our state,” said Foxx. “Currently states are forced to choose between the fundamentally flawed policies of No Child Left Behind, which doubled down on federal programs, mandates and spending, and the Obama administration’s controversial temporary, conditional waiver scheme, which has imposed the administration’s preferred policies and heightened the level of uncertainty shared by states and school districts. America’s students deserve better.” The Student Success Act would: • Replace the current national accountability scheme based on high stakes tests with state-led accountability systems; • Ensure parents continue to have the information they need to hold local schools accountable; • Eliminate more than 65 ineffective, duplicative and unnecessary programs and consolidate funding into a Local Academic Flexible Grant; • Protect state and local autonomy over decisions in the classroom by preventing the Secretary of Education from coercing states into adopting Common Core or any other common standards or assessments as well as reining in the secretary’s regulatory authority; • Strengthen existing efforts to improve student performance among targeted student populations, including English learners and homeless children; and • Empower parents with more school choice options by continuing support for magnet schools and expanding charter school opportunities as well as allowing federal funds to follow low-income children to the traditional public or charter school of the parent’s choice. “The Student Success Act empowers the people closest to students with the authority to make education choices in their respective states and communities. State and local governments can identify student needs and determine priorities better than the federal government,” said Foxx. “Local control always delivers programs and services more efficiently and effectively. By scaling back Washington’s one-size-fits-all micromanagement of classrooms, this legislation takes positive steps toward ensuring local educators have the flexibility required to meet the diverse needs of their students.” ### U.S. Rep.

06.26.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision to redefine the definition of marriage: “Two years ago the Supreme Court insisted that marriage was a policy decision that properly belonged to the states, but today they have imposed a redefinition of marriage nationwide. This decision undermines the ability of states to set public policy within their borders as voters in North Carolina overwhelmingly did in 2012. I’m also extremely concerned about the threat this ruling poses to the conscience rights of people and organizations who believe that marriage is the union of one man and one woman. I will do everything in my power to defend these rights and protect the sacred institution of marriage.” The Supreme Court found in favor of the plaintiffs in Obergefell v. Hodges who argued that states are required to license a marriage between two people of the same sex under the 14th Amendment and recognize those marriages performed out-of-state. ### U.S. Rep.

06.25.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding the Supreme Court’s decision that the federal government can subsidize health insurance policies purchased on Obamacare’s federal exchange: “For the past two years, my email inbox, mailbox and phone lines have been flooded with reports of cancelled health insurance plans, soaring premiums, increased deductibles and frustrated constituents trying to navigate the confusing Washington bureaucracy that is Obamacare. Despite its central promise, the Affordable Care Act has proved to be anything but affordable for many North Carolinians, and today’s Supreme Court decision doesn’t change that fact. Rather than making piecemeal fixes, the best approach to solving the multitude of problems resulting from Obamacare is to unite behind a complete repeal of the law and replace it with solutions that lower costs and empower patients to choose the care that’s right for them.” The Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs in King v. Burwell who argued that only residents of states that set up their own exchanges are entitled to government subsidies to help them pay for their insurance. North Carolina is one of 34 states that did not set up its own insurance exchange and instead relies on the federal marketplace. ### U.S. Rep.

06.25.2015	WASHINGTON - House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following joint statement in response to today’s announcement from the Department of Education regarding its controversial college rating system: "The department’s decision to abandon an arbitrary college rating system is a win for students and taxpayers. This unprecedented scheme would have ultimately discouraged innovation, reduced access for disadvantaged individuals, and used limited taxpayer dollars to reward institutions that put the department’s priorities before students. As they shop for the right school, students and families need basic information that is easily accessible and that can provide a fair comparison of all institutions of higher learning. We will continue to promote reforms that empower students and families to make informed decisions about the education options available to them as Congress works to strengthen America’s higher education system. We urge the department to be a constructive partner in that effort." NOTE: As part of an ongoing effort to strengthen America’s higher education system, the House of Representatives passed last year the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act (H.R. 4983). The bill, introduced by Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) and Rep. Luke Messer (R-IN), would improve consumer information to provide a more complete picture of all student populations, streamline existing transparency efforts at the federal level to reduce confusion for students, and require better coordination by federal agencies to avoid duplication and misinformation. Although the bill advanced in the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, no action was taken on the legislation in the Senate. ###
06.24.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of bipartisan legislation designed to help keep electricity prices affordable for families and businesses. “The EPA is out of touch with the energy needs of Americans, and its unelected bureaucrats too often make decisions without consideration for how those choices will affect people's daily lives. The ‘Clean Power Plan’ rule is yet another example of the EPA’s regulatory overreach,” said Foxx. “The Ratepayer Protection Act puts electric generation back in the hands of states. Instead of overregulating energy production, we need to focus on advancing policies that allow us to utilize our innovative culture to develop new sources of energy and create jobs here at home.” In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, referred to by the agency as the “Clean Power Plan.” In the rule, EPA interprets a rarely invoked provision of the Clean Air Act, section 111(d), to allow the agency to set mandatory carbon dioxide “goals” for each state’s electricity system. State governors, regulators and other stakeholders have submitted extensive comments raising concerns about the rule. H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act, would allow for timely judicial review of the “Clean Power Plan” standards before states would be required to comply with the rule as well as ensure a state would not be forced to implement a plan that would have a significant adverse effect on its ratepayers. It passed the House by a vote of 247-180. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

06.18.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of trade promotion authority, or TPA, legislation, which would impose congressional accountability to the president’s trade negotiation efforts through enhanced oversight and additional transparency. “There have been many mischaracterizations of what TPA is. The allegation that TPA is something for President Obama is false. Every day I hear from constituents who want me to hold the president accountable. TPA does just that by holding President Obama accountable on trade and is consistent with my ongoing efforts to limit the damage he has done to this nation. TPA requires the president to follow congressional negotiating directives and provides transparency for any negotiating texts and, of course, final agreements that Congress considers,” said Foxx. “It is also important to recognize more than 95 percent of the world’s customers live beyond U.S. borders, and 1.2 million jobs in North Carolina rely on trade. While I heard many different perspectives on TPA from my constituents, the argument from North Carolina families, farmers and employers that negotiating these trade agreements is in the economic best interest of our state was the deciding factor for my vote in favor of TPA today.” Before it expired in 2007, TPA had applied to every president since 1974. The legislation would hold trade negotiators accountable to 150 congressional priorities, including protections for Israel, human rights and intellectual property; rules for agricultural trade; and measures to combat currency manipulation. It also includes strict transparency requirements that would allow the American people to have the opportunity to review the full text of any agreements negotiated under TPA and fully understand an agreement’s economic impact before a vote in Congress on its approval. TPA passed the House by a vote of 218-208. In North Carolina, trade-related employment grew 3.8 times faster than total state employment from 2004 to 2013. The state exported $29.2 billion in goods and $17.2 billion in services in 2013. The United States currently enjoys a nearly $55 billion manufacturing trade surplus with its 20 existing free trade agreement partners. ### U.S. Rep.

06.18.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would permanently repeal Obamacare’s 2.3 percent excise tax on medical devices. “When the Democrat-controlled Congress rammed the so-called Affordable Care Act through this chamber, I joined my Republican colleagues in expressing our grave concerns over the effects of the law’s tax increases. Specifically, we warned that the excise tax on medical devices would hinder innovation as well as restrict growth and job creation in an industry that has improved the quality of life of millions around the world,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “And just as we cautioned, this tax on devices that restore mobility, keep hearts in rhythm and help doctors diagnose life-threatening diseases earlier than ever before has cost us local jobs and reduced research capabilities. This tax must be repealed and its harmful effects undone.” During her remarks, Foxx cited the example of Cook Medical, which employs 600 people in Winston-Salem, N.C., where the company focuses on endoscopy medicine. Since the medical device tax was levied in 2013, Cook Medical has paid roughly $13 million annually, which amounts to an increase of more than a 30 percent in their taxes. As a result of the tax, the company was forced to pull back on plans to expand operations in the United States, including those located in Winston-Salem. H.R. 160, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, passed the House by a vote of 280-140. ### U.S. Rep.

06.11.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would fund a number of important resources for America’s military personnel and their families. “Providing for the common defense of the United States of America is the federal government’s primary duty,” said Foxx. “This bill maintains the nation’s defense readiness and gives our men and women in uniform the resources they need to carry out their missions.” H.R. 2685, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, would provide $578.6 billion in discretionary funding for the nation’s military and defense initiatives, including $88.4 billion for overseas contingency operations. It provides a 2.3 percent pay raise for service members, which is above President Obama’s request of 1.3 percent. The legislation passed the House by a vote of 278- 149. During a speech on the House floor, Foxx criticized Senate Democrats, who have threatened to block consideration of any appropriations bill until Republicans meet their demands for increased government spending. “In a time of grave threats to our nation, we must be vigilant, determined and united in full support of our military personnel,” said Foxx. “Holding hostage funding for our troops, their families and the nation’s veterans in order to extract more taxpayer dollars for Washington bureaucracies is the worst kind of political gamesmanship.” ### U.S. Rep.

05.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today announced that seven students from the 5th District have been appointed to the nation’s service academies. Foxx nominated the students last fall after a rigorous application and interview process. “North Carolina’s 5th District has a proud tradition of military service. Each year it is an honor to nominate some of the area’s finest young men and women to attend America’s prestigious military academies and contribute to this legacy,” said Foxx. “These appointments are a testament to their hard work, discipline and strong desire to serve our country.” Each member of Congress may nominate qualified young people to the nation's service academies. Those nominees who are accepted into the academies are awarded full four-year scholarships that include tuition, books, room and board, medical and dental care. Foxx will host a reception for the students and their families on Friday, June 5, at 4:30 p.m. at her district office, which is located at 3540 Clemmons Road, Suite 125, Clemmons, NC 27012.

However, the uncertainty surrounding the credit’s annual extension has ultimately restricted the amount of research and development that companies undertake,” said Foxx “This legislation gives businesses the certainty they need to make long-term investment decisions and keeps North Carolina employers competitive in the global marketplace.” H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015, passed the House by a vote of 274-145. ### U.S. Rep.

05.15.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which authorizes funding for America’s military and defense initiatives.

Additionally it authorizes $89.2 billion for overseas contingency operations. During debate, Foxx supported an amendment by Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., that removed language from the bill encouraging the Secretary of Defense to waive enlistment requirements for illegal aliens. “The National Defense Authorization Act is not the place for a debate on immigration,” said Foxx. “It’s unfortunate that Democrats used the committee mark-up to advance a partisan issue on what should be bipartisan legislation supporting our troops.” ### U.S. Rep.

05.13.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation that would prohibit elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which is the point at which scientific evidence has shown that an unborn child can feel pain. “The science is clear. Unborn children at 20 weeks of development are individuals capable of experiencing great pain,” said Foxx. “Today the House showed it will not sit idly by while the innocent and voiceless are subjected to this grotesque and brutal procedure.” H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, also would ensure that elective abortions performed after 20 weeks are done with a doctor present to provide care and transport the child to a hospital in the event he or she is born alive. “We go to extraordinary lengths in this country to save the lives of our fellow human beings because we value life so much. However, there are many who do not hold the unborn in the same esteem and that is tragic,” continued Foxx. “Every life matters. It is my hope that a culture of life will take hold and all children will be protected in law in the near future.” The legislation passed the House by a vote of 242-184. ### U.S. Rep.

05.13.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation to reform the nation’s intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) while preserving tools critical to safeguarding America. “Congress should be vigilant in ensuring that the government doesn't infringe upon the constitutional rights of individual Americans, and I believe this legislation renews a focus on the civil liberties of our citizens while providing appropriate, narrow authorities to meet the country’s national security needs,” said Foxx. H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act, would protect civil liberties by ending bulk data collection and specifically prohibiting large-scale, indiscriminate collection of data such as all records from an entire state, city or zip code. It also improves transparency by making significant FISA interpretations available to the public and requiring the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence to disclose how they use these national security authorities. Additionally the legislation would strengthen national security by closing a loophole in current law that requires the government to stop tracking foreign terrorists when they enter the United States, increasing the statutory maximum prison sentence to 20 years for providing material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization and enhancing investigations of international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The House passed H.R. 2048 by a vote of 338-88. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

05.12.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would require the Obama administration to withdraw its flawed “Waters of the United States” rule, which would negatively impact North Carolina farmers and landowners. “Federal agencies frequently place burdensome regulations on the American public, and the ‘Waters of the United States’ rule is no exception,” said Foxx. “This common sense legislation prevents an out-of-touch administration from threatening the livelihood of North Carolina’s farmers and saddling local governments with exorbitant compliance costs.” In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that would significantly broaden the federal government’s power to regulate waters and adjacent lands under the Clean Water Act. The rule would have given the federal government jurisdiction over puddles, roadside ditches, irrigation ditches and storm and wastewater systems. H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, would require the agencies to start over and develop a new rule in consultation with state and local governments and other stakeholders. In developing the new rule, the agencies would be required to preserve the rights and responsibilities of the states to protect water quality and to develop land and water resources as well as protect the rights of private property owners over natural and manmade water features. The House passed H.R. 1732 by a vote of 261-155. ### U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

04.23.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of bipartisan legislation that would help prevent future cyberattacks by making it easier for private entities to share cybersecurity information. “In 2013 there were 46,605 cyber breaches in the federal government, and it’s estimated that $445 billion is lost annually to cybercrime across the world economy,” said Foxx. “This legislation improves the government’s ability to protect the nation against cyber threats before they damage our infrastructure or economy while also ensuring the privacy and civil liberties of American citizens are protected.” H.R. 1560, the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, which passed the House on Wednesday by a vote of 307-116, would encourage private companies to voluntarily share information with each other and with the government on cyber threats. H.R. 1731, the National Cybersecurity Protection Advancement Act, which passed the House on Thursday by a vote of 355-63, would strengthen the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center’s role as the lead civilian interface for the sharing of cybersecurity risks and incidents. Both pieces of legislation prohibit the federal government from forcing private sector companies to give information to the government. They also require companies to remove all personal information before sharing as well as require federal government agencies to perform a second check to remove personal information. ### U.S. Rep.

04.15.2015	WASHINGTON – As Americans face the annual deadline to file their tax returns, Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of several pieces of legislation designed to protect hardworking taxpayers and rein in IRS abuse. “Taxpayers shudder at the mere mention of the IRS, and that image hasn’t been helped since the federal government’s most feared agency admitted to singling out conservative groups for unprecedented invasive scrutiny,” said Foxx. “As Americans, we expect our government to preserve, protect and defend our rights - not target them for political gain and control. The legislation we passed today will help ensure that all taxpayers are treated fairly and hold IRS employees accountable for their actions.” The bills that passed the House include: • H.R. 709, the Prevent Targeting at the IRS Act, which would authorize the IRS to terminate employees who engage in political targeting; • H.R. 1026, the Taxpayer Knowledge of IRS Investigations Act, which would provide taxpayers with the status of investigations pertaining to their personal information; • H.R. 1058, the Taxpayer Bill of Rights Act of 2015, which would codify a strong set of basic rights for taxpayers, including the right to quality service, the right to confidentiality and the right to appeal and have their challenge be heard; • H.R. 1104, the Fair Treatment for All Gifts Act, which would ensure that all donations to nonprofit organizations are tax-free; • H.R. 1152, the IRS Email Transparency Act, which would prevent IRS employees from using of personal e-mail for official business; • H.R. 1295, the IRS Bureaucracy Reduction and Judicial Review Act, which would allow organizations to declare their tax-exempt status rather than wait for bureaucratic approval; • H.R. 1314, the Ensuring Tax Exempt Organizations the Right to Appeal Act, would allow nonprofit organizations seeking tax-exempt status to directly petition the IRS and get a fair hearing if their application is turned down; • H.R. 1562, the Contracting and Tax Accountability Act of 2015, which would prohibit the award of contracts or grants to corporations or individuals that have seriously delinquent federal tax debt; and The House is also expected to pass H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, which would permanently repeal the death tax so that families who have lost loved ones are not faced with an enormous financial burden in the event of a death, on Thursday. “While it represents only a tiny fraction of federal revenue, the death tax can be devastating for a family,” said Foxx. “I look forward to voting to repeal this unreasonable and unfair burden on thousands of American families, small businesses and family farms.” Foxx also called for comprehensive tax reform that ensures fairer distribution of the income tax burden. Foxx is a co-sponsor of H.R. 25, the FairTax Act of 2015. “Between mountains of paperwork, complicated codes and the fear of fines, paying taxes every year is a huge burden for hardworking Americans,” said Foxx during a speech on the House floor. “It is past time to simplify the tax code and decrease the tax burden that Americans currently spend close to a third of the year bearing.” ### U.S. Rep.

03.25.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of the House Republican pro-growth balanced budget proposal, which passed the House by a vote of 228-199. “In my family, balancing our budget isn’t just a priority, it’s a requirement. We must view America’s budget the same way. Washington owes the American people a responsible budget that reins in federal spending and guarantees accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars,” said Foxx. “Despite $2.1 trillion in new tax increases, President Obama's budget never balances. House Republicans have approved a budget that not only places our country on a path to pay off the overwhelming mound of debt we face, but will also spur economic growth and increase opportunity.” The Balanced Budget for a Stronger America balances the budget within less than 10 years with no new taxes and cuts $5.5 trillion in unnecessary spending. The proposal also provides a framework for repealing Obamacare in full and calls on Congress to pass comprehensive tax reform that lowers rates for individuals, families and businesses. House Republicans have cut wasteful discretionary spending by $165 billion since FY 2010 and have implemented overall spending cuts to save taxpayers more than $2 trillion over the next 10 years since taking the majority four years ago. ### U.S. Rep.

03.20.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced legislation to stretch the limited funds available to the Highway Trust Fund by exempting it from the Davis-Bacon Act’s outdated, wasteful labor requirements for federal-aid highway and public transportation projects. “With Highway Trust Fund deficits expected to hit $157 billion by 2024, it makes sense to exempt the fund from Davis-Bacon’s expensive and overly burdensome wage requirements,” said Foxx. “Big Labor should not continue to use this Depression-era legislation as a shield to line its own pockets at the expense of non-union workers and taxpayers.” The Davis-Bacon Act, which became law in 1931, requires federal contractors and subcontractors to pay the local prevailing wage for construction projects on which the federal government is a party. For decades, it has been driving up the cost of federal highway projects by mandating artificially high wages. According to a 2011 Joint Economic Committee report, Davis-Bacon-determined wages tended to inflate labor costs an average of 22 percent above market rates. Researchers at Suffolk University also found in a 2008 study that Davis-Bacon requirements cost U.S. taxpayers an additional $8.6 billion annually and add 9.9 percent to construction costs. Beyond increasing construction costs for taxpayers, Davis-Bacon requirements force businesses working on federal highway projects to comply with burdensome paperwork and reporting regulations. Reports from the Government Accountability Office suggest that these Davis-Bacon requirements inflate costs and slow project completion. By removing the Davis-Bacon’s implications from federal-aid highway and public transportation projects, H.R. 1483, the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act, would free up funds to create more market-priced construction jobs and more affordable, timely completed projects. ### U.S. Rep.

03.19.2015	WASHINGTON - Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of a disapproval resolution seeking to stop the National Labor Relations Board from overturning decades of precedent and dramatically altering long-standing policies governing union elections. The measure passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 232-186. “Yet again the National Labor Relations Board is using the federal regulatory process to tip the scales toward union organizers,” said Foxx. “The ‘ambush election’ rule is just the latest in a series of outrageous actions seeking to jeopardize the relationship between workers and employers and upend a carefully crafted process for organizing elections that has existed for decades. This rule constrains the rights of workers to make informed decisions, severely hampers employers’ rights to speak to their employees during union organizing campaigns and weakens the privacy rights of workers.” NLRB released the so-called “ambush election” rule in December 2014 and it is scheduled to take effect on April 14. The rule would require employers to provide union organizers with employees' names, phone numbers, emails and mailing addresses without any mechanism for workers to opt-out, which Foxx believes is a clear violation of their privacy. Additionally the rule would shorten the time between when a petition is filed and the day workers vote as well as postpone decisions about who is eligible to participate. As a result, union representation elections could be held within only 11 days without providing any certainty over who should be participating or giving employers sufficient time to prepare. Under the rule, employers would have only eight days to find experienced legal representation before facing a hearing and would be required to file an in-depth “Statement of Position” within seven days of receiving a petition for election. Many companies, particularly small businesses, do not have in-house counsel and would not be prepared to respond within the short timeframe. Important review procedures would be set aside by this rule as well, including the opportunity for review of decisions made prior to the election by the NLRB. The board’s requirement for review of post-election disputes would be made discretionary, limiting oversight. The Congressional Review Act of 1996 established a process through which Congress can overturn regulations issued by federal agencies by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval. The Senate passed the disapproval resolution on March 4 by a vote of 53-46. A disapproval resolution must be signed by the president before it could go into effect. ### U.S. Rep.

03.13.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., has introduced bipartisan legislation to reduce federal intrusion and limit the costly regulatory burden on colleges and universities. H.R. 970, the Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act, would eliminate unnecessary federal regulations that restrict choice and opportunity in higher education, including the gainful employment regulation, the state authorization regulation and the federal credit hour regulation. “Unnecessary regulations are stifling pioneering institutions at a time when forward-thinking solutions are desperately needed. The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act would remove the threat that these regulations pose to student choice, innovative schools and an American economy that stands to benefit from responsive higher learning institutions,” said Foxx, who serves as chair of the House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education. “Republicans and Democrats should toss these bad ideas aside and work together to strengthen higher education for students and taxpayers while maintaining the flexibility and choice that set American colleges and universities apart.” H.R. 970 would: • repeal the gainful employment regulation, which would levy arbitrary burdens on community and proprietary colleges and deny vulnerable students access to postsecondary education; • repeal the state authorization regulation, which forces states to follow federal requirements when deciding whether to grant an institution permission to operate within the state; • repeal the credit hour regulation, which establishes a federal definition of a credit hour and increases the government’s control over institutions’ academic affairs; • prohibit the U.S. Department of Education from promulgating teacher preparation regulations that tie institutional eligibility for TEACH grants to tenuous accountability systems; • prohibit the U.S. Department of Education from developing a postsecondary institution ratings system (PIRS), which would deny students access to the college or university of their choice due to an arbitrary rating system that grades institutions with a one-size-fits-all approach; and • clarify the incentive compensation policies to ensure third-party service providers are allowed to enter into tuition sharing agreements with nonprofit colleges and universities. Co-sponsors include Reps. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., French Hill, R-Ark., Mike Kelly, R-Pa., John Kline, R-Minn., Daniel Lipinski, D-Ill., Todd Rokita, R-Ind., and Matt Salmon, R-Ariz. ### U.S. Rep.

03.03.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress: “Prime Minister Netanyahu is absolutely right - the world cannot tolerate a nuclear Iranian regime. The Obama administration is signaling it will support temporarily restricting, not eliminating, Iran’s potential to produce nuclear weapons, but I believe it is critical that we act to ensure Iran does not obtain nuclear capabilities. Any deal reached by the State Department and Iran regarding their nuclear program needs to include Congressional involvement. “As a strong supporter of Israel, I am concerned about the instability and the animosity that subsists toward one of our strongest allies. Though there may be widespread ignorance in the international community about the conflict between Israel and those who seek its destruction, the simple truth is that throughout history Israel has made numerous concessions in the pursuit of peace while seeking only the right to exist and defend itself from all threats. A strong Israel is paramount in the region and not giving it our backing would be supporting terrorists. Support for Israel includes support for its duly elected political leadership, and I considered it my responsibility as an elected representative to attend a speech by the leadership of one of our closest allies.” ### U.S. Rep.

03.03.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted against a long-term funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security. The House passed the legislation by a vote of 257 to 167. “Unfortunately, this legislation does nothing to prevent President Obama’s unlawful plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens through executive actions, which undermine our system of checks and balances. While House Republicans made good-faith efforts to resolve the situation, Senate Democrats and the president refused to contribute to finding a solution,” said Foxx. “Now, the fight against the president’s blatant overreach of his Constitutionally-granted executive authority will be litigated in the courts. I will continue to work tirelessly to hold the president accountable for his utter disregard of the law and the will of the American people.” On Jan. 14, the House passed legislation to fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015 that included amendments specifically designed to stop President Obama’s executive amnesty. However, Senate Democrats, many of whom have publicly opposed the president’s actions on immigration, stood in the way of a vote on the House-passed bill and instead voted to strip the House amendments from the legislation and allow President Obama to act unilaterally on immigration. In order to allow formal discussions with the Senate to commence and to continue funding the national security functions of the Department of Homeland Security, the House voted last week to temporarily extend funding for the department for one week. On Monday Senate Democrats blocked a measure that would have begun negotiations between both chambers. In December, Foxx signed on to an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit by 26 states, including North Carolina, which sought an injunction against President Obama’s unilateral executive actions on immigration. That injunction was granted on Feb. 16 by a U.S. District Court Judge in Texas. ### U.S. Rep.

02.25.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would strengthen and improve the investment tool known as a 529 plan, which helps families save for their child’s college education. H.R. 529 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 401 to 20. “Paying for college is hard work, and it’s getting more difficult as tuition and fees continue to increase at rapid rates. With student loan debt surpassing credit card debt, we need to do everything we can to encourage American families to save for college and invest in their child’s future,” said Foxx. “The bipartisan legislation we passed today does that by expanding, strengthening and improving 529 plans.” Since 2001, students have been able to withdraw earnings from 529 investment plans tax-free if the funds are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses. In January President Obama proposed taxing those withdrawals and treating the earnings as student income, which would hurt a child’s chances of receiving financial aid. After numerous objections from Republicans and Democrats, the White House announced the president would drop the plan. The legislation would permit the re-deposit of refunds from colleges into 529 plans without taxes or penalties as long as the re-deposit occurs within 60 days of the student withdrawing from the college. It also would eliminate a paperwork burden for 529 plan administrators by removing distribution aggregation requirements, which have been unnecessary since the tax treatment of the plans changed in 2001. Finally the bill would identify computers as a qualified expense. ### U.S. Rep.

02.17.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., is encouraging high school students in North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District to submit entries for the 2015 Congressional Art Competition, which is a nationwide high school visual art competition to recognize talented young artists and promote the valuable role meaningful art plays in our society. “Every year our country’s top young artists have the chance to display their work in the United States Capitol where it will be seen by visitors from around the world,” said Foxx. “North Carolina’s artists are among the best in the nation, and I always look forward to seeing the strong talent of our local young people.” The following are guidelines for the competition: • Only high school students residing in the 5th Congressional District may compete. Students may be enrolled at public, private or home schools. • Each submission must be accompanied by a completed Congressional Art Competition release form, which is available on Foxx’s website. • All artwork must be original and may not violate any U.S. copyright laws. • All artwork must be two-dimensional. • Artwork must be framed by the artist at the time of submission. When framed, the piece can be no larger than 28 inches high, 28 inches wide and 4 inches deep. • Acceptable mediums include: paintings, drawings, collages, prints, mixed media, computer-generated art and photographs. • The deadline for submissions to Foxx’s office is Friday, April 17, at 5 p.m. • Entries should be submitted to Foxx’s Clemmons office at 3540 Clemmons Road, Suite 125, Clemmons, NC 27012. As in years past, Foxx is inviting the online community to decide this year’s winner.

02.12.2015	WASHINGTON – Last night Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., voted in favor of legislation to improve K-12 education by replacing No Child Left Behind with new policies to help every child access a high-quality education. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce passed H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, by a vote of 21 to 16. The Student Success Act, which reforms and reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, is a long-term solution that would prevent future federal overreach into elementary and secondary education, promote effective teachers in the classroom, provide parents a stronger voice in education and restore local control. “As a grandmother, educator and former school board member, I know students are best served when those at the local level are the driving force behind improving education. North Carolina teachers, parents and administrators – not Washington bureaucrats – should be in charge of making education decisions in our state,” said Foxx. “The Student Success Act empowers the people closest to students with the authority to make education choices in their respective states and communities. State and local governments can identify student needs and determine priorities better than the federal government. Local control always delivers programs and services more efficiently and effectively. By scaling back Washington’s one-size-fits-all micromanagement of classrooms, this legislation takes positive steps toward ensuring local educators have the flexibility required to meet the diverse needs of their students.” The Student Success Act would: • Replace the current national accountability scheme based on high stakes tests with state-led accountability systems; • Ensure parents continue to have the information they need to hold local schools accountable; • Eliminate more than 65 ineffective, duplicative and unnecessary programs and consolidate the funding into a Local Academic Flexible Grant; • Protect state and local autonomy over decisions in the classroom by preventing the Secretary of Education from coercing states into adopting Common Core or any other common standards or assessments as well as reining in the secretary’s regulatory authority; • Strengthen existing efforts to improve student performance among targeted student populations, including English learners and homeless children; and • Empower parents with more school choice options by continuing support for magnet schools and expanding charter school opportunities as well as allowing federal funds to follow low-income children to the traditional public or charter school of the parent’s choice. ### U.S. Rep.

02.12.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would provide incentives for charitable giving by making permanent tax deductions for the donation of food, land for conservation and IRA contributions as well as simplifying the tax rate for private foundations. “Americans are a giving people whose compassion for others is well known, whether we’re supporting our friends and neighbors when times are tough or responding in generosity during moments of great need,” said Foxx. “The legislation we passed today provides important tax relief to encourage that philanthropic spirit.” H.R. 644, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 279 to 137, would restore an enhanced deduction for businesses that donate food inventory to charities as well as renew the ability to make tax-free distributions from individual retirement accounts to qualifying charities. Additionally the legislation would revive an enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of real property made for conservation purposes and reduce to 1 percent the investment income excise tax rate for private foundations. According to the National Philanthropic Trust, over 95 percent of American households give to charities. In 2013, Americans gave $335.17 billion. ### U.S. Rep.

02.11.2015	WASHINGTON – Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and David Jolly, R-Fla., have introduced legislation to stop the intrusion of political robocalls in homes across America. The Robo Calls Off Phones Act, or Robo COP Act, would expand the types of unsolicited calls restricted by the national Do Not Call Registry to include political robocalls, giving the American people the opportunity to opt-out of the bothersome campaign season interruption. “Every campaign season, like clockwork, families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robocalls,” said Foxx, who does not use political robocalling. “Though citizens are able to stop receiving telemarketing calls, politicians made sure to exempt political robocalls from the power of the Do Not Call Registry. Removing that exemption through the Robo COP Act is a matter of fairness.” “Political speech is a fundamental right but not beyond the reach of reasonable regulation. Elected officials should not be placed above others, which is why they should be included on the Do Not Call registry,” said Jolly. “Bottom line, many consider the bombardment of political robocalls to be an invasion of privacy and this legislation protects that privacy.” The Robo COP Act would direct the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do Not Call registry to prohibit pre-recorded campaign messages from being sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. The legislation applies strictly to unsolicited, political robocalls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. ### U.S. Rep.

02.11.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. S. 1 passed the House by a vote of 270 to 152 and now goes to President Obama who has threatened to veto the bill. “For more than six years, supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline have been fighting to secure the necessary approval that would allow the U.S. to take advantage of vital oil production in Canada and the northern United States,” said Foxx. “It is the most studied pipeline in our nation’s history, and thousands of pages prove its worth to our economy and national interest and further document its safety. It will spur job creation, help us on our way to energy security and increase access to affordable North American oil.” This is the 11th time that the House has passed legislation to authorize building the pipeline. “The president claims he just wants to let the State Department review process conclude and was waiting for the resolution of a lawsuit challenging the pipeline’s route through Nebraska. Well the State Department has already determined that the Keystone project would have a minimal impact on the environment, and Nebraska’s Supreme Court has tossed that lawsuit and upheld Keystone’s proposed path,” said Foxx. “It is my hope that the strong bipartisan support for the project encourages President Obama to change his mind and finally act in America’s energy interests.” ### U.S. Rep.

By classifying the attack as workplace violence instead of terrorism, the Army has denied victims the honors they deserve for far too long. Last fall Congress, with my support, expanded the eligibility criteria for the Purple Heart by broadening what can be considered an attack by a foreign terrorist organization, and I’m pleased the Army finally recognized that the Fort Hood shooting meets the criteria for the award.” ### U.S. Rep.

02.04.2015	WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives today passed bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., that would shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, H.R. 50, passed the House by a vote of 250 to 173. Foxx has introduced this legislation in the past four Congresses, and it has previously passed the House with bipartisan support on three separate occasions. “Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of the rules they create. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act is simply about making government work better for the American people by requiring openness and honesty from Washington,” said Foxx. “Transparency and accountability are not partisan issues. It’s my hope that the bipartisan manner in which this legislation passed the House will pave the way for swift consideration and passage in the Senate.” H.R. 50 would increase transparency about the costs imposed by unfunded mandates and would hold the federal government accountable for considering those costs before passing them on to local governments and small businesses. The legislation would expand the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. Current loopholes within UMRA allow certain regulatory bodies to escape public reporting requirements and incentivize others to forego publicizing regulatory proposals. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act would correct this. Specifically, H.R. 50 would: • Impose stricter and more clearly defined requirements for how and when federal agencies must disclose the cost of federal mandates; • Ensure those who will be affected have the opportunity to weigh in on proposed mandates; • Equip Congress and the public with tools to better determine the true cost of regulations; and • Provide an accountability mechanism to ensure the federal government and its independent regulatory agencies adhere to the provisions set forth by H.R. 50 and its predecessor, UMRA. The legislation also would require the federal government to report how legislative changes to existing federal grant programs might shift costs to state, local and tribal governments. For instance, grant programs which are administered by states can be altered by federal legislation. Under H.R. 50 the federal government would be statutorily required to report how such changes would impact state or local government budgets.

02.02.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding President Obama’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2016: “One of the concerns I often hear from folks in North Carolina is that the federal government spends too much. Many worry that our ballooning national debt threatens economic stability and jeopardizes the American dream for their families. “President Obama’s budget proposal disregards those concerns and delays dealing with them, ignoring our crushing debt burden. His budget is more of the same ineffective policies we’ve seen in the past: more taxes, more spending and more debt. These are outdated, Washington-centered ideas that don’t work. “Washington owes the American people a responsible budget that reins in federal spending, not more one-size-fits-all federal dictates. That is why I am committed to passing a budget that cuts spending, balances the budget, reforms our complicated tax code to be fairer and simpler without raising taxes and removes many of the unnecessary onerous federal regulations that tie the hands of employers.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised the passage of 12 bills designed to fight the growing problem of human trafficking in the United States. “Human trafficking is modern day slavery that preys on vulnerable individuals, and this epidemic is not isolated to far-off places on the other side of the world. It is happening every day in the places we call home,” said Foxx. “These bipartisan bills will provide necessary support and services to the victims of trafficking crimes as well as boost resources for law enforcement.” According to the FBI, sex trafficking is the fastest-growing business of organized crime and the third-largest criminal enterprise in the world. More than 300,000 American children are at risk of becoming victims of sex trafficking annually, and it’s estimated that child sex trafficking in the United States is a $9.8 billion industry. The bills that passed the House include: H.R. 159, Stop Exploitation Through Trafficking Act; H.R. 181, Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act; H.R. 246, To improve the response to victims of child sex trafficking; H.R. 285, Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act; H.R. 350, Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act; H.R. 357, Human Trafficking Prevention Act; H.R. 398, Trafficking Awareness Training for Health Care Act; H.R. 460, Human Trafficking Detection Act; H.R. 468, Enhancing Services for Runaway and Homeless Victims for Youth Trafficking Act; H.R. 469, Strengthening Child Welfare Response to Trafficking Act; H.R. 514, Human Trafficking Prioritization Act; and H.R. 515, International Megan’s Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking. ### U.S. Rep.

01.27.2015	WASHINGTON – Bipartisan regulatory transparency legislation sponsored by Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., today advanced from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, H.R. 50, would shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers by fixing loopholes within the bipartisan regulatory reform act known as UMRA. Foxx has introduced this legislation in the past four Congresses, and it has successfully passed the House with bipartisan support on three separate occasions. “Transparency and accountability are not partisan issues. This legislation is purely about making government work better for the American people by requiring openness and honesty from Washington about the true cost of regulations, whether those costs come in dollars or in lost jobs,” said Foxx. “It is my hope the bipartisan support with which this legislation was introduced will pave the way for its swift passage from the House of Representatives.” “This bill increases transparency in the regulatory process and protects state and local governments from the burden of unfunded and often unnecessary mandates that waste time and money,” said Sanchez.

01.26.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today spoke out in opposition to President Obama’s plan to raise taxes on popular college savings accounts. “Paying for college is hard work, and it’s getting more difficult as tuition and fees continue to increase at rapid rates,” said Foxx on the House floor. “Luckily American families have an investment tool known as a 529 plan to help them save for their child’s college education.” Since 2001, students have been able to withdraw earnings from 529 investment plans tax-free if the funds are used to pay for qualified higher education expenses. Last week President Obama proposed taxing those withdrawals and treating the earnings as student income, which would hurt a child’s chances of receiving financial aid. “With student loan debt surpassing credit card debt, it is incredibly irresponsible of the president to take away this valuable tool that millions of American families use to save for college,” Foxx said. “House Republicans will fight this attempt to raise taxes on hardworking American families. We want to encourage, not discourage, families from investing in their child’s future.” Watch Foxx’s floor speech at http://youtu.be/MZpO2JRGF3U. ### U.S. Rep.

01.22.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would permanently prohibit the use of federal funds to pay for abortion or abortion coverage. H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, passed the House by a vote of 242 to 179. It would codify the Hyde amendment, which has been regularly attached to annual appropriations bills for nearly 40 years to prevent federal funding of abortion with limited exceptions. “This common-sense measure restores a longstanding agreement that protects the unborn and prevents taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of elective abortions,” said Foxx. “It reflects the will of the American people and is the product of what has historically been a bipartisan, bicameral consensus in Congress.” Foxx continued, “Since 1973, at least 52 million children’s lives have been tragically taken by abortion in the United States. It is unconscionable that in America where we fight for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, we tolerate the systematic extermination of an entire generation of the most vulnerable among us. One day I hope it will be different. I hope life will cease to be valued on a sliding scale. I hope the era of elective abortions, ushered in by an unelected court, will be closed and collectively deemed one of the darkest chapters in American history. But until that day, it remains a solemn duty to stand up for life. Regardless of the length of this journey, I will continue to speak for those who cannot.” H.R. 7 also would prohibit federal medical facilities and health professionals from providing abortion services. Additionally it would prohibit individuals and small businesses from receiving federal subsidies and tax credits under Obamacare to purchase health care plans that cover abortions. ### U.S. Rep.

01.20.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., tonight issued the following response regarding President Obama's State of the Union address: “The American people spoke loud and clear in November, but it’s evident from tonight’s State of the Union that President Obama wasn’t listening. Despite a rejection of his policies at the ballot box, the president continues to propose outdated, Washington-centered ideas that simply don’t work. “The nation’s tax code is in desperate need of reform, but I wholeheartedly reject the notion that higher taxes for the employers and workers who drive our economy is the solution. Hardworking Americans pay enough in taxes, and they deserve better than failed class warfare gimmicks. “Making higher education affordable and attainable for America’s students must be a priority, but President Obama’s $60 billion proposal to provide free community college tuition is the wrong approach for the federal government to take. Rather than yet another top-down federal government boondoggle, we need to focus on new ways to promote innovation, access and completion, which starts with the states and individual institutions that are best suited to tailor solutions to their local needs. “The American people want Washington to stop interfering in their lives, and they don’t need more one-size-fits-all federal dictates. Republicans have a vision for the future, but President Obama appears to be mired in the past. “Tonight the president expressed a willingness to work with Republicans, and I hope that gesture is sincere. In the past, working together too often meant agreeing with whatever the president said. It’s time for President Obama to live up to his rhetoric. House Republicans are eager to work together to increase opportunities for all Americans and empower people, not Washington.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.14.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation that would defund President Obama’s executive actions on immigration in their entirety. H.R. 240, which would fund the Department of Homeland Security for the remainder of fiscal year 2015, passed the House by a vote of 236 to 191. “Breaking the law to enter the United States should not be rewarded, but that’s exactly what President Obama did when he announced plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens through executive actions,” said Foxx. “This legislation will put a stop to the president’s unlawful, unilateral actions, which are a blatant overreach of his Constitutionally-granted executive authority. It is the responsibility of Congress to pursue reforms and ensure a strong immigration policy, and we should begin by securing our borders.” Prior to passage of the bill, the House approved five amendments specifically designed to stop President Obama’s executive overreach on immigration. As a result, the legislation would prevent any funds, whether they are appropriated funds or user fees collected by the agency, to implement the president’s executive amnesty that was announced on Nov. 20, 2014, bar the use of funds to continue the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, and ensure that convicted sex offenders and domestic violence perpetrators are priorities for removal by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The legislation also expresses the sense of Congress that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services should stop putting the interests of unlawful immigrants ahead of legal immigrants as well as expresses the sense of Congress that the administration should not pursue policies that disadvantage the hiring of U.S. citizens and those lawfully present in the United States by making it economically advantageous to hire workers who came to the country illegally, such as granting deferred action and work authorization to illegal immigrants. Additionally the legislation would provide funds to enhance border security, provides for stringent oversight, increases transparency within the Department of Homeland Security and bolsters immigration and customs enforcement. ### U.S. Rep.

01.13.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of legislation designed to reduce excessive regulatory costs by overhauling the federal rulemaking process. H.R. 185, the Regulatory Accountability Act of 2015, passed the House by a vote of 250 to 175. “Having owned a small business, I know from personal experience that overly burdensome rules and regulations handed down from bureaucrats in Washington can wreak havoc on both employers and employees,” said Foxx. “While Congress cannot create prosperity, we can work to ensure entrepreneurs and employers aren’t crushed under red tape. This legislation will help ensure that the federal government properly investigates and examines the effects that new rules and regulations pose to the American economy.” By modernizing the rulemaking process as defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, the legislation would improve how rules are promulgated by requiring agencies to estimate the cost of proposed regulations and consider new criteria, including lower-cost alternatives. It also would subject rules that are deemed "major" or "high impact" to additional criteria and procedural steps. The bill defines a "major" rule as any federal rule or regulatory proposal that is likely to impose an average annual cost of $100 million or more, adjusted annually for inflation, or that is likely to result in major increases in consumer prices or adverse effects on employment, investment, productivity or the ability of U.S. companies to compete with foreign-based enterprises. It defines a "high impact" rule as any rule or regulatory proposal that is likely to impose an annual cost of $1 billion or more, adjusted annually for inflation. Additionally the legislation would require an advanced-notice comment period to determine whether the rule-making process should proceed for rules that are deemed "major" or "high impact" as well as provide new opportunities for interested parties and the public to challenge agency justifications and findings. ### U.S. Rep.

01.12.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of bipartisan legislation to prevent veteran suicide and ensure individuals who may be struggling have access to necessary mental health care services and support. H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, passed the House unanimously. “Our veterans fight battles on foreign soil to protect us here at home. Those who make it back should never have to worry that they might face a bureaucracy more lethal than enemy fire. This legislation will help ensure that American veterans have access to the mental health care services they need and deserve,” said Foxx. “The entire nation owes our military personnel and veterans a huge debt of gratitude, and ensuring that debt is properly repaid is one of my top priorities in Congress.” H.R. 203 would increase access to mental health care by amending the requirements for reviewing potentially improper discharge characterizations of individuals diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder or traumatic brain injury. It would also require the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a centralized website containing information regarding all mental health services for veterans. Under the legislation, a third party would conduct an annual evaluation of all mental health care and suicide prevention practices and programs at the Department of Defense and VA and make recommendations to improve care. Additionally it would establish a strategic relationship between the VA and the National Guard to facilitate a greater continuity of care. Finally, the bill would establish a peer support and community outreach pilot program to assist transitioning service members with accessing VA mental health care services. ### U.S. Rep.

01.09.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. H.R. 3 passed the House by a vote of 266-153-1. “For more than six years, supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline have been fighting to secure the necessary Congressional approval that would allow the U.S. to take advantage of vital oil production in Canada and the northern United States,” said Foxx. “It is the most studied pipeline in our nation’s history, and thousands of pages prove its worth to our economy and national interest and further document its safety. It will spur job creation, help us on our way to energy independence and increase access to affordable North American oil.” This is the 10th time that the House has passed legislation to authorize building the pipeline. The Senate is scheduled to consider legislation to approve the pipeline next week. However, President Obama has threatened to veto the legislation. “The president claims he just wants to let the State Department review process, which has already concluded that the Keystone project would have a minimal impact on the environment, conclude, but I believe he is more interested in pleasing special interest groups than creating American jobs,” said Foxx. “It is my hope that the strong bipartisan support for the project encourages President Obama to change his mind and finally act in America’s energy interests.” ### U.S. Rep.

01.09.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today released the following statement regarding President Obama’s proposal to publicly fund community college for all Americans: “As a former community college president, I am a huge fan of community colleges and the great educational opportunities they provide to students from all walks of life. However, I’m reminded of the old Peanuts cartoon where Linus says to Lucy, ‘Every time there’s a good suggestion, someone brings up the budget.’ President Obama has a bad habit of creating programs without identifying a way to pay for them, and the price tag for this initiative, which is bound to be incredibly expensive, has yet to even be revealed. Increasing the number of students who have access to higher education must be a priority, but this is the wrong approach for the federal government to take.” Foxx, who serves as chair of the House Education and the Workforce Subcommittee on Higher Education, is a former president of Mayland Community College. ### U.S. Rep.

01.08.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation to change Obamacare’s 30-hour definition of “full-time employment” and restore the traditional 40-hour workweek. “From adjunct professors to hourly workers, I have heard from constituents across North Carolina’s 5th District who have one thing in common - their hours are being reduced,” said Foxx. “Obamacare has placed an undue burden on employers and their employees by undermining the 40-hour work week, which has long been the standard for full-time work. This legislation will help protect the estimated 2.6 million Americans at-risk for lost hours and wages at work under this destructive rule.” The employer mandate in Obamacare defines a full-time employee as someone who works an average of at least 30 hours a week. H.R. 30, the Save American Workers Act, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 252 to 172. ### U.S. Rep.

01.06.2015	WASHINGTON – Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., today introduced legislation to shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, H.R. 50, would fix loopholes within the bipartisan regulatory reform act known as UMRA. Foxx has introduced this legislation in the past four Congresses, and it has successfully passed the House with bipartisan support on three separate occasions. “Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch state and city budgets and make it harder for North Carolina businesses to hire,” said Foxx. “While Congress cannot create prosperity, we can work to ensure entrepreneurs and employers aren’t crushed under costly regulations. This legislation will help restore transparency and hold Washington bureaucrats accountable for the true cost — in dollars and in jobs — that federal dictates pose to the economy. Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of rules they create.” “This bill increases transparency in the regulatory process and protects state and local governments from the burden of unfunded and often unnecessary mandates that waste time and money,” said Sanchez. H.R. 50 would increase transparency about the costs imposed by unfunded mandates and would hold the federal government accountable for considering those costs before passing them on to local governments and small businesses. The legislation would expand the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. Current loopholes within UMRA allow certain regulatory bodies to escape public reporting requirements and incentivize others to forego publicizing regulatory proposals. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act would correct this. Specifically, H.R. 50 would: Impose stricter and more clearly defined requirements for how and when federal agencies must disclose the cost of federal mandates; Ensure those who will be affected have the opportunity to weigh in on proposed mandates; Equip Congress and the public with tools to better determine the true cost of regulations; and Provide an accountability mechanism to ensure the federal government and its independent regulatory agencies adhere to the provisions set forth by H.R. 50 and its predecessor, UMRA. The legislation also would require the federal government to report how legislative changes to existing federal grant programs might shift costs to state, local and tribal governments. For instance, grant programs which are administered by states can be altered by federal legislation. Under H.R. 50 the federal government would be statutorily required to report how such changes would impact state or local government budgets.

01.06.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today was sworn in to her sixth term as the representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District. In taking the oath of office, Foxx swore to “support and defend” the Constitution of the United States. “Serving the people of North Carolina is a profound honor, and I am grateful for the opportunity to represent the 5th District in Congress,” Foxx said. ​“The 114th Congress offers new chances to pass legislation that will take our country down a road of economic recovery that results in lower unemployment, a fair tax code and opportunity for all. It’s time to build a better future for American families.” Foxx also voted for Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, to serve a third term as Speaker of the House. “Today’s vote for Speaker ratifies the decision made on November 13 when House Republicans elected their leadership team for the 114th Congress,” said Foxx. “John Boehner came to Congress over 20 years ago as a reformer, and he has remained one ever since. He understands the need to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, protect against executive overreach, reform spending and keep America strong. I fully support him as Speaker.” Download a high-resolution photo of Foxx’s swearing-in with Speaker Boehner by clicking here. ### U.S. Rep.

01.02.2015	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today announced that Col. Vickie Hughes of Boone will serve on her Service Academy Nomination Board. “Each year I have the honor of nominating outstanding students from across northwest North Carolina to attend our nation’s excellent military academies,” said Foxx. “It’s a privilege to have someone with such a distinguished record of service as Col. Hughes helping me to identify the military’s future leaders.” Foxx annually nominates students from the 5th Congressional District to America’s service academies, which include the Air Force Academy, Naval Academy, Military Academy, Merchant Marine Academy and Coast Guard Academy. Nominations are required for all but the Coast Guard Academy, to which appointments are made on the basis of an annual nationwide competition. Foxx’s Service Academy Nomination Board evaluates applicants for service academy nominations and makes recommendations to her based on applicant experience and merit. Each fall Foxx hosts a Service Academy Day to help familiarize students with the application and nomination process for applying to the nation's five military service academies. Hughes retired from the Air Force after 27 years of service with demonstrated leadership in educational instruction, clinical services, administrative supervision, management and program development. During her military career, she served as the commander of the Air Force’s largest medical school as well as director of operations for the Commissioned Officer Training School. She was commissioned as a second lieutenant in July 1987. Hughes is a licensed Advanced Practice Nurse Practitioner who is board certified by the American Nurses Association as a Clinical Nurse Specialist, Adult Psychiatric and Mental Health Nursing. She received a Doctorate of Nursing Science from Louisiana State University Health Science Center in 1999, a master’s degree in nursing from the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 1994, a master’s degree in counseling and human development from Troy State University in 1989 and a bachelor’s degree in nursing from the Medical University of South Carolina in 1986.

12.11.2014	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today issued the following statement regarding passage of the bipartisan “omnibus” spending bill to appropriate funds for the federal government: “While an omnibus spending bill is not ideal, it allows changes to policy that a continuing resolution simply cannot. For example, this legislation includes provisions to help meet the goal of ending the disability claims backlog at the Department of Veterans Affairs by the end of 2015. It also prevents the Army Corps of Engineers from regulating farm ponds and irrigation ditches under the Clean Water Act. “Additionally this bill will allow Congress to focus immediately on addressing the pressing issues facing our nation, including stopping President Obama from implementing his executive amnesty, when we return in January with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. “The appropriations process is an important tool for holding the vast federal bureaucracy accountable to Congress, and it’s my sincere hope that next year the Senate will return to regular order, including hearings, oversight and the elimination of wasteful spending on ineffective programs, as the House has been doing for the past four years.” H.R. 83, Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 219 to 206. The bill abides by the 2013 bipartisan budget agreement, and overall discretionary spending has been reduced by $165 billion since FY 2010 as a result. The House passed seven appropriations bills this year. The Democratic-led Senate passed no appropriations bills. ### U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015, which authorizes funding for America’s military and defense initiatives. It passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 300 to 119. “Providing for the common defense of the United States of America is the federal government’s primary responsibility,” said Foxx. “This bill maintains the nation’s defense readiness and ensures the continued success of our military men and woman by providing them with the best equipment, skills development and compensation.” Congress has passed the National Defense Authorization Act during each of the last 52 years. This year’s bill authorizes $521.3 billion in discretionary spending for national defense, which includes funding for the pay and benefits of the nation’s troops and their families. Additionally it authorizes $63.7 billion for overseas contingency operations. ### U.S. Rep.

12.03.2014	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today voted in favor of bipartisan legislation that would allow families of a severely disabled child to save for their child's long-term disability expenses in the same way that many families currently save for college through popular 529 investment plans. H.R. 647, also known as the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act or ABLE Act, overwhelmingly passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 404 to 17. “Individuals with disabilities often face enormous financial struggles. The ABLE Act will positively impact millions of American families with a severely disabled child and help provide those families with peace of mind about the future,” said Foxx. “By allowing disabled individuals to save money without jeopardizing their benefits, the ABLE Act also encourages personal responsibility instead of increasing dependency on the government.” ABLE accounts would be a savings vehicle for disability-related expenses that would supplement, but not supplant, benefits provided through private insurances, the Medicaid program, the supplemental security income program, the beneficiary's employment and other sources. 529A accounts would be administered by participating states in a manner similar to 529 college savings accounts. Families would have a choice of investment options, and the range of investment options available would be determined by each state. Accounts would be available only to individuals diagnosed with a disability before age 26, and qualified beneficiaries could have only one ABLE account. ### U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today issued the following statement following President Obama’s announcement that he will take executive action to grant amnesty to millions of immigrants illegally in the United States: “President Obama does not have the legal authority to legislate, and his unilateral actions on immigration are a blatant overreach of his Constitutionally-granted executive authority. The president claims to believe in the Constitution, but his actions tonight demonstrate otherwise. “The president himself has even acknowledged that this is not how our democracy functions. Just last year he told Univision that he believed ‘it is very important for us to recognize that the way to solve this problem has to be legislative.’ “America’s immigration system is broken. It’s not working for families, employers or taxpayers. However, it is Congress’ responsibility to pursue reforms and build consensus toward a strong immigration policy that begins with border security. “Immigration reform must be approached carefully and with ample public input. There is too much at stake to do anything else.” ### U.S. Rep.

11.14.2014	WASHINGTON – Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today praised passage of legislation to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. H.R. 5682 passed the House by a bipartisan vote of 252 to 161. “For more than six years, supporters of the Keystone XL pipeline have been fighting to secure the necessary approval that would allow the U.S. to take advantage of vital oil production in Canada and the northern United States,” said Foxx. “Republicans and Democrats have coalesced in support of the pipeline, recognizing it will spur job creation, help us on our way to energy independence and increase access to affordable North American oil.” This is the ninth time that the House has passed legislation to authorize building the pipeline. The Senate is scheduled to consider legislation to approve the pipeline on the Senate floor next week for the first time. “Keystone XL is the most studied pipeline in our nation’s history. Thousands of pages prove its worth to our economy and national interest and further document its safety. There is no good reason to continue this delay,” said Foxx. “It is my hope that the strong bipartisan support for the project will encourage President Obama to finally act in America’s energy interests.” ### U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., today presented brothers Ben and William Casstevens of Winston-Salem with Congressional Award Medals for their commitment to bettering themselves and giving back to the communities in which they live. The Congressional Award is the United States Congress’ award for young Americans who set personally challenging goals and achieve them. It is non-partisan, voluntary and non-competitive. The program is open to all 14- to 23-year-olds. There are six levels of the award. Participants can earn Bronze, Silver and Gold Congressional Award Certificates and Bronze, Silver and Gold Congressional Award Medals. Each level involves setting goals in four program areas: volunteer public service, personal development, physical fitness and expedition/exploration. Along the way participants serve their communities and learn qualities such as responsibility, citizenship and the ability to plan and organize. Ben Casstevens, who attends R.J. Reynolds High School, earned the Silver Congressional Medal by volunteering more than 200 hours delivering Meals on Wheels, packing weekend and holiday meals for students, serving food to the homeless and coaching baseball. William Casstevens, who attends R.J. Reynolds High School, earned the Bronze Congressional Medal by volunteering nearly 150 hours with a local public elementary school and his church’s outreach ministry. As a school volunteer, he aided teachers’ efforts, organized a box top collection program and managed events during Teacher Appreciation Week. Through his volunteer work at his church, William ensured local homeless and impoverished citizens had a hot meal.

10.10.2014	WASHINGTON – Rep.

As House Republicans continue our tireless pursuit of accountability, the President should immediately abandon any ill-conceived plans to bring dangerous terrorists to the American homeland.” ### U.S. Rep.

09.19.2014	Washington D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx introduced H.R. 5672, no-cost, bipartisan legislation to correct a technical limitation preventing the rollover of tax-deferred retirement funds into existing SIMPLE IRA accounts. Representative Foxx released the following statement after introducing the legislation: “This legislation will simplify Americans’ retirement planning and ensure a complex tax code does not prevent sensible financial planning decisions. Individuals should be able to consolidate their retirement funds in a way that best meets their needs. This legislation is a small but important first step on the long road to ensuring our tax system works for Americans, not against them.” In 1996, federal legislation established a new type of employer sponsored retirement plan, SIMPLE IRAs. These plans were designed to give small employers a straightforward retirement plan option for employees without the administrative burdens of other employer-sponsored retirement plan types. SIMPLE IRAs have served employers and employees very well in the years since. Despite the benefits of consolidating retirement funds in certain circumstances, current law prohibits rolling funds over into SIMPLE IRAs from other retirement accounts, due to the fact that SIMPLE IRAs face a 25% early withdrawal penalty during the first two years of their existence (versus 10% for other IRAs). Lawmakers rightly wanted to prevent account holders from unknowingly rolling their IRA funds into SIMPLE IRAs and being surprised by an increased early withdrawal penalty. After that initial two year period, however, SIMPLE IRAs have the same early withdrawal penalty as other IRAs.. Consumers and financial planners have struggled with the rollover restrictions as they attempt to consolidate accounts, so H.R. 5672 would allow for rollovers into SIMPLE IRA accounts that have met the two-year threshold. The Joint Committee on Taxation had previously estimated this legislation would have a “negligible effect” on federal tax revenues. This legislation is supported by the National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors (NAIFA). # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s Fifth Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

09.18.2014	Washington D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted in favor of H.R. 4, the Jobs for America Act, which passed on a 253 to 163 bipartisan vote. Rep Foxx spoke on the House floor in support of the measure: “Each year Washington imposes thousands of pages of rules and regulations on America’s private sector employers as well as state and local governments. Buried in those pages are costly federal mandates that make it harder for businesses to hire and cash-strapped states, counties, and cities to serve their citizens. There are some who may not understand why a bill to improve the regulatory process is also a bill about jobs. As a former small business owner, I understand first-hand the concerns job creators have about how lengthy, confusing rules affect their ability to conduct business and provide jobs and opportunities to their employees. “That is why I introduced H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, which we call UMITA, and am glad to see it included in H.R. 4, the Jobs for America Act. “This bill shines much needed light on the murky regulatory process and ensures the public has transparent access to proposed rules and regulations.” The Jobs for America Act is a compilation of fifteen bills that would make various changes to federal law in order to improve the conditions necessary for economic growth and job creation. Today, the House also passed H.R. 2, the American Energy Solutions for Lower Costs & More American Jobs Act, which includes thirteen bills to lower energy costs and create American jobs. H.R. 2, which cleared the House on a 226 to 191 vote, would increase domestic production, expand our energy infrastructure, promote new technologies, improve our energy security, and reduce prices for American families. All of the legislation that makes up these bills previously passed the House, most with bipartisan support, but are awaiting Senate action. # # # Video of the full speech can be found here: http://youtu.be/X78o8QpMUyE # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s Fifth Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

09.11.2014	Washington D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) made the following remarks after President Obama’s speech about ISIL: “ISIL is a vicious terrorist group that controls significant land and resources, has repeatedly called for the destruction of the United States and has publicly killed two U.S. citizens in the most brutal way imaginable. I am glad that the President has come around to recognizing this threat for what it is, and has outlined the beginnings of a strategy to confront it. “We must be steadfast in defeating this enemy, half measures will not do. The President must remain engaged and must provide leadership for this fight. We have chosen to confront this enemy with force, and we must dedicate the resources necessary to utterly destroy it.” # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s Fifth Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

07.31.2014	Washington, D.C. – This week, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) made the following remarks on the floor of the House during debate about House Resolution 676, which authorizes a lawsuit by House of Representatives against President Obama. “I rise in support of this effort to restore every branch of this government to its proper constitutional bounds. This is not about politics. If there were a Republican President doing the same thing. I would feel just as strongly. This is about the Constitution. “Our Constitution was drafted deliberately to ensure that the greatest power in our government resided closely with the people. That is why the portion dealing with Congress was placed first. In Article I, the framers placed the ultimate power of creating and changing laws with the Congress, and they particularly empowered the House of Representatives: the People’s House. “Every two years, members of this House face the voters, and our actions in this body are judged. No other member of this government must submit to the judgment of the people more regularly. “For too long, this body, under the leadership of both Democrats and Republicans, has ceded parts of our Constitutional authority to the executive branch and to agencies that are, at best, remotely accountable to voters. “It is time for that to stop, and today we take a step to make it stop. This lawsuit is about actions. The actions of an administration that has claimed more power than it has been given, even when we have already given it more authority than we should have. “I bear no animus to this President, but I strongly disagree with many of his policies, his stated priorities and, ultimately, his actions. This lawsuit is not entered into lightly: it is not our first response, but rather, it is our last resort. I will vote yes on this resolution: not for electoral gain, but rather to preserve our Constitution and the separation of powers enshrined therein.” At a recent hearing about this resolution, George Washington University law Professor Jonathan Turley said the following about President Obama’s overreach. “The President’s pledge to effectively govern alone is alarming but what is most alarming is his ability to fulfill that pledge,” said Professor Turley. “When a president can govern alone, he can become a government unto himself, which is precisely the danger that the Framers sought to avoid in the establishment of our tripartite system of government. In perhaps the saddest reflection of our divisive times, many of our citizens and Members are now embracing the very model of a dominant executive that the Framers fought to excise from our country almost 250 years ago.” The resolution passed on a 225-201 vote. # # # Video of the remarks can be found here: http://youtu.be/dEZSKQ2MR5I # # #
07.30.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after the House of Representatives agreed to final passage of H.R. 3230, the Veterans’ Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014: “It is critically important that we provide high-quality, timely care for those who have sacrificed so much in service to our country,” said Rep. Foxx. “There is more that must be done to reform the Veterans Administration, but this legislation is a good start.” The conference report represents the agreement worked out between differing Veterans Administration (VA) reform packages passed by the House and Senate. The final agreement provides $5 billion in mandatory funding for hiring new health care providers and $10 billion for a three year program to allow veterans to seek care from private providers if they live too far from a VA facility or cannot otherwise get an appointment within 14 days. The legislation gives the VA Secretary the authority to fire senior executives for poor performance and requires a top to bottom study of the entire department be completed within one year of enactment. The conference report passed the House on a 420-5 vote, the bill is expected to clear the Senate this week and be signed into law by the President. # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s Fifth Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

07.24.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after the House of Representatives passed the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act: “Students and families must wade through massive and often conflicting amounts of information in order to make informed college decisions,” said Rep. Foxx. “The Higher Education Act (HEA) alone requires 26 different categories of information be available, and there are many additional state and federal requirements. Our bill will streamline the overwhelming maze of information with a consumer-tested College Dashboard. The College Dashboard will provide students with key information: enrollment, completion, net price, and average loan debt and Bureau of Labor Statistics wage data.” “With college costs steadily rising, prospective students need to make informed decisions about their future; the Strengthening Transparency in Higher Education Act will help them to do just that.” The legislation passed the House Committee on Education and the Workforce with bipartisan support and then cleared the House by voice vote, and now goes before the Senate for consideration. # # # Video of Rep.

07.22.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C.—Today, President Obama signed into law H.R. 803, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA), legislation authored by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx providing for a long overdue reform of the Workforce Investment Act. WIOA represents a compromise between Congresswoman Foxx’s SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) and S. 1356, the Workforce Investment Act of 2013. “President Obama’s signing of the bipartisan Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act demonstrates the good that can be done when we legislate the old fashioned way, using negotiation and compromise,” said Representative Virginia Foxx. “This law will help millions of American jobseekers get the skills needed to improve their employment prospects and improve their quality of life. Our economy will benefit from a 21st century workforce capable of filling the millions of jobs that currently go unfilled due to the skills gap.” WIOA was approved by a vote of 415 to 6 in the House of Representatives; it passed the Senate on a 95-3 vote. WIOA streamlines and improves existing federal workforce development programs and fosters a modern workforce that American businesses can rely on to compete. The bill was supported by a broad array of business, and workforce development leaders, as well as governors and mayors from throughout the country. # # # Video of Rep.

07.18.2014	Washington, D.C. – R.J. Reynolds High School teacher Michael T. McCulloch has completed Congresswoman Virginia Foxx’s week-long Teacher in Congress Internship. Congresswoman Foxx hopes the experience will help him encourage each of his students to become active participants in their government. In remarks delivered on the House floor, Congresswoman Foxx spoke highly of Mr. McCulloch: “I commend Mr. McCulloch for his commitment to teaching the next generation about the revolutionary ideas on which our nation was founded,” said Rep. Foxx.” It’s been a pleasure to get to know him, and I hope this week proves fruitful for him and his students.” While in Washington, Mr. McCulloch discussed education policy, conducted research at the Library of Congress and the National Archives, observed legislative debate on the House floor with Congresswoman Foxx, attended House Rules Committee hearings and toured the United States Capitol with an official historian “Legends, facts, and stories can all be used to grab the attention of students just before giving them the facts they need to learn,” said Mr. McCulloch. Mr. McCulloch teaches International Relations and observed public diplomacy in action at the Capitol: “I was able to observe delegates and citizens from other countries throughout the week from countries like Angola and Vietnam. I saw how they were greeted, treated with tours, and given information, etc. This will only help goodwill between nations and give the USA credence as a country wanting to try and get along with most other cultures and people.” Foxx’s annual Teacher in Congress Internship is unique in Washington. Since 2007, the program has invited one Fifth Congressional District high school teacher to travel to Washington, D.C. for a week of intensive learning and curriculum development activities during their summer school break. Mr. McCulloch enjoyed spending time one on one with his Representative in Congress: “I really enjoyed having breakfast with Congresswoman Foxx in the Members Dining Hall,” said Mr. McCulloch. “She is a very humble politician and a true server of her community in the Fifth District of North Carolina.” Mr. McCulloch has been teaching high school social studies, economics and history for 19 years. He plans to integrate his experiences at the United States Capitol into his International Relations and U.S. History lesson plans this coming year. # # # Video of Rep.

07.09.2014	WASHINGTON, D.C.—Legislation to update the Workforce Investment Act, overdue for reauthorization for more than a decade, is headed to the President’s desk following overwhelming bipartisan support from both houses of Congress. H.R. 803 the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) represents a compromise between Congresswoman Foxx’s SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), which passed the House of Representatives in March of 2013 with bipartisan support, and the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356), which passed the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee with a bipartisan vote of 18-3 in July of 2013. The Senate and House authors of WIOA applauded the passage of the bill, which seeks to update and improve the nation’s workforce development system. The legislation was approved today by a vote of 415 to 6 by the House of Representatives; it was approved by the Senate last month by a vote of 95-3 and will be signed into law by President Obama. “Today’s vote is the culmination of a long process of legislating the old fashioned way: discussion, negotiation and compromise. There is longstanding, bipartisan agreement that the current workforce development system is broken, and this bill turns that consensus into action,” said Representative Virginia Foxx. “The bipartisan, bicameral process through which the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act was developed serves as an example of what we can accomplish when we work together. This legislation is important for the millions of Americans who are looking for work and for the employers who have 4.6 million job opportunities that remain unfilled due to the skills gap. Closing this gap will specifically improve the lives of many American job seekers, while generally helping our economy grow. I urge the President to sign this legislation without delay.” WIOA modernizes and improves existing federal workforce development programs, helps workers attain skills for 21st century jobs, provides support to people with disabilities to enter and remain in competitive, integrated job settings, and fosters the modern workforce that evolving American businesses rely on to compete. In addition to winning strong bipartisan support in both chambers, the bill is supported by a broad array of labor, business, and workforce development leaders, as well as disability advocates, governors and mayors from around the country. “Today is a good day for the American people. We’ve shown what’s possible when we work together toward a common goal and right now there is no greater goal than putting Americans back to work,” said Representative John Kline, Chairman of the House Education and Workforce Committee. “This bipartisan, bicameral agreement will fix a broken job training system, help workers fill in-demand jobs, and protect taxpayers. I am proud to have helped lead this effort and want to thank my Republican and Democrat colleagues in the House and Senate for their hard work. Let’s build off today’s achievement and continue working together on behalf of the American people.” “The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act modernizes our workforce development system to ensure that all our workers can prepare for and fill 21st century jobs, including individuals with disabilities. It also makes groundbreaking changes that will raise prospects and expectations for Americans with disabilities so that they receive the skills and training necessary to succeed in competitive, integrated employment,” said Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. “Access to education, training, and employment services is critical to helping our workers secure good jobs, gain access to the middle class, and become economically self-sufficient, and this bill is part of the solution to the challenges facing our middle class. This bill represents the best of what Congress can accomplish when we work together and I urge President Obama to sign it into law as soon as possible.” "Last year the federal government spent more than $145 million in Tennessee through a maze of programs trying to help Tennesseans find jobs, and this legislation simplifies that maze. This bill will help our nation’s workers gain the skills to find jobs and give governors and local workforce boards the freedom and flexibility to make job training meet their local needs,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, Ranking Member of the Senate HELP Committee. “The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will update and improve our workforce training programs by aligning them with real-world labor market needs. This legislation will better connect job training programs with the needs of local employers, helping workers to learn the most in-demand skills and to be prepared for the jobs of tomorrow,” said Representative George Miller, senior Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee. “I want to commend all my colleagues, and particularly Reps. Tierney and Hinojosa, for their commitment to and leadership on strengthening our nation’s workforce development system. For forty years, we have reauthorized these programs through bipartisan collaboration, and I am happy to see that tradition continue.” “After receiving overwhelming, bipartisan support in the Senate, today’s vote in the House goes to show that both chambers of Congress are still capable of breaking through the gridlock and investing in American workers and the economy,” said Senator Patty Murray. “I’ve seen firsthand that federal workforce programs can change lives, boost our economy, and get people back to work, but we can’t expect to adequately train Americans for jobs at Boeing or Microsoft with programs designed in the 1990s. Today, we can definitively say that both chambers of Congress agree, and I’m thrilled that this long overdue legislation is now headed for the President’s desk to become law.” “Workforce training is critically important to help grow the American economy still recovering from recession and bridge the widening skills gap separating thousands of unemployed workers from promising careers in 21st century workplaces,” said Senator Johnny Isakson. “The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act will provide millions of Americans the opportunity to receive the training and skills necessary to find a job and keep a job. I am extremely pleased that my colleagues in the House acted today to pass this bipartisan measure with overwhelming support, and I urge the president to swiftly sign this bill into law so we can continue making critical investments in American workers to meet the modern demands of businesses in a global environment.” “I am pleased to see the bipartisan support as well as the overwhelming support from business groups, labor unions, state and local elected officials, community colleges, workforce boards, adult education providers, youth organizations, and civil rights groups for this bill,” said Representative Rubén Hinojosa. “In my district in South Texas we have seen how these programs are successful in training our workforce and getting our residents back into good paying jobs. Importantly, this bill includes several key provisions from ‘The Adult Education and Economic Growth Act,’ which I introduced. In the area of adult education, this bill integrates adult education and workplace skills, authorizes the integrated English Literacy and Civics education program for Adult learners, and expands access to postsecondary education.” # # # Video of Rep.

As usual, President Obama is using gasoline when a fire extinguisher would be more appropriate. “House Republicans agree that the situation along our country’s southern border needs to be addressed, but any “solution” that does not begin with securing our borders and enforcing current law is no solution at all. The American people do not trust the President and his Administration to enforce any new laws when our current laws are not being enforced. “The constituents of the Fifth District are very concerned about this issue, and I agree that our current immigration system is insufficient.

06.20.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today voted in support of the Fiscal Year 2015 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, which passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support on a 340 to 73 vote. “Defending our country is the first responsibility of the federal government. This legislation complies with the House budget, provides a raise for our troops and will maintain our defense readiness. It’s my hope that the Senate will move quickly on their own defense appropriations bill so that we can iron out our differences and ensure that we pass this vital bill in a timely fashion under the regular rules.” The House FY 2015 DOD Appropriations bill provides $491 billion in discretionary funding. The bill provides for a 1.8% pay increase for service members (above the President’s request of 1%) and funds military operations for the fiscal year beginning in October. The legislation also prohibits funding to be used in contravention of Sec. 1035 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which deals with Congressional notification of the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

06.10.2014	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after the House of Representatives passed the Veterans Access to Care Act of 2014: “We need to continue to pursue reforms to ensure that every veteran has access to quality care. This bill will give veterans whose needs are not being met in a timely manner the option of getting care outside of the VA system. This bill is far too important to be allowed to languish on Harry Reid’s desk. The Senate should build upon the bipartisan unanimity with which the bill passed the House, quickly consider this legislation and get it to the President this week.” The Veterans Administration recently released the results of national audit of its medical facilities. The audit showed that 57,000 veterans have waited more than 90 days for care and that 64,000 were attempting to get care but had not been added to the wait list. The Veterans Access to Care Act would require VA to provide authorization to any enrolled veteran who elects to go to a non-VA facility if they reside more than forty miles from a VA medical facility or have waited longer than the wait time goals for a medical appointment. The bill cleared the House on a 426-0 vote # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

05.22.2014	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted in favor of HR 4435 the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed the House of Representatives on a 325-98 vote. “Providing for the common defense is one of our most important Constitutional duties,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “I support the NDAA because it supports the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines that make up our armed forces and keep our nation safe. The NDAA provides for a robust defense, includes a raise for our servicemen and prohibits administration-proposed Tricare cost increases for military families, all while abiding by the budget caps established in the Bipartisan Budget Act. These are just a few of the reasons why I support the bill.” The National Defense Authorization Act previously passed the House Armed Services Committee with unanimous support. The NDAA has been passed in each of the last 52 years. This year’s bill authorizes $592.9 billion for discretionary defense programs in fiscal year 2015. That amount includes $79.4 billion in spending for Afghanistan and the war on terror. # # # Yesterday, Rep. Foxx voted in favor of HR 4031, The Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014, which cleared the House with 390 votes in favor and 33 opposed.

Foxx. “HR 4031 is a good start, but much more must be done to promote accountability and efficiency at all levels of the bureaucracy in this vital agency.” Both bills now await consideration in the Senate. # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

05.21.2014	Current federal workforce laws, written in 1998, have been overdue for reauthorization for more than ten years share: f t (Washington, D.C.) - Today, Rep. Virginia Foxx joined a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers announcing that they have reached a deal to improve the nation’s workforce development system through new legislation, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA). The bill, which will now be considered by both the House and Senate, modernizes and improves existing federal workforce development programs, helps workers attain skills for 21st century jobs, and fosters the modern workforce that evolving American businesses rely on to compete. WIOA represents a compromise between the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), which passed the House of Representatives in March of 2013 with bipartisan support, and the Workforce Investment Act of 2013 (S. 1356), which passed through the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee with a bipartisan vote of 18-3 in July of 2013. A one-page summary of the legislation can be found HERE. The statement of managers, including a section-by-section summary of the legislation, can be found HERE. A summary of key improvements WIOA makes to current workforce development programs can be found HERE. The text of the bipartisan, bicameral agreement can be found HERE. “Access to training, education, and employment services opens doors to the middle class for workers and helps strengthen our economy. This bipartisan, bicameral reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act will help ensure that all workers—including those with disabilities—can access these opportunities. It will provide better coordination and value to our workforce development system,” said Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), who is Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. “This bill also makes groundbreaking changes that will raise prospects and expectations for Americans with disabilities, many of whom, under current law, are shunted to segregated, subminimum wage settings without ever receiving the opportunities and skills to succeed in competitive, integrated employment. It will stem the flow of young people into segregated employment by requiring that they be given experience in integrated settings, and require state Vocational Rehabilitation programs to work with individuals to develop an individual employment plan and support them in integrated work settings. This bill truly represents the spirit of bipartisan compromise and cooperation, and I applaud my colleagues on the HELP Committee and on the Education and the Workforce Committee for their perseverance and commitment to updating this critical law. I urge senators on both sides of the aisle to support this bill when it comes up for a vote.” “We can’t expect a modern workforce to succeed with an outdated job training system. The current workforce development system is broken with too much bureaucracy, too many inefficiencies, and too little accountability,” said Representative John Kline (R-MN), Chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee. “The problems we face have been apparent for a long time and I am pleased we are moving toward adopting comprehensive reform that provides employers, workers, and taxpayers the job training solutions they deserve. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to send this agreement to the president’s desk without delay.” "Last year the federal government spent more than $145 million in Tennessee through a maze of programs trying to help Tennesseans find work,” said Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Ranking Member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. “Our legislation will simplify that maze, give governors and states more flexibility, and make it easier for Tennessee's 13 local workforce investment boards to match job seekers with the skills employers are looking for.” “By revising the original Workforce Investment Act to support access to real-world education in fields that are in demand locally, this legislation will help more workers across the country find a good job or train for a new career. Similar to the legislation proposed by Reps. Tierney and Hinojosa earlier this Congress, this bill also makes job training programs more efficient and effective by requiring that states developed unified plans to streamline and better coordinate these services,” said Representative George Miller (D-CA), senior Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee. “By strengthening the workforce development system, we will increase accountability, promote innovation, and make it easier to track results, while helping put more Americans back to work. I'm proud to have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to develop this proposal and hope to see it signed into law this year.” “Every year, federal workforce investments help millions of Americans get back to work, go back to school, and increase their skills for an economy that’s changing faster than ever, but for too long, we’ve been relying on workforce development programs written in the 1990s,” said Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee . “This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will bring federal worker programs into the 21st Century, give workers and students the resources they need to succeed, and foster a workforce that American businesses rely on to compete. It’s a prime example of what’s possible when Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate work together to write laws that help our economy grow. I want to thank Senator Isakson, who co-authored the Senate reauthorization bill with me, and all of my colleagues, for their hard work and commitment to moving this forward.” “This is a good example of what Congress can achieve when we all come to the table and work towards a compromise that respects the opinions of legislators on both sides of the aisle,” said Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and the Workforce Training. “This bill will eliminate fifteen duplicative programs, help the remaining programs better align worker education with available jobs and improve our ability to gauge how well the system is working as a whole. I want to thank my colleagues in the House for passing the SKILLS Act and my colleagues in the Senate for considering this long overdue re-authorization of the Workforce Investment Act.” “Workforce investment and training is critically important to help grow the American economy still recovering from recession and to bridge the widening skills gap separating thousands of unemployed workers from good-paying jobs,” said Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA), a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee. “I thank Senator Murray and my colleagues for their bipartisan efforts on this legislation, and I look forward to getting this measure passed so we can get Americans back to work and meet the modern demands of businesses employees in a global environment.” “This bipartisan agreement helps American workers get back on track by promoting sector strategies and career pathways that lead to good jobs and postsecondary education in our nation's public workforce training and adult education system.” said Representative Rubén Hinojosa (D-TX), the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and the Workforce Training. “This bill makes certain that the connection between adult education, postsecondary education and the workforce is strengthened. We as a nation must be inclusive in our workforce, and this bill provides better services to workers young and old, with disabilities, and to those populations that have significant barriers to employment. It also addresses the need to improve services for English language learners that will ease their participation into our nation's workforce. I am pleased to see the progress we are making in the Senate and in the House and look forward to having this bill signed into law.” ###
05.07.2014	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted to hold former Internal Revenue Service Exempt Organizations Division Director Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for her refusal to fully cooperate with an ongoing House investigation into improper IRS scrutiny of conservative non-profit groups. “Americans need to be certain that the machinery of government will not be put to partisan ends,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “Lois Lerner led an IRS division that repeatedly and unfairly singled out conservative groups for exhaustive scrutiny, effectively sidelining them for an election cycle. Lerner’s refusal to refusal to cooperate with an investigation into how and why these groups were targeted is unacceptable.” “I voted to hold Ms. Lerner in contempt today because officials who abuse the public trust must be held accountable.” Lois Lerner appeared before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform last year and delivered a 305 word statement attesting to her innocence before refusing to answer questions, invoking her 5 th Amendment right not to incriminate herself in criminal activity. The Congressional investigation into IRS scrutiny of conservative groups is ongoing. Lerner was held in contempt on a bipartisan 231 to 187 vote in the House of Representatives. # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

05.05.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement regarding Speaker John Boehner’s announcement that the House of Representatives will empanel a select committee to investigate the September 11, 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi. “Recently released emails suggest that the White House was intimately involved in the media response to Benghazi. I support Speaker Boehner’s decision to set up a select committee to investigate whether the White House initiated politically-motivated spin about this critical lapse in our diplomatic security,” said Rep. Foxx. “The latest trove of emails makes it absolutely clear that the White House is not cooperating with the House’s oversight efforts, and establishing a select committee is the logical next step.” “We need to put politics aside and focus on getting answers to ensure this never happens again.” Last week, in response to a Freedom of Information Act request, the White House released a series of emails from the days after of the attack. In the emails, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes edited early talking points in an attempt to ensure the attacks were blamed on “[An] Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.” # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

04.30.2014	April 30, 2014 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE REP. VIRGINIA FOXX SUPPORTS VETERANS/MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted in favor of H.R. 4486, the 2015 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill. “The hardest part about military service shouldn’t be coming home. Those who wear our country’s uniform make tremendous sacrifices, and providing the support needed to ensure they successfully re-integrate into civilian life after hanging up the uniform is a key responsibility of the federal government. “In addition to providing funds to improve our bases and critical infrastructure, H.R. 4486 increases resources and provides for additional oversight of the VA claims process. The VA claims backlog is a long-running national scandal that has a daily local impact around the country. I regularly hear from constituents who are waiting for answers from the VA, and this bill will help them get those answers.” HR 4486 passed the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 416 to 1. The bill increases discretionary funding for veterans programs by $1.5 billion, appropriates $158.2 billion in total spending for veterans. # # # Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is currently in her fifth term as the Representative of North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District and is the elected Republican Conference Secretary.

04.10.2014	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted in favor of House Concurrent Resolution 96, the Republican “Path to Prosperity” budget sponsored by Rep. Paul Ryan. Rep. Foxx delivered the following remarks as part of a floor speech in support of the legislation: “The CBO has warned that if we fail to address our lackluster economic growth and rising debt, our children and grandchildren are guaranteed a lower standard of living than what we currently enjoy. For the first time in American history, we may bequeath to our children and grandchildren a less prosperous country with limited opportunities to pursue their American dream. As a mother and a grandmother, I will do all that I can to keep that from happening. “Over the next decade, the U.S. government will spend $5.8 trillion dollars servicing debt. $5 trillion dollars, simply to make interest payments to our creditors! Those dollars could be put to work at home strengthening our military, caring for our veterans, and improving the lives of all Americans – but instead it will go to pay for the inability of those who came before to responsibly manage the nation’s treasury. We need to stop spending money we don’t have.” The legislation passed the House of Representatives on a 219 to 205 vote.

03.25.2014	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after the Supreme Court heard oral arguments about Affordable Care Act birth control coverage mandates. “I hope the Supreme Court sees fit to stand up for religious liberty and stop this assault on business owners who believe their faith does not begin and end at the church door.” “Americans should be free to practice their religion and conduct their business without unnecessary interference from Washington. It’s striking that this Administration, which has shown a willingness to provide extra-legal accommodations from aspects of this law on a wide variety of issues, has refused to accommodate religious business owners who are providing healthcare coverage for their employees. “It’s a testament to the anti-religious animus of this Administration that the fine for providing health insurance that does not cover contraceptives is 18 times larger than the fine for providing no health insurance at all."

02.28.2014	The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act bypasses the usual partisan debates about the size and role of government and simply requires federal agencies to consider the costs of their actions. Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in 1995 because they believed Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of rules they create. UMITA builds on and strengthens share: f t This week, the House passed bipartisan regulatory transparency legislation sponsored by Representatives Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike McIntyre (D-NC), and Collin Peterson (D-MN). The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act (H.R. 899) would strengthen the bipartisan regulatory Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). Representative Virginia Foxx – “The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act bypasses the usual partisan debates about the size and role of government and simply requires federal agencies to consider the costs of their actions. Democrats and Republicans worked together to pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in 1995 because they believed Americans are better served when regulators are required to measure and consider the costs of rules they create. UMITA builds on and strengthens UMRA to ensure jobs and economic growth are not sacrificed due to bureaucratic ignorance and indifference. It’s my hope that the strong bipartisan manner in which UMITA passed the House will pave the way for swift consideration and passage in the Senate.” Representative Loretta Sanchez –“This bill will help protect state and local governments from the burden of unfunded and often unnecessary mandates that waste time and money. Our bill will hold federal agencies accountable by requiring public reporting on these mandates.” Representative James Lankford – “I am proud to join Rep. Foxx in working this important bill through the legislative process and to the House floor for a vote. At several subcommittee hearings in 2011, I examined how excessive federal rules and regulations circumvent existing law to increase the burden on states and business owners that struggle under the ever-growing weight of federal bureaucracy. The federal government must stop flippantly imposing costly regulations on states, cities, counties, tribes and local businesses. This necessary reform will force the federal government to consider the least burdensome and most effective means for any future regulation. The federal government is designed to serve the nation, not abuse its delegated power through overregulation and mandates.” Representative Mike McIntyre – “Unfunded mandates place an unnecessary burden on the free market, our local governments, and the taxpayers at large! It’s a problem that must be addressed and today we take a strong step in the right direction, holding government accountable and providing greater transparency about the costs of unfunded mandates. The passage of this bill is a great victory for the American tax payer!” Representative Collin Peterson – “It’s time to establish a more open and transparent process of federal mandates, providing our constituents with a complete assessment on the impact of government regulations. The Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act modernizes the process and is a first step to the reforms I believe need to be made to the regulatory process.” H.R. 899 expands the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. UMITA will ensure that regulatory agencies know exactly what they are asking the American people to pay, and whether the costs of compliance might make it harder for family businesses to meet payroll and stay afloat. H.R. 899 passed the House today on a bipartisan 234-176 vote.

H.R. 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act (UMITA) will strengthen the bipartisan Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA). “Every year federal agencies impose thousands of regulatory mandates on small businesses and local governments. These mandates are often costly, making it harder for small businesses to get off the ground, for established business to grow, and for city and state governments to deliver services,” said Rep. Foxx. “Federal regulators must be required to consider the costs of every rule they impose on our economy and our local governments. UMITA will force Washington to calculate and consider these regulatory costs before passing them on to Americans. This bill is about transparency and accountability, and is something Democrats and Republicans can all support.” UMITA expands the scope of the UMRA, which was passed to increase awareness of the financial burden federal mandates and rules place on businesses and state and local governments. UMITA requires regulatory agencies calculate and disclose what they are asking the American people to pay, and includes avenues for redress if agencies fail to comply.

01.28.2014	Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) applauded passage of HR 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act. Congresswoman Foxx delivered the following remarks on the floor of the House as the bill was being considered: “Before liberty, equality, free speech, freedom of conscience, the pursuit of happiness and justice for all, there has to be life. And yet, for millions of aborted infants – many pain-capable and many discriminated against because of gender or disability – life is exactly what they have been denied. One day, we hope it will be different. We hope life will cease to be valued on a sliding scale. We hope the era of elective abortions, ushered in by an unelected court, will be closed and collectively deemed one of the darkest chapters in American history. But until that day, it remains a solemn duty to stand up for life. HR 7 is a common-sense measure which restores an important, longstanding, bipartisan agreement protecting the unborn and preventing taxpayers from being forced to finance thousands of elective abortions. It reflects the will of the American people and is the prduct of what has historically been a bipartisan, bicameral consensus in Congress.” HR 7 passed the House today on a bipartisan 227-188 vote.
01.28.2014	Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement in response to the President’s State of the Union speech: “Unfortunately, tonight’s State of the Union fits within a long tradition of speeches that deploy platitudes in support of a long list of policy goals that seem to be forgotten by the White House as soon as they are mentioned. “To give just one example, in his 2012 State of the Union, President Obama said he ‘want(ed) to cut through the maze of confusing programs,’ that make up federal workforce development system. The House passed a bill, the SKILLS Act, which would do just that. The SKILLSAct passed with bipartisan support, and fulfills a Presidential objective, but it is languishing in Harry Reid’s Senate. The House has passed over thirty jobs bills only to have them go unconsidered in the Senate. The legislative process is about focus and effort. It’s my hope the President will use this year to engage with Congress and spur action on these necessary pieces of legislation. “As a final note, I disagree with the President’s contention that what most Americans want is for all of us in Washington to ‘focus on their lives, their hopes, their aspirations.’ Americans want Washington to stop interfering in their lives. Five years of ever-increasing regulations-including a disastrous government takeover of the health care system-have not restored our nation’s economic vitality. The President needs to scale back his agenda, help rein in Washington’s endless appetite for spending and regulation and allow Americans to get back to work.” Congresswoman Foxx represents North Carolina’s 5th District.
01.15.2014	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement after President Obama’s speech in Raleigh. “In today’s speech, President Obama talked about ways to reach the goal of an economy that produces good jobs for all Americans who want to work. I share this goal, and hope the President will follow through on his rhetoric with action. Unemployed Americans want to get back to work, and Republicans in Congress want to help, I introduced the SKILLS Act in order to cut through the current maze of federal workforce development programs and create a more consumer-oriented, responsive system that would help workers develop the skills needed to get one of the 3.6 million jobs that are currently unfilled due to a lack of qualified applicants. This is a reform that President Obama called for two years ago. The House passed the SKILLS Act last year only to have it blocked by Democrats in the Senate, along with more than three dozen other pieces of House-passed jobs legislation. “The President has said he will use his pen and his phone to take action on jobs, he should start by writing down Senate Majority Leader Reid’s phone number and calling to tell him to pass the SKILLS Act.” More information about the SKILLS Act can be found at www.edworkforce.house.gov/skillsact
12.12.2013	It is a step forward that in this divided government House Republicans were able to have a budget debate framed by our principles – that Washington must live within its means and spend less, not that Americans must surrender to government more of their hard-earned money. With this President and this Senate, that is a real achievement. share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement on the passage of H.J.Res. 59, a bipartisan federal budget agreement: "For the first time in years the federal government is on its way to having a budget. It’s not the budget I would write myself, but it’s a budget much stronger and smarter than the status quo, and it’s a budget that has my support. "Trust me. As a proud fiscal conservative, I was skeptical of this agreement before the details emerged. Too many government budgets are filled with creative accounting, gimmickry and faux savings. However, the agreement reached by Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senator Patty Murray is an exception. "Their budget agreement provides a framework to reduce the federal deficit an additional $23 billion beyond current law, and it does so without raising taxes. The alternative savings it proposes advance conservative principles by replacing arbitrary, defense-heavy sequestration cuts with permanent savings found by targeting real waste and fraud, unsustainable federal employee pensions and other auto-pilot spending. And whereas today’s sequestration spending levels will eventually expire, leaving discretionary spending to be re-negotiated each year, the mandatory ‘Ryan-Murray’ savings will be written into law without any sunset date. "It is a step forward that in this divided government House Republicans were able to have a budget debate framed by our principles – that Washington must live within its means and spend less, not that Americans must surrender to government more of their hard-earned money.

Insurance policies are being cancelled – policies families liked and thought they could keep; Premiums are increasing beyond what family budgets can handle; People’s personal health coverage choices are being belittled by central government planners. Washington can’t ignore their stories." share: f t *Video/Audio Below* WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement on the personal impact the Affordable Care Act is having on 5th District residents and the Keep Your Plan Act: “Fifth District residents contact me every day to share how the President’s Affordable Care Act is impacting them. Insurance policies are being cancelled – policies families liked and thought they could keep; premiums are increasing beyond what family budgets can handle; people’s personal health coverage choices are being belittled by central government planners. Washington Democrats can’t ignore their stories. “Though Obamacare is the absolute wrong solution to America’s health care challenges and won’t be truly ‘fixed’ without full repeal, we should do all we can to protect Americans from the President’s broken promises within the law – especially the central broken promise, that if Americans liked the health care plans they had, they could keep them. “Today I voted in favor of the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013. We are a nation of laws, not of ‘administrative fixes.’ In spite of the President’s veto threat and the challenges to enact such a policy in the health care market with sufficient time, Americans deserve to have a legislative safeguard that says the plans they like and want to keep are not illegal under the law. It’s not enough to take the President at his word.” Congresswoman Foxx shared the personal health care stories of constituents from North Carolina’s Fifth District whose health insurance policies have been deemed non-compliant with Affordable Care Act regulations. Video is below: Broken Obamacare Promises Hurt NC Families (Dawn from Wilkes County) From Dawn’s letter to Congresswoman Foxx: “The Affordable Care Act has eliminated my current HSA with Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina… The ACA-compliant replacement policy which I have been offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield will have a $5,500 annual deductible and will cost $478.60 per month. Even with a 10% higher deductible, this new plan will cost $318.30 per month more than what I can now afford.” For Ruthann, How is this Affordable Care? (Ruthann from Hickory, NC) From Ruthann’s letter to Congresswoman Foxx: “In effect, I am now relegated to a policy that will only be helpful in case of a catastrophic illness resulting in hospitalization.” Broken Obamacare Promise Hurts Don (Don from Lexington) From Don’s letter to Congresswoman Foxx: “My individual health plan…cancels Jan 1st. What is being offered by…Healthcare.gov is triple the cost. I'm unemployed and desperately trying to keep healthcare until I reach 65 late next year. The president said, ‘If you like your health care plan, keep it.’ Please do whatever you can to make that a reality and not another empty statement...” Midge Wants to Keep the Insurance Plan She Likes (Midge from Alexander County) From Midge’s letter to Congresswoman Foxx: “I am one of the many…policy holders whose policy was cancelled due to Obamacare mandates…My policy was great, affordable, and I liked it. The most similar policy Blue Cross can put me on has higher deductibles, higher coinsurance, and coverage that I don't need.” Obamacare: Promises Matter (Michael from Davie County) From Michael’s letter to Congresswoman Foxx: “It is now impossible for our family to afford private health insurance.” # # #
11.14.2013	"None of the damage control changes the President’s foundational promises about Obamacare. Time and again, he said unambiguously, ‘if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.’ He said Obamacare would save families $2,500 each year. He said Obamacare wouldn’t raise taxes." share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s plan to once-again enact unilateral changes to Obamacare without Congressional approval: “Can this tragically-flawed law hold any more band-aids? Waivers for this group; delays for that group; temporary ’fixes’ to mask the gravity of Obamacare’s most grievous features. The President is now trying to repackage his broken law. It’s not working. “None of the damage control changes the President’s foundational promises about Obamacare. Time and again, he said unambiguously, ‘if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.’ He said Obamacare would save families $2,500 each year. He said Obamacare wouldn’t raise taxes. “Too many North Carolinians, roughly 160,000, are confronting a very different truth. “With the President’s credibility about these promises in shambles, attempting another unilateral end-run around Congress will not give North Carolina families the assurance they need. “An executive fiat is not what my constituents Scott, Dawn, Ruthann, Midge, Mark, and John – who are each facing cancelled plans – want. And it does nothing to solve the underlying chaos Obamacare is causing. Only full repeal in favor of honest, patient-centered reform can do that.” Congresswoman Foxx today shared the health care experience of Ruthann from Hickory, North Carolina on the floor of the House of Representatives: For Ruthann, How is this Affordable Care?

In their honor, and in gratitude for their selfless intrepidity on this Veterans Day and throughout our history, our nation offers its humble thanks." share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement to commemorate Veterans Day: "Throughout America’s history, ordinary men and women have donned America’s uniform and offered themselves as a line of defense against tyranny, evil and oppression in this world. "Veterans Day belongs to these men and women. "Through their honor, courage and commitment to our freedoms and our republic they have earned us the renown as the last best hope of earth. "Whether in peacetime or in crisis, liberty requires constant defense. And regardless of the potential cost, be it lost time with family or even the last full measure of one’s devotion, Americans continue to answer freedom’s call. They enlist; they commission; they volunteer to be our protectors. We must never forget the weight or consequence of those decisions. We must never forget the good they have accomplished through their sacrifice. "Appreciation is also due to the families who support our troops, past and present. There are brave spouses in every community who serve as anchors for their households while their loved ones are away, often for months at a time. There are grandparents who help share the responsibilities of raising children so military moms and dads can fulfill their duties with peace of mind. So, too, are there spouses, children, and neighbors who tend to the needs of our aging veterans, to ensure our nation fulfills its promises to them. "For them, every day is Veterans Day. "On this November 11th, our thoughts and prayers will also remain with the men and women deployed throughout the world in service to our Constitution and in pursuit of greater peace. We think of them and celebrate that our country is one set apart from the rest by the heart of our warriors and the resolve of our people for victory. "America’s airmen, soldiers, coastguardsmen, sailors, and marines are heroes among us. In their honor, and in gratitude for their selfless intrepidity on this Veterans Day and throughout our history, our nation offers its humble thanks." # # #

10.16.2013	In the weeks and months ahead, the country will have to ask whether the President takes his legacy of debt seriously. Republicans and Democrats alike should heed the mathematical writing on the wall and urge the President to commit to honest spending reforms to make our country stronger. share: f t Washington, D.C. – Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement tonight after the House of Representatives passed legislation to increase the federal debt limit and authorize short-term funding for the federal government. "North Carolinians expect real solutions, not problem dodging, from their elected leaders. They expect solutions to ensure laws are fair, spending is controlled, and government is responsive to their concerns. They expect the President to work with both parties to put the American people first. "America is facing sizeable challenges, in no small part because decades of temporary fixes have failed to confront fundamental problems. Now families are learning that their health care costs will be skyrocketing next year. They are unable to afford Obamacare, much less log in to the government’s broken health care website. Federal debt has already eclipsed the size of the United States economy and will soar to unsustainable levels unless Washington chooses to get the cost of ‘mandatory’ spending programs under control. Both parties must acknowledge and commit to fix that reality. "In the House of Representatives, we had hoped the occasion of America’s debt ceiling deadline would spur bipartisan commitment to confront the real drivers of America’s $16.7 trillion debt – debt that will hang over the heads of our children and grandchildren for years to come. It did not. "We attempted to work with the President and Senate Democrats to delay Obamacare’s unprecedented individual mandate tax and at least guarantee fairness in the broken law’s implementation. They refused. "While I am glad to see the federal government shutdown end and have temporary assurance that America’s bills will be paid, given the magnitude of the problems we face, the solution offered by the United States Senate does not adequately improve America’s long-term fiscal health. Thus, I could not offer my support. "In the weeks and months ahead, the country will have to ask whether the President takes his legacy of debt seriously. Republicans and Democrats alike should heed the mathematical writing on the wall and urge the President to commit to honest spending reforms to make our country stronger. "It won’t be easy, but our debt – driven largely by health care spending, and exacerbated by Obamacare – requires a leader. Right now, President Obama is America’s leader, and the buck stops with him.” # # #

Refusing to negotiate a fair end to the shutdown or a fiscally responsible solution to America’s debt crisis is childish and unreasonable, particularly when divided government requires bipartisanship.” share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted today with a bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives to immediately restore funding to children’s Head Start Programs nationwide. Though President Obama has supported two of the House’s intermediary funding bills, he has threatened to veto the Head Start for Low-Income Children Act (H.J. Res. 84). “The House of Representatives is acting in good-faith to restore government services for the American people and stop punitive shutdown antics from tainting our national parks and memorials,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “This afternoon, the House of Representatives passed its eleventh bipartisan partial funding measure - this one to reopen immediately the federal Head Start Program for low-income children. Twenty-three Democrats joined House Republicans in passing the measure. In the House, we agree that children who rely on Head Start should not have their program disrupted any further by Washington’s dysfunction. “House Republicans want to meet with Senate Democrats to find a bipartisan solution to reopen the federal government fully, but the Senate first needs to agree to be part of those talks. Refusing to negotiate a fair end to the shutdown or a fiscally responsible solution to America’s debt crisis is childish and unreasonable, particularly when divided government requires bipartisanship.” The House has now taken action on eleven separate measures to solve problems caused by the federal government shutdown. Additional bills will be considered by the House in coming days. With the exception of the Pay our Military Act (H.R. 3210), the Senate has yet to consider any.

The White House has announced its intention to veto these bills in addition to the bills passed by the House today. When the White House made the veto announcement, Speaker of the House John Boehner’s Press Secretary Michael Steel remarked, “How does the White House justify signing the troop funding bill, but vetoing similar measures for veterans and National Parks? The President can't continue to complain about the impact of the government shutdown on veterans and visitors at National Parks while vetoing bills to help them. The White House position is unsustainably hypocritical.” HOUSE WILL CONTINUE TO LEAD, FIX PROBLEMS “Republicans and Democrats have policy differences. But we shouldn’t differ here. Correcting problems for veterans, military families, the National Institute of Health, and visitors to national parks – including the WWII Memorial and North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Parkway – is common sense and provides common ground for Democrats and Republicans to make some progress toward solving this shutdown.” HOUSE WILL CONTINUE AS BIPARTISAN LEADER “House Republicans still recognize that it’s going to take bipartisanship to re-open government.

Federal government appropriations expired at 12:00 a.m: “President Obama, Harry Reid, and Senate Democrats flat-out refused to come to the table to shape a bipartisan solution to keep the government open. I am incredibly disappointed that their ‘our way or the highway’ mindset has carried us past the government funding deadline and started the eighteenth government shutdown. “House Republicans worked alone in good faith this weekend to keep the government open.

I am incredibly disappointed that their ‘our way or the highway’ mindset has carried us past the government funding deadline and started the eighteenth government shutdown. “As the federal funding deadline approached, House Republicans knew the solution to keep government open had to be bipartisan – that’s the reality when Congress is comprised of a Republican House and a Democrat Senate. However, our willingness to work together was not matched by the President or Senate leaders who each repeatedly refused to negotiate with the people's House. We edited our bipartisan government funding proposals down to include basic matters of fairness – extending to individuals the same Obamacare delay the President offered to big businesses and political allies, and ensuring the President and Members of Congress are treated just like American taxpayers under the law. However, even those bipartisan amendments were rejected in favor of shutdown politics. "Just as Obamacare passed on purely partisan votes, the President’s legacy of partisanship continues. House Republicans, though, are willing to lead and will continue to try and find common ground with Democrats to open this government.

09.30.2013	We are asking to fund the government and ensure that Americans are treated fairly under Obamacare. October 1 not only marks the beginning of the federal fiscal year, it’s also the day Obamacare insurance exchanges will launch throughout the country. In North Carolina, the rates available through the exchanges may be triple or quadruple what individuals are paying now, and there will be fewer providers to choose from. North Carolinians should get the same one year break from Obamacare’s individual mandate that the President unilaterally chose to extend to big businesses. share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx tonight issued the following statement upon the passage of the third Continuing Resolution from the House of Representatives to fund the federal government in advance of the fiscal year deadline: “Tonight I cast my third separate vote to keep the federal government open to the American people. With each vote, House Republicans are trying to work with our Senate colleagues to shape a bipartisan solution to fund our government, but the Senate didn’t even show up to work yesterday and is antagonistic to the notion of compromise. Such politicking is unbelievably disheartening at so critical a moment. “We are asking to fund the government and ensure that Americans are treated fairly under Obamacare.

In North Carolina, the rates available through the exchanges may be triple or quadruple what individuals are paying now, and there will be fewer providers to choose from. North Carolinians should get the same one year break from Obamacare’s individual mandate that the President unilaterally chose to extend to big businesses. “Additionally, Members of Congress, Congressional Staff, the President, Vice President, and presidential appointees and cabinet members should receive fair treatment under Obamacare, not special treatment. The President’s choice to direct his Office of Personnel Management to extend premium contributions to Members of Congress and Congressional Staff undermines the spirit of the law, and we are correcting that through this Continuing Resolution. “The Senate has just hours left to start working with House Republicans to keep the government open. We should be able to agree on the need for fairness in Obamacare’s implementation. It’s only right to enact this reform now and keep the government open.” # # #
09.29.2013	Our bipartisan legislation fully funds the federal government, guarantees troop pay, puts Obamacare and all its uncertainty for families and small businesses on hold, and permanently repeals Obamacare’s innovation hampering medical device tax – something more than thirty Senate Democrats want removed. share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today issued the following statement on the second passage of House legislation to avert a government shutdown: “For the second time in as many weeks, I voted today to keep the federal government open to the American people. Now it is time for the President and Senate to let go of their partisan intransigence and work with us to come to an agreement that is best for this country. “Our bipartisan legislation fully funds the federal government, guarantees troop pay, puts Obamacare and all its uncertainty for families and small businesses on hold, and permanently repeals Obamacare’s innovation hampering medical device tax – something more than thirty Senate Democrats want removed. “My job is to serve the people of North Carolina, to make their federal government less obstructive to liberty and more responsive to their needs. That responsibility includes protecting them from bad laws, and not simply capitulating at their expense when the President decides he is unwilling to work in a bipartisan way to strengthen this country. “The House of Representatives cannot compromise alone. We cannot work together if the President and Senate Democrats refuse to come to the negotiating table. The federal government should remain open, but White House obstinance is standing in the way.” Foxx spoke twice on the floor of the House of Representatives Saturday in favor of keeping the government open and ensuring American families receive fair treatment under Obamacare. Footage of her remarks is below: Foxx: We’re Fighting for the American People "We don’t want to shut down the federal government…We want to have the policy right…We’re fighting for the American people."

09.26.2013	"There is a better way to move forward with patient-centered health care reform. The American Health Care Reform Act will undo the damage of Obamacare." share: f t After information released by the Department of Health and Human Services showed individuals in North Carolina stand to face significantly higher costs under Obamacare, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), a cosponsor of the American Health Care Reform Act, issued the following statement: “Despite promises of affordability and cost reductions, behind the Obama Administration’s spin is the ugly truth that too many North Carolinians and families will be paying more for insurance on January 1st than they are paying today. Higher insurance rates and higher taxes, due to Obamacare, are going to hit families right in the wallet. Where’s the affordability in that? “There is a better way to move forward with patient-centered health care reform. The American Health Care Reform Act will undo the damage of Obamacare, extend coverage to those with preexisting conditions, give individuals power in the health care market, and allow patients to take advantage of affordable coverage options outside their own state. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.” Watch Foxx’s Remarks on the House Floor Here “Americans aren’t interested in the Administration’s PR, they’re concerned with whether they’ll have to spend more on January 1 then they are spending today. Under Obamacare, for many in my state, the answer to that question is sadly, yes.” Congresswoman Foxx is a cosponsor of the Republican Study Committee’s American Health Care Reform Act. Ramesh Ponnuru writes in Bloomberg that “the Republican plan is superior to Obamacare. It’s less coercive. It requires fewer taxes. It doesn’t have as much potential to reduce full-time employment. And it’s more likely to control costs, relying as it does on the power of competition rather than the guidance of Washington-based experts.” The American Health Care Reform Act will: Fully repeal President Obama's health care law, eliminating billions in taxes and thousands of pages of unworkable regulations and mandates that are driving up health care costs. Spur competition to lower health care costs by allowing Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines and enabling small businesses to pool together and get the same buying power as large corporations. Reform medical malpractice laws in a commonsense way that limit trial lawyer fees and non-economic damages while maintaining strong protections for patients. Provide tax reform that allows families and individuals to deduct health care costs, just like companies, leveling the playing field and providing all Americans with a standard deduction for health insurance. Expand access to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), increasing the amount of pre-tax dollars individuals can deposit into portable savings accounts to be used for health care expenses. Protect the unborn by ensuring no federal funding for elective abortions. # # #
09.20.2013	“Today we had an opportunity to move our government away from shut down and our country and economy away from Obamacare. This was the right step to take. The Senate must now do its part to pass this legislation.” share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued this statement upon the passage of a Continuing Resolution (H.J. Res 59) to fund the government from the House of Representatives: “Without question, I am focused on preventing a government shutdown. That’s why I voted with my House Republican colleagues today to pass a Continuing Resolution, in advance of the new fiscal year, that lays out how our government will be funded. “Consistent with our conservative values, this legislation maintains current savings and also specifies that no taxpayer dollars should be wasted implementing the Obamacare train wreck. The American people, by and large, do not want the changes they see coming to their health care because of Obamacare. House Republicans agree and are united in firm opposition to the President’s unfair health law. “Today we had an opportunity to move our government away from shut down and our country and economy away from Obamacare. This was the right step to take. The Senate must now do its part to pass this legislation.” Continuing Resolution Specifics: Funds the Government at current levels ($986.3 billion): The Continuing Resolution is a straight extension of current spending levels. Full Faith and Credit: The Continuing Resolution incorporates H.R. 807, the Full Faith and Credit Act, allowing the Department of the Treasury to make public debt payments should America reach the debt ceiling. In addition, this provision will ensure that in a debt ceiling situation beneficiaries will continue to receive Social Security and disability payments by allowing redemption of Social Security Trust Fund obligations. Fully Defunds Obamacare: The Continuing Resolution fully defunds Obamacare by rescinding all available unobligated balances and prohibiting additional discretionary and mandatory spending on its implementation.
09.19.2013	"Reforms in this legislation put stronger protections in place to ensure SNAP money is reserved just for those Americans who qualify for food stamps and isn’t wasted on government public relations campaigns or lottery winners. Additionally, consistent with the bipartisan belief that the solution to poverty is found through work, and not just aid, the Nutrition Reform & Work Opportunity Act reinstates Clinton-era SNAP work requirements." share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued this statement upon the passage of H.R. 3102, the Nutrition Reform & Work Opportunity Act: “The Nutrition Reform & Work Opportunity Act is designed to preserve the integrity of the SNAP program for families, and especially children, who rely on food stamps. Its cost-saving reforms are a step in the right direction, and are long overdue out of respect for needy Americans and taxpayers. “Reforms in this legislation put stronger protections in place to ensure SNAP money is reserved just for those Americans who qualify for food stamps and isn’t wasted on government public relations campaigns or lottery winners. Additionally, consistent with the bipartisan belief that the solution to poverty is found through work, and not just aid, the Nutrition Reform & Work Opportunity Act reinstates Clinton-era SNAP work requirements. These rules stipulate that able-bodied adults with no dependents, must be looking for work, developing job skills, completing community service or obtain employment to draw food stamp benefits. Not only will this provision ensure that the truly needy continue to receive aid, it will also help these individuals compete and prepare for jobs. “An overextended, unchecked SNAP program won’t be capable of serving the citizens it’s purposed to help. It is the job of this Congress to ensure the program is held accountable as a steward of taxpayer dollars and safety net for the needy.” H.R. 3102 reforms federal nutrition programs to provide for the neediest Americans while simultaneously promoting employment, reducing waste and abuse, and saving taxpayers roughly $40 billion over a ten year span. Food stamp spending has doubled to $80 billion annually over the course of the Obama presidency. While the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) is a vital resource for millions of Americans it has become victim to waste, fraud, and abuse. Through the Nutrition Reform & Work Opportunity Act, the House of Representatives is working to protect the integrity of this program. Legislation Specifics: Reforms SNAP for the first time since the Welfare Reform Act of 1996, saving roughly $40 billion over a decade. Eliminates the “Categorical Eligibility” loophole to ensure existing benefit asset and income tests are met. Eliminates the ability for states to waive work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents. States will still be allowed to exempt from work requirements up to 15% of their total able-bodied beneficiaries based on hardship or lack of jobs in a given area. Ends USDA bonus awards to states for administering SNAP. Ensures SNAP recipients are not receiving benefits from multiple states and that previously disqualified recipients do not start receiving benefits in another state. Prevents states from paying individuals low amounts of Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds in an effort to allow them to qualify for SNAP.

09.12.2013	"The No Subsidies Without Verification Act we passed today in the House will hold the Administration to an honest standard: Develop a verification process now, or stop the subsidy system.” share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon the passage of the No Subsidies Without Verification Act (H.R. 2775), legislation that would require the Department of Health and Human Services’ Inspector General to verify the eligibility requirements of any person applying for Obamacare’s taxpayer-funded healthcare subsidies: “Before any taxpayer-funded Obamacare subsidies are issued, the United States government must have an eligibility verification system in place. But sadly for working families, it appears the Obama Administration prefers the ‘honor system.’ This summer they announced essentially that the job of verifying eligibility before awarding applicants with taxpayer-funded Obamacare subsidies was too burdensome, so the American people would be left having to pay for a subsidy system susceptible to rampant fraud. This is not only inexcusable; it’s shameful. “Congress has a responsibility to protect hardworking North Carolina families from such bureaucratic laziness. The No Subsidies Without Verification Act we passed today in the House will hold the Administration to an honest standard: Develop a verification process now, or stop the subsidy system.” Video: Congresswoman Foxx spoke in favor of the No Subsidies Without Verification Act on the floor of the House of Representatives this week. This legislation is the latest bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives to repeal, delay, defund, or dismantle the broken federal health care legislation known as Obamacare. Thus far, seven bills which dismantle various provisions of the law have been signed by the President. Ditch the “Honor System,” or Delay the Subsidies Foxx: “We are told this honor system will be temporary, but we are not satisfied. Develop a verification process now, or delay the subsidies.” Background: On Friday July 5th, the Obama Administration released more than 600 pages of new rules and regulations to govern Obamacare. Within those pages was an announcement that the Department of Health and Human Services would no longer verify the eligibility of applicants for Obamacare’s taxpayer-funded exchange subsidies, instead opting to rely on a system of applicant self-verification – simply put, an “honor system.” H.R. 2775, the No Subsidies Without Verification Act, prevents the Obama administration’s attempt to dodge responsibility for how taxpayer dollars are used by requiring that fact-based verification systems be put in place before Obamacare income-based subsidies are issued, a principle on which the Democrat Senate’s Appropriations Committee agrees. # # #
09.11.2013	"September 11, another infamous date for our Republic, revealed the strength and resolve of American character, and proved once again to the adversaries of liberty that the champions of freedom will not be stopped. We will never waiver, we will not cede strength, and we will stand firm as the last best hope of earth." share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) made the following remarks today on the twelfth anniversary of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and the first anniversary of the terror attack in Benghazi: "Twelve years ago, the course of our country’s history changed. "In an unprovoked attack that sought to bring America to its knees, the world was reminded instead that ours is a nation of heroes – where people run toward danger for the sake of their fellow man; where a new generation of protectors, knowing full well the risk, chose to answer its country’s call to defend liberty and pursue peace. "Last year on this day we were again reminded that freedom has its foes. We mourn the lives of the four dear Americans we lost to terror in Benghazi and pledge justice on their behalf. "To the families bound together by this tragic date eleven years apart, we promise our continued prayers for peace, and we take comfort that the nearness of Almighty God is always with the brokenhearted. "September 11, another infamous date for our Republic, revealed the strength and resolve of American character, and proved once again to the adversaries of liberty that the champions of freedom will not be stopped. We will never waiver, we will not cede strength, and we will stand firm as the last best hope of earth." # # #
09.10.2013	At this time, I do not believe the use of military force in Syria, as sought by the President, is the appropriate response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons; nor is it the best defense of America’s national security interests. Thus, after carefully considering President Obama’s request and reviewing classified information provided by the White House, I will not support the current proposal to authorize military force in Syria. share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement on President Obama’s request for Congress to authorize the use of military force in Syria: “At this time, I do not believe the use of military force in Syria, as sought by the President, is the appropriate response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons; nor is it the best defense of America’s national security interests. Thus, after carefully considering President Obama’s request and reviewing classified information provided by the White House, I will not support the current proposal to authorize military force in Syria. “The people of North Carolina’s 5th District overwhelmingly agree with my opposition to committing American troops and assets to an ill-conceived, “shot across the bow” campaign in the midst of Syrian tumult. In the days since President Obama announced his intention to engage our military, and in the months leading up to it, no compelling case has been made by the Administration to suggest that its desired military action is in our country’s immediate interest or worth assuming the myriad risks associated with such an undertaking at this time. The Administration’s objectives for engagement remain unclear and leave the American public doubting whether authorizing force would deter the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by unstable regimes. “The Assad regime should face consequences for employing and continuing the proliferation of chemical weapons in its ongoing civil war. But until we can conclude that the application of American military power is the best way to protect the American people, our allies or our interests, it does not serve our country to risk American lives and waste American resources in Syria.”

As debate over that question continues prior to the upcoming vote on authorization, I will be looking for the President to offer evidence to support his belief that America’s national security is best served by initiating his proposed military involvement. However, at this point, I remain unconvinced." # # #

In fact, my Republican colleagues and I have been demanding this from the White House. “The onus is on the President to make the case to Congress and to the American people for his desired military response and answer why he believes it is in the United States’ national interest to involve itself in Syria’s ongoing violence.

08.07.2013	“Through a combination of talent and tenacity, Josiah Gourley has accomplished the rare achievement of earning the Civil Air Patrol’s Spaatz Award,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “I congratulate Josiah on this accomplishment and what it reveals about his character, and trust that he will continue to lead, serve and inspire others in his ranks.” share: f t Clemmons, N.C. –Congresswoman Virginia Foxx Tuesday presented the highest cadet award in the United States Air Force Auxiliary’s Civil Air Patrol to Mr. Josiah Gourley, a rising high school senior from Walnut Cove. Gourley’s achievement marks only the 1899th time in the history of the Civil Air Patrol that the Spaatz Award has been earned. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx presents the Civil Air Patrol’s highest cadet honor, the Spaatz Award, to Cadet Josiah Gourley of Walnut Cove. “Through a combination of talent and tenacity, Josiah Gourley has accomplished the rare achievement of earning the Civil Air Patrol’s Spaatz Award,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “I congratulate Josiah on this accomplishment and what it reveals about his character, and trust that he will continue to lead, serve and inspire others in his ranks.” “The Spaatz is considered the pinnacle of a cadet’s career, and requires years of studying and leadership,” Cadet Josiah Gourley said. “The things I enjoyed most while pursuing this goal were the people I met and the many different leadership styles to which I was exposed. I truly believe that it has taught me to appreciate how much pressure leaders can be under. Regardless of what career I enter, although I hope to serve in the military, the skills of leadership, followership and self-discipline I’ve learned from the Civil Air Patrol will always be a big part of my life.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, Cadet Colonel Josiah Gourley and Civil Air Patrol Major Eric Ordain. About Cadet Josiah Gourley: A lifelong resident of Walnut Cove, Josiah Gourley is the son of Timothy and Leslieann Gourley. He has excelled academically through homeschooling and is an active member of his community through civic, church and Civil Air Patrol activities. Since joining the Civil Air Patrol in 2008, Cadet Colonel Gourley has served with distinction and won a reputation as one of the top cadets to engage the CAP cadet program. Through a broad range of duty assignments and service opportunities, Gourley has consistently performed with excellence. Beyond the rigorous physical fitness requirements of the Civil Air Patrol and the careful training required of ground team members, Gourley earned the prestigious “Ranger First Class” rating. In addition to mastering significant amounts of aerospace education knowledge, he supported his passion for aviation with hard work and earned the opportunity to “solo,” or fly a CAP airplane by himself, last summer at the National Flight Academy. In addition to his outstanding work leading cadets in his local squadron, where his service as cadet commander capped a long string of successful duty positions, Gourley served as commander of the statewide summer encampment and chaired the cadet committee charged with advising the state wing commander about cadet programs. His hard work and exceptional talent has been recognized with the Spaatz Association Scholarship (to fund flight training; three awarded nationally), and in 2012 he was named the Cadet of the Year for the North Carolina Wing and then also named Cadet of the Year for the Middle East Region (covering the mid-Atlantic states: NC, SC, VA, WV, MD, DC and DE). About the Spaatz Award: The Spaatz Award is the Civil Air Patrol’s highest cadet honor. It is presented to cadets who have demonstrated excellence in leadership, character, fitness and aerospace education. Cadets qualify for this prestigious award after devoting an average of five years to progress through sixteen achievements in the CAP Cadet Program. Along the way they develop self-discipline, a strong sense of personal responsibility, the ability to lead and persuade and the foundation necessary for pursuing a career in aviation, space or technology. The final step a cadet must complete to earn the Spaatz Award is a rigorous four-part exam consisting of a challenging physical fitness test, an essay exam testing their moral reasoning, a comprehensive written exam on leadership and a comprehensive written exam on aerospace education. Upon passing the Spaatz Award exams, the cadet is promoted to the grade of cadet colonel. The Spaatz Award is named in honor of General Carl A. “Tooey” Spaatz, the first chief of staff of the United States Air Force. On average, only two cadets in one thousand earn the Spaatz Award. Since the award’s inception in 1964, Civil Air Patrol has presented the Spaatz Award to only 1,899 cadets. # # #
08.02.2013	Today Congresswoman Virginia Foxx voted in support of two measures to restrict the role of the federal government in the lives of the American people. The Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act (H.R. 2009) and the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act (H.R. 367) are two of ten pieces of legislation passed by the House of Representatives this week to hold Washington accountable and stop government abuse. share: f t Today Congresswoman Virginia Foxx voted in support of two measures to restrict the role of the federal government in the lives of the American people. The Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act (H.R. 2009) and the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act (H.R. 367) are two of ten pieces of legislation passed by the House of Representatives this week to hold Washington accountable and stop government abuse. About the Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act, Congresswoman Foxx stated: “If asked to list the persons or entities that should play no part in personal health care decisions, the American people would likely put the IRS at or near the top. And yet the very entity responsible for providing Obamacare its enforcement teeth is the Internal Revenue Service. Yes, the same agency responsible for audits and implicated in political intimidation tactics is responsible, under Obamacare, for micromanaging, regulating and issuing punishments if it disapproves of your health care choices. “Today a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives voted to take this power away from the IRS. The Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act specifically bars the IRS from implementing or enforcing any part of Obamacare. Obamacare is a bad law for patients, doctors, jobs and the economy. It shouldn’t rest its hopes for implementation on a further empowered IRS.” Regarding the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, Congresswoman Foxx said: “Today, nearly 12 million Americans are out of work and economic growth is stagnant. The Obama economic agenda – from Obamacare to Stimulus and restrictions on American energy – is not working. “When American workers and small businesses look to Washington for help, they aren’t asking for more micromanagement or a continuation of the President’s failed policies. They are asking for a leaner more responsive government that works for them. “Reforming our laws, taxes, and regulations to encourage growth and strengthen America’s standing in the global economy are things both parties should agree on, and things House Republicans are happy to help the President pursue. The passage of the REINS Act today will add an additional layer of oversight to the most costly of federal government regulations. Unelected bureaucrats shouldn’t be able to unilaterally impose onerous rules that bleed jobs and money from the U.S. economy. Congress and the American people should approve of any high impact rules first.” Congresswoman Foxx spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives about the importance of stopping federal government regulatory abuse. A video of her remarks may be found here. "The American people are asking ‘where are the jobs?’ and they are asking for a government that makes sense. No one is asking for more red tape.” #StopGovtAbuse # # #

A Davidson County American history, civics and economics teacher has completed Congresswoman Virginia Foxx’s week-long Teacher in Congress program. Miss Hannah Savey, a recent Appalachian State University graduate who teaches at North Davidson High School, made the most of her week in Washington with Congresswoman Foxx and hopes the experience will help her encourage each of her students to become active in their government. “Our capital city is rich with history and inspiration, and I am glad Miss Savey was able to join me in Washington to experience her Congress at work,” Congresswoman Foxx said. “North Davidson High School students are blessed to have a teacher as passionate and excited about American government and public service as Hannah Savey, and I trust they will enjoy hearing her front-row perspective.” “My experience with Congresswoman Foxx was incredible,” Hannah Savey said. “I feel honored as a teacher to have been given this opportunity, which included meeting both of North Carolina’s Senators and researching primary sources for my classroom. I look forward to sharing all that I have learned with my students this fall, and hopefully, I will be able to inspire them to be active citizens in our great nation.” Hannah Savey and Congresswoman Foxx sit at the dais in the House Rules Committee Chamber. Foxx’s annual Teacher in Congress program is unique in Washington. Since 2007, the program has invited one 5th Congressional District high school teacher each year to travel to Washington, D.C. for a week of intensive learning and curriculum development activities during their summer school break. While in Washington, Savey toured the United States Capitol with an official historian, discussed education policy, visited the Supreme Court, studied at the Library of Congress, reviewed national archives including the original United States Constitution, met both of North Carolina’s United States Senators, watched legislative debate on the House floor with Congresswoman Foxx, attended House Rules Committee hearings and even spent time with a teacher from Great Britain who was visiting the United States Capitol with her family. Savey just completed her first year teaching at North Davidson High School. She plans to integrate her experiences at the United States Capitol into both her American history and civics lesson plans this coming year. In her application for the Teacher in Congress Program, Savey wrote, “If I only have one goal as a teacher, it is to never become [a] person [who makes no effort to make learning fun]. I want to absorb new opportunities in professional development and incorporate interesting activities that my students will learn and enjoy. This is precisely why I believe I would be an excellent candidate for the Teacher in Congress internship.” Savey, a Lexington resident, is a 2011 magna cum laude graduate of Appalachian State University. She is currently pursuing her Masters in History Education at Appalachian State University’s Hickory campus. # # #
07.31.2013	“We’ve all seen how Washington’s involvement in rate-setting is a recipe for uncertainty and confusion. Students deserve better. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act, much like the House’s Smarter Solutions for Students Act, ends the temporary fixes that have failed to strengthen our nation’s student loan system and offers long-term simplicity, rate caps, and an assurance that interest rates are immediately in line with the free market. It’s a shame that it took Senate Democrats this long to join us and correct the problem, but it’s better they complete the assignment late than never.” share: f t The House of Representatives today approved with bipartisan support a final version of H.R. 1911, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act (also known as the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act as amended by the Senate). “Changing the status quo is never easy, and returning student loan interest rates to the market is a longstanding goal Republicans have been working toward for years,” House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) said. “By getting politicians out of the business of setting student loan interest rates, H.R. 1911 will provide students the certainty they need to make smart, fiscally responsible investments in their education. I applaud my colleagues on the other side of the aisle for finally recognizing this long-term, market-based proposal for what it is: a win for students and taxpayers.” Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) stated, “We’ve all seen how Washington’s involvement in rate-setting is a recipe for uncertainty and confusion.

07.24.2013	Transparency and accountability are not partisan issues. Democrats and Republicans who worked together to pass UMRA in 1995 believed the American people would be served better if government issued regulations only when the cost of those regulations was fully understood. My colleagues and I still think that’s the case. And while UMRA is good, it needs to be strengthened. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act builds off of UMRA and goes even further to make sure government is held accountable for considering how prospective regulatory will impact small businesses and local governments. The legislation is purely about making government work better for the American people by requiring openness and honesty from Washington about the true cost of regulations, whether those costs come in dollars or in lost jobs. It is my hope the strong bipartisan support with which it was introduced will pave the way for its swift passage from the House of Representatives. share: f t Today bipartisan regulatory transparency legislation sponsored by Representatives Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike McIntyre (D-NC), and Collin Peterson (D-MN) successfully advanced from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, H.R. 899, will fix loopholes within the bipartisan regulatory reform act known as UMRA. Representative Virginia Foxx – “Transparency and accountability are not partisan issues. Democrats and Republicans who worked together to pass UMRA in 1995 believed the American people would be served better if government issued regulations only when the cost of those regulations was fully understood. My colleagues and I still think that’s the case. And while UMRA is good, it needs to be strengthened.

It is my hope the strong bipartisan support with which it was introduced will pave the way for its swift passage from the House of Representatives.” Representative Loretta Sanchez –“This bill will help protect state and local governments from unfunded, unnecessary mandates that waste time and money. Our bill will hold federal agencies accountable by requiring public reporting on these mandates.” Representative James Lankford – “I am proud to join Rep. Foxx to move this bill through the next phase of the legislative process. Excessive federal rules and regulations continue to find their way around existing law to further restrict states and business owners already burdened under the mountain of federal bureaucracy. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2013 will zero in on every future mandate to empower local governments and private businesses to push back on harmful regulations. This bill is a first step in an important overhaul effort for a more commonsense regulatory structure, which will increase transparency and efficiency.” Representative Mike McIntyre – “Unfunded and duplicative mandates strangle the free enterprise system, and this bill is a great step toward reforming the regulatory process, streamlining government, and saving taxpayers’ time and money. Passing this bill out of committee is a positive step forward, and let’s keep working together to enact it into law!” Representative Collin Peterson – “It’s time to establish a more open and transparent process of federal mandates, providing our constituents with a complete assessment on the impact of government regulations. The Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act modernizes the process and is a first step to the reforms I believe need to be made to the regulatory process.” H.R. 899 will increase transparency about the costs imposed by unfunded mandates and will hold government accountable for considering those costs before passing them onto local governments and small businesses. The legislation expands the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. Current loopholes within UMRA allow Congress and certain regulatory bodies to escape public reporting requirements and incentivize others to forego publicizing regulatory proposals. Foxx’s legislation will correct this. Specifically, H.R. 899 will: Impose stricter and more clearly defined requirements for how and when federal agencies must disclose the cost of federal mandates; Ensure those who will be affected have the opportunity to weigh in on proposed mandates; Equip Congress and the public with tools to better determine the true cost of regulations; and Provide an accountability mechanism to ensure the federal government and its independent regulatory agencies adhere to the provisions set forth by H.R. 899 and its predecessor, UMRA. Foxx’s legislation also requires the federal government to report how legislative changes to existing federal grant programs might shift costs to state, local, and tribal governments. For instance, grant programs which are administered by states can be altered by federal legislation such as No Child Left Behind and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to impose new financial burdens for participation. Under H.R. 899 the federal government would be statutorily required to report how such changes would impact state or local government budgets. Support for the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act has been voiced in letters from the National Conference of State Legislatures, the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council. # # #

The legislation reforms and reauthorizes the Elementary and Secondary Education Act: “North Carolina teachers, parents and administrators – not Washington bureaucrats – should be in charge of making education decisions in our state. “The Student Success Act I cosponsored centers around the theme of empowering the people closest to students with the authority to make education choices in their respective states and communities. By scaling back Washington’s one-size-fits-all micromanagement of classrooms, this legislation takes positive steps toward ensuring local educators have the flexibility required to meet the diverse needs of their students. “As a grandmother, educator and former school board member, I know students are best served when those at the local level are the driving force behind improving education. Washington red tape, duplicative programs and coercive standards compound the negative effects of flawed federal education laws on American schools. I will not allow Washington policy to compromise education quality, and the Student Success Act begins the process of getting Washington out of the way.” The Student Success Act is a long-term solution that will prevent future federal overreach into elementary and secondary education, promote effective teachers in the classroom, provide parents a stronger voice in education and begin to restore local control. The following are some of the reforms to federal education policy included in H.R. 5, the Student Success Act: Prohibits the Secretary of Education from coercing states into adopting specific academic standards (such as Common Core) and imposing conditions in exchange for a waiver of K-12 law; Eliminates more than 70 duplicative and ineffective federal K-12 programs; Prioritizes state and local decision-making by scrapping one-size-fits-all accountability and school improvement systems; Repeals antiquated “Highly Qualified Teacher” requirements that have little bearing on teacher effectiveness; Supports state or school district efforts to develop their own evaluation systems that take into account student achievement and include input from parents, teachers, and administrators; Reauthorizes and expands the Charter School Program to assist states in replicating high-quality charter schools; Improves tutoring and public school choice options through the Direct Student Services Program; and Ensures parents have access to meaningful information about school performance, and encourages communities to hold schools accountable. # # #
07.17.2013	Obamacare is a bad law, but it is a bad law President Obama asked for. And it’s a bad law he, as mastermind and chief enforcer, must obey – unless Congress authorizes a change. Today House Republicans voted to give the President the authority to delay the implementation of Obamacare’s employer mandate – something his Administration wants to do. But House Republicans went a step further. If businesses are getting a break from the President’s law, individual Americans should too. share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) voted today on two pieces of legislation to ensure every American is given a reprieve from Obamacare’s onerous mandates. Foxx offered the following statement on the votes: “Obamacare is a bad law, but it is a bad law President Obama asked for. And it’s a bad law he, as mastermind and chief enforcer, must obey – unless Congress authorizes a change. “Today House Republicans voted to give the President the authority to delay the implementation of Obamacare’s employer mandate – something his Administration wants to do. But House Republicans went a step further. If businesses are getting a break from the President’s law, individual Americans should too. “In a second vote today, we voted to extend to families the same reprieve by delaying the implementation of Obamacare’s individual mandate tax as well. “House Republicans see Obamacare for the broken law it is. We don’t want any Americans to suffer under its weight.” The Authority for Mandate Delay Act (H.R. 2667) delays Obamacare’s employer mandate. The Fairness for American Families Act (H.R. 2668) provides relief to every American citizen by delaying Obamacare’s strikingly unpopular individual mandate. President Obama announced earlier this month that his Administration would unilaterally delay the implementation of Obamacare’s employer mandate for one year. The President must enforce and abide by laws as they are written. But it is curious that the Administration would seek only to extend reprieve to businesses and not to individual Americans. Foxx and GOP leaders sent a letter to President Barack Obama last week asking him to explain his rationale for exempting just businesses, and not families, from Obamacare’s mandates during the first year the legislation takes effect. The letter additionally asks the White House to announce now which other provisions of Obamacare it expects to delay. Foxx twice spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives in support of extending the delay of Obamacare’s mandates to individual Americans and not just businesses as the White House has planned. Videos of her remarks are below: Every American Deserves Obamacare Reprieve “The White House scrambling is to be expected. Obamacare is a bad law. But it's a bad law the President asked for. And it's a bad law he, as mastermind and chief enforcer, must obey...unless Congress authorizes a change.” Watch here. Fairness For All – Obamacare Delay Should be Universal “This week House Republicans will take action to protect every American -- individuals, families, and those who manage or work for businesses, from the President's costly, broken law. If the employer mandate is being delayed, so should the individual mandate. It's basic fairness. It's Fairness for All.” Watch here. # # #
07.11.2013	The 2013 Farm Bill is certainly imperfect, but with the inclusion of three taxpayer-centric amendments I authored, overall cost savings and long-overdue reforms to ‘Soviet-style’ milk subsidy programs, it is a definite improvement from the untenable status quo. This legislation finally lays the groundwork to repeal the 1949 law that has been the problematic backstop of American agriculture policy for more than sixty years. And farmers as well as taxpayers will benefit from a modernized bill that cuts spending roughly $20 billion dollars. This legislation is just one step in the right direction, not the end of conservative reform efforts to eliminate wasteful crop subsidies and restore integrity to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. share: f t Three amendments by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), previously adopted by the House of Representatives, were included in the 2013 Farm Bill, the Federal Agriculture Reform & Risk Management Act (H.R. 2642), which passed today with Foxx’s support. “The 2013 Farm Bill is certainly imperfect, but with the inclusion of three taxpayer-centric amendments I authored, overall cost savings and long-overdue reforms to ‘Soviet-style’ milk subsidy programs, it is a definite improvement from the untenable status quo. “This legislation finally lays the groundwork to repeal the 1949 law that has been the problematic backstop of American agriculture policy for more than sixty years. And farmers as well as taxpayers will benefit from a modernized bill that cuts spending roughly $20 billion dollars. “This legislation is just one step in the right direction, not the end of conservative reform efforts to eliminate wasteful crop subsidies and restore integrity to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” The 2013 Farm Bill reauthorization saves nearly $20 billion, eliminates or consolidates more than 100 duplicative or unnecessary federal programs, ends the indefensible direct payment system to ensure taxpayers are not subsidizing those who do not farm, and limits risk management options to only those times when farmers suffer significant loss. Information on Foxx’s three amendments to the 2013 Federal Agriculture Reform & Risk Management Act and quotes from Foxx on each are below: Spending Safeguard Amendment Foxx on the Spending Safeguard Amendment: “Taxpayers shouldn’t have to pay the difference whenever Congress gets its cost projections wrong, something that has been known to happen on numerous occasions. Under current law, if actual costs for the Farm Risk Management Election Program exceed Congressional Budget Office estimates, taxpayers will have to pay the full bill regardless. My Spending Safeguard Amendment that passed with bipartisan support caps mandatory spending right around CBO projection levels and thus puts a finite number on an otherwise infinite taxpayer liability.” Background and Details: The Foxx Spending Safeguard Amendment will cap spending on the Farm Risk Management Election program at 110% of CBO-predicted levels for the first five (5) years in which payments are disbursed (FY 2016 – 2020). In the event government’s cost projections prove completely wrong, this amendment will ensure taxpayers are not forced to automatically pay the difference between Washington’s mistake and reality. H.R. 2642, the Federal Agriculture Reform and Risk Management (FARRM) Act of 2013, is slated to cost taxpayers $940 billion over 10 years. The bill repeals the indefensible direct payments system, but replaces it with the “Farm Risk Management Election” program. This program alone is predicted to cost $23.37 billion over 10 years, but could cost more…much more. The 2008 Farm Bill cost taxpayers 51% more than its drafters predicted. In the case of the Farm Risk Management Election Program, cost estimates are based on high target prices which exceed historical averages. If these target prices fall and the program’s costs increase beyond projections as a result, taxpayers will be forced to pay the difference. This amendment will: Safeguard taxpayers if this program ends up costing significantly more than advertised; Prevent automatic, unappropriated spending from unexpectedly skyrocketing; and Set a striking new precedent for fiscal responsibility. Sunset Discretionary Programs Amendment Foxx on the Sunset Discretionary Programs Amendment: “President Ronald Reagan once famously commented on the seeming eternal nature of some federal government programs. Farm Bills to date have been rife with indefinitely authorized discretionary programs which don’t have to prove their mettle to continue drawing from the taxpayer dole. That is a travesty, and my Sunset Discretionary Programs Amendment will require the automatic expiration of all discretionary programs in the Farm Bill after five years unless Congress votes specifically to allow a program to continue.” Background and Details: The Sunset Discretionary Programs Amendment will automatically end discretionary programs in the 2013 Farm Bill upon expiration of the bill’s 5-year authorization period. Many programs authorized by the Farm Bill are wasteful, duplicative and ineffective, but are authorized indefinitely. This amendment will require Congress to justify a program’s continued existence and funding through regular reauthorization efforts. As our national debt approaches $17 trillion, Congress simply cannot afford to add to the number of costly federal programs on auto-pilot. This common-sense amendment will: Prevent the covert continuance of wasteful, ineffective, and duplicative programs; Send a strong message to stakeholders, lobbyists and special interests that discretionary federal programs have an expiration date. Prompt Congress and the public to thoughtfully reexamine costly programs when the Farm Bill’s authorization expires; and Require members of Congress to mount a strong defense for the continuation of any expired discretionary program at the end of the Farm Bill’s authorization period. This amendment will NOT: Eliminate or undermine the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP); or Apply to the farm bill’s mandatory spending provisions. Crop Insurance Transparency Amendment Foxx on the Crop Insurance Transparency Amendment: “It shouldn’t take a FOIA request for the American people to figure out whether their leaders are personally benefiting from government farm subsidies. The Crop Insurance Transparency Amendment requires that information disclosing high-powered beneficiaries of taxpayer-funded subsidies be made available to the public without requiring a formal Freedom of Information Act request. Democrats and Republicans should all agree that requiring such transparency is commonsense.” Background and Details: The Crop Insurance Transparency Amendment, cosponsored by Congressman Keith Ellison (D-MN), will require the government to disclose the names of key persons or entities receiving federal crop insurance subsidies. Specifically, disclosure would be required for: Members of Congress and their immediate families; Cabinet Secretaries and their immediate families, and Entities in which any of the preceding parties are majority shareholders. This information is already recorded, but members of the public have to petition the government under the Freedom of Information Act to acquire the data. It shouldn’t take a FOIA request for the American people to figure out whether their leaders are receiving government farm subsidies. This bipartisan amendment makes this information available to the public without a FOIA request. # # #
07.10.2013	Rep. Foxx said, “These regulations are stifling pioneering institutions at a time when forward-thinking solutions are desperately needed. The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act will remove the threat gainful employment, state authorization, and federal credit hour regulations pose to student choice, innovative schools, and an American economy that stands to benefit from responsive higher learning institutions. Republicans and Democrats should toss these bad ideas aside and work together to strengthen higher education for students and taxpayers while maintaining the flexibility and choice that set American colleges and universities apart.” share: f t WASHINGTON, D.C. | July 10, 2013 -Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN), and Rep. Alcee L. Hastings (D-FL) today introduced the Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act (H.R. 2637). Building on bipartisan legislation that passed the House last year, H.R. 2637 will repeal three unnecessary federal regulations that restrict choice and opportunity in higher education: the gainful employment regulation, the state authorization regulation, and the federal credit hour regulation. Rep. Foxx said, “These regulations are stifling pioneering institutions at a time when forward-thinking solutions are desperately needed. The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act will remove the threat gainful employment, state authorization, and federal credit hour regulations pose to student choice, innovative schools, and an American economy that stands to benefit from responsive higher learning institutions. Republicans and Democrats should toss these bad ideas aside and work together to strengthen higher education for students and taxpayers while maintaining the flexibility and choice that set American colleges and universities apart.” “Members on both sides of the aisle have repeatedly expressed concerns these so-called ‘program integrity’ regulations could limit education and job training opportunities for millions of students,” Chairman Kline said. “Even federal courts have weighed in, striking down portions of the state authorization and gainful employment regulations – yet the administration continues to press forward with these ill-conceived regulations. Enough is enough. The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act will eliminate the onerous gainful employment, state authorization, and credit hour regulations once and for all, and prevent the Department of Education from piling more burdensome regulations on higher education institutions.” “We need a highly-skilled workforce capable of competing in a global economy. As I have said many times before, the Department of Education’s suggested approach on gainful employment will disproportionally harm nontraditional and lower-income students. To me, it is misguided and would cut-off the ability of millions of students to afford school and job-training based on a formula of projected future earnings,” said Rep. Hastings. “The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act will take the necessary legislative action to eliminate these burdensome regulations.” The Supporting Academic Freedom through Regulatory Relief Act will: Permanently repeal the gainful employment regulation, which would levy reporting burdens on community colleges and proprietary schools and force administrators to seek federal approval before creating new programs. Permanently repeal the state authorization regulation, which forces states to follow federal requirements when deciding whether to grant an institution – including those offering online education programs – permission to operate within the state. Permanently repeal the credit hour regulation, which establishes a federal definition of a credit hour, providing the government increased control over institutions’ academic affairs. Amend the incentive compensation regulation to ensure third party service providers are allowed to enter into tuition sharing agreements with nonprofit colleges and universities to aid in the development of distance education platforms. Prohibit the Department of Education from issuing additional higher education regulations in several of these areas until after Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act.

Some of the finest men and women I know have served in our armed forces, and their good work must not be tarnished by the recent rise of sexual assault. The problem must be dealt with now. I praise Representative Jackie Walorski for introducing this legislation. Ensuring all military personnel are able to report crimes without fear of reprisal is critical to stopping future assaults.” share: f t Washington, D.C. – The House of Representatives today passed legislation cosponsored by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) designed to prevent any retaliation against military personnel who report rape or sexual assault within their ranks. Foxx issued the following statement on H.R. 1864: “Fear or professional intimidation should never come between a victim and the justice they deserve,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “Increases in sexual assault within our military cannot be tolerated. Some of the finest men and women I know have served in our armed forces, and their good work must not be tarnished by the recent rise of sexual assault. The problem must be dealt with now. I praise Representative Jackie Walorski for introducing this legislation. Ensuring all military personnel are able to report crimes without fear of reprisal is critical to stopping future assaults.” The legislation Foxx cosponsored expands the duties of Defense Department inspector general to include examining whether reports of sexual assault, misconduct or rape within the military have led to retaliation against reporters or alleged victims. Currently, the inspector general is only responsible for investigating whether sexual harassment allegations have led to retaliation. In addition to the legislation passed today, the FY 2014 National Defense Authorization Act Foxx voted for earlier this month included many provisions designed to more effectively combat instances of sexual assault within the military. # # #

If Congress chooses to reconsider the VRA coverage formula - that is used to determine which states are subject to ‘pre-clearance’ from the DOJ - I hope it will also consider the entirety of Section 5 and whether in 2013 the law ought to still compel select states to receive federal approval for each and every one of their proposed federal election policies.” # # #

06.05.2013	Last week, Foxx invited Shelby and her family to her office in Clemmons to present her with the medal, which was established in 1979 and is open to those 14 to 23 years old. share: f t Lewisville student awarded Congressional Silver Medal Lisa O'Donnell/Winston-Salem Journal CLEMMONS — Shelby Birkedal had a simple reason for pursuing the Congressional Silver Medal. “I know the purpose is to develop a well-rounded individual,” Shelby said. “I was hoping through this I might become that.” At least one very important person thinks she succeeded: U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx. Last week, Foxx invited Shelby and her family to her office in Clemmons to present her with the medal, which was established in 1979 and is open to those 14 to 23 years old. “Having positive occasions like this and to be able to acknowledge Shelby and the work she has done in getting the congressional award is really exciting to me,” Foxx said. Earning the medal requires fulfilling a rigorous set of criteria. For Shelby, a home-schooled Lewisville resident, earning a silver medal involved 200 hours of volunteering, a requirement she fulfilled by mentoring underprivileged kids in Winston-Salem; 100 hours of physical fitness, which she met through dancing at a local studio; and 30 hours of personal development, which involved taking a leadership class. She also studied historical sites in South Carolina as part of a requirement to take an expedition. “It was definitely challenging,” she said. Shelby will attend Wake Forest University in the fall where she plans to major in health and exercise science. She attended the ceremony with her brother, Ryan; her parents, Mary Lynn and John; and grandparents Mary Ellen and Mick Marlowe, also of Lewisville.

Shelby will take the lessons she learned through this program with her to Wake Forest in the fall, and if her experience is any indication for future participants, young people will discover the most rewarding part of the Congressional Award program to be found in acts of service to others.” “I heard about the program through a friend and liked its concept of developing well-rounded individuals as well as encouraging community service,” Shelby Birkedal said. “I hoped that in pursuing this goal I would grow into a more well-rounded student, but I never realized how much I would truly enjoy the community service aspect. It was a wonderful experience and I look forward to continuing to help my community.” Congresswoman Foxx and the Birkedal Family: John, Mary Lynn, Shelby, and Ryan. About Miss Shelby Birkedal:Shelby Birkedal just completed her senior year as a Tuscany Academy home school student in Lewisville, NC. She is headed to Wake Forest University in the fall. In earning her Congressional Award Silver Medal, Shelby dedicated more than 200 hours to tutoring, mentoring and teaching life skills to underprivileged children. She worked to improve her leadership skills by enrolling in a weekly leadership course focusing on the role of character and integrity in leadership. Shelby devoted in excess of 100 hours to dance classes where she improved her consecutive pirouettes from two to three. For her expedition, Shelby studied historic locations and planned a trip to South Carolina to see those places firsthand. About the Congressional Award:The Congressional Award is the United States Congress' award for young Americans. The non-partisan Congressional Award Program is all about challenge.

05.27.2013	America is home to heroes! In our country men and women choose to serve, knowing full well their sacrifice could be tremendous – and even require their life. But still they volunteer. share: f t “Let me not mourn for the men who have died fighting, but rather let me be glad such heroes have lived.” – U.S. Army General George Patton That excerpt from a prayer written by General Patton speaks directly to the challenge of Memorial Day. It is a day seemingly anchored in loss, losses many military families in our region have experienced personally. But it is also a day of celebration. America is home to heroes! In our country men and women choose to serve, knowing full well their sacrifice could be tremendous – and even require their life. But still they volunteer. They do so because America – her ideals, her people and her way of life – is worth defending. They volunteer because they love this country. Among our military the scripture “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends,” has special significance. Our troops do not risk for their own sake, they do so for others – for their comrades, for their families and even for strangers – whom they just know as fellow citizens. The final Monday in May is set aside yearly for our nation to commemorate each Airman, Soldier, Sailor, Coastguardsman and Marine who paid freedom’s ultimate price with their lives. Whether you pay your respects at Arlington or Salisbury National Cemetery, at wreath laying ceremonies, community parades or private family events, I encourage you to reflect on the fact that we enjoy freedom because our protectors endured sacrifice. And while they lay revered in rest at hallowed sites throughout our country, many of their loved ones are with us still and deserve our thanks this day. Liberty is bought and paid for by the incomprehensible generosity of patriots. May we endeavor to live worthy of their legacy and guard, vigilantly, the history and stories of our fallen. Thank you and God Bless, Virginia Foxx Member of Congress

Foxx, who chairs the House of Representatives Subcommittee on Higher Education, cosponsored the measure with Education Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN): “Campaign promises and political posturing should not play a role in the calculation of student loan interest rates. As we’ve seen, Washington’s involvement in the rate-setting equation is a recipe for uncertainty and confusion. Borrowers deserve better. The Smarter Solution for Students Act puts an end to the temporary fixes that have failed to strengthen our nation’s student loan system and offers simplicity, rate caps and an assurance that interest rates are immediately in line with the free market – a need particularly acute in this jobless economy. “If President Obama and Senate Democrats are serious about a long-term solution to the student loan interest rate problem, they will immediately consider and build on the ideas put forth in the Smarter Solutions for Students Act . Students, families and taxpayers deserve certainty, not more can-kicking from Washington.” The Smarter Solutions for Students Act returns student loan interest rates to a market-based system in order to strengthen federal student loan programs and better serve borrowers and taxpayers. Under H.R. 1911, and like President Obama’s proposal, interest rates on subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans will be calculated using a formula based on government’s borrowing rate, the 10-year Treasury Note. In 2007, the Democrat-led Congress passed legislation that temporarily lowered interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans made to undergraduate students from 6.8% to 3.4% over four years. The lower interest rate was extended for a year in anticipation of the July 1, 2012 expiration. However, rates for new subsidized Stafford Loans are scheduled to double on July 1, 2013, to 6.8% unless a long-term solution is enacted. The Smarter Solutions for Students Act is that long-term solution. H.R. 1911 provides long-term predictability for students and borrowers by ending the cycle of short-term fixes and looming deadlines in Congress. The Washington Post in its editorial “Reforming Student Loans is Off to a Good Start” said of a long-term, market-based solution, “there’s no reason to delay passing such a policy.” Congresswoman Foxx and Chairman Kline wrote an editorial in today’s Washington Times entitled, “Getting politics out of student loans.” Excerpts are below: “By tying rates to the market, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act sets a predictable formula for interest-rate calculations, insulated from the politics and posturing of Washington. Additionally, we protect students from high interest-rate environments by imposing a fair and reasonable cap.” “It will put an end to the quick fixes and campaign promises that have failed to strengthen our nation's student-loan system. Our proposal offers predictability, simplicity and the flexibility to take advantage of low interest rates whenever possible. In fact, should this legislation be enacted this summer, most student-loan borrowers will see their interest rates drop as much as 2 percentage points. It's a win for students and a win for taxpayers.” “Students deserve a long-term solution that gets Washington out of the business of setting student-loan interest rates. Fortunately, President Obama agrees. In his budget for the next fiscal year, the president offered a plan to tie rates to the free market.” Video/Audio Congresswoman Foxx led part of the floor debate in the House of Representatives in favor of the Smarter Solutions for Students Act.

05.22.2013	The Keystone Pipeline and the 40,000 jobs it's expected to create have been waiting for President Obama's approval for the better part of five years, and with no good reason. The Northern Route Approval Act will ensure that those senseless delays share: f t FOXX: There is a Reason Democrats, Republicans & Organized Labor Support Keystone *Video/Audio Linked* Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today issued the following statement upon voting for the immediate construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline through H.R. 3, the Northern Route Approval Act. Foxx is a cosponsor of the measure: “The Keystone Pipeline and the 40,000 jobs it’s expected to create have been waiting for President Obama’s approval for the better part of five years, and with no good reason. The Northern Route Approval Act will ensure that those senseless delays end immediately. Americans need these jobs. “The American people have coalesced behind the Keystone XL Pipeline because it will spur job creation, help us on our way to energy independence and increase access to affordable North American oil. There is a reason Democrats, Republicans and organized labor are counted among its supporters.” President Obama and his State Department have delayed and blocked the Keystone XL Pipeline proposal since its first application was filed nearly five years ago. Keystone XL is the most studied pipeline in our nation’s history with over 15,500 pages of review having been issued by the State Department showing it is safe and in the national interest. Similar pipeline projects requiring a Presidential Permit usually take 18 to 24 months to review and approve. H.R. 3 will end the Obama Administration’s delays by removing the need for the Keystone XL Pipeline to receive a Presidential Permit. Additionally, this legislation satisfies all National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements, and streamlines the review and approval process for all other necessary federal permits. H.R. 3 is bipartisan bill with over 130 cosponsors. It received bipartisan support in all three committees of jurisdiction during the markup process. Video Congresswoman Foxx spoke in favor of the immediate construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline on the floor of the House of Representatives this week. Video of her remarks are linked below: Let’s Build Keystone TODAY “Job killers win, American workers lose," is how the Laborers International Union of North America, a rare critic of the Administration, summed up the President's call to block the Keystone XL Pipeline.” Why is the President Rejecting Jobs? “American families expect government to pursue the least expensive, most reliable domestic energy. Jobless Americans expect that their President won't stand in the way of economic relief. But on both fronts President Obama's choice to cede to environmental special interests and block the Keystone pipeline did the opposite” Who Would Stand in the Way of Jobs? “The President continues to play favorites in the energy sector and block domestic energy with onerous regulations. Red tape only makes it harder to capitalize on economic growth opportunities and harder to achieve energy independence. If the President were just to sign-off on the Keystone XL Pipeline today, he'd open up thousands of American jobs.” # # # For more information, please visit Congresswoman Foxx’s website www.foxx.house.govor call (202) 225-2071.

05.22.2013	Why the Obama Administration would threaten to veto legislation that so closely mirrors their own student loan proposal suggests President Obama isn't serious about working toward a long-term solution for students and taxpayers after all. share: f t Higher Education Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement in response to the Obama Administration's threat to veto the Smarter Solutions for Students Act (H.R. 1911) which Foxx sponsored with House Education Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN): "Why the Obama Administration would threaten to veto legislation that so closely mirrors their own student loan proposal suggests President Obama isn’t serious about working toward a long-term solution for students and taxpayers after all. "Like President Obama’s own proposal, the Smarter Solutions for Students Act removes Washington politicians from the rate-setting equation and anchors rates to the free market. Like President Obama’s proposal, it prevents rates from doubling on July 1. And beyond President Obama’s proposal, it includes sensible rate caps and the opportunity for borrowers who choose to consolidate their loans to take advantage of low rates after they’ve graduated. "All those similarities certainly shouldn’t be grounds for a veto. If President Obama chooses to ignore our common ground and cow to partisan pressure to kick the student loan can down the road, he will do students, families and taxpayers a real disservice. # # #
05.16.2013	ObamaCare hinges on twenty-one tax increases, many of which hit the middle class, and goes so far as to empower the IRS as its primary enforcer. That is a problem. share: f t FOXX: ObamaCare Breaks Promises, Empowers IRS. That’s A Problem. *Video/Audio Linked* Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today issued the following statement upon voting to fully repeal ObamaCare: “ObamaCare’s proponents promised it would lower health care costs, expand insurance coverage, and certainly not raise taxes. But even prior to its full implementation, President Obama’s health care overhaul has proved a hindrance, not a help, to health care access and economic recovery. ObamaCare hinges on twenty-one tax increases, many of which hit the middle class, and goes so far as to empower the IRS as its primary enforcer. That is a problem. “Family health care premiums are more expensive today than they were in 2008 and those costs are set to rise further. Republicans in the House of Representatives will not stand by and let this train wreck happen, nor tolerate the defense of such epic failure. In previous repeal efforts we have been successful in eliminating or defunding seven of ObamaCare’s troubling provisions and we will not rest until the remainder of this legislation is wiped from public law. “Improving the cost and quality of health care is among our country’s greatest challenges, and it is one that must be met by Congress, the states, and the American people working together. If we are serious about affordable care, removing barriers to job creation, and sparing North Carolinians the weight of massive new taxes, ObamaCare must go.” Video Twice this week Congresswoman Foxx spoke to members of the House of Representatives advocating the full repeal of ObamaCare. Video of her remarks are below: Big Government Begets Scandals? This is My Shocked Face. “These scandals are byproducts of a government too big for its britches, and proof that the IRS should not be given more power to manage our health care.” Repeal the Not-So-Affordable Care Act “More than 30 studies have found ObamaCare will make health care premiums less affordable by the time it's fully implemented. Promises for affordable care have delivered a train wreck to the American people.” Why Repeal ObamaCare? Here are 37 Reasons Courtesy of the House Committee on Ways & Means Individuals and Families Will Pay More for Health Care Secretary Sebelius admitted premiums will increase for Americans. The American Society of Actuaries estimates a 32 percent increase in the cost of covering people in the individual market as a result of ObamaCare. The New York Times recently reported some states are seeing health insurance premium hikes up to double digits. “Maryland health insurers … said they will need to charge more for health insurance to compensate for new risk and additional requirements under the federal Affordable Care Act. CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, for example, has proposed a 25 percent rate increase to many of its plans in the individual and small group markets. In the company’s filing, CareFirst — the region’s largest insurer — attributes the increase largely to new rules under the Affordable Care Act.” A report by the House Energy and Commerce Committee reveals “consumers purchasing health insurance on the individual market may face premium increases of nearly 100 percent on average, with potential highs eclipsing 400 percent.” The same report shows “small businesses can expect average premium increases in the small group market of up to 50 percent, with potential highs over 100 percent.” Insurers agree. According to one industry executive, “We're going to see some markets go up by as much as 100%.” (Mark Bertolini, CEO, Aetna) “We estimate that almost 80 percent of those ages 21 to 29 with incomes greater than 138 percent of FPL [Federal Poverty Level] who are enrolled in nongroup single coverage can expect to pay more out of pocket for coverage than they pay today – even after accounting for premium assistance.” (Oliver Wyman consultants) Beginning in 2014, Americans buying coverage on their own or as an employee of a small business – whether inside or outside the Exchange – will be forced to pay a “user fee” totaling 3.5 percent of the monthly premium to fund the bureaucratic operations of the government-run federal Exchange. ObamaCare Threatens Job Creation, Wages, and HoursAccording to a recent report/survey, 70 percent of small businesses cite ObamaCare as a major obstacle to job creation. USA Today and the Wall Street Journal have reported that many businesses plan to bring on more part-time workers next year, trim the hours of full-time employees or curtail hiring because of the new health care law. According to a study by the Hudson Institute, in the franchise industry alone, ObamaCare’s employer mandate puts up to 3.2 million jobs at risk. The Federal Reserve recently warned, “Employers in several [Federal Reserve] Districts cited the unknown effects of the Affordable Care Act as reasons for planned layoffs and reluctance to hire more staff.” According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the amount of workers in the labor force will be reduced by 800,000 in 2021 as a result of the Democrats’ health care law. Regal Cinemas, the largest theatre circuit in the United States, announced they would be cutting the hours of thousands of employees as a result of ObamaCare. The Wall Street Journal reported, “Several restaurants, hotels and retailers have started or are preparing to limit schedules of hourly workers to below 30 hours a week…. CKE Restaurants Inc., parent of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's burger chains, began two months ago to hire part-time workers to replace full-time employees who left…. Home retailer Anna's Linens Inc., is considering cutting hours for some full-time employees to avoid the insurance mandate if the health-care law isn't repealed....” From the New York Times: “There is another reason to believe that part-time employment will stay higher for longer, namely the incentives to employ part-time workers created by Obama’s health care reforms.” (Paul Dales, senior United States economist for Capital Economics) The ADP payroll survey shows U.S. companies added just 119,000 jobs in April, the fewest in seven months. According to AP, “New requirements under President Barack Obama's health care law may be prompting some small and mid-size companies to hold back on hiring.” In April, the city of Dearborn, Michigan announced it will cut hours of part-time and seasonal workers because of ObamaCare. Citing added costs and the competitive disadvantage ObamaCare puts larger companies at, The United Union of Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers has withdrawn its public support for ObamaCare and now favors its repeal. “To date, employers are still missing key pieces of guidance needed to construct their systems, make plan design changes and communicate with their employees…the delay in issuing the regulations pertaining to the notice and reporting requirements is becoming increasingly untenable for employers.” (Employers for Flexibility in Health Care Coalition Comment letter to the Treasury Department, March 15, 2013) You Can’t Keep the Health Plan You Have and Like The State of Washington is considering a plan that “threatens to affect the federal budget and the pocketbooks of some part-time workers, as it would push a group of employees out of their current health care plans and into an exchange developed under the Affordable Care Act.” Based on two separate analyses provided by CBO and Deloitte, as many as 20 million to 65 million Americans might lose their employer-sponsored health insurance as a result of the Democrats’ health care law. Secretary Sebelius has admitted up to 24 million Americans will lose the coverage they currently have and like. The Wall Street Journal reported that annual premium increases and costs associated with the law, including a $65 per person coverage fee set to take effect beginning in 2014, are driving, and will continue to drive, up the cost of care and make it prohibitive to continue offering health coverage. A result of such cost pressures is that employers are being forced to discontinue the offering of spousal coverage in employer health plans. ObamaCare contains $308 billion in cuts to the Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which the Medicare Trustees originally predicted could cut enrollment in MA in half by 2017. Approximately nine-in-ten seniors with retiree benefits will lose their retiree prescription drug coverage through their employer under the Democrats’ health care law. ObamaCare Is a Burden on American Families and Employers Estimates from CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) confirm that the Democrats’ health law is a one trillion dollar tax hike on families and employers. The law contains 21 tax hikes, and more than half of those fall on the backs of Americans earning less than $200,000 per year for singles and $250,000 per year for married couples – a clear violation of the President’s pledge to avoid tax hikes on low- and middle-income taxpayers. According to the Obama Administration’s own estimates, ObamaCare will require American job creators, families, and health care providers to spend over 190 million hours per year on compliance. The employer mandate penalty raises significantly the cost of hiring lower-skill workers, because the penalty is a higher proportion of their compensation than for high-skill workers. Industries that have traditionally offered the greatest opportunities to entry-level workers – leisure and hospitality and restaurants – will be particularly hard-hit by the new law. ObamaCare Is a Train Wreck At a time when the IRS’s credibility is in serious question, the Obama Administration says it needs to hire an additional 2,000 IRS agents to implement functions related to ObamaCare. Henry Chao, a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services official, oversees the technology for the Exchanges and has downgraded his expectations for ObamaCare saying he just wants to “make sure it’s not a third-world experience.” Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-MT) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) both warned ObamaCare could become a “huge train wreck.” A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that just 35 percent of Americans view ObamaCare “very” or “somewhat” favorably. The same poll showed that more than half of Americans “say they do not have enough information about the Affordable Care Act to understand how it will affect them.” It Didn’t Have to be This Way The House GOP alternative to the Democrats’ health care law was the only legislation that met the top health care priority of American families – lowering the cost of health insurance premiums. # # #
05.13.2013	We should all ponder that while multiple murder charges against Kermit Gosnell were up for debate, no one ever questioned whether Gosnell's intent was to kill each of his infant victims. Of course their death was his intent – such is the case wi share: f t FOXX: Gosnell Verdict Delivers Some Justice for Victims Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon the issuance of a verdict convicting Philadelphia-based late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell on three counts of first degree murder and one count of manslaughter among more than two-hundred other charges: “Every life has value and for every life ended at the hands of Kermit Gosnell, a butcher who masqueraded as a ‘women’s’ health care professional,’ there should be justice. Today’s verdict, while limited in its scope, delivers some justice for each of Gosnell’s victims – every woman who trusted him in their vulnerability and every child whose life was callously and brutally ended at his direction. “We should all ponder that while multiple murder charges against Kermit Gosnell were up for debate, no one ever questioned whether Gosnell’s intent was to kill each of his infant victims. Of course their death was his intent – such is the case with all abortions. But in our justice system premeditating and exacting the demise of babies is only a crime if a child is fully outside the womb. We would do well as a society to consider what deciding murder based upon geographic technicalities reveals about our collective conscious. “As long as the tragedy of elective abortion is legal in this country, there must be oversight, and there must be rigorous scrutiny – regardless of whether popular culture, special interests, or government considers the turf politically sacrosanct. In Philadelphia, evil dressed in a white coat went unchecked for years and women and children paid the price for that abdication.” # # #

TheSmarter Solutions for Students Act (H.R. 1911) would take politicians out of the business of calculating student loan interest rates by moving all federal student loans (except Perkins Loans) to a new interest rate formula based on the 10-year Treasury Note, similar to a proposal put forth in President Obama’s Fiscal Year 2014 budget plan. "As I’ve said time and again, we’ve got to stop kicking the can down the road with short-term fixes to this interest rate problem,” Chairman Kline said. "The Smarter Solutions for Students Act is a lasting solution that will serve the best interests of students and taxpayers. Our proposal ensures millions of subsidized Stafford Loan borrowers will not see their interest rates double this July, and other borrowers will actually have their rates reduced. I hope my colleagues in the House and Senate will join us in supporting this responsible bill, and look forward to continuing to work with the administration as we move this proposal through the legislative process." "Students need more certainty and less confusion about their federal loan interest rates," said Rep. Foxx. "Republicans have been working to provide stability for a long time and it appears from the President’s budget proposal that he also sees the need to remove the whims of Washington from the student loan equation. We hope to build off that common ground through the Smarter Solutions for Students Act and work with Congressional Democrats to return to a simplified, market-based plan before July 1 that works for students, families, and taxpayers." The Smarter Solutions for Students Act: Calculates subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans using a formula based on the 10-year Treasury Note plus 2.5 percent. Calculates graduate and parent PLUS loans using a formula based on the 10-year Treasury Note plus 4.5 percent. Resets student loan interest rates once a year, allowing rates to move with the free market and ensuring borrowers can take advantage of lower interest rates when available. Protects borrowers in high interest rate environments by including a 8.5 percent cap on Stafford Loan interest rates and a 10.5 percent cap on PLUS loans. Provides stability for low- and middle-income students working to finance their postsecondary education, and prevents future uncertainty about whether Congress is going to act in time to change the interest rate.

It is the President's responsibility always to make good on our country's debt payments, and today the House of Representatives esta share: f t FOXX: Full Faith & Credit Act Removes Default Threat for Good Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon the passage of the Full Faith & Credit Act (H.R. 807), which Foxx cosponsored, from the House of Representatives: “Washington has a spending problem. Every time the federal government approaches its debt limit, like clockwork, big spending politicians – from the White House down – begin threatening ‘default’ unless the government is able to continue with its spending binge. Such gamesmanship is a disservice to everyone. “The United States’ credit rating should not hang in the balance every time Washington has a debt limit debate. It is the President’s responsibility always to make good on our country’s debt payments, and today the House of Representatives established that for good by passing the Full Faith & Credit Act. It’s high time Congress moved beyond the scare tactic of ‘default.’” The Full Faith & Credit Act requires that the U.S. Treasury always make debt payments to the public and Social Security Trust Fund, even when the federal government’s debt limit is reached. By taking the threat of default off the table, the United States’ credit rating will be protected, which is essential for economic growth, and seniors will have certainty regarding Social Security. The Congressional Budget Office affirms this legislation will not affect federal spending or revenues and contains no unfunded mandates. # # #

The SKILLS Act, authored by Foxx, was passed by the House of Representatives on March 15 and referred to the Senate for consideration on March 18. Congresswoman Foxx takes a question from a New Jersey site manager. |Congresswoman Foxx describes the maze of workforce education programs today’s job seekers encounter. Excerpts from Foxx’s comments: “Employers from across the country – including many in this room – are experiencing the frustration of having open jobs, but not enough skilled workers to fill them. The federal government is spending too much money - $18 billion each year – on workforce development programs that aren’t helping to connect millions of jobless Americans with the skills and experience they need to compete for good, high-paying jobs.” “The SKILLS Act is built on the understanding that local employers, community colleges, and workforce boards know more than ‘the suits’ in Washington about what job seekers need to succeed at finding work within their respective states. They should help guide any workforce investments.” “The purpose behind the SKILLS Act – and behind the federal government’s involvement in the first place – is to connect job seekers with jobs. Washington isn’t doing that very well. And it will continue to fail if we don’t bring in people with practical experience to help us get it right.” The SKILLS Act will streamline 35 duplicative federally run workforce development programs – as highlighted by a 2011 GAO report – and create one Workforce Investment Fund. Additionally, the SKILLS Act will: Require a report on administrative costs and savings due to program streamlining; Provide more flexibility to states by removing 19 mandates that currently dictate Workforce Investment Board membership; Strengthen the role of state and local officials and job creators, allowing them to tailor programs to best fit their area’s needs and job opportunities; Facilitate greater collaboration with community colleges by allowing states to determine the standards required for eligible training providers; Reform Job Corps to ensure that career and technical education is geared toward in-demand jobs; Increase focus on the delivery of basic literacy and math skills; and Help individuals with disabilities transition into employment.

05.08.2013	It's hard to raise a family and earn a living at the same time. Every hour you spend working to provide for your family is an hour you can't spend with your family. And when life happens – in the form of school plays, little league games, or share: f t FOXX: Working Families Flexibility Act Empowers Americans, Respects Work/Life Balance Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon the passage of the Working Families Flexibility Act (H.R. 1406), which Foxx cosponsored, from the House of Representatives: “The Working Families Flexibility Act will ensure every working parent and grandparent is able to benefit from the flexibility of choices in how they receive overtime compensation. Today private sector employees are only offered cash wages as overtime payment, while government employees get to choose between cash and comp time. This legislation ends the double standard. “It's hard to raise a family and earn a living at the same time. Every hour you spend working to provide for your family is an hour you can't spend with your family. And when life happens – in the form of school plays, little league games, or family members becoming sick – time and flexibility are exactly what working parents and grandparents need. And because of this legislation, they’ll be able to choose both. “There is no good reason why a 1930s era federal law prohibits private sector workers from exercising the same choices available already to government workers. For the sake of every worker and family, I am pleased to see this legislation restore common sense and hope the Senate acts quickly toward its passage.” The Working Families Flexibility Act will allow non-salaried private sector employees to have the same overtime compensation options that have been available to government employees for the better part of thirty years. Foxx twice addressed the House of Representatives in support of the Working Families Flexibility Act and introduced the rule (H.Res. 198) whereby the Working Families Flexibility Act was brought to the House floor for consideration. Footage of Foxx’s floor statements are below: Working Families Flexibility Act Protects #YourTime Working Families Flexibility Act Protects Work-Life Balance Just the Basics: The Working Families Flexibility Act Courtesy of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce THE PROBLEM: For many Americans, balancing the demands of family and the workplace can be difficult. State and local government employees have long been able to choose paid time off as compensation for working overtime hours, allowing these public-sector employees greater flexibility to meet family obligations. However, the federal government prohibits private-sector workers from enjoying this same benefit. An outdated federal law has become an impediment to employers who want to help employees manage work and family responsibilities. THE SOLUTION: To remove this obstacle in federal law, Representative Martha Roby (R-AL) introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act of 2013. The legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to allow employers to offer private-sector employees the choice of paid time off in lieu of cash wages for overtime hours worked. It is pro-family, pro-worker legislation that gives workers the flexibility to spend time with family, attend teacher conferences, care for aging parents, stay home with a newborn, or attend to other family needs that may arise. H.R. 1406 - THE WORKING FAMILIES FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 2013: Allows employers to offer employees a choice between cash wages and comp time for overtime hours worked. Employees who want to receive cash wages would continue to do so. No employee can be forced to take comp time instead of receiving overtime pay. Protects employees by requiring the employer and the employee to complete a written agreement to use comp time, entered into knowingly and voluntarily by the employee. Where the employee is represented by a union, the agreement to take comp time must be part of the collective bargaining agreement negotiated between the union and the employer. Retains all existing employee protections in current law, including the 40 hour work week and how overtime compensation is accrued. The bill adds additional safeguards for workers to ensure the choice and use of comp time are truly voluntary. Allows employees to accrue up to 160 hours of comp time each year. An employer would be required to pay cash wages for any unused time at the end of the year. Workers are free to ‘cash out’ their accrued comp time whenever they choose to do so. The Working Families Flexibility Act is commonsense legislation that will help American workers better balance the needs of family and the workplace. # # #

Make no mistake, furloughs and delays, much like White House closures, were the administrati share: f t HOUSE VOTES TO BLOCK #ObamaFlightDelays Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon the passage of legislation from the House of Representatives to spare the American people from flight delays caused by the President’s irresponsible management of sequester savings within the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA): “President Obama caused turbulence in airports across the country this week when commercial air traffic was slowed by unnecessary FAA traffic controller furloughs. Make no mistake, furloughs and delays, much like White House closures, were the administration’s choice after it refused to come up with a strategy to implement sequester savings with the least possible harm. “The President may have abdicated leadership, but the House and Senate decided to clean up the mess. Our solution, which the President and FAA could have employed all along, directs the agency to find savings in other areas in its budget to replace furloughs and their resulting flight delays. “Rather than inflicting pain on the American people, President Obama and his FAA should have made the required 4% budget cut by targeting waste. Within the FAA’s budget, there are $2.7 billion in non-personnel costs that should have been scrutinized and seriously trimmed before the President or his Transportation Secretary ever cried ‘doomsday’ or ‘delay.’ “The President’s FAA officials have always had the discretion to reduce such excess and apply savings where it matters. It is a shame they chose to play political games at the expense of the American public instead of implementing these modest cuts responsibly.” The legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support, directs the FAA to transfer funds within its budget to replace the savings enacted by furloughing critical employees. Since 1996, the FAA’s operating budget has increased nearly 110%. However, since 2000, domestic flights have decreased 27%. Sequester savings of 4% returns the agency roughly to its 2010 spending level. Congresswoman Foxx voted twice to replace the sequester in its entirety, but both pieces of legislation were ignored by the Democrat Senate. This week she spoke on the House Floor urging the President and FAA to choose to enact savings from a plethora of non-personnel expenditures within the agency. Footage of her remarks is below.

The people and foreign governments behind these attacks attempt to steal personal information, poach intellectual property, damage critical infrastruc share: f t Foxx Statement on Passage of Cyber Intelligence Sharing & Protection Act Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement upon voting in favor of H.R. 624, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing & Protection Act (CISPA): “The United States government and American businesses are targeted by malicious cyber attacks every day. The people and foreign governments behind these attacks attempt to steal personal information, poach intellectual property, damage critical infrastructure, and disrupt commerce – each of which could be devastating to national and economic security. To build better defenses it would help if our government and private enterprises had the option to communicate with each other about current attacks and threats coming on the horizon. Right now, they can’t. The law prohibits them from doing so, leaving each to fend for themselves. The Cyber Intelligence Sharing & Protection Act will open channels of communication so government and businesses can work together, if they choose, to ward off cyber threats.” H.R. 624 will improve internet security by allowing federal intelligence personnel and private-sector companies to communicate with each other about cyber threats.

04.16.2013	"State governments and local citizens have invaluable perspective to offer when it comes to designating National Monuments in their backyards. Their voice needs to be included in the decision-making process," Congresswoman Foxx said. "The Preserve Land Fr share: f t Foxx’s Preserve Land Freedom for Americans Act Presented to House Natural Resources Committee Legislation will Ensure States & Public Have a Voice in How Federal Lands are Designated in their Backyards Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today spoke in defense of states’ rights and local interests as she testified on her legislation, the Preserve Land Freedom for Americans Act (H.R. 382) before the House Committee on Natural Resources. H.R. 382 will protect against unilateral presidential land grabs by requiring state input and approval as part of the process whereby federal lands become re-designated as National Monuments. “State governments and local citizens have invaluable perspective to offer when it comes to designating National Monuments in their backyards. Their voice needs to be included in the decision-making process,” Congresswoman Foxx said. “The Preserve Land Freedom for Americans Act recognizes that more voices will lead to a more accountable, transparent system for establishing National Monuments. By involving states and members of the public in the process, the federal government will make impactful land-use decisions and designations cooperatively and with appropriate levels of input.” Under the Antiquities Act of 1906 the President of the United States is able to unilaterally designate federal lands as National Monuments and restrict land usage in those areas. Public input and consultation with states and localities is not required to make these designations, which can jeopardize economic development, job creation, and state and property rights. Foxx’s legislation will require approval by the governors and legislatures of states whose borders contain all or portions of land proposed for National Monument designation. H.R. 382 will also require state approval and a public review period prior to the implementation of any restrictions on the public use of a National Monument. This provision will allow citizens in affected areas whose livelihoods may be impacted by changes in authorized land use to voice their concerns and ensure the federal government and state government consider all appropriate information before making new monument designations.

04.11.2013	If Congress refuses to approve [Foxx's] modest reform it might as well take a roll-call vote on a resolution stating: "The public has no business knowing the costs of the regulations that we impose on them." share: f t ICYMI: Foxx’s Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act “Has a Chance” Bipartisan Legislation, H.R. 899, Touted in Investor’s Business Daily Congresswoman Virginia Foxx’s Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act, H.R. 899, was featured in today’s Investor’s Business Daily. The bipartisan legislation, cosponsored by Representatives Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike McIntyre (D-NC), and Collin Peterson (D-MN) has been referred to the House Committees on Oversight & Government Reform, Rules, and the Judiciary. Excerpts: “That's why a proposal from Rep. Virginia Foxx. R-N.C., is a breath of fresh air. “[Foxx] has just re-introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act to improve UMRA. It would require all agencies, not just some of them, to conduct UMRA analysis. And it would require these for all new final rules, not just some.” “Foxx's proposed reform would not curtail Congress' power to regulate; it only requires increased disclosure as to how that power is exercised.” “If Congress refuses to approve this modest reform it might as well take a roll-call vote on a resolution stating: ‘The public has no business knowing the costs of the regulations that we impose on them.’” Even After Cuts, Regulation Pushes Up Cost Of Government By WAYNE CREWS AND RYAN YOUNG With sequestration dominating the headlines, hyperventilating pundits on both sides are missing an important point: No matter how deep sequestration cuts go — keeping in mind that most "cuts" are really just smaller increases — the cost of government can still grow without limit. Congress can simply move the costs of federal regulations and spending programs off the federal budget and onto the private sector and state and local governments through unfunded mandates. For example, instead of funding a new federal job training program from federal coffers, Congress could mandate that all firms above a certain size provide such training at their own expense. The first option appears on the federal budget; the second does not. For politicians, it's the perfect scheme. The government can spend — or, rather, force others to spend — as much as it wants without adding to the deficit. And in these times of annual trillion-dollar deficits, the temptation to take that route is greater than ever. Revolts That Don't Last Unfunded mandates have severe economic consequences. Agencies spend roughly $61 billion per year to enforce regulations, but complying with those regulations costs private parties about 30 times that, around $1.8 trillion. Unfortunately, few people outside of Washington appreciate the stealth of off-budget spending through mandates. There is the occasional uprising of governors and other state and local officials. But the power of the purse is strong, and Congress can always threaten to cut grant money for state programs, so the rebellions tend not to last. This needs to change. Mandates that impose costs on businesses and consumers should not slip through the regulatory process without public scrutiny. As a matter of basic transparency, agencies and Congress should have to tally up their mandates' direct and indirect costs — which can include job losses and jobs not being created in the first place. Furthermore, mandates mount quickly as a small firm grows. Mandatory compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act kicks in at 15 employees, the Health Maintenance Organization Act at 25, the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) at 50, and so on. Incentivizing firms to stay at 49 employees and hire temps to stay under the FMLA threshold is hardly a recipe for job growth. Congress sought to address this problem by passing the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) in 1995, but it hasn't done much good, as last year's 3,714 new rules can attest. That's partly because UMRA only applies to cabinet-level agencies, which account for only 17 out of roughly 60 federal rulemaking agencies. It also lacks teeth; it only requires disclosure that a rule contains unfunded mandates, as opposed to action. Law Has A Chance That's why a proposal from Rep. Virginia Foxx. R-N.C., is a breath of fresh air. She has just re-introduced the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act to improve UMRA. It would require all agencies, not just some of them, to conduct UMRA analysis. And it would require these for all new final rules, not just some. Foxx's proposed reform would not curtail Congress' power to regulate; it only requires increased disclosure as to how that power is exercised. Congress would still be free to pass any unfunded mandate it pleases, as long as it accounts for the costs involved. The Foxx bill would help to curb Washington's unfunded mandate problem, but its increased transparency is only a first step. As the deficit and federal spending — and public anger about them — grow, unfunded mandate reform may just have a chance. If Congress refuses to approve this modest reform it might as well take a roll-call vote on a resolution stating: "The public has no business knowing the costs of the regulations that we impose on them." # # #
04.10.2013	"For more than two months, the American people have been waiting for the President to get off the sidelines and join the conversation about putting Washington on a budget. Today, he issued a budget proposal that irresponsibly ignores our growing debt and share: f t Foxx Statement on President Obama’s Tax and Spend Budget Proposal On Tax Freedom Day, President Obama Offers Budget with $1.1 Trillion in New Taxes Congresswoman Virginia Foxx(R, NC-5) issued the following statement in response to the release of President’ Obama’s Fiscal Year 2014 budget proposal today, sixty-five days past its due date: “For more than two months, the American people have been waiting for the President to get off the sidelines and join the conversation about putting Washington on a budget. Today, he issued a budget proposal that irresponsibly ignores our growing debt and defends the status quo in Washington. The contrast between his tax-laden proposal and the House Republican balanced budget is stark. “Unlike the House Republican budget that will balance in a decade, the President’s budget will never balance. Ever. It will, however, compound debt, authorize more wasteful government overspending, and burden the American people with an additional $1 trillion in new taxes. “Republicans have asked Washington to make do with a little less to ensure that the American people are able to keep more of what they earn. Our balanced budget will grow the economy, ensure retirement security for seniors, and encourage job creation immediately. “It is ironic that the President’s long awaited budget was released today on April 10th which is Tax Freedom Day for North Carolinians. That means today, on average, North Carolina families have finally earned enough money to pay off their 2013 tax bill and start earning money for themselves. “The President’s budget proposal would ask the people of North Carolina to work longer for Washington just so Washington can continue its overspending binge. How disappointing!” Foxx: Contrast in Budgets is Stark Watch Congresswoman Foxx address the House of Representatives on the contrast between the President’s tax-laden proposal and the Republicans’ Path to Prosperity balanced budget plan. Key facts from the President’s fiscal year 2014 budget The President’s Budget Never Balances—Ever The House budget balances in ten years, but, like Senate Democrats, the White House says their budget never balances—ever. $8.2 Trillion in New Debt Accounting for the cost of eliminating the sequester and removing the budget gimmicks, net deficit reduction is only $119 billion. Additional deficit increase in FY2013: $61 billion Total U.S. debt in 2023: $25.4 trillion Debt increase per household: $60,980 Interest payments on the debt in 2023: $763 billion Deficit in 2023: $439 billion $1.1 Trillion in New Taxes President Obama’s budget increases taxes by $1.1 trillion—on top of $1 trillion in taxes from Obamacare and more than $600 billion from the President’s recent tax hike. $964 Billion in New Spending above Projected Growth Spending increase next year alone: $154 billion Additional spending in FY2013: $61 billion Total spending over ten years: $46.5 trillion Rate of annual increase in mandatory spending: 5.2% The Budget Grows the Government at the Expense of the Economy President Obama’s budget takes more from hardworking families to spend more in Washington, D.C. Instead of empowering people with more control over their lives, the President’s plan empowers bureaucracy. Instead of creating good-paying private sector jobs, the President’s plan destroys jobs, depresses wages, and diminishes opportunity. Republicans are offering a different path. Our plan to balance the budget will end the waste of taxpayer dollars and foster a healthier economy, delivering real solutions to help improve people’s lives. Source: House Budget Committee.

03.25.2013	"Every campaign season, like clockwork, families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robo-calls," Congresswoman Foxx stated. "There is little voters can do to stop the annoyance, which all too often comes right in the middle of family dinners share: f t FOXX: “DO NOT CALL LIST” SHOULD EXTEND TO POLITICAL ROBO-CALLS Foxx Legislation to Grant Escape from Incessant Noise of Political Robo-Calls Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today announced the introduction of legislation to stop the intrusion of political robo-calls in homes across America. The Robo Calls Off Phones Act (Robo COP Act), H.R. 1315, will expand the types of unsolicited calls restricted by the national “Do Not Call” registry to include political robo-calls, giving the American people the opportunity to opt-out of the bothersome campaign-season interruption. “Every campaign season, like clockwork, families are bombarded by an endless stream of political robo-calls,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “There is little voters can do to stop the annoyance, which all too often comes right in the middle of family dinners and bedtimes. The Robo COP Act will solve this problem for the American people by allowing them to opt out of these calls by signing up for the federal government’s ‘Do Not Call’ list.” “Though citizens are able to stop receiving telemarketing calls, politicians made sure to exempt political robo-calls from the power of the ‘Do Not Call’ registry. If these calls weren’t such a nuisance, their blatant exclusion would be laughable. Removing their exemption through the Robo COP Act is a matter of fairness that will help bring some peace and quiet to North Carolina homes throughout campaign season.” Foxx’s Robo COP Act would direct the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations regarding the National Do Not Call registry to prohibit prerecorded campaign messages (robo-calls) from being sent to telephone numbers on the national registry. Foxx’s legislation applies strictly to unsolicited, political robo-calls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. Foxx, who does not use political robo-calling, has introduced similar legislation, often with bipartisan support, in the 109th, 110th, 111th, and 112th Congresses. # # #

The first step has to be controlling government spending through the passage of a balanced budget. House Republicans, with the leadership of Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, today took the lead in the nation’s capitol by approving a budget that not only balances revenue and spending in ten years, but will spur economic growth and confidence, protect key safety net programs for the future, and increase opportunity for every American. As we North Carolinians know, a roadmap is needed to achieve goals. The Path to Prosperity budget is the roadmap the country needs. “The choice now lies with the President and Senate.

03.15.2013	On many high-profile issues, one would be hard-pressed to find us in agreement. But the spirit of this legislation and its underlying principle – that the American people would be better served by a government that only regulates with the best of in share: f t ICYMI: Foxx, Sanchez Tout Bipartisan Regulatory Transparency Legislation in Roll Call Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act seeks to leverage transparency as filter for bad regulation In today’s Roll Call, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) and Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) tout their bipartisan effort, through the Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act (H.R. 899), to require transparency and accountability from government about the cost of unfunded regulatory mandates: “On many high-profile issues, one would be hard-pressed to find us in agreement. But the spirit of this legislation and its underlying principle — that the American people would be better served by a government that only regulates with the best of information — unites us.”Read more. “Washington should think carefully before it decrees mandates that could siphon from the limited dollars governments and private sector job creators use to keep people employed and localities functioning.

Foxx and Sanchez: Light the Process, Lighten the Load Bipartisan UMRA reform legislation seeks to leverage transparency as filter for bad regulation By Reps. Virginia Foxx and Loretta Sanchez Every year, Washington imposes thousands of pages of rules and regulations on small businesses and local governments across this country. Hidden in those pages are costly mandates that make it harder for companies to hire and for cash-strapped states, counties and cities to keep streets clean and parks safe. We are two members of Congress, one a Southern Republican and the other a California Democrat, who believe that each regulation the federal government dictates should be deliberative and economically defensible. And so we banded together with three other co-sponsors to form a bipartisan team to introduce HR 899, the Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act, legislation that will ensure public and bureaucratic awareness about the costs — in dollars and in jobs — federal dictates pose to the economy and to local governments. There is precedence for bipartisanship on this issue. In 1995, members from both parties got behind, and President Bill Clinton signed, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, which sought to expose Washington’s abuse of unfunded federal mandates. By forcing the federal government to estimate how much its mandates would cost local governments and employers, regulation would necessarily become better and more efficient for everyone involved . . . and it has, to a certain extent. But over the years, weaknesses in the original legislation have been revealed — weaknesses that some government agencies and independent regulatory bodies have exploited. Our legislation will correct these oversights and put some weight behind UMRA to ensure no government body, purposely or accidentally, skirts public scrutiny when jobs and scarce resources are at stake. UMITA will impose stricter, more clearly defined requirements for how Congress and regulatory agencies must consider federal mandates. It also corrects a glaring UMRA loophole, the exemption of independent agencies from considering regulatory costs. Unlike the 1995 bill, our legislation guarantees the public always has the opportunity to weigh in on regulations. Our bill fixes the problematic incentive UMRA inadvertently created for some agencies to forgo public rule disclosures in order to avoid cost evaluations. Congress and the American people will also be equipped with better tools through our joint effort to determine the true cost of regulations. Analyses required by our bill will have to factor in real-world consequences such as lost business profits, costs passed onto consumers and changed behavior costs when considering the bottom-line impact of federal mandates. And finally, UMITA will ensure government is held accountable for following these rules. On many high-profile issues, one would be hard-pressed to find us in agreement. But the spirit of this legislation and its underlying principle — that the American people would be better served by a government that only regulates with the best of information — unites us. At the very least, lawmakers and unelected regulators should know the price of their dictates. So, too, should the people, private enterprises and governments being asked to foot the bill. The process of reforming UMRA in this manner started six years ago in the Foxx office. With the team we have assembled today, and the acute need for smarter regulation in this job market, there should be no further delay to its passage. Times are tight for families across this country. Millions of Americans remain unemployed, and many more still rely on small businesses and local governments for jobs, health care, public safety and education. Washington should think carefully before it decrees mandates that could siphon from the limited dollars governments and private sector job creators use to keep people employed and localities functioning. But as loopholes within the original UMRA legislation have revealed, federal mandates are not universally preceded by thoughtfulness. The Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act we have introduced will require that from government. Reps. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., James Lankford, R-OK, Mike McIntyre, D-N.C., and Collin Peterson, D-MN, are sponsors of The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, HR 899.
03.15.2013	The "suits" in Washington do not have all the answers when it comes to helping millions of jobless Americans compete for work. The best insight and the best services for job seekers are found at the local level – with local leaders, local workforce share: f t FOXX LEGISLATION PASSES HOUSE, ADVANCES TO SENATE SKILLS Act will Reform America’s Workforce Development Strategy to Better Serve Job Seekers, Taxpayers Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), today issued the following statement on the passage of her legislation, the Supporting Knowledge & Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act), H.R. 803, from the House of Representatives: “The ‘suits’ in Washington do not have all the answers when it comes to helping millions of jobless Americans compete for work. The best insight and the best services for job seekers are found at the local level – with local leaders, local workforce boards, community colleges, and local employers who have jobs to fill. Those individuals should be at the helm of America’s workforce development strategy, and the SKILLS Act puts them there. “The SKILLS Act recognizes that North Carolinians know more than Washington does about what it takes to find a job in our state. This legislation is a step in the right direction for job seekers and for taxpayers. It will simplify the current one-size-fits-all maze that the vast majority of job seekers never complete; it will prioritize education for in-demand jobs; and it will ensure that hard-earned taxpayer money spent on workforce education programs is actually being used to prepare people for good jobs, and not to pad bureaucracy. “The SKILLS Act is a clear alternative to the complicated status quo that is failing American workers and taxpayers. The Senate should take action on the SKILLS Act without delay.” The SKILLS Act will streamline 35 duplicative federally run workforce development programs – as highlighted by a 2011 GAO report – and create one Workforce Investment Fund. Additionally, the SKILLS Act will: Require a report on administrative costs and savings due to program streamlining; Provide more flexibility to states by removing 19 mandates that currently dictate Workforce Investment Board membership; Strengthen the role of state and local officials and job creators, allowing them to tailor programs to best fit their area’s needs and job opportunities; Facilitate greater collaboration with community colleges by allowing states to determine the standards required for eligible training providers; Reform Job Corps to ensure that career and technical education is geared toward in-demand jobs; Increase focus on the delivery of basic literacy and math skills; and Help individuals with disabilities transition into employment.

Vote on Measure Scheduled for Friday Congresswoman Virginia Foxx’s Supporting Knowledge & Investing in Lifelong Skills Act (SKILLS Act), H.R. 803, will be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives today and tomorrow, Thursday, March 14th – Friday, March 15th. At the conclusion of debate on Friday, the measure will be presented for a vote in the House. To watch the live floor debate, North Carolinians may tune in to C-SPAN or live-stream House floor proceedings at www.houselive.gov. Thursday’s floor debate begins at 3:45 p.m. EST. Friday’s floor debate is scheduled to begin at 9:15 a.m. Foxx’s SKILLS Act, a joint venture with the House Committee on Education & the Workforce, targets federal waste by consolidating and streamlining more than 30 duplicative federal workforce education programs as highlighted by the Government Accountability Office. In 2012, President Barack Obama urged reform of the nation’s workforce development strategy. Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn has also documented how taxpayer dollars are being mismanaged to fund unnecessary overlap in these federal programs. At a time when twelve million Americans are searching for jobs, the SKILLS Act will cut through the current maze of federal workforce development programs and create one Workforce Investment Fund. It will additionally reduce administrative costs and require transparency and accountability for how taxpayer dollars are spent, ensuring that money is used to directly help job seekers, not to preserve bureaucracy. The SKILLS Act also recognizes that the “suits” in Washington aren’t in the best position to help local job seekers find employment in their communities. Thus, it provides flexibility to states and local workforce boards by removing 19 mandates that micromanage Workforce Investment Board membership. The SKILLS Act grants local discretion to ensure that job seekers are treated as individuals and that states are not blocked from making further savings.

Washington hasn’t been operating within that framework for years, though. House Republicans have had enough of this 'Washington exceptionalism,' and today introduced a budget for the federal government that will balance in just 10 years. “Budgets reveal priorities, and House Republicans have revealed ours today. We want to build a stronger, more prosperous future for this generation and the next; we want to protect the promise of Medicare; we want to guarantee accountability for the use of taxpayer dollars; we want to preserve personal freedoms and pursue commonsense governance. The American people deserve this, and so we’ve offered a balanced budget that encourages growth and opportunity for all while paving the way for the country to get out of debt. “It takes courage to put forth such bold ideas. My thanks go out to Chairman Paul Ryan and to all of the Republican members of the House Budget Committee who led the way in making this stand. Although it may not please foreign debt holders, future generations of Americans will be thankful for such leadership, and I hope the President and Senate will follow suit with ideas of their own – ideas that will actually balance.” # # #

John Kline (R-MN), approved legislation to reform the nation’s workforce development system and help ensure workers and employers have the resources they need to be successful in today’s economy. Introduced by Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act (H.R. 803) was approved in a vote of 23 to 0. “These long overdue job training reforms are vital to the strength of our workforce,” said Chairman Kline. “Each day we delay reform, taxpayer dollars are wasted on failed programs and workers are left stranded in unemployment. The committee has worked diligently on this issue for more than two years, and it is time for Congress to act. Today Democrats abdicated their responsibility and demonstrated their unwillingness to engage in the legislative process. Last year the committee debated and approved numerous amendments offered by the minority which helped improve the bill. We stood ready to do the same today. Rather than present their ideas, Democrats offered a rote defense of the status quo and political theatrics. Both are a disservice workers, employers, and job seekers. “ “I am particularly pleased about today’s passage of the SKILLS Act, as reforming our nation’s broken workforce development system has been a top priority for this committee over the past two years,” Rep. Foxx said. “This legislation takes a crucial step forward in the fight to eliminate red tape and create a more effective system to better serve and prepare Americans to compete in the 21st century workforce. I hope the legislation will see swift approval in the House and Senate and the SKILLS Act will be on the president’s desk in the coming weeks.” “We have an important opportunity to promote better use of taxpayer dollars and help put Americans back to work,” continued Chairman Kline. “Leader Cantor has announced his intent to bring the SKILLS Act to the House floor next week, and I look forward to a robust debate on this critical legislation with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.” The positive reforms adopted by the committee in the SKILLS Act will: Eliminate and streamline 35 duplicative and ineffective employment and training programs. Replace the current maze of programs with a flexible Workforce Investment Fund to serve as a single source of support for employers and job seekers. Strengthen the role of employers in workforce education decisions by repealing 19 federal mandates governing workforce investment board representation. Establish common performance measures for state and local leaders and require an independent evaluation of programs at least once every five years to improve accountability. Require local workforce investment leaders to outline the strategies they will implement to serve at-risk youth, individuals with disabilities, veterans, and other workers with unique barriers to employment.

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx:“What we want to do [with the Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act] is to make sure that the American public and the people who are writing the regulations know what the regulations are going to cost. Regulations are a hidden tax on the American people, on businesses, even on government. So what we want to do is to make sure that people understand that and hopefully look for alternatives.” Fox News:“You mentioned a number of places [regulations] are going to hit, which are businesses, private businesses, and state and local governments. Unfunded mandates come their way and they have to comply, but somebody has to pay for it.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx: “That's exactly right. It’s the American people who are paying for it.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx:“We are looking for more transparency and accountably from our governments, particularly at the federal level.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx:“If [local governments are] using this money for unnecessary regulations, they are not hiring teachers, they are not hiring firefighters…We want to bring down the cost of government and allow the money to be used more wisely.” Click here for more information on the Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act. # # #

"Despite receiving some of the highest tax revenues in history, Washington has been overspending by at least $1 trillion each year of the Obama Presidency. All told, national debt has increased $5.8 trillion to an historic high of $16.6 trillion on his watch. "When families and small businesses run out of money and perpetually exhaust credit, they do the smart thing –stop spending so much. "Washington has to do the same, but arbitrarily cutting budgets through sequestration isn’t the best way to go about it. "Twice since last summer House Republicans passed legislation that would preserve the same dollar savings while completely removing the indiscriminate threat of sequestration. Our plans targeted government waste, reformed unsustainable programs, and limited government growth. "The President threatened to veto our proposals because they didn’t include tax increases, and in fifteen months, his Party in the Senate passed zero sequester alternatives of their own.

03.01.2013	Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch city budgets and make it harder for North Carolina businesses to hire. At the very least policymakers and un share: f t FOXX: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD KNOW AND CONSIDER THE PRICE OF REGULATORY DICTATES Foxx, Sanchez, Lankford, McIntyre, Peterson Introduce Legislation to Make Federal Mandate Costs Transparent to Local Governments, Employers Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R, NC-5) re-introduced legislation to shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and private sector employers at the close of the House of Representatives' legislative week. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, H.R. 899, will fix loopholes within the bipartisan regulatory reform act known as UMRA. Foxx was joined in the introduction by four bipartisan cosponsors: Representatives Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike McIntyre (D-NC), and Collin Peterson (D-MN). Congresswoman Virginia Foxx– “Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on local governments and small businesses. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that stretch state and city budgets and make it harder for North Carolina businesses to hire. “At the very least policymakers and unelected regulators should know the price of what they dictate. The Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act will help restore honesty and transparency to federal mandates and ensure Washington bureaucrats are held accountable for seeking public input and considering the negative consequences, in dollars and in jobs, prospective mandates will impose on the economy. “Six years of work have gone into advancing this legislation, and there should be no further delay to its passage. Times are tight for families across this country. Millions of Americans remain unemployed, and many more still rely on small businesses and local governments for jobs, health care, public safety, and education. Washington should think carefully before it decrees regulation that could siphon from the limited dollars cities and small businesses use to keep people employed and localities functioning.” Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez – “This bill will further protect state and local governments from unfunded mandates that are unnecessary and costly,” said Sanchez. “These unfunded mandates waste time and money for our local government systems. Our bill will require public reporting by federal agencies on these mandates and will hold the federal government more accountable on how mandates may cost local governments.” Congressman James Lankford – “States, local governments, and businesses face a never-ending wave of new federal regulations and mandates, which bog down their government or business. There must be a way to force the federal government to think through the effects of each regulation and prioritize any essential regulation. The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2013 will place the spotlight on every future mandate and allow local governments and businesses to push back before rules take effect. I am proud to join Rep. Foxx in taking these positive steps to help ensure agencies consistently consider responsible alternatives. This bill is a first step in an important overhaul effort for a more commonsense regulatory structure.” Congressman Mike McIntyre – “Reducing regulations, helping small businesses, and eliminating unfunded mandates for state and local governments are keys to helping create jobs and put people to work. This bill is a great step toward reforming the regulatory process, streamlining government, and saving taxpayers’ time and money. Let’s pass this common sense bill now!” Congressman Collin Peterson – “While I believe we could go even further in reforming the regulatory process, I believe this bill is a step in the right direction to modernize and open up the process of federal mandates. More transparency is needed to start shining light on the impact regulations have on our local communities. Policy should be written in an open and fair process rather than behind closed doors by lobbyists.” H.R. 899 will increase transparency about the costs imposed by unfunded mandates and will hold government accountable for considering those costs before passing them onto local governments and small businesses. The legislation expands the scope of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was passed to ensure public awareness of the financial burden federal mandates place on employers and state and local governments. Current loopholes within UMRA allow certain regulatory bodies to escape public reporting requirements and incentivize others to forego publicizing regulatory proposals. Foxx’s legislation will correct this. Specifically, H.R. 899 will: Impose stricter and more clearly defined requirements for how and when federal agencies must disclose the cost of federal mandates; Ensure those who will be affected have the opportunity to weigh in on proposed mandates; Equip Congress and the public with tools to better determine the true cost of regulations; and Provide an accountability mechanism to ensure the federal government and its independent regulatory agencies adhere to the provisions set forth by H.R. 899 and its predecessor, UMRA. Foxx’s legislation also requires the federal government to report how legislative changes to existing federal grant programs might shift costs to state, local, and tribal governments. For instance, grant programs which are administered by states can be altered by federal legislation such as No Child Left Behind and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Under H.R. 899 the federal government would be statutorily required to report how such changes would impact state or local government budgets.

02.28.2013	"Violence against women is a tragedy and I had hoped to see the House VAWA reauthorization bill pass today to bolster prevention initiatives and ensure that every victim of sexual assault and domestic violence in this country receives the greatest protect share: f t FOXX Statement Supporting House VAWA Reauthorization Proposal Congresswoman Virginia Foxx issued the following statement regarding her support for the House Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization proposal today: “Today I supported the House of Representatives’ Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) reauthorization proposal because it included reforms to best serve all victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, crimes which inflict pain and trauma on women and leave no community untouched. “Violence against women is a tragedy and I had hoped to see the House VAWA reauthorization bill pass today to bolster prevention initiatives and ensure that every victim of sexual assault and domestic violence in this country receives the greatest protection in the future. “The House VAWA reauthorization was better than the Senate proposal (S. 47) and would have maximized protection for all who face the threat of domestic and sexual violence. It would have increased accountability for how VAWA grant dollars are administered to ensure that money goes to helping victims and reducing violence, not padding bureaucracy; it would have distributed funds more equitably between rape prevention and sexual assault services; and it would have improved the ability for law enforcement to prosecute abusers. “Additionally, the House VAWA reauthorization would have provided a constitutional route to ensuring justice for Native American and Alaskan Native women who are victims of assault on tribal lands. The House bill sought to enable tribal governments to prosecute, within a constitutional framework, domestic violence and sexual assault crimes perpetrated by non-Native Americans on tribal land. The House proposal also enhanced immigration laws to protect victims of violence. “Both the House and Senate VAWA reauthorization proposals contained legislation I cosponsored, the STALKER Act, that will strengthen protections for any victim of online cyber-stalking.” # # #
02.27.2013	"Today's workforce development system is failing workers, employers, and taxpayers," said Chairwoman Foxx."Instead of a dynamic network of employment support, we have a massive bureaucracy that stifles innovation and wastes resources..." share: f t LEADING WORKFORCE EDUCATION OFFICIALS LAUD REFORMS IN FOXX’S SKILLS ACT Courtesy of the House Committee on Education & the Workforce Higher Education & Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx presents the SKILLS Act, H.R. 803, legislation to reform and modernize federal workforce development programs in order to better serve job seekers and employers. The Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, chaired by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), Tuesday held a hearing on the urgent need to strengthen the federal workforce development system. Members discussed a number of legislative proposals intended to address flaws in federal job development policies, including the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act. “Today’s workforce development system is failing workers, employers, and taxpayers,” said Chairwoman Foxx.“Instead of a dynamic network of employment support, we have a massive bureaucracy that stifles innovation and wastes resources. The need to fundamentally change the status quo has never been greater. President Obama said last year that it was ‘time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system.’ That is precisely what the Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills Act will do.” The SKILLS Act (H.R. 803) reauthorizes the Workforce Investment Act, which has not been reformed since 1998. State and local workforce development leaders described the need to reauthorize federal law and discussed the positive reforms reflected in the legislation. Dr. R. Scott Ralls, president of the North Carolina Community College System, noted that it is “important that reauthorization of the Workforce Investment Act streamlines programs, limits administrative overhead, and enables state and local flexibility to design systems that meet the legislative goals in the most effective and efficient manner. Simplifying the system and moving past the myriad of multiple program titles and funding streams is a fundamental step.” The SKILLS Act eliminates and streamlines 35 duplicative and ineffective programs and creates a Workforce Investment Fund to serve as the primary source of support for employers, workers, and job seekers. However, removing inefficiencies and simplifying the system is only part of a broader strategy to ensure workers have the skills they need to succeed in today’s workforce. Job training reform must also strengthen the role of job creators, state leaders, and local officials to better align services with in-demand jobs. The SKILLS Act eliminates onerous federal mandates, provides greater representation of employers on workforce investment boards, and empowers state and local leaders to determine the remaining representatives. As Todd Gustafson, executive director of Michigan Works—Berrien-Cass-Van Buren, noted, “Eliminating the 19 federal mandates on representation will further strengthen business engagement. Requiring two-thirds of board members to be employers will enhance the shift from a supply side designed system to a demand or market driven system.” Mr. Gustafson added,“Eliminating mandates will also help attract higher caliber local business and community leaders who otherwise feel disempowered and ultimately uninterested among a large unfocused group. Smaller boards are a best practice in both the private-for-profit and non-profit sectors and should be applied to the government’s workforce system.” Chris Hart, president and CEO of Workforce Florida, Inc., praised the legislation:“The proposed SKILLS Act, at its very core, is about maintaining our nation’s global economic leadership and accelerating economic progress for Americans by focusing on jobs and a modern talent delivery system that produces skilled and knowledgeable workers.

Taxpayer dollars are spent supporting a massive bureaucracy instead of helping workers. House Education and the Workforce Committee Republicans have released commonsense reforms that will streamline the system, shifting the focus away from ineffective programs and back to workers. To learn more about this important effort, stay tuned for Part 2. NOTE: Tomorrow at 10 a.m. ET, the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training will hold a hearing entitled "Putting America Back to Work: Reforming the Nation's Workforce Investment System."

The House Education and the Workforce Committee is taking action to provide taxpayers, employers, and workers with a more effective workforce development system. The Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act (H.R. 803) eliminates and streamlines dozens of ineffective and duplicative programs, and creates a flexible Workforce Investment Fund. This new fund will provide state and local leaders an efficient resource to deliver the support their workers need. Instead of a system focused on programs and bureaucracy, the SKILLS Act delivers a dynamic network of employment support that will put workers and job seekers first: Last year, President Obama said it was "time to turn our unemployment system into a reemployment system." That is precisely what the SKILLS Act will do. A hearing scheduled for tomorrow in the Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee will discuss the need for reform and the commonsense approach reflected in the SKILLS Act.

02.21.2013	"Today's workforce development system is failing workers, employers, and taxpayers," said Rep. Foxx. "Instead of a dynamic network of employment support, we have a massive bureaucracy that stifles innovation and wastes resources. Last year, President share: f t Committee Republicans Release Broad Job Development Reform Legislation Hearing to examine solutions to fix a broken workforce development system set for next week Education and the Workforce Committee Republicans, led by Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), today released a comprehensive proposal to reform federal job training and employment assistance. The Supporting Knowledge and Investing in Lifelong Skills (SKILLS) Act, which will be formally introduced on February 25, streamlines federal programs and creates a single source of employment support for employers and job seekers. Rep. Foxx will chair a hearing on Tuesday, February 26 at 10 a.m. to discuss the proposal and the need for job training reform. “Today’s workforce development system is failing workers, employers, and taxpayers,” said Rep. Foxx. “Instead of a dynamic network of employment support, we have a massive bureaucracy that stifles innovation and wastes resources. Last year, President Obama urged Congress to cut through the confusing maze of programs and create one program for individuals to access the assistance they need. The SKILLS Act is the only proposal that moves us toward this goal. It is time to be bold with how we prepare today’s workers to compete and succeed in this new economy.” The Workforce Investment Act of 1998 established a system of one-stop centers for individuals to access job training and employment services. However, the law has never been reauthorized and inefficiencies exist throughout the system. The federal government administers more than 50 programs across nine agencies. Many of these programs overlap and few have been evaluated for efficacy. House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) noted the urgent need for reform. “The SKILLS Act is a commonsense solution to help fix a broken job training system,” said Chairman Kline. “We have tried the Washington-knows-best approach for decades and it hasn’t worked. In the process, we’ve squandered taxpayer dollars and failed to provide workers the help they need. The status quo is no longer acceptable. I am grateful to Representative Foxx, as well as Representatives McKeon and Heck, for their continued leadership on this important issue and look forward to advancing job training reform legislation in the coming weeks.” Job training reform is a leading priority for House Republicans, including Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-VA). Earlier this month, Leader Cantor outlined a legislative agenda for the 113th Congress that includes a call for reforms that make it easier for Americans to find the skills they need. Among its positive reforms, the SKILLS Act will: Eliminate and streamline 35 ineffective and redundant employment and training programs and create a Workforce Investment Fund to serve as a single source of support for employers, workers, and job seekers. Strengthen the role of employers in workforce training decisions by eliminating 19 federal mandates governing workforce investment board representation. Require state and local workforce investment leaders to outline the strategies they will implement to serve at-risk youth, individuals with disabilities, veterans, and other workers with unique challenges to employment. Promote accountability by establishing common performance measures and requiring an independent evaluation of programs at least once every five years. To learn more about the SKILLS Act, click here.

02.15.2013	Taxpayers have had to bail out America's Highway Trust Fund before, and they shouldn't have to do so again. H.R. 711 will exempt the Highway Trust Fund from Davis-Bacon wage mandates that artificially inflate federally funded highway construction share: f t FOXX INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO CREATE CONSTRUCTION JOBS H.R. 711 Exempts Highway Construction from Outdated Davis-Bacon rules, Stabilizes Highway Trust Fund Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) introduced the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act, H.R. 711, legislation to stabilize the federal Highway Trust Fund and spur the creation of construction jobs by exempting the fund from Davis-Bacon’s outdated, wasteful labor requirements for highway construction projects. Foxx, who first introduced the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act in the 111th Congress, has partnered in the 113th Congress with original cosponsors Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), and Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA). Rep. Virginia Foxx:“Taxpayers have had to bail out America’s Highway Trust Fund before, and they shouldn’t have to do so again. H.R. 711 will exempt the Highway Trust Fund from Davis-Bacon wage mandates that artificially inflate federally funded highway construction costs and price newer, non-union workers out of jobs. Big Labor should not continue to use this Depression-era legislation as a shield to line its own pockets at the expense of non-union workers and taxpayers.” Rep. Jason Chaffetz:“Simply put – we need to reform outdated and ineffective government regulations. Wages for federal government contracts should not be inflated by outdated labor requirements passed over 80 years ago. The Highway Trust Fund Reform Act is a pro-taxpayer, free-market approach to building highways.” Rep. Joe Pitts:“Pennsylvania has more structurally deficient bridges than any other state in the nation. We need to use taxpayer funds wisely and start fixing bridges as soon as possible, but federal Davis-Bacon requirements are making it more difficult. It’s time that states start paying the market price for labor and get the most bang for their buck.” Rep. Lynn Westmoreland:“It is ridiculous that the federal government is still using an outdated federal construction wage rate that was passed during Herbert Hoover’s Administration. Times have changed, but apparently not for the unions, who still want to have a stranglehold on federal highway construction projects and inflate the cost of doing business at the taxpayers’ expense. The Highway Trust Fund is not the personal slush fund of the unions, and by repealing the obsolete Davis-Bacon wage mandates, we can ensure the cost of our federal infrastructure projects are based on real numbers, and also allow non-union workers the opportunity to work on projects that benefit the nation.” Foxx’s Highway Trust Fund Reform Act does away with Davis-Bacon Act requirements that, for decades, have been driving up the cost of federal highway projects by mandating artificially high wages. When compared with Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Suffolk University researchers found Davis-Bacon-determined wages tended to inflate labor costs an average of 22 percent above market rates. Beyond increasing construction costs for taxpayers, Davis-Bacon requirements force businesses working on federal highway projects to comply with burdensome paperwork and reporting regulations. Reports from the Government Accountability Office suggest that these Davis-Bacon requirements inflate costs and slow project completion. Removing Davis-Bacon’s implications from federally-funded highway construction projects funded through the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act would free up funds from inflated wages and regulatory compliance to create more market-priced construction jobs and more affordable, timely completed projects. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Highway Trust Fund, which is used to pay for labor costs, will go insolvent during FY 2015. And unless Congress acts, the Trust Fund will need an additional $126 billionin new revenue or taxpayer bailouts to cover costs through 2023. To learn more about how outdated Davis-Bacon requirements increase costs and decrease employment please read the Joint Economic Committee staff commentary on Davis-Bacon requirements and the Highway Trust Fund. # # #

02.13.2013	Our state is beautiful and our people are good, upstanding ambassadors of Southern hospitality. It's no wonder the President chose to visit. It's my hope he takes some of our North Carolina common sense with him back to Washington. share: f t Foxx Responds to President Obama's Trip to Asheville, N.C. The President is mistaken if he thinks taking more money away from the American people is going to magically generate private sector job creation. His travails with “stimulus” and Solyndra should have taught him that. Since the President assumed office in January of 2009, 8.5 million more Americans have sadly given up looking for jobs. A real draw for manufacturers to plant roots and hire workers in North Carolina would be a flatter, fairer tax code that doesn’t disadvantage small businesses and simplified federal regulation. Our state is beautiful and our people are good, upstanding ambassadors of Southern hospitality. It’s no wonder the President chose to visit. It’s my hope he takes some of our North Carolina common sense with him back to Washington. # # #
02.12.2013	It doesn't help North Carolina families when Washington spends money it does not have. A fiscally responsible federal government that doesn't stand in the way of private sector job growth is what's needed to make it easier for families to put share: f t FOXX RESPONSE TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R, NC-5) issued the following statement at the conclusion of tonight’s State of the Union address: “It doesn’t help North Carolina families when Washington spends money it does not have. A fiscally responsible federal government that doesn’t stand in the way of private sector job growth is what’s needed to make it easier for families to put food on the table, pay their bills, and realize their American Dream. “American families, small business owners, students and taxpayers should never have to doubt whether their government is working for them. But today, the hard-earned money Washington takes from the American people isn’t generating real economic growth; it’s not making health care more affordable; it’s not reducing bottom-line college costs; and it’s not being used to pay off the $16 trillion debt bill that will burden our children and grandchildren for generations to come. Washington has to start answering for those poor results rather than attempting more micromanagement of personal freedoms. “House Republicans have proposed ways to spur job creation and opportunity for everyone without increasing the size of the federal government’s footprint in our lives. We would like the President and Senate to work with us. Partisan speeches, in lieu of the real bipartisan solutions Americans crave, do not solve problems.” Prior to the speech, Foxx and a small number of her colleagues accompanied President Obama into the House of Representatives Chamber as members of the Presidential Escort Committee. Foxx is serving her fifth term as the U.S. Congresswoman representing North Carolina's fifth district in the House of Representatives. She is the chairperson of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education & Workforce Training and is Vice Chair of the House Committee on Rules. Additionally, she was elected by her peers to serve in House Leadership as the GOP Conference Secretary for the 113th Congress. # # #

Chairman John Kline (R-MN), Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), and Reps. Thomas Petri (R-WI), Joe Wilson (R-SC), Phil Roe (R-TN), Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-PA), Tim Walberg (R-MI), Matt Salmon (R-AZ), Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), Todd Rokita (R-IN), Larry Bucshon (R-IN), Lou Barletta (R-PA), Martha Roby (R-AL), Joe Heck (R-NV), and Susan Brooks (R-IN) signed the letter. “We cannot continue kicking the can down the road, creating confusion and uncertainty for student loan borrowers,” Chairman Kline said. “The Stafford Loan interest rate problem was manufactured here in Washington, and we have a responsibility to craft a long-term solution to fix it. It’s time to tie interest rates to the free market, not the whims of politicians.” In 2012, lawmakers approved a proposal to delay for one year a scheduled interest rate increase on subsidized Stafford Loans made to undergraduate students. Unless Congress takes action, the interest rate will jump from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on June 30, 2013. In the letter, the Republican committee members write: Too often, Congress must scramble to craft short-term fixes for long-term problems, a dynamic particularly evident in federal student aid programs. Last year, Congress chose to delay for one year the scheduled interest rate increase under the premise that we would use the time to develop a permanent solution to the problem. As the June 30 deadline nears, it is time for us to work together on a sustainable solution to ensure students have the certainty they need to plan for the cost of attending college. We support resolving the interest rate cliff by moving toward a market-based interest rate for Stafford loans in a fiscally responsible manner, and are interested in the administration’s ideas. As such, we request an outline of the proposal you plan to include in the fiscal year 2014 budget request that provides a long-term solution to the student loan interest rate issue and requisite offsets to ensure taxpayers will not be forced to bear the burden of fixing this problem.

02.01.2013	Despite knowing the program faced a shortfall since fiscal year 2011, the department failed to anticipate and address the specific causes or take action to stabilize the financial condition of the program. Instead, it continues to take temporary steps to share: f t Kline, Foxx Launch Comprehensive Review of Job Corps Program U.S. House Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) have launched a comprehensive review of the federal Job Corps program. In response to ongoing reports of financial challenges, the committee seeks information from the Obama administration, operators of Job Corps centers, and the National Job Corps Association. “Congress must get to the bottom of the budgetary shortfalls that continue to plague the Job Corps program,” said Chairman Kline. “I expect the department and all interested stakeholders to cooperate fully with the committee’s investigation so we can ensure this program serves our nation’s youth while protecting taxpayers’ investment.” The federal Job Corps program provides disadvantaged youth with the necessary skills to pursue a career, join the military, or prepare for higher education. Operated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the program currently serves 60,000 students and has an annual budget of $1.7 billion. In 2011, the department announced a $39 million funding shortfall in the Job Corps program. The department took emergency steps to fill the budget gap, such as transferring funds from other employment and training programs. However, the funding shortfall continued and rose an additional $60 million in 2012. As a result, the department announced on January 18 that it was suspending all new enrollments at Job Corps centers nationwide. To date, the Department of Labor has failed to provide specific reasons for the program’s ongoing budget weaknesses or propose reforms that will enhance its long term financial stability. In their letter to the department, committee members stated: Despite knowing the program faced a shortfall since fiscal year 2011, the department failed to anticipate and address the specific causes or take action to stabilize the financial condition of the program. Instead, it continues to take temporary steps to achieve savings to cover the shortfall, estimated at more than $100 million over the last two program years. The department’s lack of action is even more concerning considering the impending sequestration. The committee is growing increasingly concerned with the ability of the department and its contractors to manage the program’s budget in the short and long term. As part of the committee’s broad oversight of the program, members have also sent letters to: The National Job Corps Association; Operators that run the nation’s 125 Job Corps centers; and The Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Labor. # # #

I call on the administration to help us in this endeavor by providing the requested briefing on its safety recommendations as soon as possible.” In the letters, Chairman Kline, Rep. Foxx, and Rep. Rokita write: President Obama recently stated, “We won’t be able to stop every violent act, but if there is even one thing that we can do to prevent any of these events, we have a deep obligation, all of us, to try.” The horrific events at Sandy Hook Elementary School have sparked a national conversation about school safety. While we agree we cannot stop every senseless act of violence, we share the president’s commitment to reviewing the facts and evaluating proposed and existing policies and programs intended to help teachers, principals, and parents protect their children. The House Committee on Education and the Workforce takes seriously this responsibility to the nation’s teachers, principals, and superintendents, as well as the parents and children who deserve access to a quality education in a safe learning environment. The members pose specific questions to each recipient on timelines, planning, cost, and methodology for the implementation of the administration’s executive actions, as well as the congressional proposals and suggested changes to existing programs.

In fact, po share: f t Washington, D.C. – GOP Conference Secretary, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today issued the following statement on the passage of H.R. 325, the No Budget, No Pay Act in the House of Representatives: “It is downright embarrassing that the United States Senate has failed to pass a budget for almost four years. Every North Carolina family and small business has to contend with the realities of budgeting, and Washington should be no exception. In fact, politicians should not get paid if they fail to do their most basic job – passing a budget. “Our country and job market are mired in $16.4 trillion dollars of debt. A spending plan is needed to undo that damage and end the cycle of $1 trillion dollar deficits that has characterized every year of the Obama Presidency. The No Budget, No Pay Act will put pressure on Washington to finally do its work. The Senate should consider this legislation immediately. “House Republicans will continue to lead the way this year and pass another budget that takes bold stands on spending priorities and lays out a plan to eliminate deficits in ten years.

Wade decision legalizing abortion in the United States: Mr. Speaker, Life is the most fundamental of all rights. It is sacred, and God-given. But millions of babies have been robbed of that right in this, the freest country in the world. That is a tragedy beyond words and a betrayal of what we as a nation stand for. Before liberty, equality, free speech, freedom of conscience, the pursuit of happiness and justice for all, there has to be life. And yet, for millions of aborted infants – many pain-capable and many discriminated because of gender or disability – life is exactly what they have been denied, often at taxpayer expense. And an affront to life for some is an affront to life for every one of us. One day, we hope it will be different. We hope life will cease to be valued on a sliding scale. We hope the era of elective abortions, ushered in by an unelected court, will be closed and collectively deemed one of the darkest chapters in American history. But until that day, it remains a solemn duty to stand up for life. Regardless of the length of this journey, we will continue to speak for those who cannot. And we will continue to pray to the One who can change the hearts of those in desperation and those in power, who equally hold the lives of the innocent in their hands. May we, in love, defend the unborn. May we, in humility, confront this national sin. And may we mourn what abortion reveals about the conscience of our nation.

Our representative democracy is displayed proudly in Presidential Inauguration ceremonies,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “It is wonderful to be able to share the experience with so many North Carolina students and families.” Among those attending the Presidential Inauguration at Congresswoman Foxx’s invitation was Ms. Susan Le Tissier of Mount Holly, North Carolina. Le Tissier, a native of the British Isle of Guernsey, is a Legal Permanent Resident in the United States who plans to apply for United States citizenship in the near future. She had dreamed of one day attending an Inauguration ceremony. “What is remarkable to me is that the leader of a country can be changed and the response is celebration,” Ms. Le Tissier said. “I enjoy the fact that in America the peaceful transfer of power is celebrated.” Foxx and Le Tissier met at Charlotte’s Douglas Airport. Having developed a great appreciation for the American republic while studying government and politics in the U.K., Le Tissier conveyed to Foxx her hope to attend the Presidential Inauguration. In addition to Ms. Le Tissier, Fifth District residents from Winston-Salem, Boone, Clemmons, Statesville, Lewisville, Lexington, Hickory, Salisbury, Rural Hall, and Boomer received inauguration tickets from Representative Foxx to attend the 57th Presidential Inauguration ceremony. Foxx’s guests visited the 5th District Congressional office in Washington, D.C. on Sunday to pick up their tickets in advance of today’s Inauguration and enjoy a bit of refreshment in the form of North Carolina peanuts and soft drinks.

The spending in H.R. 152 doesn't come close to meeting that requirement and so I could not support it. "Emergencies require us to come together as a country to help our neighbors in need and ensure that taxpayer-funded assistance gets to victims quickly and efficiently. Emergencies should not be used as cover for profligate Washington spending or to dodge the scrutiny of an open budget process. I fear, however, both are the case with this legislation. “H.R. 152 is weighed down by spending entirely unrelated to Hurricane Sandy. Despite its ‘emergency’ classification, just seven percent of H.R. 152's total cost will go toward helping victims in the near future, and not a cent of its cost is offset. In a debt crisis of $16.4 trillion proportion, the failure to budget for such an expense must be questioned." Among the non-emergency spending included in H.R. 152 are the following: $16 billion for Community Development Funds that would be made available to any community or state declared to be a federal disaster area in 2011, 2012 and 2013 (Hurricane Sandy occurred AFTER 2011, so states not affected by Sandy would be eligible for this taxpayer money); $2 million for repairs to Smithsonian roofs in Washington, D.C.; $3.46 billion for non-emergency Army Corps of Engineers spending, as classified by the Congressional Budget Office; Transportation funding (including highway repairs in the Virgin Islands) not limited to areas affected by Hurricane Sandy; and Provisions making Guam eligible for funding (Guam is 8,000 miles away from New York). Monday, Foxx voted to support the Sandy Recovery Improvement Act (H.R. 219), bipartisan legislation that corrects inefficiencies in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) programs in order to speed up the delivery of assistance to victims and reduce the overall cost of recovery to taxpayers. # # #

01.07.2013	"Stalkers inflict real pain in the lives of thousands of women every year, and with the growing threat of cyberstalking, federal stalking laws are long overdue for an update," Rep. Foxx said. "Rep. Sanchez and I recognize this and are again introducing le share: f t Reps. Loretta Sanchez, Virginia Foxx Re-Introduce STALKER ACT for Stronger Stalking Laws Lawmakers Work Across Party Lines to Clarify Federal Stalking Statutes and Increase Penalties for Offenders In the first week of the 113th Congress, Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez (D-CA) and Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) re-introduced a tough bill that would strengthen federal anti-stalking laws to address the new technology predators are using to harass their victims. In addition to clarifying existing laws, H.R. 206, the Simplifying the Ambiguous Law, Keeping Everyone Reliably Safe (STALKERS) Act of 2013, would give law enforcement authorities the tools they need to prevent and prosecute stalking in the digital age. The House of Representatives passed this bipartisan legislation by unanimous consent in the 111th Congress but it was not voted on in the Senate. In the 112th Congress, the bill was introduced but not brought to the floor and was instead attached to the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). “Law enforcement must be given the appropriate tools to combat stalking and cyber stalking in the 21st century,” said Rep. Sanchez. “Unfortunately, our laws haven’t been updated to cover harassment through electronic surveillance and other new technologies. I am proud to join Rep. Foxx in re-introducing this important bill, which will take crucial steps to prosecute predators and empower victims. I hope in the 113th Congress, this bill will continue to gain steam and will garner the bipartisan support it needs to be signed into law – we need these protections.” “Stalkers inflict real pain in the lives of thousands of women every year, and with the growing threat of cyberstalking, federal stalking laws are long overdue for an update,” Rep. Foxx said. “Rep. Sanchez and I recognize this and are again introducing legislation to modernize federal law. The STALKERS Act will equip law enforcement and victims, and put fear back where it belongs – in the hearts of lawbreaking stalkers who prey on the innocent.” Current federal anti-stalking laws are outdated and may not cover all acts of electronic surveillance, including spyware, bugging, video surveillance, and other new technology used by modern-day stalkers. The legislation empowers law enforcement to prosecute any act of stalking that would be “reasonably expected” to cause a person serious emotional distress. It requires the attorney general to evaluate federal, state, and local efforts to enforce anti-stalking laws and submit an annual report on best practices. Additionally, the bill increases the punishment for stalking offenses to protect the most vulnerable victims of stalking. Offenders who are convicted for violating protection orders, stalking minors, or stalking the elderly may be sentenced to a maximum additional five years in prison. # # #

As a defender of taxpayers, I hold the United States government to a standard of spending your hard-earned money minimally and wisely. That mea share: f t FOXX STATEMENT ON FISCAL CLIFF DEAL Catastrophic National Debt Demands Less Spending, Smaller Government Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) tonight issued the following statement after opposing the Senate fiscal cliff deal, H.R. 8, that ignores America’s debt crisis while growing the size of government: “Since May House Republicans have acted in good faith to generate ideas to avert the fiscal cliff. Our balanced proposals have been designed to protect American jobs and begin the hard work of overcoming America’s debt crisis. Thus, I could not in good conscience vote for a Senate “deal” that delays savings while expanding spending subsidies, ignoring the real drivers of debt, and using harmful new taxes as justification for government growth. “The process of resolving the fiscal cliff has been ugly. The Senate received H.R. 8 from the House of Representatives on August 1 of 2012. But the Senators waited until December 31 to weigh in on the legislation. The proposal they finalized in the early hours of January 1, though deeply flawed, does clear up uncertainty for families and small businesses trying to prepare for the future. I am glad for that, but feel for the many job creators who will face a higher tax burden in yet another year of tepid economic recovery. “Regardless of the complexity of any manufactured Washington crisis, I will continue to be guided by principle. As a defender of taxpayers, I hold the United States government to a standard of spending your hard-earned money minimally and wisely. That means new government spending must be off-set. “Washington rhetoric cannot mask the fact that the country’s debt crisis and consequent fiscal cliff are symptoms of the larger problem of uncontrollable government spending. 2012 yielded the third highest annual tax revenue in American history. Sadly, government spending was just as historic. Unless spending is reined in and trillion dollar deficits become a thing of the past, no level of tax increases will solve the problem. “Rather than fixating on Clinton-era tax rates, the President and Senate Democrats would better serve the country working to shrink the federal government to a Clinton-era size. America’s catastrophic national debt demands it. The debt clock is ticking.” From May to December, Foxx cast six separate affirmative votes on H.Con.Res. 112, H.R. 8 (prior to Senate amendments), H.R. 9, H.R. 6684, H.R. 6365, and H.R. 5652 to either avert the fiscal cliff or stop the defense sequester. The Senate amendments to H.R. 8 passed the House of Representatives on the evening of January 1. If signed by the President, its provisions will apply retroactively to December 31. # # #

House Joint Resolution 66 permanently protects millions of American taxpayers from tax increases demanded by the President and Congressional Democrats. “Since May, House Republicans have acted in good faith to generate ideas to avert the fiscal cliff. Our balanced proposals have been designed to protect American jobs while the President’s counter-offers have not, consisting of endless stimulus spending and tax increases to stoke the flames of class warfare. “The President has indicated that if his tax demands are not satisfied, he will allow the country to endure the greatest tax increase in our nation’s history. “The President might be comfortable playing political games while taxes increase on every American, but Republicans are not. Families and job creators cannot afford such a hit. They need certainty to plan for the future which is what Republicans are working to deliver with the Permanent Tax Relief for Families and Small Businesses Act. “Admittedly, this legislation is not a perfect solution, but rather the latest Republican effort to protect jobs and American taxpayers to the greatest extent possible from the insatiable tax appetite of the President and Democrat Senate. “Rather than fixating on a sliver of the Clinton-era tax rates, the President would better serve the country working to shrink the federal government to a Clinton-era size. America’s catastrophic national debt demands it. It’s time for the President to get off his post-election laurels and govern.” Instead of kicking the tax can down the road with short-term patches, H.J.Res. 66 permanently protects 99.81% of the American people from a $3.91 trillion tax hike scheduled to take effect this January. Included in H.J.Res. 66 are the following permanent tax reductions for families and small businesses: $1.9 trillion: Permanently stopping the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) from hitting more middle class families; $875.7 billion: Permanent extension of current income tax rates for everyone making less than $1 million; $388.2 billion: Permanent death tax relief; $282.5 billion: Permanent extension of capital gains and dividend tax rates for everyone with less than $1 million in income; $220.1 billion: Permanent extension of the $1,000 child tax credit; $162.7 billion: Permanent repeal of personal exemption phase-out (PEP) and Pease limitation; $59.5 billion: Permanent marriage penalty relief; $28.8 billion: Permanent extension of education and other family tax relief; and $45.7 billion: Permanent extension of section 179 expensing for small businesses. In addition to H.J.Res. 66, this evening the House of Representatives reaffirmed its support for comprehensive, strategic spending cuts to stop defense sequestration by passing H.R. 6684, theSpending Reduction Act of 2012. President Obama promised the sequester would not take effect, but has presented no alternatives to avert its trigger. From May to December, Foxx cast seven separate votes on H.Con.Res. 112, H.J.Res. 66, H.R. 8, H.R. 9, H.R. 6684, H.R. 6365, and H.R. 5652to either avert the fiscal cliff or stop the defense sequester. # # #

Text Excerpts: Congresswoman Virginia Foxx. “Debt problems of a 16.2 trillion dollar proportion don’t get solved without real savings. And while the President’s offers have plenty of Washington budget gimmicks, real savings are disappointingly absent. That concerns me. “My grandkids are just starting to think about college and what they might want to be when they’re older. “I worry for them because a country saddled with debt is not a country where job growth abounds. A country that spends 1 trillion dollars more than it takes in every year is not a country that’s going to make it easier for young people to find jobs to support themselves, move out of their parents’ home, and pay for their college investments. “I want more for my grandchildren than a shaky job market and mountains of debt they didn’t incur. I want to leave them a country as strong and prosperous as the one I grew up in. “So I can’t, in good conscience, support any so-called solution that leaves the real work of controlling spending for another day. That’s not what parents and grandparents do. We fix problems. We don’t back away from them. … “Debt is no more “patriotic” today than when the President first ran in 2008. “The debt problem we face may not be entirely of our own making, but every day we don’t control spending the problem gets worse for our children and grandchildren.

12.06.2012	Federal government advises citizens to avoid debt with "holiday budgeting." If only Washington practiced what it preached. share: f t - By Congresswoman Virginia Foxx The federal government’s Financial Protection Bureau is instructing Americans to avoid debt this holiday season by setting a budget and sticking to it. Great advice. Also hilarious given the source. No one can take issue with the substance of the advice published by the taxpayer-funded Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. However, I do wish the federal government was aware of its own hypocrisy in playing budget sage. Washington is hardly the place from which hardworking citizens should be seeking budget advice. For three and a half years, Washington has operated without a budget to map out how it spends your money. This is not for lack of trying on the part of Republicans in the House of Representatives. Every year, we crunched numbers and subjected ourselves to criticism by taking tough stands on spending priorities. But every budget we passed during this 1300-day span stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate, even though that chamber has not once presented a spending proposal of its own. Furthermore, President Obama’s budget, which would entrench Washington’s unsustainable habits of overspending while ignoring costly entitlement reforms, has not found a single vote of support in either house. With neither strong financial leadership from the Executive, nor a roadmap for fiscal solvency guiding the ship of state, Washington has unsurprisingly just capped its fourth consecutive fiscal year of spending $1,000,000,000,000 more than it takes in. And the sobering fact in all of this is that while government spending has only increased, tax revenue today is roughly equal to what it was in 2006. The rapid rise in national debt, stemming from wasteful “stimulus” expenditures, bank bailouts, and rapidly growing entitlement bills (read more on that in my short column Defending Medicare for Future Generations), has brought us to where we are today – staring down a steep fiscal cliff of Washington’s own making. So what do we take from the Financial Protection Bureau’s advice to create a holiday spending plan, keep track of what you spend, avoid impulse purchases, and keep those troublesome credit cards at home? Simply this: do as Washington says, not as it does. There is certainly no end to the irony in Washington.

Already this year, Hamas has attacked the Israeli statewith a violent barrage of more than 900 rockets and missiles, most heavily in the past few days." share: f t America Should Continue to Stand with Israel Washington, D.C. - Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today issued the following statement in regard to the escalation of terrorist violence in Israel: “The nation of Israel is America’s friend and closest ally in the Middle East. Already this year, Hamas has attacked the Israeli statewith a violent barrage of more than 900 rockets and missiles, most heavily in the past few days. “After initiating an attack yesterday that claimed the lives of three civilians, including a pregnant woman, Hamas today targeted Israel’s capital city, Jerusalem. “When confronted with radical terrorism, Israel is absolutely justified in taking defensive action to protect its citizens. The United States would certainly do no less, and should continue to stand withIsrael while we pray for a peaceful end to the violence and destruction plaguing their land.” Today, the House of Representatives considered and passed with Foxx’s support House Resolution 813 – “Expressing vigorous support and unwavering commitment to the welfare, security, and survival of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state with secure borders, and recognizing and strongly supporting its right to act in self-defense to protect its citizens against acts of terrorism.” # # #

On this Veterans Day, the thanks of a grateful nation is with all of America's uniformed servicemembers, past and present, and with their families. A famous William Harvard quote reads, “The greatest glory of a free-born people is to transmit that freedom to their children.” He is right. And the freedom of which he speaks is only possible because of the brave men and women throughout our history who have answered our country's call to serve in her defense. Today is all about those men and women - the ones who have volunteered to give their all, if that is what is asked of them, for our country. They comprise our Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marine Corps, and Navy. And they are supported by families who carry their burden of service with them. The American people are unmatched in their willingness to sacrifice for the freedom of others. Ours is the first nation in the history of the world that goes to war only to defend and to liberate—never to conquer. In our campaigns, we seek to build dignity, and we seek to build friendship – for lasting peace, and for the furtherance of freedom. For those who've taken oaths to leave the comfort of home and the embrace of family to partake in that dangerous but noble work, we are truly indebted. Today we honor them and reflect upon the magnitude of what they have given. May we come to give half as much.

"The regulatory assaults propagated by this Administration will only help to make high energy costs rise highe share: f t STOP THE WAR ON COAL, MINING JOBS Foxx Votes to Protect North Carolina Mines and Miners from Government Overreach Representative Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today voted to help end the Obama Administration’s war on coal and support North Carolina’s energy and mining industry from oppressive government regulations. The Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act (H.R. 3409) passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 233 –175. “The President’s war on coal is a threat to thousands of American jobs, many in my home state of North Carolina,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “The regulatory assaults propagated by this Administration will only help to make high energy costs rise higher.” “The Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act provides some necessary accountability to the President’s regulators and will keep them from unilaterally crippling the domestic coal industry.” “America wants energy security. The Keystone Pipeline, coal, and coal-fired plants play a role in getting the country to that point. The President and his regulators should be less invested in subsidizing coal projects in China and more involved in supporting American mines and the jobs they provide.” H.R. 3409 is comprised of a series of bills that aim to stop the unaccountable EPA from imposing a liberal cap-and-tax agenda on the American people through the auspices of the Clean Air Act. Specifically, the Coal Miner Employment and Domestic Energy Infrastructure Protection Act will prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from issuing regulations under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act that will: Adversely impact U.S. coal mining employment; Cause a reduction in coal revenue to governments through regulation of coal mining; Reduce the amount of coal available for domestic consumption or export; Designate any area as unsuitable for surface coal mining and reclamation operations; or Expose the U.S. to liability for taking the value of privately owned coal through regulation. # # #
09.20.2012	"The President might not like Article 1 of the Constitution, but he can't ignore it. His latest attempt to side-step Congress and undermine the successful bipartisan welfare reforms of 1996 will not be tolerated by the members of this House." share: f t FOXX, HOUSE VOTE TO KEEP BIPARTISAN WELFARE REFORM STRONG Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today praised the successful passage of House Joint Resolution 118 from the House of Representatives. The legislation will prevent President Obama from unilaterally imposing an alternative policy to the successful bipartisan welfare reforms of 1996. “The President might not like Article 1 of the Constitution, but he can’t ignore it. His latest attempt to side-step Congress and undermine the successful bipartisan welfare reforms of 1996 will not be tolerated by the members of this House. “Republicans have a clear record of strengthening the work requirements at the heart of the 1996 welfare reform bill, and we stand with the 83 percent of Americans who want to see them upheld, and not undermined through the substitution of a weaker policy. “Rather than weakening welfare’s work requirements, the President should acknowledge the success of these bipartisan reforms and focus himself on removing tax and regulatory barriers from the private sector so that Americans can find jobs.” House Joint Resolution 118 will counter the overreach of the Executive by: Disapproving of the President’s regulatory effort to weaken welfare reform; Preventing the administration from implementing its plan to waive the work requirements of the 1996 welfare reform law; and Preserving the critical reforms of ‘96 that helped lift millions of American families out of poverty. An identical measure to H.J. Res. 118 is being considered in the Senate. Four Facts About Today’s Vote to Preserve Key Welfare Reforms (Courtesy of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce) Today the House will consider a joint resolution disapproving of the Obama administration’s attempt to undermine welfare reform. Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Kline (R-MN) joined Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) and Republican Study Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) in introducing H.J.Res. 118 to block this latest example of executive overreach and preserve policies that have helped millions of low-income families. Here are four facts about today’s vote on H.J.Res. 118: Fact #1. The resolution protects bipartisan reforms that have successfully helped families in need. For the first time in our nation’s history, the 1996 welfare reform law promoted work as an essential component to helping low-income families achieve self-sufficiency. The results exceeded expectations: The number of individuals on welfare dropped by 57 percent; poverty among single-mothers fell 30 percent; black children living in poverty dropped to its lowest level in 2001. These facts point toward successful policies that should be strengthened through future bipartisan cooperation, not unilaterally weakened through executive fiat. Fact #2. The resolution reins in the president’s unlawful and unprecedented waiver scheme. The welfare reform law provides limited and explicit waiver authority to the administration. Nowhere does that waiver authority include the law’s work requirements. According to the Government Accountability Office, no administration has ever granted a waiver of the work requirements – until now. In fact, the Department of Health and Human Services has previously denied requests by states to waive the work requirements citing its lack of authority to grant such a waiver. Fact #3. The resolution demonstrates the right of Congress to review the president’s welfare waiver rule. Not only does the administration lack the legal authority to grant waivers of the welfare work requirements, it is trying to advance its controversial waiver scheme through an end run around Congress. The Government Accountability Office has declared the administration’s waiver plan is a rule under the Congressional Review Act and must be submitted to Congress for review. However, the Obama administration has refused to follow even this basic legal process. Fact #4. The resolution stops a flawed rule that will lead to more government dependency. Before the 1996 welfare reform law, many families were trapped in a cycle of dependency and poverty. Individuals in need of assistance spent an average of 13 years on welfare. By undermining the centerpiece of welfare reform, the president’s waiver plan will unwind the progress we’ve made in moving families off welfare and into the workforce. Recent reports on food stamps provide a startling warning. After President Obama suspended the work requirements in the food stamp program, the number of able-bodied adults receiving food stamps doubled. The facts are clear: today’s vote on this important resolution will protect policies that have helped millions of families in need and rein in the president’s unlawful executive overreach.

09.14.2012	"The Obama Administration's energy policies have failed the American people," Congresswoman Foxx stated. "Keystone was squashed, but a half billion taxpayer dollars were approved to be wasted in support of now-bankrupt Solyndra." "The inept largess share: f t FOXX: NO MORE SOLYNDRAS For the Sake of Taxpayers, the Inept Largesse of Big Government Bureaucrats Has Got to Stop Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), a member of the House Energy Action (HEAT) Team, today spoke out in defense of taxpayers and in support of the No More Solyndras Act (H.R. 6213) in the House of Representatives. H.R. 6213 passed with a bipartisan vote of 245-161. “The Obama Administration’s energy policies have failed the American people,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “Keystone was squashed, but a half billion taxpayer dollars were approved to be wasted in support of now-bankrupt Solyndra.” “The inept largesse of Big Government bureaucrats has got to stop. The No More Solyndras Act will help impose protections for taxpayers against the politically-motivated spending binges that stream from this Administration.” No More Solyndras To watch Rep. Foxx’s floor statement, click here. Courtesy of the House Energy & Commerce Committee: The “No More Solyndras Act,” draws upon the lessons of the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s investigation into the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) $535 million loan guarantee to Solyndra, the California solar panel manufacturer that ultimately went bankrupt last September. Here are some of the startling facts discovered during the committee’s investigation into the Obama administration’s highly touted stimulus “success story”: 1) The White House ignored its own experts’ warnings. The administration was warned that Solyndra was a bad bet from the beginning. One Obama administration Office of Management and Budget (OMB) employee wrote in an email in March of 2009 that the Solyndra “deal is NOT ready for prime time.” Another DOE employee prophetically warned that Solyndra would be out of cash in September 2011 – the exact month that the company was raided by the FBI and its doors were shuttered. 2) Solyndra’s rushed approval was for a previously scheduled press event. Documents obtained by the committee show the White House rushed to approve the loan in spite of the warning signs to coincide with the press event for Solyndra’s groundbreaking. An e-mail between OMB staff noted, “Given the time pressure we are under to sign-off on Solyndra, we don’t have time to change the model…” As scheduled, Vice President Biden appeared via satellite at the groundbreaking ceremony just days later and touted Solyndra’s ability to create “permanent jobs.” 3) DOE failed to monitor Solyndra’s financial condition. While a 2010 SEC filing showed Solyndra had never reported a profit, was experiencing negative cash flows, and had cancelled a $300 million initial public stock offering, the DOE failed to adequately monitor Solyndra’s financial condition. After this filing, and after Solyndra laid off employees, Republican members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee began asking questions about the Solyndra loan. Solyndra later attempted to mislead members of the committee by producing a document in July of 2011, entitled “Exceeding Expectations: Solyndra Today” that claimed the company’s financial condition was improving. 4) The Obama administration stonewalled the committee’s investigation. After OMB’s refusal to provide any of its communications and internal documents regarding Solyndra, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations was forced to issue a subpoena in July 2011, for documents pertaining to the loan. Four months later, after the White House refused to respond to the committee’s request for documents, the committee issued two subpoenas to President Obama’s and Vice President Biden’s Chiefs of Staff for Solyndra-related documents. 5) Solyndra went belly up precisely when predicted. On September 6, 2011, Solyndra, the company that President Obama heralded as “leading the way toward a brighter and more prosperous future,” filed for bankruptcy, resulting in the loss of nearly 1,900 jobs. Just 2 days later on September 8, 2011, the FBI raided the Fremont, California company. Regrettably, the bankruptcy wouldn't have come as a surprise to the Obama administration. In an August 2009 email, DOE staff warned that Solyndra would be out of cash in September 2011: "(T)he issue is cash balances… (T)he model runs out of cash in September 2011 even in the best case…" (See Footnote 191 for The Solyndra Failure HERE.) 6) No regrets. In an interview on October 3, 2011, ABC News asked President Obama whether he had any regrets over the Solyndra deal. The president replied, “No I don’t,” and simply that, "hindsight is always 20-20." Several months later the president doubled down on deflecting responsibility for Solyndra’s failure by stating, “But understand: This was not our program, per se.” Even as recently as July of 2012, the Acting Executive Director of the DOE Loan Program Office called the program responsible for Solyndra an “enormous success.” 7) The Department of Energy’s restructuring of the Solyndra loan violated the law. The committee’s investigation discovered that DOE knowingly violated the law when it restructured the terms of the loan guarantee and put the interests of wealthy investors ahead of taxpayers. The committee also found DOE employed the “Clinton Defense” in distorting the definition of the word “is” in the statute to legally justify subordination. OMB’s oversight and review of Solyndra’s restructuring occurred under then-director, now White House Chief of Staff Jack Lew’s tenure. Despite warnings from an agency analyst that saving Solyndra could cost taxpayers more than allowing the solar company to fail, Lew failed to stop the restructuring when he had the opportunity. (See section VII of The Solyndra Failure HERE.) 8) It wasn’t just Solyndra. Documents obtained by the committee exposed a startling relationship between Solyndra and another stimulus-backed project. Solyndra was a key supplier for Prologis’ Project Amp, a solar panel installation project and the recipient of a partial loan guarantee for $1.4 billion. The committee’s investigation showed the White House was well aware of Solyndra’s deteriorating financial condition when it allowed DOE to move forward with Project Amp. DOE would later use the relationship between Project Amp and Solyndra as a key bargaining tool to push for a second restructuring while directly engaging in last minute negotiations between Solyndra and the Project Amp sponsor. Additionally, other DOE loan guarantee recipients under the same loan guarantee program have either failed or are running out of cash. It is this program that the “No More Solyndras Act” phases out. 9) Solyndra backers had close political connections to the White House. As reported by ABC News, "One of Solyndra's major investors was George Kaiser, an Oklahoma billionaire who raised between $50,000 and $100,000 for Obama during the 2008 election." ABC also reported that "Kaiser is one of several Obama campaign supporters who had a stake in companies that later received federal loans…" George Kaiser was closely involved in important decisions related to Solyndra through the life of the loan guarantee. According to the committee’s report, “Individuals connected to the George Kaiser Family Foundation (GKFF) — whose primary investment arm, Argonaut, was Solyndra’s largest shareholder — played important roles in a series of critical discussions and negotiations with DOE. George Kaiser, whose fortune funds the GKFF, was closely involved in financial decisions related to Solyndra, often authorizing key disbursements and restructuring proposals, as well as in Solyndra’s lobbying, public relations, and government procurement strategies in Washington.” (See page 4-5 of The Solyndra Failure HERE) 10) As Solyndra’s bankruptcy unfolds, it’s like rubbing salt into the taxpayers’ wound. While American taxpayers are stuck footing the bill for the Solyndra failure, Solyndra’s private investors, including George Kaiser, now stand to gain hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks from Solyndra’s bankruptcy.

09.13.2012	"Members of the House Education & Workforce Committee did what we had to do today to protect successful welfare reforms from being gutted by the Obama Administration," Congresswoman Foxx stated. "The bipartisan welfare reforms of the mid-nineties were cen share: f t A Successful Policy like the 1996 Welfare Reform Merits Defending Foxx Praises Committee Passage of Resolution Preserving Work Requirements for Welfare Programs Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today praised the passage of House Joint Resolution 118 from the Education and Workforce Committee. H.J. Res. 118 will preserve federal work requirements for welfare programs from being dismantled by President Obama’s Health and Human Services Department. “Members of the House Education & Workforce Committee did what we had to do today to protect successful welfare reforms from being gutted by the Obama Administration,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “The bipartisan welfare reforms of the mid-nineties were centered around work requirements for capable individuals. That particular commonsense reform helped pave a way for many Americans and their families to escape cyclical poverty, and got many of them off the welfare rolls altogether. A successful policy like that merits defending.” “Why the President and his HHS Secretary decided to attempt to undermine the success of welfare reform is beyond me. Only Congress can change public law, not the Executive. The majority of members stand with the 83 percent of Americans who want to see welfare work requirements upheld.” The success of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act is well documented: The number of individuals on the welfare rolls dropped by 57 percent; Poverty among all single mothers fell by 30 percent; Poverty among black children dropped to its lowest level in 2001; and Employment and earnings among single mothers increased significantly. H.J. Res. 118 will: Convey the disapproval of Congress for the Obama Administration’s attempt to bypass the legislature and weaken welfare reform; Prevent the Administration from implementing its unilateral plan to waive the work requirements of the 1996 Welfare Reform Law; and Preserve critical reforms that have helped lift millions of American families out of poverty. Background On July 12, 2012 the Obama Administration’s Department of Health and Human Services issued an information memorandum announcing it would be unilaterally waiving the work requirements central to the 1996 Welfare reforms enacted by a Republican Congress with the support of President Bill Clinton. The 1996 Welfare Reform Act includes a clause that specially prohibits the Executive Branch from changing the work requirements established within the law. The Government Accountability Office’s General Counsel, Lynn H. Gibson, weighed in on the Executive’s unilateral action on September 4, noting that the memorandum issued by HHS on July 12 “is a statement of general applicability and future effect, designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy with regard to TANF… Accordingly, the Information Memorandum is a rule under the Congressional Review Act.” As a rule, he continued, the HHS policy directive “must be submitted to Congress and the comptroller general before taking effect.” H.J. Res. 118 will advance to the full House of Representatives for consideration next week. An identical version of the resolution is moving through the Senate. In addition to her support of H.J. Res. 118, Foxx is a cosponsor of H.R. 6140, the Preserving Work Requirements for Welfare Programs Act. Like H.J. Res. 118, this legislation would specifically prohibit the President’s Health and Human Services Secretary from acting outside the limits of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act by waiving work requirements. # # #

The National Security and Job Protection Act (H.R. 6365) is the 2nd piece of legislation to be passed through the House of Representatives that would spare the military from the brunt of these cuts. “The President and Congressional Democrats have got to stop holding defense hostage in order to advance their class warfare agenda,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “At minimum, the President should submit a plan to the American people for how he expects our military to absorb these cuts without compromising national security. He’s failed to do even that.” “Republicans are ready and willing to work with the President to maintain our strong military in the midst of this uncertain world. I urge the Senate to leave tax demagoguery for another day and immediately take up the National Security and Job Protection Act and send it to the President.” The following are some of the effects the Defense sequester will have, if allowed to persist by President Obama: 200,000 soldiers and Marines will be separated from service, bringing forces well below pre-9/11 levels; Ability to respond to contingencies in North Korea or Iran will be jeopardized; The ground force will be at its smallest since 1940; The U.S. fleet will have fewer than 230 ships, its smallest level since 1915; The Air Force will have its smallest tactical fighter force in history; The nuclear triad that has kept the U.S. and 30 of its allies safe for decades will be in jeopardy; and Two BRAC rounds of base closings. What Military Leaders are Saying about the Coming Sequester: Defense Secretary Leon Panetta:“If the maximum sequestration is triggered, the total cut will rise to about $1 trillion compared with the FY 2012 plan. The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the Department… Facing such large reductions, we would have to reduce the size of the military sharply. Rough estimates suggest after ten years of these cuts, we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history.” General Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:, “[S]equestration leaves me three places to go to find the additional money: operations, maintenance, and training. That’s the definition of a hollow force.” General Ray T. Odierno, Chief Of Staff, United States Army: “Cuts of this magnitude would be catastrophic to the military…My assessment is that the nation would incur an unacceptable level of strategic and operational risk.” Admiral Jonathan W. Greenert, Chief of Naval Operations:“A severe and irreversible impact on the Navy’s future.” General James F. Amos, Commandant of the Marine Corps:“A Marine Corps below the end strength that’s necessary to support even one major contingency.” General Norton A. Schwartz, Former Chief of Staff, United States Air Force:“Even the most thoroughly deliberated strategy may not be able to overcome dire consequences.” # # #

But we also recount how in the midst of fear and uncertainty, so many Americans acted as heroes and gave of themselves for the sake of their country and their city, and to help their fellow man. “The darkness of that day did not prevail, nor will it. An attack meant to bring us to our knees instead brought us together, and prompted a generation of protectors – Airmen, Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines – to rise up in defense of freedom and in pursuit of peace. “So today, in our thoughts and prayers we lift up the families of the fallen in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania; we give thanks for the bravery of first responders who ran toward the burning buildings, and away from safety; we honor the men and women whose last moments were committed to love of country and their fellow man; and we pray for the safety of those men and women still deployed throughout the world on the mission that began that day. “May we live worthy of their legacy.” # # #

The announcement of Whitaker’s achievement was made today by Education Secretary Arne Duncan. “Whitaker Elementary School has made Winston-Salem and all of North Carolina proud,” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx stated. “Its status as a National Blue Ribbon School reflects countless hours of hard work on the part of students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Congratulations to each of them! It is wonderful to know that children are being so well prepared at Whitaker Elementary School for bright, successful futures.” “Schools honored with the National Blue Ribbon Schools award are committed to accelerating student achievement and preparing students for success in college and careers,” U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said. “Their work reflects the conviction that every child has promise and that education is the surest pathway to a strong, secure future.” Whitaker Elementary, and other honorees, will be recognized at a November awards ceremony in Washington, D.C. Whitaker’s principal, Mrs. Brenda Herman, and one Whitaker teacher will be invited to the event where they will receive a National Blue Ribbon Schools placard and a flag to signify the school’s great achievement. Schools were designated as Blue Ribbon based upon the marked improvement in standardized test scores achieved by their student bodies, or by overall national excellence in reading and math test performance. Education Department heads from each of the fifty states nominate public schools for Blue Ribbon recognition. The Council for American Private Education nominates private schools. # # #

The 12.5 million Americans still actively looking for work, to no avail, deserve better from their government than the adventures in overspending, overtaxing, absent budgets, and bureaucratic bloat that have defined this Administration. “President Obama’s lack of understanding with regard to the private sector has led him in the wrong direction at every turn. His “Stimulus,” Obamacare, heightened regulations, and squandering of taxpayer dollars on crony-capitalist ventures such as Solyndra have brought us to this point. And as today’s unemployment numbers show, a different strategy is needed to turn the economic tide “Rather than doubling down on the same wrongheaded policies of spending more and raising taxes on nearly 1,000,000 small businesses, which will cause an additional loss of 710,000 private sector jobs, the President should let go of his tax fixation, commit to tax stability for all Americans, and demand action on the 36 Republican jobs bills being ignored by his friends in the Senate.” # # #

But in fewer than four years, under his leadership and with his big-spending policies, our deficit has grown and national debt has expanded at an unprecedented rate to the historic high of $16 trillion. “Crossing the $16 trillion threshold, as our country did today, should give each and every American pause. A powerful and prosperous nation should not be shackled by interest and debt. “American families work hard to manage and minimize their debt, aiming ultimately for debt freedom. Choices are made to reduce spending, cost compare, work harder and longer, and forgo niceties, all because families know debt stands in the way of household thriving and peace-of-mind in retirement. But rather than work with Congressional Republicans to apply those commonsense principles, President Obama has overseen a government growth and spending binge on failures such as “Stimulus,” Obamacare, and Solyndra. “The fact that our children and grandchildren are on the hook for this debt is a shame. And just as no parent would wish a debt-ridden future upon their children, so too do we as citizens want better for our country.” # # #
08.01.2012	President’s Tax Hike Plan Will Cost 710,000 Jobs the Country Cannot Afford to Lose Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) stood up for American taxpayers today and voted twice to stop ALL scheduled 2013 tax increases. A bipartisan majority in the House voted with Foxx to defeat President Obama’s tax plan that would increase taxes on 940,000 small businesses next year. Immediately after, by a bipartisan vote of 256 – 171, the House passed the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act (H.R. 8) to maintain current tax rates for all Americans. “Raising taxes will make it harder for small businesses to grow and create jobs,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “Any plan that seeks to increase taxes on the American people in order to blunt the consequences of Washington’s overspending ought to be a non-starter, especially in this dragging economic recovery. “We need more Americans working, not fewer. But the President’s tax hike plan will cost an estimated 710,000 jobs our country cannot afford to lose. That is why I cast my vote today in support of the Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act and tax relief for ALL Americans. “Washington’s money problems are the result of years of choices to overspend on failures like “Stimulus,” Obamacare, Solyndra, and bailouts. They do not exist because the American people are not taxed enough. “There is a great deal Congress can do to remove obstacles to private sector job creation. In addition to passing the more than thirty jobs bills awaiting consideration in the Senate, both houses need to reform the United States Tax Code to make it simpler, flatter, and fairer – not a loophole haven for corporate lawyers. The Job Protection and Recession Prevention Act we passed today lays the groundwork for pursuing such reforms.” # # #

The legislation is comprised of seven separate regulatory relief bills, including Representative Foxx’s H.R. 373, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. “Every year Washington imposes thousands of rules on the private sector and local governments. Hidden in those rules are costly mandates that make it harder for small businesses to hire. "At the very least, policymakers and unelected regulators should know the cost of their dictates. The Unfunded Mandates Information & Transparency Act will help restore honesty and transparency to federal mandates and ensure Washington bureaucrats are held accountable for seeking public input and considering the negative consequences, in dollars and in jobs, prospective mandates will impose on the economy. "Five years of work went into advancing this legislation. And as millions of Americans remain unemployed, it is my hope the Senate acts immediately to lessen the load unfunded mandates place on job creators.” For more information on Representative Foxx’s Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act see the attached fact sheet and the following coverage by the Washington Times (Season for Relief from Big Government: More Transparency Would Help Curb Untracked Spending) and the Competitive Enterprise Institute (Cut Down on Unfunded Mandates: Part I, Part II, Part III). # # #

07.18.2012	"All of us have the best of intentions when it comes to helping students afford a college education. And we all agree debt should not be a foregone conclusion in higher education," Rep. Foxx concluded. "However, we must not forget heavy-handed federal reg share: f t The Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, chaired by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today held a hearing entitled, “Keeping College Within Reach: Exploring State Efforts to Curb Costs.” The hearing brought together state and higher education leaders to discuss state-led initiatives to address rising college costs. "In recent months, the issue of rising college costs has shifted to the forefront of our national discourse – and rightly so, as millions of young people struggle to manage school debt and find job opportunities in the lagging economy," Rep. Foxx noted in her opening remarks. “Annual tuition and fees at public universities have increased 72 percent since 2001, and the cost of private institutions and two-year degree programs have similarly increased.” As our economy continues to struggle, state officials have been forced to make difficult budgetary decisions, such as reducing aid to higher education institutions. National Association of State Budget Officers Executive Director Scott Pattison explained state funding for higher education will be “unalterably different from the past” due to budget restrictions, adding, "Now more than ever, public higher education institutions and state officials will need to work together to improve access and performance while spending resources wisely and cutting costs." In recent years, several states have taken steps to develop innovative programs that promote better use of limited resources while also encouraging higher education institutions to reduce the student debt burden. For example, Louisiana and Florida have successfully implemented comprehensive articulation agreements, which make it easier for students to transfer course credits between state institutions. “Today, students can enroll at any community college in Louisiana, earn the Louisiana Transfer Degree—either an Associate’s of Arts degree or an Associate’s of Science degree and transfer to LSU or any of the state’s 14 universities with junior status,” said Dr. Joe May, president of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. "As a result of this initiative, the average student saves $2,117 while the state of Louisiana saves $1,930 per transfer student...It is estimated that, on average, students would save over $10,000 of the cost of a Bachelor of Art's [degree]." Indiana and Pennsylvania have introduced ‘pay for performance’ structures that offer additional state resources to high-performing postsecondary institutions with the best retention, completion, and placement rates. According to Indiana Commissioner for Higher Education Teresa Lubbers, “Funding for our state’s colleges and universities should be tied to key values and needs, especially higher graduation rates and credentials that lead to greater economic opportunity for students and the state.” Ms. Lubbers also noted Indiana’s new performance funding formula is “rewarding successful remediation strategies, establishing targets for credit attainment, and incentivizing institutions to produce graduates in fields that support Indiana's economic-development goals." “All of us have the best of intentions when it comes to helping students afford a college education. And we all agree debt should not be a foregone conclusion in higher education,” Rep. Foxx concluded. “However, we must not forget heavy-handed federal regulations often yield results contradictory to their aim, weighing down states with another layer of burdensome red tape. Instead of leveraging new mandates on states and institutions, we should encourage innovation by continuing to highlight the successful efforts being made at the state and local level.” Today’s hearing builds upon a previous Higher Education and Workforce Training Subcommittee hearing that explored ways higher education institutions are working to lower tuition and help students graduate with less debt.

What we know from military personnel at all levels is that if the defense sequester takes effect on Ja share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement today in response to the House of Representatives’ bipartisan decision to pass the Sequester Transparency Act (H.R. 5872), the latest in a series of actions taken by House Republicans to avert and draw attention to the devastating, nonstrategic funding cuts set to hit the United States Military in 2013: “Few Congressional responsibilities rise above the Constitutional imperative to provide for the strong national defense of the United States of America. What we know from military personnel at all levels is that if the defense sequester takes effect on January 1, the consequences will be ‘devastating,’ leaving the United States with its smallest ground force since the World War II era and a decimated technological arms advantage. Gutting our military in this manner does not have to happen, though. Congress has a choice. “House Republicans have chosen to find a better savings solution that doesn’t compromise national security or put 200,000 of America’s men and women in uniform in a position of uncertainty. “Our proposals to maintain a strong national defense by countering the sequester with strategic cuts from other areas of government have been met with inaction in the Senate, just like more than thirty Republican jobs bills. If the President and Senate refuse to put forth a sequestration solution of their own, the least they can do is be honest with the American people about the real impact a weaker military will have on the economy and national security. That honesty will be compelled by the Sequester Transparency Act.” The Sequester Transparency Act requires President Obama to submit a report to Congress detailing how his administration plans to implement the budget sequestration cuts scheduled to take effect January 2013. The report must include an estimate of the sequestration percentages and amounts necessary to achieve the reduction for each spending category. In addition to the Sequester Transparency Act, the House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the Department of Defense Appropriations Act (H.R. 5856) that reflects House Republican solutions to the sequester consistent with those passed in the Sequester Replacement Reconciliation Act (H.R. 5652) in April which more than offset the cost of the sequester through targeted deficit reduction. # # #

The Repeal of Obamacare Act (H.R. 6079) passed the House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 244 – 185. The repeal legislation will cancel Obamacare - its twenty-one imminent tax increases, myriad new regulations, higher health care premiums, and $1.76 trillion price tag. “Obamacare fails at its basic objectives and makes it harder for small businesses to create jobs,” Congresswoman Foxx stated. “Defending the taxes and failures of Obamacare places jobs at stake. In an economy that’s already struggling, and in an era of unprecedented big-government debt, the American people cannot afford Obamacare. We owe it to the American people to start fresh on real health reform – with the people leading that discussion. Passing the Repeal of Obamacare Act will give us that opportunity.” Some of the failed objectives of the President’s law are listed below: The President’s health law promised to create jobs immediately. In reality, the Congressional Budget Office estimates there will be 800,000 fewer jobs by 2021 because of Obamacare. The President’s health law promised not to raise taxes. In fact, Obamacare includes twenty-one separate tax increases – twelve of which will impact the middle class. The President’s health law promised not to add to the deficit. However, it will add at least $340 billion to the deficit and its overall cost projections have ballooned to $1.76 trillion over ten years. The President’s health law promised to allow patients the option to keep their current coverage. Today, twenty million stand to lose their current coverage and the doctors they “like.” The President’s health law promised to make health care more affordable. But family premium costs have already increased more than $1,000. The Repeal of Obamacare Act now proceeds to the Senate for consideration.

I share: f t “Independence Forever.” President John Adams offered those, his last public words, on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence. Today his words are just as fitting as we commemorate the 236th anniversary of that same Declaration. The uniquely American opportunities to raise families in freedom and work toward the pursuit of dreams are ours because fifty-six men chose to risk everything to sign the Declaration of Independence, and thousands more stood to fight for its principles. In breaking ties with England, these patriots changed the landscape of history, and on the presumption that all men are created equal, made possible the birth of a free and independent United States. The miracle of their accomplishment warrants a joyous July 4th celebration. In fact, President John Adams wrote to his wife that Independence Day “ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade, with shows, games, sports, guns, bells, bonfires, and illuminations, from one end of this continent to the other, from this time forward forever more. “ Our North Carolina celebrations certainly won’t disappoint his standards. But as we celebrate, let us remember that we are able to do so because brave men and women still stand ready to give their last full measure of devotion to the cause of freedom. Today we give thanks for them and remember the loved ones awaiting their return. Many family celebrations will surely feel the sting of their absence as our troops tend to liberty’s cause throughout the world. America is the shining city on a hill, the last best hope of earth. And she is entirely worth fighting for. May we be mindful of the price paid by many for her preservation then and now, and may we be willing to sacrifice just as greatly for freedom. Sincerely, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx

The red tape and bureaucracy associated with the so-called ‘gainful employment’ regulation would have severely limited students’ academic options and made it impossible for many schools to respond quickly to local workforce needs without pre-approval from the Secretary of Education.

But due to the Attorney General’s obstinate refusal to cooperate with Congressional investigators and honor lawful subpoenas, members had no choice but to forcefully demand openness and transparency on behalf of the American people by voting to affirm today’s contempt resolutions. Disappointed as I am, I find today’s actions more than justified and hope they will be instrumental in delivering the answers victims of this operation seek.” The House affirmed two separate resolutions finding the Attorney General in contempt – one criminal and one civil. The criminal resolution passed by a vote of 255-67. The civil resolution passed by a vote of 258-95. The criminal contempt resolution will be referred to the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia for enforcement. The civil contempt resolution will allow the House to take the Attorney General to court in an effort to compel him to turn over the lawfully subpoenaed documents. Members of Congress led by Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) and Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) have been investigating Fast and Furious since the early months of 2011. Subpoenas issued to the Department of Justice for documents relating to Operation Fast and Furious have not been honored as fewer than 8,000 of the more than 100,000 pages requested have been furnished to Congressional investigators. Fast and Furious is the failed operation run by the Department of Justice’s Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms division that authorized the sale and trafficking of illegal weapons in the United States and across the Mexican border. Guns sold through Fast and Furious were found at the scene of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry’s murder in December of 2010.

06.28.2012	"This decision on its face establishes a number of troubling precedents our country will wrestle with for years to come. Among them, that government can compel its citizens, under threat of tax, to make purchases and decisions as though they were subjects share: f t Court Decision Sets Troubling Tax Precedent, but Congress Can Legislate with a Narrower View Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) issued the following statement today upon the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Obamacare: “I am greatly troubled by the Supreme Court’s decision today validating the President’s unprecedented overreach into the lives of American citizens, and recasting Obamacare as a tax on the American people. “This decision on its face establishes a number of troubling precedents our country will wrestle with for years to come. Among them, that government can compel its citizens, under threat of tax, to make purchases and decisions as though they were subjects, redefine the limits of federalism, and establish itself or its delegates as the unquestionable arbiters of patient care. The American people resoundingly disapprove of the President’s attempt to redefine the relationship between citizens and government in those terms, and I had hoped our Justices would see that our Constitution aggressively shields this foundational relationship from such federal expansion. “More than two years ago when President Obama and Democrats ramrodded Obamacare through Congress, I was appalled. The President’s promises for openness and transparency with the American people were broken in a process that excluded the public from having a say in health care reform. That broken process, overseen by the President, was a precursor to the broken way in which the federal government will handle patient care– with patients on the periphery and a select few in Washington calling all the shots. “President Obama and the proponents of his health law promised it would cut health care costs, expand insurance, and not raise taxes. But even prior to its full implementation, Obamacare has proved to be a hindrance, not a help, to the health care market and to broader economic recovery. Health care premium costs are up over $1,000 per family, 20 million are at risk of losing their current health insurance, 48% of businesses aren’t hiring to brace for rising health care costs and latent tax increases, and by 2021, the Congressional Budget Office estimates there will be 800,000 fewer jobs because of the President’s health law. “America’s health care objectives haven’t changed since the President’s law passed, but today they are far more distant from being realized. We still want greater access to quality, affordable patient-centered care, and the best way we can go about achieving those ends is through repealing Obamacare in its entirety and starting fresh on health care reform with the American people as our partners. This is, and will remain, among my top priorities in Congress.” To read the Court’s full decision on the President’s health law visit www.foxx.house.gov. # # #

Padgett won the competition with a piece created with pen and ink entitled, Homeland. His art work will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., for the next year. This is the second year the Art Competition winner was chosen via Facebook voting. “This competition is a once in a lifetime chance for young North Carolina artists to display their work in the United States Capitol,” Foxx said. “I am impressed by Noah’s artistic abilities and look forward to meeting him at the official award and art installation ceremony.” In the spring of every year, the United States House of Representatives hosts a Congressional Art Competition for high-school artists. The contest promotes attention to the arts by recognizing talented young artists from across the nation. This year’s winning artwork by Padgett, who lives in Boone, NC, will be featured along with winning submissions from other congressional districts in the United States Capitol. About the Congressional Art Contest: Each year Members of Congress from around the country hold contests within their districts to choose winning pieces of art by high school students. Since this competition was created in 1982, hundreds of thousands of high school students have participated at the local level. The winning student from the 5th District is invited to Washington, D.C., for the ribbon-cutting ceremony and has his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year.
04.18.2012	The Amendment limits the president's authority to set aside federal lands share: f t Congresswoman Virginia Foxx offered an amendment to the Sportsmen’s Heritage Act yesterday that would require presidential monument designations provided for under the Antiquities Act to be approved by the state legislatures and governors in states where the proposed monument is located. Lawmakers passed Rep. Foxx’s amendment and the House passed the Sportsmen’s Heritage Act 274 – 146. “Currently, a national monument designation allows for the president unilaterally to impose further restrictions on the use of federal lands without consulting the states affected by the designation. This amendment adds a layer of accountability to the process by requiring the approval of the legislatures and governors of the states where monuments are proposed to be located,” Rep. Foxx said. “Following concern over a leaked draft internal Department of the Interior memo in 2010 outlining 17 potential sites for the president to exercise the Antiquities Act authorities, applying to over 13 million acres in 11 western states, President Obama stated that he will consult state authorities when considering use of these restrictions which can impact the economic, recreational, energy development, agricultural, and environmental opportunities of a state. My amendment builds on this consensus about the importance of local and state input in this process,” Foxx concluded. More information: FOX News: House bill increases hunter access to public lands

02.28.2012	U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation to repeal two excessive federal regulations affecting colleges and universities. share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 28, 2012 CONTACT: Press Office (202) 226-9440 Today, the U.S. House of Representatives approved legislation to repeal two excessive federal regulations affecting colleges and universities. The Protecting Academic Freedom in Higher Education Act received bipartisan support in a vote of 303 to 114. Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who introduced the Protecting Academic Freedom in Higher Education Act last summer, applauded passage of the legislation. “As we have seen many times before, onerous federal regulations always come with a price and that price is always paid by taxpayers - in this case, students and parents,” Rep. Foxx said. “It’s time to take a comprehensive view of the problems facing our nation’s higher education system and eliminate burdensome federal regulations that pile unnecessary costs on institutions and students. I’m pleased this legislation received the bipartisan support it deserves, and I urge swift Senate consideration of this important proposal.” Watch Rep. Foxx’s floor remarks on H.R. 2117 here. House Committee on Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) spoke in support of H.R. 2117 on the House floor, stating, “The legislation before us today is driven by a simple goal: to ensure Washington isn’t adding to the boondoggle of rising college costs by imposing burdensome regulations… Each year, the average higher education institution spends a significant amount of time and money complying with federal regulations and reporting requirements, costs that can trickle down to students’ tuitions and fees… H.R. 2117 will repeal two particularly problematic regulations, protecting academic institutions and prospective students from significant financial and bureaucratic burdens.” Watch Chairman Kline’s full remarks here. The Protecting Academic Freedom in Higher Education Act has received support from numerous organizations representing higher education institutions and students, including: The American Council on Education, on behalf of 98 public and private organizations SUNY Empire State College Excelsior College National Governors Association The RAMC Coalition of Community Colleges U.S. Chamber of Commerce Western Governors University To learn more about H.R. 2117, click here. # # #\
02.27.2012	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05), introduced legislation (H.R. 2117) that would repeal two Department of Education regulations that inject the federal government into issues that are traditionally academic or state affairs. This legislation is expected share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Kate Meriwether February 27, 2011 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05), Chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, introduced legislation (H.R. 2117) in June that would repeal two Department of Education regulations that inject the federal government into issues that are traditionally academic or state affairs. The bill repeals a new federal credit hour rule that sets a federal definition of a credit hour and it also repeals what are known as “state authorization” regulations. This legislation is expected to be considered on the House floor this week. “These two regulations are a classic case of federal government overreach, which will unnecessarily restrict colleges and universities and will result in fewer choices for students,” Foxx said. “Plus, by curbing choice and making it difficult for institutions to expand their programs, these regulations will stifle job creation within the higher education sector at a time when we need new jobs more than ever.” "Congresswoman Foxx's bill takes a necessary step toward halting federal overreach into colleges and universities," said House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN). "This legislation will help protect student choice, reduce job-destroying regulations, and encourage the establishment of more innovative programs to better serve both students and the local workforce." H.R. 2117 repeals the Department of Education’s “state authorization” regulation, which forces states to follow federal rules when granting a college or university permission to operate within the state. The regulation may require distance education programs to get authorization in every state where its students live in order to participate in federal student aid programs. This could force some schools to go through a lengthy authorization process in all fifty states or stop accepting students from more rural states. The legislation also repeals part of the federal credit hour regulation. It specifically overturns the rule creating a sweeping federal definition of a credit hour. Many school officials are concerned that this regulation will restrict their ability to determine the number of credit hours for each course, which is an inherently academic function. While the credit hour is important to the distribution of federal student assistance, institutions of higher education fear they will be required to get government approval before creating new courses and programs. “Many colleges and universities find these inflexible new regulations confusing and nearly impossible to comply with,” Foxx said. “This heavy-handed regulation threatens to crush the very innovative new programs we need to make education more affordable and efficient. The sooner we repeal these rules the sooner we can get on with the business of improving the quality of higher education in this country.” ###

"As we look back over the past three years, it is easy to see that the president's policies have failed. The evidence is the number of underemployed and unemployed Americans we still have today. The White House said unemployment would never reach 8 percent if the "stimulus" was approved and unemployment has been above 8 percent for 36 straight months. "It is clear the that the White House just doesn't get it and we need a new plan to revive our nation's economy. The House Republicans have proposed 30 plus jobs bills all of which have fallen on the deaf ears of the president and Democrats in the Senate. It is time to put division and politics aside and take an honest look at what our country really needs." ###

"Today's announcement by the White House is not a compromise on policy, it is a gimmick masquerading as a compromise. The White House simply doesn’t get it. The president gave lip service to the importance of the First Amendment. This is simply another in a long line of actions that either ignore or assault the constitution. “The so-called “fix” ignores the First Amendment and is government intrusion into personal decisions on religion and health care. Forcing insurance companies to provide free contraceptives does not fix anything and opens up new issues. Who will pay for these contraceptives if the institutions do not cover the cost? I am concerned that Americans who currently have health insurance will be forced to subsidize these "free" contraceptive services. This is just another reason why I have voted for and continue to support the repeal of the president's health care law." ###

The bill to freeze the pay for members of Congress and federal employees, H.R 3835,passed the House 309-117. "It's offensive to those unemployed Americans struggling to find a job to see unionized federal employees continue to enjoy comparatively high compensation, which is used to pay dues to government unions, which spend heavily to elect candidates who promise them concessions," Foxx said. ####
01.24.2012	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx issued the following statement after President Obama's State of the Union address. share: f t CONTACT: 202-225-2071 Tonight, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx issued the following statement after President Obama’s State of the Union address. “President Obama’s State of the Union address sounded very similar to speeches we have heard over the past three years. We have heard many of these promises before. “Our nation is in the midst of an economic crisis, which is due in large part to this Administration’s failed economic policies. The President promised while peddling his stimulus package that it would create jobs and keep unemployment under 8 percent. Instead unemployment continued to increase reaching double digits. Since the President took office, our unemployment rate has been over 8 percent every month. President Obama has presided over the longest period of sustained high unemployment since the Great Depression and nearly half of all Americans are classified as poor or low-income. “The only way to get us out of this mess and put our economy back on the right track is to move forward on a path of cooperation. I urge President Obama to work with Congress to advance the nearly 30 bipartisan jobs bills that remain stuck in the Democrat controlled Senate. “When the President took office he promised to cut the job-killing deficit in half. Instead the deficit has nearly doubled in the three years he has been in office. We simply must stop spending money that we don’t have and burdening the next generation with a mountain of debt they will never be able to overcome.” ###

"It is disappointing that President Obama has forgotten his promise of transparency and decided to appoint three new members to the controversial, activist National Labor Relations Board without any input from the U.S. Senate," said Chairwoman Foxx. "This administration seems to be more interested in giving handouts to organized labor than in actual job creation and bipartisanship. These recess appointments will further call into question future NLRB decisions."

Hales said. “Applicants for Service Academy nominations tend to be driven and know what they want in life—just the sort of young people we need to be the leaders of tomorrow.” Col. Hales will be serving on Foxx’s Service Academy Nomination Board alongside four other members of the Nomination Board from across the 5th Congressional District. The other members are David Helsley from Forsyth County, Dale Collie from Watauga County, Col. Joe Cansler from Iredell County and Judge Mitchell McLean from Wilkes County.

The amendment, H.J.Res.2, requires the federal government to operate under a balanced budget and not run a deficit. “The federal government spends and borrows far too much,” Foxx said. “That fact was illustrated once again this week when the national debt topped $15 trillion. “A balanced budget amendment is a simple and commonsense step to address the exploding national debt and runaway government spending. It already works for the 49 states that have a balance budget amendment and it’s time it worked for a federal government awash in red ink. “While I prefer and have cosponsored an even stronger balanced budget amendment with specific restraints on government spending levels, this is still a historic opportunity that should not go to waste.” Under the Constitution, a two-thirds majority of each chamber of Congress is required to propose an amendment to the Constitution, and approval by three-fourths of the states is subsequently required to ratify a constitutional amendment. The House voted on a balanced-budget amendment in 1995, reaching the required two-thirds vote threshold for adoption. However it failed by one vote to reach the required two-thirds threshold in the Senate. The current proposed balanced budget amendment requires that federal spending in any year does not exceed total receipts for that year, unless three-fifths of each chamber votes to incur a budget deficit. Each year the president is also required to submit a budget proposal that is balanced or that would generate a surplus. The amendment allows Congress to waive the measure's provisions for any year in which a congressional declaration of war is in effect.

The bill, the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), allows law-abiding gun owners with valid state-issued concealed firearms permits or licenses to carry a concealed firearm in any other state that also allows concealed carry. “This bill ensures that law-abiding Americans’ right to defend themselves and those they love is not eliminated simply by crossing a state border,” Foxx said. “Recognizing concealed carry permits across all states that issue such permits will reduce confusion and help law-abiding concealed-carry permit holders remain in compliance with the law when traveling.” Importantly, H.R. 822 does not set up a federal permit system or create any new federal regulation of concealed carry permits. It does, however, require all permit holders to follow all firearm laws of the state they are in, ensuring that states are allowed to set their own rules for carrying concealed weapons. The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act passed the House 272-154 with broad bipartisan support.

The bills address a number of topics including, economic growth, tax reform, regulatory reform and energy policy. “These 15 bills represent the efforts of House legislators on a number of fronts to spur private sector job creation and economic growth,” Foxx said. “The Senate is standing squarely in the way of these bills even getting a fair, up or down vote. If Majority Leader Reid is serious about encouraging job creation then he needs to get serious about allowing votes on these 15 bills.” “Unlike President Obama’s proposals, these pieces of legislation are focused on freeing the private sector to create jobs and fuel the growth of our economy. His proposals include exactly what we don’t need: more bureaucrats, more wasteful spending and more job-destroying regulation. The best way to get Americans back to work is to encourage business to grow, to remove obstacles that impede entrepreneurs and innovators and show America’s job creators that we are still a nation that values success.” To learn more about the jobs and economic growth legislation passed by the House and awaiting action in the Senate, please visit: http://majorityleader.gov/JobsTracker/.
10.27.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) voted today for legislation (H.R. 674) to repeal a federal mandate to require state, local and federal governments to withhold three percent of payments made to companies that do business with the g share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill repeals harmful 3% withholding tax Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) voted today for legislation (H.R. 674) to repeal a federal mandate to require state, local and federal governments to withhold three percent of payments made to companies that do business with the government. President Obama recently said this mandate “keeps capital out of the hands of jobs creators” and has endorsed the House bill. “This federal mandate would have fallen particularly hard on small and family-owned businesses that don’t have massive cash holdings,” Foxx said. “Repealing this job-killing regulation will help free up cash for small businesses that they can use to invest in their operations and in hiring new employees.” The three percent withholding rule was originally intended to increase compliance with federal taxation. However, most companies that do business with local, state or federal governments would be unfairly harmed by the new requirement that aimed to curtail tax delinquency. Additionally, government agencies have questioned whether the additional tax revenue collected would be greater than the cost of complying with the new rule. For instance, the Department of Defense estimated that it would spend $17 billion over 5 years to comply with the rule, while the withholding provision is only expected to bring in $11 billion over the next ten years. The three percent withholding repeal bill, H.R. 674, passed the House 405-16. “There are better ways to go after tax scofflaws than punishing all job-creators with a harmful government mandate,” Foxx said. “I’m pleased that the House passed this bipartisan bill and urge the Senate to give it an up or down vote as soon as possible. More than 15 bipartisan bills focused on job-creation have passed the House and are awaiting a vote in the in the Senate. It’s past time they got to work.”

Her bill, the Disabled Veterans’ Surviving Spouses Home Loans Act, provides access to VA home loans for surviving spouses of permanently disabled veterans whose deaths are not necessarily attributed to their service-related disability. “As we approach Veterans Day, we should ask ourselves if this Congress doing all that can be done for our veterans,” Foxx said before the House. (video) “This bill maintains our promise not only to the men and women that have served in the Armed Forces, but to their families as well.” Foxx’s legislation (H.R. 120) gives disabled veterans with permanent and total disabilities the peace of mind that their surviving spouses will be able to benefit from the VA Home Loan Guaranty after their death. Under current law, most surviving spouses of veterans whose deaths were not service-connected, but who had permanent, service-connected disabilities, are eligible to receive monthly compensation payments from the VA. These same spouses could not, however qualify for a VA home loan. Foxx’s bill, which passed the House as part of H.R. 2433, corrects this problem by making these spouses eligible for the loan. The Disabled American Veterans, America Legion, the MOAA and the VFW endorsed her legislation. The 2.1 million member Veterans of Foreign Wars stated in a letter of support that “allowing a military widow to utilize the VA home loan program is the right thing to do.”
10.05.2011	Taxpayer watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste has named Congresswoman Virginia Foxx a "Taxpayer Hero" for her record of voting to protect taxpayers, cut spending and to oppose wasteful government expenditures. Foxx rec share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Receives highest score among NC lawmakers in group’s vote ranking Taxpayer watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste has named Congresswoman Virginia Foxx a “Taxpayer Hero” for her record of voting to protect taxpayers, cut spending and to oppose wasteful government expenditures. Foxx received a 98% score in the group’s ratings, which was the highest score in the North Carolina congressional delegation. Foxx honored for cracking down on wasteful spending. “North Carolina taxpayers sent me to Washington to make sure their hard-earned tax dollars are carefully stewarded,” Foxx said. “Cracking down on wasteful spending means swimming against the stream of big government and profligate spenders in Washington. It is refreshing that Citizens Against Government Waste is recognizing those who work hard to get spending under control and who guard against spending waste and abuse.” Citizens Against Government Waste’s (CAGW) congressional rankings examine Representatives’ voting records to identify members of Congress who stand up for the taxpayers’ interests and also those who fail to deliver on promises of fiscal responsibility. The ratings separate the praiseworthy from the profligate by evaluating important tax, spending, transparency and accountability measures. “On behalf of taxpayers, we thank and applaud Congresswoman Foxx for her votes to cut wasteful spending, reduce taxes, and make government more accountable to taxpayers,” said CCAGW President Tom Schatz. “Unfortunately, far too many Representatives demonstrated little regard for the consequences of failing to reduce the record $1.3 trillion deficit and $14.7 trillion debt, and constituents should admonish them for their poor ratings.” The group’s 2010 ratings were based on 46 separate votes in the House of Representatives. It rated Representatives on a 0 to 100 percent scale, placing each in one of the following categories: 0-19% Hostile; 20-39% Unfriendly; 40-59% Lukewarm; 60-79% Friendly; 80-99% Taxpayer Hero; 100% Taxpayer Super Hero.

09.19.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is the lead cosponsor of new legislation to end the congressional, defined-benefit pension program. The legislation, H.R. 2913, prohibits members of Congress from participating the federal government&# share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx is the lead cosponsor of new legislation to end the congressional, defined-benefit pension program. The legislation, H.R. 2913, prohibits members of Congress from participating in the federal government’s pension program. Congressman Mike Coffman (R-CO) is the lead sponsor of the legislation. “Taxpayers are looking to Congress to cut spending and halt the growth of the national debt,” Foxx said. “Congress needs to lead by example and make sure that spending cuts are felt by those who are serving in Congress. Ending the congressional pension shows taxpayers that Congress is serious about getting our fiscal house in order.” Currently, the Congressional pension plan gives retired federal lawmakers, who have served at least five years in Congress, an annual payment equal to 1.7 percent of their salary multiplied by the number of years served—for up to 20 years. Retired lawmakers can receive an additional 1 percent for each year served after the 20-year mark. Members of Congress are required to pay 1.3 percent of their annual salary into the pension plan. While H.R. 2913 prohibits current or future members of Congress from receiving any pension credits for additional years of service, it would honor any retirement benefits already accrued before the bill takes effect. Members of Congress are also required to continue to pay into Social Security and can participate in the Federal Thrift Savings Plan (401k), which is available to all federal employees. “Winding down congressional pensions will illustrate that Congress is willing to shoulder the same kind of cuts that the rest of the federal government faces,” Foxx said. “This is the kind of leadership Americans expect of their representatives.” Foxx also voted this year to reduce congressional staffing and office budgets by approximately $80 million, by voting for H.R. 1473 ($55 million in cuts) and H.R. 2551 ($39 million in cuts). H.R. 1473 was signed into law and H.R. 2551 passed the House and is awaiting consideration in the Senate.

This year is the 224th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. “George Washington probably said it best when he said that ‘the Constitution is the guide which I never will abandon,’” Foxx said. “Thanks to the foresight of visionaries like Washington we enjoy freedoms unrivaled in the history of man, in no small part because we are a nation of laws, not of men.” “For more than 200 years our Constitution has served us well, standing as a source of stability for the nation in times of peace as well as times of tumult. Its tenants endowed America with a resilient tradition of liberty and limited government that we can turn to for inspiration and renewal of our system of government by and for the people. “Our Constitution is a timeless monument to America’s founding ideals. As a representative to Congress, it is an honor and sacred duty to protect and uphold this document. I encourage fellow North Carolinians to read our Constitution and be inspired by its staying power and by the genius of limited government and the system of checks and balances.” Note: The Constitution can be read online at the National Archives’ web site.

Sarai Whittington, who is a senior at Millers Creek Christian School, completed the program in August. “Sarai’s hard work and scholarship should make her family and community proud,” Foxx said. “She has proven to be a committed student of congressional procedure and her success in the page program is a testament to her passion for learning and public service.” In addition to receiving instruction and training about government and the operations of Congress, House pages worked in the Capitol each day carrying out a variety of duties. These duties included delivering correspondence within the congressional complex, answering phones in the House Cloakrooms, and preparing the House Floor for legislative sessions. “It was an honor to experience our government from the inside during one of the most important debates in our countries history involving the debt ceiling,” Whittington said. “Hearing our country's leaders discussing this very important issue was thrilling. By being a Congressional Page, my eyes were truly opened up to how our government operates.” Whittington participated in what ended up being the last class of House pages ever, as House Speaker Boehner and Minority Leader Pelosi announced that the page program would be shut down after operating for more than 200 years. When she graduates from high school Whittington plans to attend college to study to be a physical therapist. She has been accepted to Lenior-Rhyne University and is in the midst of the application process at other colleges.

Even though I preferred an alternative to this bill, this bill represents the best opportunity to cut spending, permanently reduce the deficit and enact a Balanced Budget Amendment. “After decades of unbridled government growth, this bill stops big government in its tracks. It moves us towards a balanced budget amendment avoids tax increases and puts tough caps on spending. The Budget Control Act also reduces federal spending by an amount greater than the increase in the debt limit. Never before has Congress linked increases in the debt limit to such large spending reductions. Despite the bill’s flaws, it is a promising first step to tackling our long-term debt problem.”

The bill would cut spending by more than $100 billion next year and by $6 trillion over the next ten years. Additionally, H.R. 2560 caps federal spending as a percentage of economic output and starts the ball rolling on a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. “Cutting spending isn’t easy and that’s why this bill is so historic—because it actually makes meaningful and enforceable spending cuts,” Foxx said. “Congress has ignored the reality of our rising indebtedness for too long. With the Cut, Cap and Balance Act we are addressing Washington’s spending and debt problems head on and making sure that the government pays its bills on time.” In June Foxx signed a letter to House Speaker John Boehner urging him to consider legislation that would enact a Cut, Cap, and Balance strategy for tackling the national debt. H.R. 256, the Cut, Cap and Balance Act, includes three major provisions. First, it cuts spending by $111 billion in 2012 and by $6 trillion in the next ten years. Then it places a statutory cap on the level of federal spending as a percentage of the economy. Finally, the bill starts the process on sending a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution to the states for ratification. It includes a $2.4 increase in the debt limit, but the increase is only enacted if the balanced budget amendment passes both the House and Senate. “We’re long overdue for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution,” Foxx said. “Nearly every state in the nation has some form of a balanced budget amendment—it’s time the federal government followed their lead. Passing this historic bill demonstrates that Congress can get our budget in order and also pay for our national priorities. I hope the Senate follows the House’s lead and takes up the Cut, Cap and Balance Act.” The Cut, Cap and Balance Act passed the House 234-190 with bipartisan support. Foxx also released a video interview today with Congressman Jim Jordan, Chairman of the Republican Study Committee.

Dan Prouty, who teaches at East Wilkes High School, is the first teacher from Wilkes County to complete this teacher continuing education program run by Foxx’s office. “Mr. Prouty demonstrated a real enthusiasm for understanding the in’s and out’s of Congress and the federal government and it was a real pleasure to have him with me in Washington for the week,” Foxx said. “When school starts in the fall his students at East Wilkes will no doubt enjoy a first-hand account from the trenches of how Congress works.” Foxx and Dan Prouty in Foxx's Washington office. The annual Teacher in Congress program allows one Fifth Congressional District school teacher to travel to Washington, D.C. for a week of intensive learning and curriculum development activities during the summer school break. Foxx created the program in 2007 to offer teachers a taste of the real workings of Congress and the federal government while experiencing the day-to-day life of a congressional Representative. By supplying teachers with hands-on opportunities, the program helps local schools enhance their civics and history curriculum. “Getting to see your representative at work in the Capitol is far superior to reading about it in a text book,” Prouty said. “And spending the week in Washington doing research while trying to keep up with Congresswoman Foxx made for some vivid experiences that I’m eager to share with my students.” During the past week Prouty attended Rules Committee hearings, Education Committee legislative markups and votes on the House floor. He also toured the White House and other Washington landmarks and accompanied Foxx during much of her daily schedule. Additionally, his schedule included research time at the Library of Congress and National Archives and briefings with House and Senate staff. Prouty is in his second year of teaching at East Wilkes and plans to integrate his Washington experiences into his civics coursework and into the annual East Wilkes sophomore trip to Washington, DC that he helps lead. Prouty is a 2009 graduate of Appalachian State University and a graduate of North Wilkes High School. He currently lives in North Wilkesboro.

Foxx kicks off the tour with a visit today to Appalachian State University’s Solar Homestead project in Boone, NC. “High energy prices are a major drag on our economy,” Foxx said. “Constituents all across the Fifth District have taken a hit from the high cost of energy. That’s why I’m spending the next three days focused on learning how energy costs and federal energy polices impact my constituents. I’m eager to hear how businesses, local governments and North Carolina families are dealing with the high fuel prices and how some are exploring alternative energy sources.” In addition to her visit to ASU’s Solar Homestead project today, Foxx will also visit local farms, small businesses and regional transportation providers. On Thursday Foxx plans to learn how Carolina Heritage Vineyards in Elkin, NC is using alternative energy to power its vineyard and winery operation. She will also visit Hemric Farms in Yadkin County to see how high fuel prices and federal ethanol policies are impacting the bottle line of a local poultry, cattle and tobacco farmer. On Friday Foxx will learn about how fuel price increases are affecting regional transportation providers and will ride a regional bus route across the Fifth District from Boone, NC to Winston-Salem, NC. Foxx will also tour the facilities of a local trucking company in Statesville, NC and discuss with company employees how fuel prices affect the company’s ability to invest and hire new workers. “We need an all-of-the-above energy policy that embraces conventional energy sources and alternative energy sources,” Foxx said. “America has depended on Middle Eastern oil for too long. By developing more American-made sources of energy—both conventional sources like oil and gas and alternatives like wind, solar and biofuels—we can stop the flow of dollars to anti-American petro-states that do not have our best interests in mind. I’m excited to learn more over the next three days about how we can create better energy policies and lower prices for hard-working North Carolinians.”

06.15.2011	The House Committee on Education and the Workforce today passed a bill sponsored by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) that reduces harmful federal regulation on colleges and universities across North Carolina. Foxx's bill, share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 The House Committee on Education and the Workforce today passed a bill sponsored by Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) that reduces harmful federal regulation on colleges and universities across North Carolina. Foxx’s bill, H.R. 2117, The Protecting Academic Freedom in Higher Education Act, passed the committee 27-11, with bipartisan support, Foxx’s bill repeals two new federal higher education regulations that would hamper innovation in higher education, reduce student choices and drive up the cost of college for North Carolina students. Foxx made the following statement on H.R. 2117 during the committee debate on her bill: “We are here today to repeal two burdensome federal regulations that will negatively impact states and institutions of higher education across the country. The credit hour and state authorization regulations would allow the federal government to interfere in areas that have historically been the responsibility of institutions and states. “The state authorization regulation requires states to follow federal requirements when deciding whether to allow individual colleges and universities to operate within the state. Institutions providing online education programs could be required to obtain authorization in every state where enrolled students reside in order to participate in the federal student aid programs. “Consider a rural community where few education opportunities exist. For prospective students in these regions, online education programs can provide a wealth of course options that aren’t otherwise available. But what if a higher education institution decides obtaining an authorization to offer services in the student’s state isn’t worth the hassle? Or what if the state doesn’t have the personnel to handle the volume of requests from colleges and universities? Both of these scenarios showcase the potentially serious consequences that could result from the state authorization regulation. “The equally troubling credit hour regulation establishes a federally mandated definition of a credit hour. Many institutions offer a broad range of academic programs which serve different student populations. A mid-career professional who is enrolled in a distance learning program may spend more time reading outside the classroom than an on-campus student who attends class discussions each week. A standard definition of a credit hour could discriminate against some of these non-traditional educational programs. “According to testimony offered to the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training on March 11th by Blair Dowden, president of Huntington University in Indiana, “A credit hour is not only different from institution to institution, but is different even within an institution from program to program. A scientific laboratory class is different from practicing a musical instrument which is different from engaging in a business practicum.” Simply put, the definition of a credit hour cannot be micromanaged by a one-size-fits-all federal mandate – and any effort to do so could limit innovative programs and teaching methods. “Many institutions are concerned these regulations are just the beginning of greater federal overreach into academic affairs. The American Council of Education recently sent a letter on behalf of more than 60 higher education organizations detailing shared concerns about the state authorization and credit hour regulations. In the letter, the Council wrote, “Given the almost total lack of evidence of a problem in the context of credit hour or state authorization, we see no basis for two regulations that so fundamentally alter the relationships between the federal government, states, accreditors, and institutions. Ultimately, we believe these regulations invite inappropriate federal interference in campus-based decisions and will limit student access to high-quality education opportunities.” “The presidents of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities and the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities have also condemned the credit hour regulation. In a recent letter, Muriel Howard and Peter McPherson state, “We are wary of federal involvement that could unnecessarily regulate and limit the vitality of our diverse system of higher education,” adding the credit hour regulation “stifles creativity and innovation in higher education while preserving and promoting the status quo.” Without objection, I’d like to submit both these letters for the record. “States and institutions should not be forced to answer to the government when pioneering new academic programs, and students should not have their academic opportunities limited because of thoughtless federal regulations. At the end of the day, the unnecessary state authorization and credit hour regulations will reduce local control and create uncertainty in postsecondary education. Instead of over-regulating the nation’s higher education system, we should focus our efforts on simplifying federal involvement and streamlining regulatory burdens. Decisions about how best to teach postsecondary students should be left to institutions, not Washington bureaucrats.”

That’s why I signed this letter to Speaker Boehner calling for a comprehensive spending reduction plan to put us on the path to a balanced budget.” In the letter to Speaker Boehner (available here), Foxx and the cosigners call for a set of three spending cut solutions to tame the budget deficit: Cut: enacting wide ranging spending cuts that reduce the budget deficit by half within a year Cap: setting an enforceable cap on total federal spending as a percentage of the economy, where automatic spending reductions occur if the spending cap is breached. Balance: sending a constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment with strong protections against tax increases to the 50 states for ratification. “These three approaches to keep spending in check and get the budget balanced represent a strong dose of fiscal restraint,” Foxx said. “By including a ‘cut, cap, balance’ strategy in the debt discussions we can put big-spenders on notice: we’re not going to live with the unchecked growth of big government anymore. It’s time to reduce spending and get serious about eliminating trillion dollar federal budget deficits.”
06.06.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05), Chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, today introduced legislation (H.R. 2117) to repeal two Department of Education regulations that inject the federal governmen share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05), Chair of the Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, today introduced legislation (H.R. 2117) to repeal two Department of Education regulations that inject the federal government into issues that are traditionally academic or state affairs. The bill repeals a new federal credit hour rule that sets a federal definition of a credit hour and it also repeals what are known as “state authorization” regulations. “These two regulations are a classic case of federal government overreach, which will unnecessarily restrict colleges and universities and will result in fewer choices for students,” Foxx said. “Plus, by curbing choice and making it difficult for institutions to expand their programs, these regulations will stifle job creation within the higher education sector at a time when we need new jobs more than ever.” "Congresswoman Foxx's bill takes a necessary step toward halting federal overreach into colleges and universities," said House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN). "This legislation will help protect student choice, reduce job-destroying regulations, and encourage the establishment of more innovative programs to better serve both students and the local workforce." H.R. 2117 repeals the Department of Education’s “state authorization” regulation, which forces states to follow federal rules when granting a college or university permission to operate within the state. The regulation may require distance education programs to get authorization in every state where its students live in order to participate in federal student aid programs. This could force some schools to go through a lengthy authorization process in all fifty states or stop accepting students from more rural states. The legislation also repeals part of the federal credit hour regulation. It specifically overturns the rule creating a sweeping federal definition of a credit hour. Many school officials are concerned that this regulation will restrict their ability to determine the number of credit hours for each course, which is an inherently academic function. While the credit hour is important to the distribution of federal student assistance, institutions of higher education fear they will be required to get government approval before creating new courses and programs. “Many colleges and universities find these inflexible new regulations confusing and nearly impossible to comply with,” Foxx said. “This heavy-handed regulation threatens to crush the very innovative new programs we need to make education more affordable and efficient. The sooner we repeal these rules the sooner we can get on with the business of improving the quality of higher education in this country.”
06.03.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted in favor of a measure to end U.S. military operations in Libya within 15 days. She also voted for a measure that bans the use of U.S. ground troops in Libya. share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted in favor of a measure to end U.S. military operations in Libya within 15 days. She also voted for a measure that bans the use of U.S. ground troops in Libya. “The President has failed to both make the case for war in Libya and to obtain authorization from Congress to conduct this war,” Foxx said. “It’s been more than 70 days since President Obama committed our military to this conflict without congressional consent. Continuing to use U.S. forces to prosecute the war in Libya without congressional approval is patently unconstitutional.” Foxx voted in favor of a measure sponsored by Democrat Rep. Dennis Kucinich that calls for withdrawal of the U.S. military from Libyan operations within 15 days of passage. She also voted in favor of a measure sponsored by House Speaker John Boehner that calls for a ban on U.S. ground troops in Libya. Boehner’s measure passed 268-145 and the Kucinich resolution failed 148-265. “Our founders envisioned a nation ruled by laws, not by an all-powerful executive,” Foxx said. “As a result, the Constitution specifically grants Congress the power to go to war. By failing to seek congressional approval for combat operations in Libya, President Obama is ignoring the Constitution and the will of Congress.”
06.02.2011	U.S. House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today expressed serious concerns with the Department of Education's n share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 U.S. House Education and the Workforce Chairman John Kline (R-MN) and Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training Chairwoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) today expressed serious concerns with the Department of Education’s new gainful employment regulation. “The department may have offered some minor changes, but they have failed to address adequately the harmful impact the gainful employment regulation could have on students and the workforce,” said Chairman Kline. “With this regulation, the administration has chosen to disregard the concerns of countless Americans and blatantly ignore the bipartisan will of the House of Representatives.” Chairwoman Foxx added, “This punitive regulation piles more burdensome red tape onto a select group of higher education institutions and unfairly targets career colleges that create innovative programs to serve the needs of their communities. As a result, millions of students who attend career colleges stand to lose out on valuable opportunities for career advancement and technical education. The increasingly fragile economic recovery simply cannot afford another job-destroying federal regulation.” “At a time when Americans are desperate for jobs and opportunities, it is deeply troubling the administration continues to push an initiative that will limit the ability of millions of individuals to gain the skills and training necessary to succeed in the workplace,” concluded Chairman Kline. “All options are on the table as we continue the fight to protect student choice in higher education.”
05.31.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today will vote against increasing the national debt limit. The House plans to take up a bill today that implements President Obama's request to increase the national debt limit to $16.7 tr share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Federal government has “chronic over-spending problem” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today will vote against increasing the national debt limit. The House plans to take up a bill today that implements President Obama’s request to increase the national debt limit to $16.7 trillion, a $2.4 trillion increase from current levels. “If someone has a spending problem they’re usually told to spend less and cut up their credit cards,” Foxx said. “The federal government has the worst sort of chronic over-spending problem and simply increasing its credit card limit will do nothing to fix the problem. That’s why any attempt to increase the debt limit must be tied to a serious, long-term spending reduction plan.” The debt limit, also known as the debt ceiling, is the amount that the federal government is allowed to borrow as established by Congress. The federal government recently reached the debt limit and by law cannot borrow any more money unless Congress increases the debt limit. Today’s vote is on H.R. 1954, a bill that raises the debt limit by $2.4 trillion without putting a spending reduction plan in place. “Despite the fact that more than 100 House Democrats have demanded a debt limit increase without spending reductions, this would not be a responsible way to get the federal government’s finances in order,” Foxx said. “Without strong incentives to bring spending under control, we’re just going to be back at the table raising the debt limit in another couple of years.” Over the past several weeks at least 114 House Democrats have signed a letter that calls for a “clean” debt limit increase, or a debt limit increase without accompanying spending reductions. H.R. 1954 is a “clean” debt limit increase bill.

The amendment passed t share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bars taxpayer funding of abortion in federal grant program Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) successfully amended a bill (H.R. 1216) today with a pro-life measure that bars taxpayer funding for elective abortions in a federal grant program contained in H.R 1216. The amendment passed the House with bipartisan support 234-182. “The great majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars paying for abortions,” Foxx said. “My amendment places important pro-life protections in this federal grant program to ensure taxpayers aren’t footing the bill for the abhorrent practice of abortion.” H.R. 1216 is a bill that alters a federal grant program that provides funding to teaching health centers to establish or expand residency programs. Foxx’s amendment bars this taxpayer-funded grant program from paying for abortions or paying for training abortion doctors. Her amendment also includes a conscience clause that ensures taxpayer dollars do not underwrite teaching health centers that discriminate against care providers who do not offer abortions. “Should taxpayers foot the bill for elective abortions or to train abortion doctors? I don’t think so,” Foxx said. “If organizations want to provide elective abortions or train abortion doctors they need to find someone other than taxpayers to write the checks. Taxpayers should not be on the hook for subsidizing the abortion industry.” The Foxx amendment is distinct from the Hyde Amendment in that it provides a permanent, rather than an annually renewed, prohibition of taxpayer-funded abortions and taxpayer-funded abortion training in the federal residency grant program. Foxx’s amendment received support from 21 groups including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Family Research Council Action, the Christian Medical Association, the National Right to Life Committee and the Susan B. Anthony List.

Foxx receives the Guardian of Seniors' Rights Award Now in its 19th year, 60 Plus presents Guardian awards each Congress to Democrats and Republicans alike based on their 'pro-senior' views and legislative initiatives. 60 Plus Chairman Jim Martin said, "we seniors felt we should show our gratitude to dedicated lawmakers like Congresswoman Foxx who show compassion towards the elderly by pledging to always protect Medicare, always protect Social Security, and just as importantly, to vote against wasteful spending of our tax dollars.” In an award ceremony in the nation’s capital, Martin cited Congresswoman Foxx for "her commitment to look out for America's greatest generation as well as her promise to always work to preserve Medicare and Social Security for future retirees, our children and grandchildren.”
05.11.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today introduced a bill that will spur the creation of more highway construction jobs by reforming the nation's Highway Trust Fund. Her bill, the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act, eliminates cost share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Repeals outdated Davis-Bacon rules, stabilizes Hwy Trust Fund Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today introduced a bill that will spur the creation of more highway construction jobs by reforming the nation’s Highway Trust Fund. Her bill, the Highway Trust Fund Reform Act, eliminates costly and wasteful “Davis-Bacon” labor requirements and is a cost-free way to create thousands of jobs while stabilizing the federal Highway Trust Fund. “Our Highway Trust Fund is going broke and wasteful Davis-Bacon wage mandates are only hastening its demise,” Foxx said. “By rolling back these outdated and wasteful requirements we can create thousands and thousands of jobs without raising taxes. Plus, we can keep the Trust Fund solvent and fund additional, important highway projects.” Foxx’s bill does away with so-called “Davis-Bacon” requirements that inflate the cost of highway projects by mandating artificially high wages. For instance, Davis-Bacon wage surveys are notoriously error-ridden. A recent audit found errors in 100 percent of the Davis-Bacon wage reports that were reviewed in the audit. Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics data also show that Davis-Bacon wages tend to inflate labor costs by at least 22 percent more than prevailing market rates. In other words, Davis-Bacon mandates are driving up federal highway construction costs. Additionally, Davis-Bacon requirements force businesses working on federal highway projects to comply with burdensome paperwork and reporting regulations. Government Accountability Office reports suggest that these Davis-Bacon requirements inflate costs and slow project completion. Repeal of Davis-Bacon would create more construction jobs and result in faster completion of highway projects at a lower cost. “Repealing Davis-Bacon is a common sense step that will give taxpayers more bang for their buck and will also stop proposals for gas tax increases in their tracks,” Foxx said. “After all, in the past three years the Highway Trust Fund has been bailed out to the tune of $34 billion. Inflated Davis-Bacon wage requirements are a major driver of Highway Trust Fund bailouts.” The Congressional Budget Office estimates that unless Congress acts, the Trust Fund will need an additional $110.3 billion worth of bailouts in the next 10 years. To learn more about how outdated Davis-Bacon requirements increase costs and decrease employment please read the recent Joint Economic Committee report on Davis-Bacon requirements and the Highway Trust Fund.

Her legislation, the Multilingual Services Accounting Act (H.R. 1715), requires all federal government bureaucracies to annually report how much taxpayer money is spent to provide government services in languages other than English. “Our government spends large, but undefined amounts of taxpayer money to provide government services in a multitude of languages—with little or no accountability for how this money is spent and with no information on the value of this spending,” Rep. Foxx said. “American taxpayers deserve better. They deserve a complete accounting of how their government spends their tax dollars.” Federal government agencies currently do not have to report how much money they spend to provide government services and publications in languages other than English. Foxx’s legislation, H.R. 1715, fixes this problem by requiring that federal bureaucracies report multilingual expenditures in their annual reports to the Office of Management and Budget. Without this basic accounting information, the federal government has no way of knowing how much it spends to provide multilingual services. “Responsible government must be transparent and accountable,” Foxx said. “By shining the light on how much money is spent on non-English services we can ensure tax dollars are not squandered on wasteful projects.” The advocacy group ProEnglish also endorsed H.R. 1715 as a responsible government accounting practice.

Our national resolve has once again shown its mettle. Justice has been served and notice has been sent to those who wish to bring terrorism to our shores: we will abide no act of terror against Americans and we will bring to justice those who commit them.” “Osama bin Laden’s death illustrates that in the battle between freedom and terrorism, freedom will prevail. His death is welcome news for all Americans, especially those who suffered great loss due to his acts of terror against our nation. “The successful mission that resulted in the killing of this agent of terror is cause for remembering those who were murdered at bin Laden’s hand and who died in the long campaign to bring him to justice. “This is also an occasion to thank again the many Americans who have worked tirelessly to find and bring bin Laden to justice. We owe a debt of gratitude to our military and intelligence services for all they have done in the past 10 years to combat terrorism. This past weekend, as a team of U.S. Navy Seals undertook this daring mission, we saw just how far those serving our nation will go to defend their homeland against terrorism—many thanks to them for their bravery, professionalism and dedication.”

The budget also includes an additional $6.6 trillion in spending reductions that brings government spending to below 20 percent of the economy—in comparison to the current spending levels of 24 percent of the economy. “Compared to the recent haggling in Congress over billions of dollars of spending, this budget moves the debate towards long-term solutions, rather than short-term cuts,” Foxx said. “By cutting spending by trillions instead of billions and reforming our tax code this budget bill puts us on a path to prosperity and averts the impending debt crisis confronting our nation.” In addition to cutting spending and reducing the deficit, the budget passed by the House (H.Con.Res 34.) also ends corporate welfare for bailed out companies, agribusiness and other recipients of government largess. The budget also contains a spending cap that limits the growth of federal spending to a specific percentage of the economy. Plus, the budget takes spending off of autopilot by requiring regular congressional review and approval of so-called “mandatory” spending and by fixing programs like Medicaid and Medicare that are headed for bankruptcy. “For too long the federal government has grown larger and larger, piling up huge debts and impacting more and more aspects of Americans’ lives,” Foxx said. “It’s time we asked the question, is the federal government too expensive, too large and too powerful? The answer is a resounding, ‘yes,’ and this budget begins to fix the problem and put in place safeguards to hold government over-spending in check.” The budget passed the House 235 to 193.

The vote came on H.R. 1217, which saves taxpayers $17.7 billion by cutting the prevention and public health fund. This fund contains no congressional oversight or accountability restrictions. “Imagine a huge slush fund that can be used for essentially anything that federal bureaucrats want—and you’ll have a good idea what this so-called ‘prevention and public health fund’ is all about,” Foxx said. “It’s $17 billion in taxpayers’ money that doesn’t have any congressional oversight.” The health care overhaul passed last year created a $17.7 billion ‘prevention and public health’ fund that is funded on autopilot without ongoing congressional approval or oversight. Elimination of the fund does not cut specific programs because the fund did not focus on any specific program. “As long as it meets scant guidelines about public health, this gusher of money goes out the door without a second glance,” Foxx said. “That has already resulted in reports of funding things like lobbying state governments to raise taxes on tobacco and sugary products. I don’t think most taxpayers want their tax dollars being used to push new tax increases. It’s time to eliminate this slush fund and restore common-sense spending priorities and oversight.” H.R. 1217 passed the House by 236-183.

The bill, H.R. 1363, also provides funding for the military for the rest of the fiscal year. “It’s time to do the right thing and fund our troops for the rest of the year,” Foxx said. “With this bill we can accomplish more than one goal: we prevent a government shutdown for another week and we ensure that our troops do not go unpaid for the rest of the years.” H.R. 1363 funds the federal government for one week to give budget negotiators time to hammer out a deal to fund the government for the rest of fiscal year 2011. Federal government funding expires on Friday, April 8. If a funding bill is not signed into law by Friday night the federal government will shutdown. “Taxpayers are tired of government living beyond its means,” Foxx said. “The status quo doesn’t work—it just produces ever bigger deficits and more borrowing from nations like China. This bill keeps the government running, funds our troops and also cuts $12 billion in government spending. That is the right way to honor our obligations to our military men and women and to keep our pledge to put government on a spending diet.”
03.29.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5) voted this week for a bill that ends a failed government mortgage modification program, saving taxpayers up to $29 billion. The program, known as Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), came in share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill prevents nearly $29 billion dollars in new spending Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5) voted today for a bill that ends a failed government mortgage modification program, saving taxpayers up to $29 billion. The program, known as Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), came into existence in 2009 and is widely criticized by government watchdogs like the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The bill, HR 839, passed the House 252-170. “Ending this failed program will save taxpayers money and halt a government program that gives 1000’s of homeowners false hope,” Foxx said. “By almost any measure HAMP is a wasteful program that for many homeowners doesn’t even prevent a foreclosure. At a time when the federal government is borrowing more than 40 cents of each dollar it spends, we’ve got to stop shelling out taxpayer money for programs that aren’t working.” HAMP originally aimed to help 4 million homeowners avoid a foreclosure. Instead, fewer that 550,000 have had permanent loan modifications under the program and many of these loans have returned to default status. According to the Treasury Department, every loan successfully modified under the program costs taxpayers $20,000. The Inspector General for the program testified before Congress that HAMP “benefits only a small portion of distressed home owners, offers little more than false hope, and in certain cases causes more harm than good.” The Congressional Oversight Panel also found that high re-default rates “signal the worst form of failure” and that “billions of taxpayer dollars will have been spent to delay, rather than prevent, foreclosure.” “If Washington can’t end a broken program, how are we going to make the real difficult choices to overcome today’s over-spending and record budget deficits?” Foxx said. “Getting serious about eliminating failed government programs is just one of many steps we must take to get our fiscal house in order.”

In her remarks Foxx said the U.S. should focus on developing more domestic energy supplies, including traditional sources like oil and nuclear as well as alterative sources like wind and solar. Foxx said such a policy would create jobs and help reduce the cost of energy. Foxx made the following remarks before the House (video here): “Mr. Speaker, with gas prices going through the roof, it is time to ask the question: Is this administration's energy policy working? After all, gas price haves soared by 30 percent over the past year. “We can help protect ourselves from these sky-high prices and create jobs by actively producing American-made energy. That's why I support an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes more American-produced energy, like oil and nuclear, along with alternatives like wind and solar. This will lower prices and create good American jobs while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. “Unfortunately, the Obama administration doesn't seem to get this. Its de facto drilling moratorium in the Gulf has already cost 12,000 jobs and 300,000 barrels a day of energy production. “Mr. Speaker, we need to increase production, not decrease it, or American families are going to be stuck with ridiculous gas prices that line the pockets of unsavory regimes in the Middle East.”
03.08.2011	With the 2011 tax season underway, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has introduced legislation to give taxpayers different options for paying their federal taxes. Her bill, the Federal Withholding Tax Repeal Act, does away with the federa share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill allows taxpayers to pay taxes annually or use current system With the 2011 tax season underway, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has introduced legislation to give taxpayers different options for paying their federal taxes. Her bill, the Federal Withholding Tax Repeal Act, does away with the federal mandate for withholding taxes from worker paychecks, allowing taxpayers to choose to pay their taxes once a year or to have taxes withheld in advance from each paycheck. “Tax withholding is a subtle way of disguising the true burden of federal taxes,” Foxx said. “My bill does away with the withholding mandate to give taxpayers a choice in how they pay their taxes. Some may wish to pay in one lump sum while others may wish to have their taxes withheld in advance. Under this bill, taxpayers get a choice, not a federal decree.” The federal government currently mandates that employers withhold a portion of workers’ paychecks and remit those tax payments to the government. This system was created in the 1940’s, decades after the enactment of the federal income tax. Foxx’s bill (H.R. 918) makes this withholding system voluntary. While it would not change taxpayers’ actual tax liability, it does give individual taxpayers flexibility in how they pay their tax bills: either in installments or as a single payment. “Withholding federal taxes from taxpayers’ paychecks is supposed to decrease the sting of paying taxes to Uncle Sam,” Foxx said. “However, withholding is also a clever way of disguising the true cost of the federal government. My bill seeks to not only give taxpayers new options and payment flexibility, but also to pull back the curtain on the full cost of federal taxes. It’s about increasing transparency in government as well as convenience and choice for taxpayers."

Know as the “1099” provision, it required business to file millions of new tax forms with the IRS, a burden that fell hardest on small businesses. “North Carolina small businesses and job creators hated this ridiculous new paperwork mandate—and they let me know about it,” Foxx said. “Rather than give Americans another reason to hate our tax system, the House did the right thing and repealed this job-killing mandate. No longer will small businesses have to spend hours and hours tracking down information and filing IRS forms to comply with this regulation.” The provision repealed today by the House originated in Section 9006 of last year’s health care overhaul. The provision required businesses to report to the IRS any transactions with vendors that total $600 or more over the course of a year. This amounted to a massive unfunded mandate on American job creators who faced expensive new tax paperwork and record-keeping requirements. “Small businesses work hard to stay afloat in any economic climate,” Foxx said. “This intrusive government mandate doesn’t make sense at any time, and especially not during an emerging economic recovery. By repealing this requirement, Congress is taking away a significant roadblock to productivity and job-creation.” A recent National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) Small Business Survey determined that tax paperwork, costing $74 an hour, is the most expensive burden placed on small businesses by the federal government. The NFIB supported the repeal of the 1099 provision and the NFIB’s tax counsel referred to the 1099 mandate as having a “direct negative impact on small business”.

Foxx issued the following statement on the short-term bill: share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill cuts spending by $4 billion, averts shutdown Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today voted for a two-week government funding bill that would save taxpayers $4 billion and fund the federal government through March 18, 2011. Foxx issued the following statement on the short-term bill: “This bill gives us more time to work out a longer-term solution that reduces spending while keeping the government running,” Foxx said. “Four billion dollars in cuts are a down payment on a substantial set of spending reductions that will put us on the path to balancing the budget. “Now the Senate has a job to do: pass a full-year funding bill like the House did about two weeks ago. We can’t afford the 24 percent in spending increases that became law over the past two years. Locking those levels of government spending in place is irresponsible and unsustainable. “North Carolinians want a government we can afford, not one that runs up more debt for future generations. Congress is way overdue to cut spending, since that’s what our constituents have been doing for the past few years.”
02.19.2011	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted for a government funding bill that dramatically reduces spending and funds the federal government for the rest of fiscal year 2011. The bill reduces spending by more than $100 bil share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill contains largest spending cuts in U.S. history U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted for a government funding bill that dramatically reduces spending and funds the federal government for the rest of fiscal year 2011. The bill reduces spending by more than $100 billion. “Once again, the federal government is on track to rack up the largest deficit in history this year—so it makes perfect sense for Congress to cut spending by the largest amount in U.S. history,” Foxx said. “After punting on fiscal responsibility for years, today Congress got serious and actually reduced spending—a down payment on our drive to trim the size and scope of government and get spending under control.” The House-passed funding bill, also known as a “Continuing Resolution,” funds the federal government through September 30, 2011. The House took up the bill because last year’s Democrat-controlled Congress did not pass a budget or annual spending bills and only provided for government funding through early March of 2011. In addition to dramatically reducing federal spending, the bill also included an amendment to defund Obamacare, which Foxx also supported. The House of Representatives debated the bill for nearly the entire past week. During the debate, any Representative could offer an amendment to the legislation, restoring a House tradition that had fallen by the way side under the previous House majority. “This legislation is an example of how Republicans are changing the culture of spending in Washington,” Foxx said. “We’ve gone from a trillion dollar, debt-financed stimulus bill just two years ago to a bill today that takes the stewardship of taxpayer dollars seriously. “Plus, for the first time in years, we had an open debate that gave any Representative the option of offering an amendment. This is a refreshing change from the closed process that locked many Representatives out of the legislative process in the past. It’s past time we turned the page on runaway spending and let Congress go about the business of pruning back government and spurring economic growth.”

These accounts, already available to many civilian employees, will help military families save on health and childcare expenses. “It’s about time we gave our military men and women the same sort of medical spending accounts that many of their civilian counterparts enjoy,” Foxx said. “This is the least we can do considering the sacrifices they make for our country each day.” These FSAs would result in significant savings for military families by allowing service members to set aside a portion of their income before taxes to cover out-of-pocket child care and health care expenses like co-pays, dental care and eye glasses. This benefit is currently available to civilian employees at the Department of Defense, but not to uniformed service members. Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-CA), with Foxx and Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) as lead cosponsors, introduced the legislation today. In the Senate, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced the legislation, with Sen. Richard Burr (R-NC) as lead cosponsor. The legislation is endorsed by the Military Officers Association of America, the National Military Family Association, Blue StarFamilies, The American Legion, the Association of the United States Navy andthe Association of the United States Army.

The bill, H.R. 519, is part of the House’s YouCut program, which allows taxpayers to choose which budget cuts they would like the House to enact. “This is a common sense bill to retrieve American taxpayer dollars from the U.N.,” Foxx said. “The U.N owes America this money and we should get it back as soon as possible.” U.N. holds $179 million that the U.S. overpaid into the U.N.’s Tax Equalization Fund. The U.N. continues to hold the American money because the Administration has not instructed it to return the money. H.R. 519 instructs the U.N. to return this money to the U.S. If the U.N. does not return the money, the legislation withholds the same amount from the U.S.’s contributions to the U.N.’s budget. “American taxpayers already shoulder too much of the U.N.’s bloated budget,” Foxx said. “At a bare minimum we should get this money back from the U.N. before it vanishes into thin air like much U.N. funding does.” House Republicans highlighted this bill in their YouCut program this week. The web-based YouCut initiative allows concerned Americans to cast their vote for various budget-cutting options and this week H.R. 519 was the top vote getter.

About the Tax Equalization Fund (TEF): In 2008 – 2009, the U.S. overpaid the TEF by $52.2 million. Overpaid amounts to this fund are not automatically returned to the U.S. Instead, overpaid funds accumulate at the U.N. According to a July 29, 2010 U.N. financial report, as of December 31, 2009, the U.S. has overpaid the TEF by $179,010,326. The TEF is a fund that reimburses certain U.N. staff, who are subject to U.S. income taxes, for those U.S. income taxes.

The bill, H.R. 359, passed the House 239-160. It came up for a vote under House Republicans’ YouCut program, which allows any American to weigh in on where to cut the federal budget. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 359 reduces federal spending by $617 million over the next ten years. “Bankrolling presidential campaigns during an era of record budget deficits is not a good use of taxpayer dollars,” Foxx said. “Today the Congressional Budget Office projected a massive $1.5 trillion federal budget deficit. In light of this, we’ve got to look everywhere we can in the budget for savings and the elimination of subsidized presidential electioneering is a common sense step.” Foxx is an original cosponsor of H.R. 359, which completely eliminates taxpayer funding for the “Presidential Election Campaign Fund.” This fund is used to finance presidential election campaigns and party conventions. Any money remaining in the account would be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury Department. House Republicans highlighted this bill in their YouCut program this week. The web-based YouCut initiative allows concerned Americans to cast their vote for various budget-cutting options and this week H.R. 359 was the top vote getter.

Today’s vote came on the heels of her vote last night to repeal the health care law, fulfilling a signature promise in House Republicans’ “Pledge to American” from last fall. “North Carolinians want Congress to tackle health care reform in a way that lowers costs and makes health care more accessible,” Foxx said. “Unfortunately, the health care overhaul passed last year has not halted the continual increases in health care costs and health insurance premiums—although it did create scores of new federal bureaucracies, miles of job-destroying red tape and a draconian mandate for all Americans to purchase health insurance. I think we can do better than that.” Last night the House passed H.R. 2, which repealed the health care law, by a margin of 245-189. Today the House passed H Res 9, which instructs the relevant House committees to draft new health care reform legislation for consideration by the full House. The new health care reform legislation will focus on economic growth and job creation, lowering health care premiums, empowering consumers, reducing wasteful government health care spending and covering those with pre-existing conditions. “Congress can get this right,” Foxx said. “By focusing on driving down costs and giving Americans more freedom, we will be able to enact the sort of reforms that Americans want—without busting the budget, raising record amounts of taxes or eroding individual liberty.”
01.20.2011	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today introduced bipartisan legislation that will shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and businesses. The legislation fixes loopholes in a 1995 law t share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Legislation gives local governments, employers access to critical cost estimates U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today introduced bipartisan legislation that will shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and businesses. The legislation fixes loopholes in a 1995 law that reined in expensive and unfunded federal mandates. Ultimately, this legislation will help states and small businesses better manage and forecast their budgetary needs. “State and local governments and small business owners are all too familiar with the financial burden of new federal laws and regulations,” Rep. Foxx said. “During these difficult economic times North Carolinians rely on small businesses and local governments for jobs and for services like healthcare, education and job training. My bill holds the federal government accountable to the public by exposing the hidden costs of federal policies.” The purpose of this bipartisan legislation (The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2011) is to enhance transparency, accountability, and awareness of federal mandates. It amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which ensured public awareness of the crushing financial burden of federal mandates on employers and state and local governments. UMRA’s main objective in 1995 was to force the federal government to estimate how much unfunded mandates would cost local governments and businesses and rein in out of control mandates. Foxx’s bill expands the scope of UMRA by closing loopholes that allowed certain policies to escape its reporting requirements. “New, costly regulations and legislation are often created with little thought for how they will squeeze local governments and employers,” Foxx said. “By updating this law, we can ensure that Congress and the public are aware of how federal policies financially impact the people we serve.” Foxx’s bill also requires the federal government to report on how changing the requirements for existing federal grant programs would shift costs to local governments. For instance, grant programs—such as No Child Left Behind—that are administered by states are often altered by federal legislation. Under this bill the federal government would have to report how such changes could negatively impact state or local government budgets.
01.13.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today announced that she introduced legislation to crack down on abusive political robo-calls.

Her bill, the Robo Calls Off Phones Act (H.R. 116), allows anyone who signs up for the federal government’s existing “Do Not Call” list to opt out of political robo-calls. Currently, political robo-calls are exempt from compliance with the federal “Do Not Call” list. Foxx does not do political robo-calls. “Every campaign season, like clockwork, voters are bombarded with an endless stream of political robo-calls,” Foxx said. “There is little voters can do to stop this invasion of their homes, which often happens during dinner time or even late at night. My bill fixes this problem by allowing anyone to opt out of these calls by simply signing up for the federal government’s ‘Do Not Call’ list.” Under Foxx’s legislation anyone who wishes do opt out political robo-calls need only sign up for the federal “Do Not Call” list, which currently applies to most telemarketing. Political robo-calls are exempt from the “Do Not Call” list and this bill closes that loophole. “Americans hate it when politicians make special rules for themselves, and political robo-calls are a perfect example, Foxx said. “Citizens should be allowed to stop automated political calls from coming to them just as they can stop telemarketing calls. Closing this loophole is a matter of fairness and will help bring a much needed dose of peace and quiet to North Carolina homes during campaign season.” Anyone who wishes to continue to receive automated political calls will still be able to receive them. Foxx’s legislation strictly applies to unsolicited, political robo-calls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone.
01.06.2011	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted to cut congressional budgets by five percent.

The vote reduced the operating budgets of House committees, leadership offices, and individual representative offices for 2011 and 2012 by five percent. The budget cut passed the House by a large bipartisan margin of 410-13. “North Carolina families and businesses have cut back over the past few years, while Congress spent their tax dollars with abandon—this cut to the congressional budget demonstrates that the new Congress is serious about stopping the runaway spending,” Foxx said. “This won’t solve the budget problems overnight, but Congress should lead by example and reduce its own budget first.” The House budget cuts will total approximately $35.2 million in the first year. In the past 10 years the total budget for Congress increased by 87 percent. Today’s spending cut represents the first such cut in recent memory. House Republicans are also moving towards restoring 2008 spending levels across the federal budget, which could save $100 billion in taxpayer dollars. “Today’s spending cut is the first of many that I will push for this year,” Foxx said. “If Congress plans to reduce government spending we must set the tone by reducing our own budget first. While spending cuts are never without pain, every day we wait to reduce spending is another day that future generations are saddled with debt.” In September 2010, Foxx joined House Republicans in pledging that they would change the way Washington works and begin cutting job-killing federal over-spending immediately. This spending cut on the second day of the 112th Congress marks the first such cut since Republicans took control of the House.

The subcommittee oversees federal policy on U.S. colleges and universities and is part of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which will be chaired by Rep. John Kline (R-MN). “Education is a cornerstone of a prosperous and secure society and if the United States is to remain competitive in the global marketplace quality higher education will be one of keys to maintaining our edge,” Foxx said. “So I’m very honored to chair the subcommittee on higher education and am excited to roll up my sleeves and work towards making our higher education system even better while carefully stewarding taxpayer dollars.” “I’m pleased to welcome Rep. Foxx back to the Education and the Workforce Committee where she will assume a key leadership role for the 112th Congress," said Rep. Kline, the incoming chairman of the panel. "Her experience as an educator and legislator make her uniquely suited to chair the subcommittee that oversees our colleges and universities and help shape policies that affect students and taxpayers.” Foxx previously served on the Education and the Workforce Committee from 2005-2008. She also brings a strong background in higher education to her new role atop the subcommittee. Before her election to Congress in 2004, Foxx taught at and served as an administrator at several North Carolina higher education institutions, including Appalachian State University, Caldwell Community College and Mayland Community College. Foxx is a graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill where she earned her A.B. in English and her M.A.C.T. in Sociology and of UNC-Greensboro where she earned an Ed.D. in Higher Education/Curriculum.

Foxx has consistently called for stopping all the tax increases that are set to go into effect in less than a month. “We are in the midst of real economic difficulties, small businesses are struggling to stay afloat and our economy desperately needs all the capital investment it can get,” Foxx said. “That’s why it is incredibly irresponsible to push a tax hike that will harm many small businesses and job creators in North Carolina and across the country.” “This idea that it’s ‘the government’s money’ is nonsense. Increasing taxes on the very people who help create jobs while millions remain jobless is reckless and tone-deaf to the wishes of the American people. This Democrat tax increase will likely hit 50% of small business income—dealing a heavy blow to hopes for a strong economic recovery. “There is bipartisan support for stopping all the tax hikes. This effort to hike taxes on job creators is political theater and nothing else. The American people deserve better.”

She also urged the Obama administration to make government data sharing efforts more secure and less susceptible to unauthorized users. “This massive breach of sensitive diplomatic information is nothing less than a blatant attempt to harm the United States’ national security,” Foxx said. “WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange’s talk about transparency is just so much hot air. It is clear that his agenda is decidedly slanted towards tearing apart U.S. foreign relations and eroding our national security. He is a criminal, nothing more.” “The federal government must use every means possible to bring Mr. Assange and any other perpetrators of this data breach to justice. Their irresponsible and possibly treasonous behavior has put the lives of our men and women serving abroad in new danger. They must be held accountable for their actions.” “At the same time, the federal government and the Obama administration must learn from this information sharing disaster. Too many prying eyes have access to too much sensitive information. The federal government must do a better job of weeding out those with too much information access and improving our data-sharing protocols so that this sort of catastrophic breach doesn’t happen again.”

Foxx first made her no earmark pledge in 2007 and will maintain her no earmark pledge in the 112th Congress. “Washington’s earmark system is a symptom of out-of-control spending and backroom deal-making,” Foxx said. “It’s time to focus on balancing our federal budget and cutting out earmarks is an important first step. “Earmarks, while a small part of federal spending, are emblematic of how the federal budget is prone to being loaded up with non-priorities and pet projects. Congress must tackle the record federal budget deficits and take bold action to reduce federal spending. As American families make tough decisions to trim their own budgets, Congress needs to learn to do the same.” The House and Senate GOP both adopted party-wide earmark moratoriums for the upcoming session of Congress. The Senate GOP earmark ban passed earlier this week and the House GOP ban passed today. The House GOP also banned earmarks in 2010. Foxx supported both the 2010 and current earmark ban.

The deadline will be extended two weeks to November 15. Students can submit applications to Rep. Foxx’s office for the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, the Coast Guard Academy and the Military Academy at West Point. “America’s service academies provide incredible opportunities for young people eager to serve as the next generation of American leaders,” Foxx said. “The selection and training process are rigorous, but the benefit of a lifetime of service to our country cannot be overstated. With less than a month left before the extended application deadline I encourage students to finalize and submit their applications now.” The deadline for the 2010 application season is now November 15, 2010, extended from November 1. To be considered for an appointment to a service academy, an applicant must meet the eligibility requirements established by law and be nominated by an authorized person such as a Member of Congress. Students pursuing a nomination should contact Congresswoman Foxx’s District Office in Clemmons, NC at (336) 778-0211 or visit her website at www.foxx.house.gov/serviceacademy for additional information about submitting completed applications.

The deadline to file with the IRS for small non-profits who may be at risk of losing their status is October 15. “As many as 700 small non-profits in Northwest North Carolina could be at risk of losing their federal tax-exempt status if they don’t file a simple form with the IRS,” Foxx said. “By taking a half hour or so to electronically file the form by tomorrow, hundreds of small non-profits can maintain their tax-exempt status and avoid the hassle of trying to get their status back.” The IRS’s October 15 filing deadline is for small tax-exempt organizations (those who typically have $25,000 or less in annual receipts) that have not filed to retain their tax-exempt status with the IRS for three consecutive years. Small non-profits are required to file a short postcard form with the IRS each year, called Form 990-N. It can be filed online at http://epostcard.form990.org/. Small non-profits that fail to file three years in a row can lose their tax-exempt status. Many types of organizations that have not filed a Form 990-N are at risk of losing their tax-exempt status. These include local sports associations and community support groups, volunteer fire and ambulance associations, social clubs, educational societies, veterans groups, church-affiliated groups, as well as groups that assist those with special needs.

The NFIB Guardian of Small Business Award is given only to members of Congress who demonstrate their commitment to small business-friendly policies by voting favorably on key small business issues at least 70 percent of the time. During the 111th Congress those key issues included the NFIB’s opposition to the $846 billion energy tax in the 2009 cap and trade bill and the many small business mandates in the 2010 health care overhaul. NFIB President and CEO Dan Danner also praised Foxx for "standing up for small business." Danner presented Foxx with the “Guardian” award and said, “In the 111th Congress, Virginia Foxx proved that she is a champion of small business. The Guardian of Small Business Award is a token of the deep appreciation that small business owners have for elected officials like Congresswoman Foxx who promote and protect their right to own, operate and grow their businesses.” For a high-resolution photo of NFIB’s Dan Danner presenting the Guardian of Small Business Award to Foxx, please click here.

Today is the 223rd anniversary of the signing of the United States Constitution, also known as Constitution Day. “Thanks to the great wisdom of the framers of our Constitution, more than 200 years later Americans enjoy freedoms that are the envy of the world,” Foxx said. “We are a privileged nation with a strong heritage of liberty and limited government. I can think of few things I’d rather do on Constitution Day than talk with young people about our Constitution and the freedoms it enshrined in law 223 years ago. During her visit to the three schools Foxx will talk with students about the Constitution’s creation and how it serves as the foundation for government in the United States. She will also be giving students a pocket-sized copy of the Constitution. “Our Constitution remains the foundation of our unique system of government and individual liberty,” Foxx said. “It is a resilient, timeless charter and a towering achievement in the cause of freedom. Above all, it is a monument to America’s founding ideals.” “As a member of Congress it is an honor and sacred duty to protect and uphold the Constitution. I hope that many North Carolinians will find the time this week to read our Constitution and be reminded of our freedoms, of the genius of limited government and checks and balances and of the privilege it is to be an American.” Note: The Constitution can be read online at the National Archives’ web site. Any 5th District constituent who would like a hard copy of the U.S. Constitution can contact Foxx’s office at (866) 677-8968.

The vote is the latest in House Republicans’ YouCut program, which aims to cut spending and reduce the national deficit. Nearly 100,000 active federal employees owe $962 million in unpaid taxes, according to the IRS. “This proposal could save up to a billion dollars,” Foxx said. “While most federal workers are paying their taxes and abiding by the law, there are some who enjoy taxpayer funded jobs and refuse to pay their fair share. This must stop.” Under current law, the IRS is the only federal agency that can fire employees who do not pay their taxes. Under this proposal, which is cosponsored by Foxx, other federal agencies would be able do the same. The proposal, H.R. 4735, allows federal agencies to fire employees who are seriously delinquent tax-dodgers. It applies to those federal workers who are serial offenders and refuse to pay their taxes. Federal employees who may be slightly behind on their taxes or are working with the IRS to pay their tax bills will not be affected. “Prevention is the best medicine,” Foxx said. “This proposal prevents future tax cheating by halting the practice of allowing tax-dodging federal employees to duck and cover. During these times of record deficits we must ensure that unscrupulous federal workers aren’t cheating the very taxpayers who pay their salaries.”
09.08.2010	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today announced the launch of her new congressional web site at www.foxx.house.gov.

The new site integrates social networking, up-to-date information about constituent services and background on legislation and votes in Congress. “As more and more constituents interact with me through the web, it became clear that my website needed an update,” Foxx said. “The Internet is one of the best tools available for communicating with constituents and my new website uses a variety of technologies to keep constituents informed about the issues before Congress, including Twitter feeds, congressional videos and online legislative search tools.” Web-design and communications experts at the non-partisan Congressional Management Foundation recently named Rep. Foxx’s web site one of the top ten in the House of Representatives. Foxx’s redesigned site builds on the success of her old website and introduces new user-friendly features like social media sharing and smoother site navigation. “This new website is a one-stop-shop for constituents who need information about the federal government, or who want to know what is happening in Congress or who simply want to get in touch with me about the important issues facing North Carolinians,” Foxx said. The new web site also includes tools to assist constituents in applying for federal grants, resolving issues with federal government agencies or securing a nomination to one of the five Service Academies. In addition, the site outlines the application process for students who wish to serve as congressional interns or pages. Congresswoman Foxx today also reminded constituents to check out her congressional Twitter feed at www.twitter.com/VirginiaFoxx. Her Twitter feed is frequently updated with pictures from her daily activities, videos, links to the latest congressional news and anything else that might be on her mind. Nearly 3,500 other people have already discovered that it is one of the best ways to keep up-to-date with Congresswoman Foxx.

The workshop was conducted in cooperation with the Concord Coalition, a national, non-partisan grassroots organization that has developed a program to foster understanding of the federal budget process. “Many taxpayers are very concerned with how the federal budget is drawn up,” Rep. Foxx said. “This workshop gives local taxpayers an inside look at the budget and let them use their spending priorities to create a model federal budget.” The Concord Coalition program, Principles & Priorities, teaches participants about the federal budget and provides realistic insight into how some of the policy proposals in today’s news would affect the operations of the federal government. Principles & Priorities is an interactive exercise in which participants learn about balancing the federal budget by making many of the same policy decisions that lawmakers face. Participants will be able to review current spending priorities, suggest principles for the future, and then apply these principles by selecting from several dozen priorities being discussed in Washington. “With record federal budget shortfalls, fiscal responsibility is more important than ever for the federal government,” Foxx said. “This budget forum promises to help local taxpayers grasp just how much—or sometimes little—goes into creating a federal budget each year.” By considering issues such as federal spending, taxes, and social programs, participants gained firsthand experience in the complex issues of today's fiscal environment. They then recommended a package of policies to put America on a sound budgetary foundation for the next several years. The workshop concluded with a wrap-up discussion of the budget results and the lessons learned from the exercise. This event took place on August 23 at the Lewisville Library located at 6490 Shallowford Road in Lewisville, NC and ran from 6:30pm to 8:00 pm. This event was free to the public.

Foxx is the lead Republican co-sponso share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Works Across Party Lines to Clarify Federal Stalking Statutes and Increase Penalties for Offenders Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) praised the passage of the STALKERS Act (H.R. 5662), a bill that improves federal stalking laws to ensure victims are protected and offenders are punished. Foxx is the lead Republican co-sponsor of the bill, which today received the public endorsement of ESPN reporter Erin Andrews, who is also publicly advocating for stronger stalking laws. Foxx released the following statement on the STALKERS Act passing the House: “The House did the right thing by passing the STALKERS Act today. We should have zero tolerance for those who prey on others through stalking or cyberstalking. Stalkers inflict real pain in the lives of thousands of people every year, and with the growing threat of cyberstalking, federal stalking laws are long overdue for an update. “This is an especially important bill for America’s women—an estimated 1 in 12 of whom will be a victim of stalking during their lifetime. This bill helps protect women who may be vulnerable to stalkers, especially those who are trying to escape abusive relationships and potential stalkers. “By giving law enforcement the tools to protect the vulnerable and fully prosecute all forms of stalking we can fight back against the fear that victims of stalking must deal with on a daily or even hourly basis. Stalking is a crime that can lead to domestic abuse and violence. By cracking down on stalking we can help prevent the vile crime of domestic violence. “The STALKERS Act will put the fear where it belongs—in the hearts of the lawbreaking stalkers who prey on others. Under this important bill, prosecutors will be empowered to crack down on both conventional stalkers and today’s malicious cyberstalkers, helping make our country safer by reining in the abuses of stalkers lurking on our streets and on the web.” About the STALKERS Act, H.R. 5662: Currently, federal laws are focused on “conventional” acts of stalking (following someone across state lines, sending unsolicited mail, or making harassing phone calls). With the advent of cyberstalking these protections are inadequate. The STALKERS Act would increase the scope of existing laws to cover acts of electronic surveillance, such as spyware, bugging, video surveillance, and other new technologies as they develop. The bill empowers law enforcement to prosecute any act of stalking that is “reasonably expected” to cause another person serious emotional distress. Currently, federal laws cannot be enforced unless a victim demonstrates a reasonable fear of physical injury, but stalking victims often do not recognize significant threats until it is too late for law enforcement to intervene. The STALKERS Act would give authorities the power to stop stalkers even if a victim is not fully aware of the danger he or she may be facing. Finally, the STALKERS Act would expand the scope of federal stalking laws to give the broadest possible mandate to federal law enforcement. The bill increases the punishment for stalking offenses in certain special cases: for stalking in violation of a protective order and stalking that targets minors or the elderly. In all three cases, the maximum sentence increases by five years. The bill also requires the Attorney General to annually evaluate federal, state, and local efforts to enforce stalking laws, and submit an annual report on what works – and what doesn’t work – in the enforcement of these laws. The STALKERS Act also recently received the full endorsement of the National Center for Victims of Crime.

An estimated $20 million has already been spent on share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today voted to save American taxpayers tens of millions of dollars by eliminating taxpayer funding for roadside signs to promote the 2009 stimulus bill. An estimated $20 million has already been spent on such signs, and well over $100 million in sign spending is expected before stimulus funding runs out. “North Carolinians want more jobs, not more signs promoting stimulus projects,” Foxx said. “With record-breaking deficits, we should focus on cutting out wasteful spending and policies that help create jobs. Littering the highways with $1,000 signs to promote the stimulus is a poor use of taxpayer dollars.” $20 million has been spent on promotional signs. This is the seventh vote in House Republicans’ YouCut program, which gives every American the opportunity to suggest and vote on ways to reduce federal spending. Today’s cut brings the total spending reductions brought to a vote to more than $64 billion. Despite bipartisan support for the spending reductions, a majority of House Democrats have defeated all seven measures. North Carolinians can access the YouCut website and vote for their favorite spending cut at http://republicanwhip.house.gov/YouCut. They can also make suggestions for spending cuts on the site. Each week Congress will vote on the cut that receives the most votes. To date more than 1.3 millions votes have been cast on the YouCut site. Unfortunately, House Democrats have defeated each of the following spending cuts brought to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives: • Week one: $2.5 billion – Eliminate duplicative welfare program. • Week two: $2 billion - Eliminate federal employee pay raise. • Week three: $30 billion - Reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. • Week four: $15 billion - Sell excess federal property. • Week five: $15 billion - Prohibit hiring new IRS agents to enforce health care law. • Week six: $120 million - Prohibit taxpayer funding for union activities. • Week seven: Millions of dollars - Prohibit funding for promotional stimulus signs.

Her bill, the Disabled Veterans' Surviving Spouses Home Loans Act, provides access to VA ho share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill gives surviving spouses of fully disabled veterans access to VA loans Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) has introduced bipartisan legislation that corrects a current injustice in the VA home loan system. Her bill, the Disabled Veterans’ Surviving Spouses Home Loans Act, provides access to VA home loans for surviving spouses of permanently disabled veterans whose deaths are not necessarily attributed to their service-related disability. “America has a solemn obligation to our brave, disabled veterans and their families,” Foxx said. “This bill takes us one step closer to fulfilling that obligation by correcting a flaw in the VA home loan system.” Under current law, most surviving spouses of veterans whose deaths were not service-connected, but who had permanent, service-connected disabilities, are eligible to receive monthly compensation payments from the VA. These same spouses could not, however qualify for a VA home loan. Foxx’s bill, H.R. 5555, corrects this problem by making these spouses eligible for the loan. Her bill has been endorsed by the Disabled American Veterans, America Legion, the MOAA and the VFW upon consensus that this legislation is long overdue. The 2.1 million member-strong Veterans of Foreign Wars stated in a letter of support that “allowing a military widow to utilize the VA home loan program is the right thing to do.” Foxx’s legislation rightfully gives disabled veterans with permanent and total disabilities the peace of mind that their surviving spouses will be able to benefit from the VA Home Loan Guaranty after their death. “These veterans and their families made incredible sacrifices so that we may live free and without fear,’ Foxx said. “For their service and sacrifice, they deserve to be eligible for this benefit.”

Its tragic reach is damaging both the Gulf Coast environment and its economy. Our main priority must be to stop the leak and clean up the spill so that the people and environment of the Gulf Coast can one day return to some semblance of normalcy. “That’s why it is absolutely critical that BP be held accountable for this disaster. BP must shoulder the financial burden for the spill. That means American taxpayers shouldn’t pay a dime. “It is also my hope that the administration, which was slow to respond to this disaster, can fully deploy any resources necessary to clean up the spill. Despite early federal government shortcomings there is still an opportunity to restore confidence in what began as a disorganized and distracted effort. After all, Americans expect effective, energetic and hands-on leadership from the administration during a time of national crisis.”

Isaacs, a junior at East Surry High School won the contest with a digital color photograph of historic downtown Mount Airy entitled “Urban Silence”. “The Congressional Art Competition is a once in a lifetime chance for young North Carolina artists to display their work in the United States Capitol,” Foxx said. “I’m pleased that Elizabeth’s excellent work of art will hang in the Capitol to represent all of the fine submissions that were part of the contest this year.” In the spring of every year, the United States House of Representatives hosts a Congressional Art Competition for amateur high-school artists. The contest promotes attention to the arts by recognizing talented young artists from across the nation. This year’s winning artwork by Isaacs, who lives in Mount Airy, NC, will be featured along with winning submissions from other congressional districts in the United States Capitol. Isaacs will travel to Washington, DC on June 17 to attend the official award and art installation ceremony. (Click here for a picture of Isaacs’ winning entry) The runner up honors for the 5th District Congressional Art Contest went to Hanna Scott, a Winston-Salem resident and a senior at Forsyth Country Day School. Scott’s mixed media piece entitled "The World in a Bubble" will hang in Foxx's Washington office. About the Congressional Art Contest: Each year Members of Congress from around the country hold contests within their districts to choose winning pieces of art by high school students. Since this competition was created in 1982, hundreds of thousands of high school students have participated at the local level. The winning student from the 5th District is invited to Washington, DC for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and has his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year.

Through America Speaking Out, North Carolinians will be given a voice in setting the priorities for a national agenda. At town hall meetings, online at AmericaSpeakingOut.com, and through new communications tools, all Americans will have an opportunity to be a part of this effort. “Washington’s business as usual isn’t going to cut it anymore. North Carolinians have been speaking out, voicing their concerns with a massive healthcare bill, record-breaking levels of debt, and our nation’s jobs crisis. They’re tired of Washington’s tin ear and ready for a new agenda. North Carolinians want a Congress that acts to implement their priorities. "House Republicans are going to offer new solutions, but rather than handing an agenda down from Washington, we want to include the American people in building it. “We have offered our own ideas when we disagreed with the Democratic majority, and we are committed to our principles of smaller, more accountable government. However, we will also listen to the American people since any new agenda should start with them. The voices of the America people can still make a difference in Washington. That’s why we created America Speaking Out, to give citizens an opportunity to lend their ideas to the creation of a new national policy agenda. "All North Carolinians, regardless of party affiliation, can be a part of this unprecedented dialogue of ideas. This project will feature innovative web tools at AmericaSpeakingOut.com plus mobile applications that will bring town hall meetings directly to anywhere Americans are discussing our nation’s challenges. Changing the course of our nation and the way Washington works will require the American people to continue to speak out and for Congress to start listening. Through America Speaking Out, the people will have a voice in Washington, as well as a group ready to act on their behalf."

The new tool, called “YouCut,” allows any American to give Congress direct input on specific spending reductions. “Congress is always approving new spending and very rarely eliminating old, outdated or wasteful programs,” Foxx said. “We need to hear from North Carolinians from all walks of life about how the federal government should tighten its belt.” The new first-of-its-kind tool, available at http://republicanwhip.house.gov/youcut, gives the public a chance to vote online or via cell phone for various proposals to reduce federal spending. Each week, the House Economic Recovery Solutions Group will post five proposals to reduce wasteful or unnecessary spending on the site for a vote. The following week House Republicans will offer up the top vote-getter for a vote in the House of Representatives. “We need to listen to America’s ideas and suggestions for cutting spending and getting the federal government’s financial house in order,” Foxx said. “YouCut is a simple way to challenge Washington’s spend, spend, spend mentality and educate Americans about the difficult choices we must make. It’s not a silver bullet, but it is a step in the direction of restoring fiscal discipline to Washington.” North Carolinians can go to http://republicanwhip.house.gov/youcut to vote for one of the five weekly spending cut proposals.

These designated “key votes” are recorded floor votes on issues established as priorities on which the Chamber communicates its position prior to the vote. Those members of Congress who support the Chamber’s position on at least 70% of those votes receive the award. “The Chamber applauds Representative Foxx for supporting the private sector and job growth through these difficult times,” said Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber. “She has demonstrated great courage and we commend her.” According to the scorecard, Representative Foxx maintained a 73% rating with the Chamber this year and collectively holds a 78% ranking during her tenure in Congress. The Chamber scored Congress on 7 Senate and 15 House votes in 2009, including the economic stimulus package, legislation to promote the U.S. as a travel destination abroad, and both the House and Senate healthcare reform bills.

The honor, the Gold Mouse Award, is given to members of Congress with the best websites. Of the 435 Representatives in the House, only 21, or less than five percent, received a CMF Gold Mouse Award. “Communicating with constituents is vital to my work in Congress and a strong online presence is more important than ever,” Foxx said. “I’m very pleased that my office’s efforts to provide constituent service that is second-to-none have not gone unnoticed.” According to the CMF study, Foxx’s website, www.foxx.house.gov, ranked especially high for constituent service and clear information about how Congress works and what is happening in Congress. Foxx was the only member of Congress from North Carolina to receive the Gold Mouse Award. This is the second Gold Mouse Award for Foxx’s website; she won the award in the 110th Congress. Foxx also has an active presence on Twitter (twitter.com/virginiafoxx), YouTube (youtube.com/repvirginiafoxx) and Flickr (flickr.com/repvirginiafoxx). “Websites like Congresswoman Foxx’s serve as a prime example that we hope other congressional offices will follow,” said Beverly Bell, CMF’s Executive Director. “Congresswoman Foxx’s Web site shows that she understands how to meet the needs of her constituents online. We congratulate her for having a website that is among the best-of-the-best on Capitol Hill, and are pleased to present Congresswoman Foxx with the 111th Congress Gold Mouse Award.” The 111th Congress Gold Mouse Awards are part of CMF’s Partnership For A More Perfect Union, which seeks to improve the quality of communication between Representatives and their constituents. For this project CMF partnered with researchers from the Harvard Kennedy School, Northeastern University, University of California–Riverside, and the Ohio State University to study how members of Congress can use the Internet to improve communications with their constituents and to promote greater participation in the legislative process.

Nearly 100,000 active federal employees owe $962 million in unpa share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill allows for firing of federal workers who refuse to pay taxes Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) has cosponsored a bill that gives the federal government the ability to fire federal employees who refuse to pay their income taxes. Nearly 100,000 active federal employees owe $962 million in unpaid taxes, according to the IRS. “The vast majority of federal workers are paying their taxes and abiding by the law,” Foxx said. “But this tax season there are some federal employees who enjoy taxpayer funded jobs and refuse to pay their fair share. This must stop.” Connect with Virginia Follow her on Twitter Watch her YouTube videos Check out her Flickr page Under current law, only the federal agency that can fire employees who do not pay their taxes is the IRS. This legislation, H.R. 4735, allows other federal agencies to do the same. H.R. 4735 allows federal agencies to fire employees who are seriously delinquent tax dodgers. The bill only applies to those federal workers who are serial offenders and refuse to pay their taxes. Federal employees who may be slightly behind on their taxes or are working with the IRS to pay their tax bills will not be affected. “Prevention is the best medicine,” Foxx said. “This bill prevents future tax cheating by halting the practice of allowing tax-dodging federal employers to duck and cover. In the future, potential tax dodgers will know that federal employers will be held to high standards and expected to pay their fair share.”
04.14.2010	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) introduced a bill this week that protects American lands from unnecessary or harmful seizure by the federal government. Her bill, the Preserve Land Freedom for Americans Act, requires congressional share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Legislation preserves private property rights, citizen input Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) introduced a bill this week that protects American lands from unnecessary or harmful seizure by the federal government. Her bill, the Preserve Land Freedom for Americans Act, requires congressional approval before any American land is designated as a national monument. “Local citizens and governments should have a voice in the process of designating new national monuments in their backyards,” Foxx said. “My bill gives Congress the ability to sign off on new national monuments, instead of leaving the federal government to make unilateral land grabs.” Currently, the President has the power to designate new national monuments without congressional approval under the 100-year-old Antiquities Act. This often takes place without the full input of states and localities, which can jeopardize private property rights, economic development and job creation. “Our national monuments and parks are American treasures, rightly protected by the federal government,” Foxx said. “This legislation simply creates safeguards to protect local citizens and land owners and keep the federal government from overstepping its bounds.” Foxx’s bill gives Congress the ability to weigh on the creation of new national monuments. This would allow Representatives from areas under consideration to voice the concerns of citizens in affected areas and ensure that the federal government does not unnecessarily harm local citizens. The bill also contains provisions to ensure prospective locations for national monuments are studied for potential use, including energy development, prior to receiving a designation. Additionally, it creates a review period for citizen input and congressional approval before restrictions are placed on the land. The bill, H.R. 4996, currently has 16 cosponsors.

She also called on the Rules Committee to install cameras in the committee room where the final details of health care reform will be decided. “Why aren’t there cameras in the Rules Committee?” Foxx asked. “Why is the House trying to pass the Senate bill without even taking a vote on the Senate bill? If this bill is so great, why not have a vote and why not throw open the doors and let the public watch the process unfold?” Foxx is a co-sponsor of H.Res. 869, a resolution that instructs the House’s Chief Administrative Officer to install cameras in the hearing room of the Rules Committee and to record and broadcast its proceedings. “The procedural sleight of hand we’re seeing in Congress makes a mockery of the legislative process,” Foxx said. “Congress has a rotten bill that the American people don’t want. But instead of starting over on health care reform, we’re watching Speaker Pelosi contrive a backroom solution that neglects the desires of the American people. This is not how Congress is supposed to work.” Foxx is also a consponsor of H.Res. 847, a bill that ensures the process of finalizing health care legislation is open to public scrutiny. This measure changes the current practice of negotiating the final details of major legislation behind closed doors. Other transparency initiatives supported by Foxx: Cosponsor of H.Res. 554, a broad, bipartisan bill authored by Democrat Rep. Brian Baird that requires that any legislation be posted online in its final form for 72 hours before it is voted on. Original cosponsor of H.Res. 835, a measure to ban “phantom amendments” by requiring all committees to post bills online within 24 hours of committee approval.
03.10.2010	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has cosponsored legislation that will ensure the federal government is accounting for taxpayer money that is used to prop up the failing finance institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The legislation, the A share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Legislation forces Congress to account for billions in Fannie, Freddie bailouts Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has cosponsored legislation that will ensure the federal government is accounting for taxpayer money that is used to prop up the failing finance institutions, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The legislation, the Accurate Accounting of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Act, aims to account for the real cost of federal bailouts for the two government-run entities. “Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are burning through billions and billions of taxpayer dollars, but this bailout money is being kept off the government’s books,” Foxx said. “North Carolina taxpayers deserve to know the full cost of the bailouts of Fannie and Freddie.” In 2008, Congress initially put a $200 billion limit ($100 billion each for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) on federal bailouts for the failing institutions. But last year the Treasury Department raised the cap to $400 billion, and then on Christmas Eve 2009, Treasury quietly lifted the cap altogether, so that federal assistance is now virtually unlimited for the next 3 years. As a result of the federal government’s stealth bailout, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac losses effectively added $291 billion to the federal deficit in 2009 and will add $99 billion to the deficit for the 2010–2019 period, for a total 10 year cost of $389 billion, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. But these costs are currently treated as “off budget,” essentially sugar-coating the real price paid by taxpayers. “Pretending that the unlimited bailout for these two failed institutions isn’t costing taxpayers a fortune is wrong,” Foxx said. “It’s just the sort of big-spending, bad government that North Carolina taxpayers are tired of seeing. Congress needs to stop the legerdemain and shed some light on what Fannie and Freddie are costing the American people.” The Accurate Accounting of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Act (H.R. 4653) will move Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac “on budget.” Under the bill their losses would have to be accounted for in the budget process and their debt would be subject to the statutory debt limit.

The ratings are based on about 200 key votes from 2009 that illustrate members of Congress’ political philosophy. “North Carolina families want someone who will fight for common sense conservative solutions and who isn’t afraid to stand up to the forces of big government,” Foxx said. “On this, my record is clear. As this rating demonstrates, I am committed to small government and individual liberty. While Washington is pushing for more big spending, I will continue to call for a smaller federal government and more freedom.” The National Journal’s ratings ranked Foxx as the 19th most conservative member of Congress. These ratings are based on Foxx’s votes in favor of ending the federal government’s bank bailouts, a balanced budget proposal and federal spending caps. In addition, Foxx’s top ranking is based on her opposition to policies such as House Democrats’ $1 trillion health care bill, $862 billion stimulus bill and the “cap and trade” carbon regulation bill.

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx opposed t share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 The federal stimulus package marks its one year anniversary today. A year ago Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Washington Democrats urged Congress to pass the stimulus in order to create jobs “immediately.” Congresswoman Virginia Foxx opposed the debt-financed spending program when it passed the House last February. “A year after the stimulus package became law Washington is racking up record deficits and adding trillions of dollars to our national debt,” Foxx said. “Despite claims from Speaker Pelosi that the stimulus created two million jobs, Americans are asking, ‘where are the jobs?’” Last year stimulus backers claimed it would keep unemployment under eight percent—although today unemployment hovers around 10 percent. Proponents also told Americans that the stimulus would “create or save” millions of jobs. But since its passage, more than three million Americans have lost their jobs. “Instead of pushing big government and more spending, we need solutions that will create real economic growth. It’s time to return to spending restraint and low taxes—proven remedies that will help restore prosperity for all Americans. “At the same time the federal government should rein in policies that create an environment of uncertainty. This is holding back job growth and innovation. The prospect of government-run health care, carbon tax schemes, and handouts to union bosses are hampering entrepreneurs’ ability to expand businesses and start hiring. Let’s free our innovators and entrepreneurs to do what the do best.”
02.04.2010	The U.S. House of Representatives today voted to increase the national debt limit by $1.9 trillion. North Carolina Congresswoman Virginia Foxx voted against increasing the national debt limit, citing the federal government's runaway share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 The U.S. House of Representatives today voted to increase the national debt limit by $1.9 trillion. North Carolina Congresswoman Virginia Foxx voted against increasing the national debt limit, citing the federal government’s runaway spending. “Reckless spending requires reckless borrowing, so this vote is no surprise,” Foxx said. “Federal spending on so-called discretionary programs increased 84 percent over the past two years—and these increases have been financed entirely by new debt. The time has come to stop these out-of-touch spending increases so we don’t have to keep jacking up the national debt.” Today’s vote increases the federal government’s debt limit by $1.9 trillion to $14.294 trillion, an increase of more than $6,000 for every person in America. This is the second increase in the national debt in less than two months and is the largest one-time increase in the debt limit ever. “Speaker Pelosi may talk about reducing debt and deficits, but the facts speak for themselves: we are looking at a record-breaking amount of federal spending and the largest budget deficit in history,” Foxx said. “We must rein in federal spending and get serious about balancing the budget.” Under the President’s budget, unveiled earlier this week, the national debt will rise from $9.961 trillion at the beginning of 2009 when President Obama took office to more than $25.77 trillion in 2020—an increase of 147 percent. As a result, over the next ten years, the federal budget deficit will average $917 billion every year under the President’s budget. U.S. Debt Clock: real time debt, deficit, spending tickers.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) today issued the following statement on President Obama’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2011: “Over the past week President Obama has repeatedly called for responsible spending policies, Foxx said. “In the middle of these difficult economic times it makes more sense than ever to reduce government spending and keep taxes low. “That’s why I’m disappointed that President Obama proposed a $3.8 trillion budget that is the largest in our history. Even worse, the President’s budget creates the largest deficit in history. “This budget lacks the sort of accountability Americans want from Washington. It contains more spending, more debt and more taxes, which will not restore our economy or help unemployed North Carolinians find work. “Growing government and exploding debt are just more of the same big government policies that North Carolinians are weary of watching in Washington. While President Obama’s budget does get some things right, it unfortunately gets most things wrong. As North Carolina taxpayers continue to tighten their belts, we can do better than $1.6 trillion in new debt for more wasteful Washington spending.”
01.20.2010	United States Rep.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted today to pass a bill (H.R. 4462) to allow American taxpayers to deduct charitable donations for Haiti relief from their 2009 taxes. “Americans always respond in generosity in times of great need,” Foxx said. “The outpouring of donations and humanitarian relief in the aftermath of Haiti’s terrible earthquake last week put this generous spirit on display.” Haitians search for survivors in the wreckage after the January 12 quake in Haiti. “H.R. 4462 is a common sense response to the tragedy in Haiti. This legislation will serve to spur even greater American generosity and ensure that the compassionate Americans who donate their hard-earned money to relief in Haiti get a timely tax deduction.” Foxx is also an original co-sponsor of H.R. 4462, which will accelerate the tax benefit for certain charitable cash contributions made for the benefit of the victims of the recent earthquake in Haiti. The bill passed by a unanimous bipartisan vote. It is similar to legislation enacted in the immediate aftermath of the Indian Ocean tsunami in early 2005. This legislation would give taxpayers who make earthquake-related contributions of cash through the end of February the opportunity to claim the charitable deduction on their 2009 returns (which most taxpayers will file in April of this year).

The office is currently hiring workers to assist in the 2010 decennial census count. “High Country residents will play a pivotal role in the 2010 Census and jobs with the local Census office are a great opportunity for anyone looking a temporary work,” Foxx said. “Hard-working and dedicated local employees will be the key to a successful Census count. The High Country has much at stake in the 2010 Census and full participation is the best way for communities to receive their fair share of federal funding for the next ten years.” High Country residents interested in jobs with the local Census office can call 828-832-5920 or visit http://2010.census.gov/2010censusjobs/. Local office staff and field worker positions all offer flexible hours, including nights and weekends, in addition to weekly pay. Census taker wages start at $11.50 per hour plus 55 cents per mile of travel. Applicants for local census jobs must be 18 years of age and be a U.S. citizen or legal resident. They will also undergo a background check, be fingerprinted, and must pass a basic skills test. Note: Foxx recently interviewed an expert from the United States Census Bureau on the upcoming Census.

The grant and loan funds will be used to purchase a 2008 Kenworth T-370 single axle heavy duty pumper engine to replace an outdated vehicle. This new truck will enable the Fire Department to improve their response time, efficiency and possibly their insurance rating. This in turn will likely mean an insurance premium reduction for each resident in Pond Mountain Volunteer Fire Department’s fire district. “I remain committed to supporting local firefighters with the distribution of these critical funds,” said Rep. Foxx. “It is important that firefighters and emergency responders throughout the 5th District are given the necessary resources to perform their job and assist in protecting the citizens of their community. I am pleased the USDA has recognized the Pond Mountain Volunteer Fire Department’s needs and responded appropriately.” The grant and loan are both from USDA Rural Development. They fall under Rural Development’s Community Programs division. Community Programs administers programs designed to develop essential community facilities for public use in rural areas. Community Programs utilizes three different financial tools to achieve this goal: the Community Facilities Guaranteed Loan Program, the Community Facilities Direct Loan Program, and the Community Facilities Grant Program.

In a letter to Speaker Pelosi, Foxx along with Ranking Republican David Dreier (R-CA), Congressmen Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) and Pete Sessions (R-TX), pointed out that while the negotiations so far have been kept from public view, there is still an opportunity to honor the pledges for openness and transparency made by President Obama and Speaker Pelosi. The letter to Pelosi states: “Despite President Obama’s pledge as a candidate that negotiations on any healthcare reform would be broadcast on C-SPAN, both the House and Senate sent versions to the floor that had been hammered out behind closed doors. In the House, in particular, the floor proceedings that were broadcast were nothing more than a formality. Unfortunately, your decision to drastically restrict the amendments allowed for consideration meant there was little real debate for the public to see.” Foxx also underscored her support for H.Res. 869, a measure sponsored by Congressman Charles Dent (R-PA), which would direct the House CAO to install cameras in the Rules Committee hearing room to allow for live broadcasts. Barring that, the letter also makes clear that honoring C-SPAN’s request on behalf of the American people is the “absolute minimum the majority must do on behalf of keeping the American people informed about a process that will affect every healthcare decision made by every family, doctor, and small business for decades to come.” The full text of the letter is available here.

The bill, H.R. 4314, increases the national debt limit from $12.1 trillion to $12.39 trillion, or more than $40,300 for every person in America. “It’s business as usual in Washington” Foxx said. “We’ve got a runaway spending problem and instead of reducing spending the Democrats have once again resorted to upping the credit limit on the nation’s credit card. That may work today, but this runaway fiscal train is going to come to a screeching halt very soon.” The debt limit increase narrowly passed the House on a 218-214 vote, with 39 Democrats joining Republican lawmakers in opposition to the $290 billion uptick. Congress last raised the debt limit in February, when it enacted the stimulus bill. Foxx also opposed that measure, which raised the debt limit by $789 billion and was financed with borrowed money. “Congress has raised the national debt ceiling by more than a trillion dollars this year, thanks to a record $1.4 trillion deficit,” Foxx said. “This is not the sort of Christmas present that taxpayers were looking for this December. They expect Congress to corral its wild spending habits and stop racking up debt. Instead, we’ll probably see more of the same in the new year.” When Congress returns in 2010 it is expected to vote to increase the national debt again by as much as $2 trillion. Foxx plans to oppose such an increase, should it materialize in 2010.

Additionally, it includes $11 billion in funding for military readiness training. The bill also provides more than $100 for equipment purchases and upgrades. “While I am pleased that we were able to give our brave men and women the pay raise they deserve, I am disappointed that this bill is funded at a lower level than the domestic spending bills that were passed by the Democrats in Congress this year,” Foxx said. “We can do better.” The Democrat-controlled Congress this year increased domestic spending this year by 12 percent on average. In contrast, the defense spending bill, which passed today with a bipartisan vote of 395-34, included an approximately four percent spending increase. The defense spending bill also includes unrelated provisions including an $11.3 billion unemployment benefits extension, help with health insurance premiums for unemployed workers, and funding for small business loan programs.

Democrat leaders in Washington are discussing the use of bailout funds to finance another round of stimulus spending. “Last fall’s megabank bailout was a terrible idea, which is why I voted against it,” Foxx said. “Now, as if the Wall Street bailout wasn’t bad enough, big-spending Washington liberals want to use what’s left of the $700 billion bailout and try their hands at a second stimulus. Not only is this a bad idea, it’s not legal.” According to the law creating the $700 billion bank bailout, all unused bailout funds must be put towards reducing the national debt. It is estimated that approximately $200 billion may be returned or left over from the original $700 billion. “The only thing the bailout law got right was the plan to return unused money to the taxpayers by way of debt reduction,” Foxx said. “Now the American people may see their money recycled into the next experiment in big government. Didn’t we learn a lesson from the last failed stimulus experiment, which cost taxpayers $787 billion?” “If we are going to return to an era of economic growth and strength we must rein in Washington’s runaway spending. We can start by using what’s left of the bailout to reduce our record $12 trillion national debt. But Washington has no business using taxpayer dollars to turn the bailout into a stimulus slush fund.” Note: Foxx voted against the $700 billion bank bailout of October 2008. She also authored a bill to stop the second half of the bailout from being spent. This bill passed the House by a wide bipartisan vote, but was not adopted by the Senate.

She also called for the Afghan security forces to step up and begin the process of taking over the security of their country. “As President Obama launches the next stage of his Afghanistan policy I urge him to commit to finishing the job and to bringing our troops home in victory and not defeat,” Foxx said. “The path to victory involves putting the proper resources in place to secure the population and ensure that local security forces have the breathing room to stabilize their towns and villages. “Strong leadership is critical at this point. The American people and the people of Afghanistan must understand that we will not allow the Taliban and al-Qaeda to win and that a stable Afghanistan is a lynchpin of America’s national security. As President Obama himself has said, ‘the safety of people around the world is at stake.’”

On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison within a year. The decision to try some terrorist detainees from Guantanamo in civilian courts has raised questions about the ramifications of such a move. “The FBI Director has warned that importing these terrorists will give them opportunities to radicalize others and operate cells inside American prisons. The secure and well-tested military tribunal process is a better alternative to sending these terrorists to a U.S. courtroom. “Plus, a civilian court trial may result in sensitive intelligence information falling into the wrong hands or may even lead to a terrorist-detainee being released inside the U.S. because of some obscure legal technicality.” Foxx is also a co-sponsor of H.R. 2294, a bill that gives governors and state legislatures the right to refuse the transfer of dangerous terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay prison to facilities in the U.S. Under this legislation, New York governor David Paterson (D), who has criticized the Obama administration’s decision, would be able to halt the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to New York City.

With unemployment already at 10.2 percent, the Democrats’ plan will make our unemployment problem worse. “As if that were not enough, this bill slashes Medicare funding and will eliminate Medicare Advantage for the 40,000 seniors in North Carolina’s Fifth District who enjoy the convenience and excellent care of this program. “The list goes on: $729 billion in new taxes, 111 new bureaucratic entities and 5.5 million lost jobs. This bill is bad for families, bad for seniors and bad for small businesses. “Republicans have offered better solutions to make health care affordable without destroying jobs or raising taxes on North Carolina families. But Speaker Pelosi insists on pushing through this harmful piece of her big government agenda. I cannot support such ill-conceived and damaging legislation and will vote against it.”

H.Res. 847 seeks to change the current practice of negotiating the final details of major legislation behind closed doors. “This is serious business,” Foxx said. “A major overhaul of health care will impact one sixth of our economy and if things don’t change these decisions that affect every America will be made behind closed doors. If there’s nothing to hide, why not throw open the doors and let the public watch?” Health care legislation is expected to be brought up for a vote in the coming weeks. House and Senate leaders are currently combining disparate pieces of legislation into a final bill in closed meetings. H.Res. 847 will make the House of Representatives more open and responsive to citizens by opening up these closed meetings. “The lawmaking process is more than just the final votes on legislation,” Foxx said. “It involves committee amendments and votes, Rules Committee hearings, and conference committees. Taxpayers deserve to see the whole legislative sausage machine, not just the shiny, shrink-wrapped package that gets sent to the president for his signature.” Foxx is also a supporter of additional rule changes in the House to make lawmaking more open to public input and scrutiny: Cosponsor of a broad, bipartisan bill authored by Democrat Rep. Brian Baird that requires that any legislation be posted online in its final form for 72 hours before it is voted on. Original cosponsor of H.Res. 835, a measure to ban “phantom amendments” by requiring all committees to post bills online within 24 hours of committee approval.

The deadline will be extended two weeks to November 15. Students can submit applications to Rep. Foxx’s office for the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, the Coast Guard Academy and the Military Academy at West Point. Graduates of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point celebrate their 2009 graduation. “America’s service academies provide incredible opportunities for young people eager to serve as the next generation of American leaders,” Foxx said. “The selection and training process are rigorous, but the benefit of a lifetime of service to our country cannot be overstated. With less than a month left before the application deadline I encourage students to finalize and submit their applications now.” The deadline for the 2009 application season is now November 15, 2009, extended from November 1. To be considered for an appointment to a service academy, an applicant must meet the eligibility requirements established by law and be nominated by an authorized person such as a Member of Congress. Students pursuing a nomination should contact Congresswoman Foxx’s District Office in Clemmons, NC at (336) 778-0211 or visit her website at www.foxx.house.gov/serviceacademy for additional information about submitting completed applications. Note: An applicant for a nomination must meet the following eligibility requirements as of July 1 of the year of admission to a service academy: He or she must be at least 17 years old, but not have passed the 23rd birthday, must be a United States citizen, and must be unmarried, not pregnant, and have no legal obligation to support children or other dependents.

The census count currently does not distinguish between illegal immigrants and citizens or those legally present in the U.S. “Accurately counting the number of illegal immigrants in our country is a matter of equity and justice for American citizens and those legally present in the U.S.,” Foxx said. “This bill is a commonsense proposal to require the Census Bureau to ask about citizenship status on the same census form that already asks recipients’ race, age, and sex.” Foxx’s legislation aims to prevent unfair distortions in the distribution of House of Representative seats among the 50 states caused by large populations of illegal immigrants in certain areas. By counting illegal immigrants the Census Bureau will be able to provide accurate data for the reapportionment and redistricting process. Without this data some states will receive fewer Congressional representatives than they should due to other states’ high illegal immigrant population. “The census is a lynchpin in the proper functioning of America’s democratic and legislative process,” Foxx said. “Ensuring that the final tally is accurate and fair will mean everyone’s vote counts equally after congressional districts are redrawn in the coming years.” Note: please click here to read the legislation.

H.Res. 554 requires 72 hour waiting period on legislation “Congress has a duty to give Americans a chance to review and comment on legislation,” Foxx said. “But when important and controversial legislation is passed only hours after the final bill text is available, average citizens are shut out of the deliberative process.” “Today the House is scheduled to vote on legislation that spends $33.5 billion—and the final legislation was only made available after 6pm last night. We can and should do better. Posting legislation online for 72 hours is a common sense step Congress can take to make our proceedings more open and transparent.” Note: Foxx is a cosponsor of a bipartisan measure (H.Res. 554) that changes the rules of the House so that major legislation is publically available in its final form for 72 hours before a vote. Foxx has also signed a “discharge petition” for H.Res. 554. A discharge petition is a procedural tool to bring legislation up for a vote. Once a majority of the House signs the discharge petition H.Res. 554 must be voted on. The discharge petition currently has 181 signatures.

This document chartered a lasting experiment in democracy and put our nation on the path to becoming the world’s strongest and freest democracy. “Our Constitution remains the foundation of our unique system of government and individual liberty. It is a resilient and timeless charter. It is a towering achievement in the cause of freedom. It is, above all, a monument to America’s founding ideals. “As a member of Congress it is an honor and sacred duty to protect and uphold the Constitution. I hope that many Americans will find the time this week to read our Constitution and be reminded of our many freedoms, of the genius of checks and balances and of the privilege it is to be an American.” Note: The Constitution can be read online at the National Archives’ web site.

Since taking office, President Obama has appointed dozens of powerful administration officials, popularly known as ‘czars’, outside the Senate confirmation process established by the Constitution. “In the past eight months the Obama administration has appointed more than 30 czars with power over every conceivable area of government and very few have gone through the constitutionally mandated Senate confirmation process,” Foxx said. “Congress must reclaim its oversight role in the confirmation process of high-ranking administration officials.” “As the recent dust-up over President Obama’s green jobs czar shows, transparency and accountability matter,” Foxx said. “I believe that every President should be advised by the best and brightest our country has to offer. But I am concerned that the proliferation of unaccountable czars threatens to undermine our system of checks and balances.” H.R. 3226, the Czar Accountability and Reform Act cuts off funding for czar positions which have not been subject to Senate confirmation. To date the Obama administration has appointed ‘czars’ with authority in areas from bank and auto bailouts to technology and energy policy. Note: Foxx penned an op-ed several weeks ago about the proliferation of so-called ‘czars’ in American government over the past several decades and what this development signals about the growth of government.

And of course it was no comfort that in the middle of August the White House announced that they expect $9.1 trillion in new government debt over the next ten years. “So how is it that the American people are expected to stomach a new government-run healthcare proposal that is estimated to cost up to $1.6 trillion? “Let’s scrap the current government-run healthcare proposal and return to the drawing board for a plan like ones Republicans have offered that put patients, not government, first.” Click here for video/audio of Foxx remarks.

By creating tax credits for uninsured families and new Individual Membership Associations Congress will help make healthcare more affordable and portable. “Congress can reform healthcare and make health insurance more affordable—and we can do it without a government takeover of healthcare. This bill makes that much clear. It focuses on preserving the patient-doctor relationship while removing barriers to affordable health insurance and keeping Washington bureaucrats out of the equation.” H.R. 3218 helps uninsured families get coverage through three different policy changes: First, it creates a health insurance tax credit of up to $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families. It also expands insurance options and access to health insurance by creating Individual Membership Associations (IMAs). IMAs would expand insurance coverage by allowing groups like trade associations, churches and other civic groups to offer affordable insurance to their members. Finally, H.R. 3218 provides federal incentives for states to create high risk insurance pools for Americans who have difficulty securing health insurance. Note: Foxx is also a cosponsor of H.R. 2607 which expands access to coverage for uninsured families by creating Associated Health Plans; H.R. 1118 which gives seniors more choices and control over Medicare enrollment; H.R. 1039 which promotes health information technology; H.R. 1086 which seeks to reduce healthcare costs through tort reform; and H.R. 2516 which lowers costs through a bevy of healthcare reforms.

However, she voted in favor of an alternative government spending reform proposal that would effectively arrest the unsustainable growth of government. “Today Congress cooked up a batch of fake fiscal responsibility that looks good but has the taste of a bitter pill of deception,” Foxx said. “Let’s stop playing this shell game and enact a pay as you go bill that actually works—instead of paving the way for new tax hikes on North Carolina families and small businesses.” H.R. 2920, which is billed as a pay as you go (PAYGO) fix for out of control spending, is actually full of exemptions and loopholes for spending on scores of government programs: It does not apply to so-called “discretionary” spending, which accounts for 40 percent of the budget. The bill also exempts “emergency” spending, but allows Congress to arbitrarily apply the emergency designation to exempting spending from the PAYGO rules. Plus, more than 160 government programs are exempted from PAYGO, including the $700 billion bank bailout and parts of the $787 billion stimulus package. In addition, the CBO’s analysis of H.R. 2920 found that the bill could actually produce larger federal deficits in the future. In its report CBO writes that “the legislation’s enactment could lead to larger future deficits.” “This bill allows federal spending to continue to grow at breakneck speed. Unfortunately, Congress shot down a Republican alternative that I supported which focuses on the real problem—runaway spending.” The Republican alternative to H.R. 2920 requires that Federal spending cannot grow faster than the economy; it establishes a cap on discretionary spending, rather than exempting it as the Democrat bill does; it rejects the practice of chasing higher spending with higher taxes; and it reduces deficits.
07.15.2009	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) promised today that she would not vote for any healthcare reform bill that she had not read and that had not been publicly available for at least 72 hours. share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Repeats promise to oppose bill that subsidizes or mandates abortion coverage Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) promised today that she would not vote for any healthcare reform bill that she had not read and that had not been publicly available for at least 72 hours. “Americans’ healthcare is much too important for Congress to pass legislation in a blind rush or under the cloak of secrecy. I promise that I will not support any legislation that the American people have not had an opportunity to review and weigh in on. “I also promise that under no circumstances will I vote for a bill that does not specifically forbid taxpayer funded abortion or that mandates insurance coverage of abortion. Taxpayer funded abortion is a profound offense to the conscience of millions and millions of Americans and such policies have no place in a healthcare reform bill.” Yesterday, House Democrats unveiled a healthcare overhaul bill that will cost more than $1 trillion. The bill imposes a 2.5 percent tax on everyone who does not obtain health coverage through their employer or does not purchase government-approved insurance policies. The bill also levies a tax on small businesses that cannot afford to offer health insurance to their employees. Additionally, more than half of the bill’s $1 trillion price tag will be paid by so-called “high income tax filers.” As a result of this tax hike hundreds of thousands of small businesses will see a significantly higher tax burden. “This legislation is going to harm the single largest source of job creation in America—small businesses,” Foxx said. “Small businesses are the engine of economic growth and it makes no sense to penalize the sector of our economy that offers the best hope for a swift economic recovery.” Note: According to a Wall Street Journal story today, “businesses with between five and nine workers, representing about one million employers, had an average payroll of around $375,000 a year. A report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that only about half of firms with three to nine workers offered health benefits in 2008.” Under the House Democrats’ healthcare bill about half of these small businesses would pay a new tax on their total payrolls if they did not start to offer health insurance.

Click here for video of Foxx’s statement. “Americans of all walks of life are hurting and cutting back as consumer spending slumps and more families find themselves with a breadwinner without work. “What we need to get us out of this slump are policies aimed at helping employers create jobs. When employers create jobs and start hiring, the unemployed can get back to work and rejoin the ranks of the workers that make our nation great. “And what kind of policies encourage employers to create jobs? “Policies that reduce the burden of government mandates and keep the taxman from dipping too deep into the pockets of those who create jobs—small business-owners. We’re talking about cutting back the jungle of red-tape and keeping taxes low for the entrepreneurs that always lead the way to economic recovery. “In 1802 Thomas Jefferson put it this way: ‘if we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people, under the pretence of taking care of them, they must become happy.’ “He was voicing a common insight into the tendency of government to quickly put burdensome mandates on entrepreneurs and job-creating small businesses under the guise of lending a helping hand. Today we know this syndrome as big government. “Unfortunately for the real engines of job-creation in America, the Ways and Means Committee Democrats floated a massive tax hike in the past few days that will fall squarely on small-business owners and entrepreneurs. Sure, they will market their $540 billion tax increase as “a surtax” on “the wealthy”. And you can bet your last dollar that anyone who dares to question this tax will be called a defender of the wealthy. “How about defending the small-businesses that will help pull us out of this recession? How about looking out for innovators and risk-takers whose ideas and products create jobs and grow our economy. These are the people who will be shelling out for this new $540 billion tax. And they are the very same people who could be hiring the unemployed and creating good jobs if we’d just give them the breathing room they need—instead of hiking their taxes one more time.”

Some estimates found that the total tax impact of this legislation will amount to $2,979 per year for a family of four. “As we struggle to make our way out of a recession, I could not vote for the creation of a new national energy tax,” Foxx said. “North Carolina families and businesses can’t afford the financial strain of high energy costs in this bill. We should be working to ensure taxpayers are less burdened by taxes and red tape—not more.” Under H.R. 2454, electricity costs are estimated to rise by 90 percent. According to the Heritage Foundation, employment will be lower by 1,105,000 jobs per year as a result of this national energy tax. The bill will have an especially negative effect on energy-intensive sectors like manufacturing—which employs one out of six people in North Carolina’s 5th Congressional District. H.R. 2454 will also reduce the United States’ economic output by $9.6 trillion. “Tens of thousands of people in North Carolina who work in manufacturing are at risk of losing their jobs due to the burdens placed on employers by this bill,” Foxx said. “Many employers will be forced out of business or out of the country because of high energy prices and the new regulations in this legislation.” The legislation will be particularly damaging to rural areas and farming communities. Because rural households spend 58 percent more on fuel than urban residents as a percentage of their income, high energy prices cause disproportionate harm to rural families. The Heritage Foundation also estimates that farm income will drop by $50 billion by 2035 if H.R. 2454 becomes law.

Foxx’s legislation, the Sustain, Support and Defend Act of 2009 (H.R. 1223), directs the Army to expand a pilot program called the First Sergeant’s Barracks Initiative to Army bases across the country. “America’s soldiers deserve on-base housing that reflects our nation’s commitment to their well-being,” Foxx said. “After all they have sacrificed, the least we can do is ensure their housing meets rigorous quality standards—and this legislation will help put practices in place to keep housing standards high.” H.R. 1223, which was included in the Defense Authorization Act, changes the way the Army maintains barracks for soldiers. Instead of individual units maintaining barracks, the legislation directs the Army to designate a separate maintenance team to be responsible for barracks housing. Such an arrangement will provide for the upkeep of barracks while Army units are deployed and their barracks are vacant and prone to deterioration. This legislation aims to prevent subpar housing conditions such as those that were widely cited in media reports last year at Fort Bragg, NC. Barracks at Fort Bragg for soldiers returning from a tour of duty were reported to have fallen into a state of disrepair in the deployed unit’s absence. Additionally, implementing the First Sergeant’s Barracks Initiative (FSBI) will result in considerable cost savings for the Army. A pilot FSBI program at Fort Hood, Texas not only improved the condition of barracks but also increased the lifespan of the barracks and their furnishings. “Making this program an Army-wide policy has the beneficial side-effect of increasing efficiency and saving money,” Foxx said. “Rarely do we have an opportunity to both improve the care provided to our military and save money at the same time.” H.R. 1223 had seven cosponsors, including North Carolina Congressman Larry Kissell (NC-8).

We will not stand by in silence and watch the forces of radicalism attempt to squelch the public outcry in Iran against last week’s election irregularities. “The ongoing crackdown on free expression and the rights of journalists along with the censoring of communication with the outside world has simply shown the true colors of the dark Iranian regime desperately trying to hold its grip on power.

H.R. 422 expands a current federal R&D tax credit from 14 share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Legislation will help increase business investment and spur U.S. innovation U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today cosponsored H.R. 422, a bipartisan bill that will permanently increase the federal tax credit for research and development. H.R. 422 expands a current federal R&D tax credit from 14 percent to 20 percent and makes the new 20 percent R&D tax credit permanent. The current R&D tax credit is set to expire at the end of 2009. “Employers struggling to stay competitive during these difficult economic times need relief,” Foxx said. “This bipartisan legislation will help keep North Carolina employers competitive in the global marketplace by increasing incentives for research and development investments.” Since employee wages account for approximately 70 percent of R&D investments in the U.S., passage of this bill creates a long-term incentive for job creation as North Carolina wrestles with the current recession. As a result of increasing the R&D tax credit, North Carolina businesses will be able to more effectively compete against foreign business that benefit from other countries’ research tax credits. “The U.S. has the second highest business tax in the world. This places U.S. companies at a serious global disadvantage. But expanding the R&D tax credit will help America retain our place as a global innovator and international business leader,’ Foxx said. The U.S. currently has one of the weakest R&D tax credits in the world. A recent report by Forbes magazine ranked the U.S. near the bottom in tax breaks for R&D spending, saying that current U.S. tax policy helped to “cripple American manufacturers.”

06.10.2009	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today cosponsored The American Energy Act, an energy bill that promotes energy independence, job creation and environmental protections. The bill, in contrast to the energy policy curren share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today cosponsored The American Energy Act, an energy bill that promotes energy independence, job creation and environmental protections. The bill, in contrast to the energy policy currently being pursued by House Democrats, establishes a national goal of constructing 100 clean, modern nuclear energy plants over the next 20 years. “Gas prices and utilities bills are starting to creep up again, dealing another economic blow to North Carolina families,” Foxx said. “If we are going to emerge from this recession with a sustainable recovery, we must confront the coming crisis in energy. That’s why I’m pleased that we have a bill that paves the way for economic recovery through commonsense energy policies. Without a clean and abundant supply of energy, America cannot retain its place as the world’s economic powerhouse.” The American Energy Act is an alternative to the “cap and trade” energy bill offered by the Democrats. Studies have shown that cap and trade policies (essentially a tax on energy) will dramatically increase the cost of energy for American families. Instead of taxing energy, the American Energy Act increases domestic energy supply by tapping offshore sources of gas and oil as well as increasing the availability and affordability of nuclear power. “We haven’t built a new nuclear power plant in decades, despite the fact nuclear power could provide a safe and clean source of energy for millions of households in America,” Foxx said. “Nuclear power already produces 73 percent of the zero emissions energy in America. The American Energy Act leverages the benefits of nuclear power by jumpstarting new investment in nuclear energy.” About the American Energy Act: This comprehensive energy legislation also directs revenue generated by the sale of energy production leases into a Renewable Energy Trust Fund that funds alternative and renewable energy sources. It also bolsters conservation and energy efficiency efforts through the use of proven tax incentives. Learn more about the American Energy Act by reading the backgrounder posted here.

The Wall Street Journal reported tod share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Calls for more transparency for $1 trillion in other federal spending Congresswoman Virginia Foxx released the following statement today after it was reported that the House of Representatives will begin posting individual representatives expense reports online. The Wall Street Journal reported today that, starting August 31, American taxpayers will be able to view the quarterly reports of Representatives’ expenditures. “America’s taxpayers deserve to know how their tax dollars are spent,” Foxx said. “I applaud this decision to post each Representatives’ spending on the Internet. “My hope is that other federal agencies follow suit. After all, if Congress, not known for its 21st century ways, can account online for every cent it spends, why not the rest of the sprawling federal government? “The rest of the federal government agencies will spend more than $1 trillion in taxpayer dollars this year. These agencies should follow the example being set by the House and begin to publicly divulge the details of how taxpayer money is spent. This would do much to remedy the Washington mindset that the money belongs to Washington and not the people.” Note: Members of the House of Representative are currently required to file quarterly reports detailing every dollar of spending made by their Congressional offices. The House of Representatives will spend $794.3 million to fund all House Committees and the office budgets of each of the 435 Representatives in 2009. This amounts to less than 1/10 of 1% of the more than $1 trillion in federal government agency expenditures for 2009—spending that is not available online for taxpayer scrutiny.
06.03.2009	A photograph by a Forsyth County high school student will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. for a year, after the student, Robert ‘Lee' Bottoms won the 2009 5th District Congressional Art Contest.

Bottoms, a senior at Woodland Christian School in Winston-Salem won the contest with a digital color photograph entitled “Dogwood at Dusk”. Congressional Art Contest winner: "Dogwood at Dusk" “The Congressional Art Competition is a once in a lifetime chance for young North Carolina artists to display their work in the United States Capitol,” Foxx said. “I’m pleased that Lee’s excellent work of art will hang in the Capitol to represent all of the fine submissions that were part of the contest this year.” In the spring of every year, the United States House of Representatives hosts a Congressional Art Competition for amateur high-school artists. The contest promotes attention to the arts by recognizing talented young artists from across the nation. This year’s winning artwork by Robert Bottoms, who lives in Clemmons, NC, will be featured along with winning submissions from other congressional districts in the United States Capitol. Bottoms will travel to Washington, DC later in June to attend the official award and art installation ceremony. (Click here for a picture of Bottoms’ winning entry) The runner up honors for the 5th District Congressional Art Contest went to Ross Pollock, a Winston-Salem resident and a sophomore at Forsyth Country Day School. Pollock’s marker drawing entitled "Bird - Squares" will hang in Foxx's Washington office. About the Congressional Art Contest: Each year Members of Congress from around the country hold contests within their districts to choose winning pieces of art by high school students. Since this competition was created in 1982, hundreds of thousands of high school students have participated at the local level. The winning student from the 5th District will be invited to Washington, DC for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and will have his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year.
05.13.2009	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today cosponsored the Keep Terrorists out of America Act (H.R. 2294), a bill that gives governors and state legislatures the right to refuse the transfer of dangerous terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill gives governor and state legislature final say on transfer of detainees Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today cosponsored the Keep Terrorists out of America Act (H.R. 2294), a bill that gives governors and state legislatures the right to refuse the transfer of dangerous terrorists from the Guantanamo Bay prison to facilities in the U.S. “Today Guantanamo Bay holds scores of the world’s most dangerous terrorists and President Obama has made it clear that he plans to close it down within the next nine months,” Foxx said. “Unfortunately it is not clear where the terrorists held at Guantanamo will be placed. This bill ensures that communities in North Carolina are not forced against their will to house terrorists who are bent on destroying our way of life.” On January 22, 2009, President Obama signed an executive order to close the Guantanamo Bay prison within a year. Since this decision was made, it has not become clear where the hundreds of inmates, including many of those who helped plan and facilitate the 9/11 attacks, will be placed. The Keep Terrorists out of America Act prohibits the Administration from transferring or releasing any terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay to any state without the approval of the state’s governor and legislature. It also requires the President to meet strict certification standards before terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay prison are moved to U.S. soil. “North Carolinians need to know the plan behind the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison,” Foxx said. “Important questions must be answered. Will these terrorists be transferred to North Carolina or anywhere else in the United States? Will they be released back onto the battlefield? North Carolinians deserve answers.” Note: H.R. 2294 prohibits the President from transferring or releasing a terrorist detainee into the United States unless he provides notification and certification to Congress regarding: The name of the detainee and transfer/release location in the United States. The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued prosecution of the detainee. The release/transfer would not negatively impact continued detention of the detainee. The ability of federal judges to release detainees into the United States.

Instead, each April 15 families and businesses are reminded of just how byzantine and punitive the American tax code is. “Our tax rules and regulations run to thousands of pages. Even the man tasked with overseeing the IRS, Treasury Secretary Geithner, recently found it impossible to comply with this burdensome outrage we call the tax code. “It comes as no surprise then that today in hundreds of towns and cities across America countless American’s are venting their fatigue and frustration with an unfair tax system and a spend-thrift Washington addicted to massive amounts of tax dollars. “Americans have had it. Our bloated government and our expansive and incomprehensible tax system have spawned a new generation of tea parties across the nation. I am encouraged by the prospect of millions of Americans who are ready for meaningful tax and spending reform that will change Washington’s wasteful ways and put American’s money back where it belongs—in their pockets.”
04.02.2009	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted against the Democrat budget that produces more than $9 trillion in new debt over the next ten years, in addition to raising taxes by more than $1.4 trillion. She also voted in share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Votes in favor of alternative budget that keeps spending in check U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted against the Democrat budget that produces more than $9 trillion in new debt over the next ten years, in addition to raising taxes by more than $1.4 trillion. She also voted in favor of the Republican alternative budget that puts a lid on runaway government spending and keeps taxes low for North Carolina families. “Today’s choice was clear,” Foxx said. “It was a choice between a budget that borrows and spends unprecedented amounts of money and a Republican alternative that recognizes that we cannot borrow and spend our way to prosperity—that’s what got us into this mess in the first place.” The Democrat budget plan remakes the federal government, creating the largest federal government since World War II. In the process of growing the size of the federal government the Democrat budget creates a record-setting deficit—$1.75 trillion. In contrast, the Republican alternative budget would save the nation $3.6 trillion over the next ten years. But the differences don’t stop with debt and spending. The Republican alternative also refrains from raising taxes—unlike the Democrats’ budget, which raises taxes by $1.4 trillion over ten years. Another key difference is the approach to energy policy. The Democrats’ budget contains so-called “cap and trade” provisions that will put a cap on carbon emissions and by extension, economic growth. This plan will raise the cost of energy for every sector of the economy and, according to the National Association of Manufacturers, will ship 3-4 million jobs oversees where energy costs will be much lower. Instead of punishing Americans with a new energy taxes, the Republican budget pursues energy independence with an innovative plan that aggressively focuses on alternative energy without creating new taxes and government mandates. “Two budgets with two sets of priorities: one budget means more government, more debt and more taxes,” Foxx said. “The GOP alternative, on the other hand, means a return to a common-sense approach to government that emphasizes individual freedom and responsibility instead of a big-government, nanny state.”

She voted to consider a measure to return 100 percent of AIG millionaire bonuses to taxpayers and in opposition to a measure that tries to recapture the bonuses in an unconstitutional fashion (known as a bill of attainder). Foxx is also a co-sponsor of H.R. 1582, the Executive Bonus Repeal Act, which will “claw back” 100 percent of the recent AIG millionaire bonuses. Foxx made the following statement today on the AIG bonus situation. Video is here. “I voted against the Bush TARP Megabank bailout and opposed the Obama Megabank bailout—which authorized the funding for the AIG bailout without attaching appropriate safeguards. I also opposed the Democrat stimulus bill, a massive bill that was finalized in the dark of night and voted on shortly thereafter, that explicitly authorized the AIG bonuses. “This rushed legislation is coming from the same people who threw together the final stimulus bill in the dead of night and gave us 12 hours to read it. The same people who drafted the stimulus bill containing the provision that gave the green light to these million dollars bonuses. “It is important to note that the same Majority that is expressing outrage over these AIG bonuses—rightly expressing outrage I might add—is the same Majority that voted overwhelmingly for the so-called stimulus that paved the way for these bonuses. “Let’s take a measured approach, unlike the approach that President Bush took on the bailout panic last fall and unlike the stimulus frenzy last month that put us where we are today. “We can recoup this money in a constitutional manner—in fact Republicans have a bill that will do just that.”

The letter falsely asserts that the Mexican government is receiving U.S. Social Security funds and solicits recipients for a donation. “During this time of considerable economic uncertainty, misleading our state’s senior citizens—many living on fixed incomes—into making a donation to ‘save’ their future Social Security is not only morally abhorrent, but it also seems legally suspect,” Rep. Foxx wrote to Attorney General Cooper. Foxx also released a short web video discussing the misleading letter and urging constituents not to donate to groups making unfounded claims. She asked constituents with concerns about the federal government or legislation to directly contact her office. The same group that sent the Social Security letter, Council of Seniors, was recently cited by the Indiana Attorney General for sending deceptive fundraising appeals to households in Indiana.

03.13.2009	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) introduced legislation this week that will bring more openness and accountability to federal government spending. Her legislation, the Multilingual Services Accounting Act, requires all f share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill requires reporting of all spending on non-English gov’t services U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) introduced legislation this week that will bring more openness and accountability to federal government spending. Her legislation, the Multilingual Services Accounting Act (H.R. 1414), requires all federal government bureaucracies to annually report how much taxpayer money is spent to provide government services in languages other than English. “Our government spends untold sums providing government services in a multitude of languages—with little or no accountability for how this money is spent and with no information on the value of this spending,” Rep. Foxx said. “American taxpayers deserve better. They deserve a full accounting of how their government spends their tax dollars.” Federal government agencies currently do not have to report how much money they spend to provide government services and publications in languages other than English. Foxx’s legislation fixes this problem by requiring that each of the 24 federal bureaucracies report multilingual expenditures in their annual reports to the Office of Management and Budget. Without this basic accounting information, the federal government has no way of knowing how much it spends to provide multilingual services. “Responsible government must be transparent and accountable,” Foxx said. “By shining the light on how much money is spent on non-English services we can ensure tax dollars are not squandered on wasteful projects.” The Multilingual Services Accounting Act (H.R. 1414) is supported by the advocacy groups U.S. English and ProEnglish as a responsible accounting practice. A growing number of states also have passed laws requiring state government agencies to account for spending on multilingual services, such as Wisconsin did in 2008. "All too often, the provision of multilingual government services has been a decision made by a single bureaucrat or bureaucrats without the consent of Congress," said Mauro E. Mujica, Chairman of U.S. English. “I want to thank Rep. Foxx for her dedication to government accountability and to the American people."
03.10.2009	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voiced strong opposition to union "card check" legislation that was introduced today. The legislation, the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, halts workers' rights to vote by secret share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Co-sponsors Secret Ballot Protection Act to preserve workers’ rights Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voiced strong opposition to union “card check” legislation that was introduced today. The legislation, the so-called Employee Free Choice Act, halts workers’ rights to vote by secret ballot in union organizing elections. “Because I support workers’ rights to unionize without harassment, I must oppose this anti-worker legislation, Foxx said. “The secret ballot is a foundational element of a free and open society. Its demise would signal a serious decline in freedom in America, not to mention a harsh blow to struggling workers in today’s tough economy.” Card check legislation strips workers of truly free choice in union organizing elections, opening the elections to coercion and intimidation. Instead of mandating a secret ballot vote, this legislation changes the rules to allow for unionization by a public signing of cards by workers. In theory, those signing cards would support joining a union: hence the term, “card check.” However, rather than allowing workers to make their choice in secrecy, the act would end workers’ right to privacy in one of the most important decisions they make about the future of their workplace. “This whole card check idea has a whiff of big-brotherism,” Foxx said. “With card check, someone’s always looking over your shoulder. This simply blows the unionization process wide open to fraud and intimidation.” Rep. Foxx is also an original cosponsor of the Secret Ballot Protection Act—legislation that preserves workers’ right to a secret ballot in unionization elections. Foxx voted against the Employee Free Choice Act in 2007 when it was brought up for a vote in the 110th Congress. Even Obama supporter and advisor, businessman Warren Buffet opposes card check legislation.
02.26.2009	Raises taxes during an economic downturn: Proposes hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes at the worst possible time, while the economy is already weakened, unemployment is on the rise, and families are struggling to make ends meet. share: f t Information courtesy of the House Ways and Means Committee. President Obamas budget: Raises taxes during an economic downturn: Proposes hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes at the worst possible time, while the economy is already weakened, unemployment is on the rise, and families are struggling to make ends meet. Even Christina Romer, the Chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisors, has argued that “tax increases are highly contractionary.” The tax hikes included in this budget proposal will only prolong the recession. Raises taxes on energy: Assumes $646 billion in new revenue from auctions of greenhouse gas emissions permits under an untested, growth-choking, and likely ineffective “tax and trade” (i.e., “cap and trade”) program. While experts across the spectrum state the unilateral “tax and trade” program envisioned by the Administration would have no measurable effect on global temperatures, it would impose enormous tax increases on the energy that fuels our cars, lights and heats our homes, powers our assembly lines, and ensures a stable, affordable food supply. Raises taxes on small businesses, the engines of job creation: Targets small businesses – the engines of job creation in our country – for unwarranted tax increases by raising marginal income tax rates from 33% to 36% and from 35% to 39.6%. Small businesses employ about half of all private-sector workers and have created nearly 80% of the new jobs in the U.S. in recent years. According to IRS data from 2006, 60% of net small business income was earned by taxpayers with at least $200,000 of income. Imposing higher taxes on hundreds of thousands of these “mom and pop” businesses is hardly the way to encourage job creation during these challenging economic times. Raises taxes on investments instead of encouraging economic growth: Discourages critical investments in our economy by raising the top tax rate on capital gains and dividends by one-third. To help steady our economy and calm the capital markets, we should be encouraging the long-term investments that lead to job creation by preserving lower tax rates on investment capital. Limits Tax Incentives for Charitable Giving: Restores and expands pre-2001 provisions – known as the Personal Exemption Phase-out and the Pease Limitation – that act as stealth increases in marginal tax rates by limiting the value of deductions and exemptions. This harms philanthropic organizations, like the Red Cross, Habitat for Humanity and soup kitchens, when their services are needed most, as it reduces the value of the charitable deduction for affected taxpayers. Increases dependence on foreign oil: Imposes punitive new taxes on domestic energy production, encouraging U.S. companies to move jobs overseas and increasing our overall dependence on foreign energy supplies. These tax increases on U.S. energy producers – combined with the Administration’s flawed “tax and trade” proposal – may leave Americans yearning for the days of $4.00 per gallon gas. Resurrects the Death Tax: Allows the death tax to spring back to life in 2010 by preventing the estate tax repeal from taking effect as scheduled under current law. Imposes new marriage penalties: Establishes significant new marriage penalties by failing to set the income level at which married couples pay higher taxes at twice the level at which those higher taxes apply to singles. Specifically, the budget imposes higher taxes on singles earning over $200,000, while imposing higher taxes on joint filers earning over $250,000 (rather than over $400,000, the level that would actually be required to avoid marriage penalties). The budget’s new marriage penalties are contained in its proposals for higher marginal tax rates, higher rates on dividends and capital gains, and its quicker phase-outs of itemized deductions and personal exemptions. Reduces Economic Competitiveness: Appears to substantially limit “deferral,” an aspect of the current tax code that permits American companies with operations around the world to compete against their international counterparts on a level playing field. The budget’s $210 billion tax increase on the international activity of these U.S. businesses threatens high-paying jobs here in the U.S. and creates incentives for these companies to be gobbled up by foreign competitors. Disguises spending as tax cuts and “spreads the wealth” on retirement savings: Purports to provide $326 billion in “tax relief” that is, in reality, new federal spending. The budget extends and expands various refundable tax credits, which are actually cash transfer payments to individuals who, in many cases, do not pay any income or payroll taxes. Of particular note, the budget makes the current “saver’s credit” refundable and provides “a 50-percent match on the first $1,000 of retirement savings for families that earn less than $65,000.” Selectively enforces PAYGO: Makes House Democrats’ inconsistent track record on PAYGO enforcement look downright principled. On the one hand, the Obama Budget assumes – quite appropriately, but much to the Blue Dogs’ chagrin – that most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts and the annual AMT patch will be extended without the need for corresponding revenue offsets. Indeed, the President should be commended for recognizing the folly of requiring tax increases in order to extend tax relief in those instances. On the other hand, it is baffling to see that the budget still clings to PAYGO with respect to extensions of certain other tax provisions, such as the R&D credit. Misses an opportunity to ensure Social Security’s future: Asserts that the “President is committed to ensuring that Social Security is solvent and viable for the American people, now and in the future,” yet his budget proposes no significant steps towards achieving this goal. Increases health care spending dramatically: Proposes a $634 billion “down payment” on health care “reform,” with total expenditures expected to exceed $1 trillion. Per capita health care costs in the U.S. are already twice as high as those in Canada and two and one half times higher than those in the UK. Throwing in an additional $1 trillion is unlikely to improve care or make it more affordable for American families. Diverting Medicare dollars away from seniors: Proposes billions of dollars of Medicare cuts, some of which take away seniors’ choices. Moreover, these Medicare savings wouldn’t be used to provide better benefits to other seniors but would be used to offset unrelated health care reform.

H.R. 1105, which completes the funding process for the federal government for fiscal year 2009, spends $410 billion, 8.3 percent more than 2008. “The federal budget is growing by 8.3 percent, while family budgets are shrinking,” Foxx said. “At a time when Americans are tightening their belts, Washington is on a reckless spending spree. This is irresponsible.” When the spending legislation passed before the end of 2008 is factoring in, federal discretionary spending will reach $1.01 trillion for 2009. This is the first time in U.S. history that the federal discretionary budget has passed the $1 trillion mark. Additionally, federal agencies lucky enough to get money from both this spending legislation and the recently-enacted stimulus bill are about to see their funding jump by 80 percent—nearly doubling some agencies’ budgets in a single year. “Congress has jacked up the federal debt limit four times in the past 17 months in order to accommodate Washington’s profligate spending,” Foxx said. “Thanks to this new massive bill it is just a matter of time until we take out yet another mortgage on our children’s future earnings.” H.R. 1105 also undermines the United States’ long-standing opposition to China’s one child policy and coercive abortion practices by increasing funding to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) by 25 percent. The UNFPA supports China’s destructive one child policy. The bill also gives organizations that promote and provide abortions around the world access to $545 million in federal funding. In a related vote today Foxx voted in favor of legislation that would help to clean up the Congressional earmark system. The legislation would be a first step towards requiring members of Congress to list campaign contributions that serve as a financial interest in lawmakers’ earmark requests.

Of course, there are some principles that we must restore to their rightful place. Our budget is sagging under the weight of endless bailouts and the economy is destabilized by the uncertainty swirling around chronic government intervention. “We must return to the things that made America’s economy great. For starters, Washington should stop spending money that we don't have. Congress and the President should also resist the temptation to jack up tax rates—that will only make our problems worse. Combining low taxes and competent, responsible government is a proven recipe for economic recovery. “Americans of every stripe are hurting during this economic downturn. And they rightly want and deserve smart, simple solutions. But attempting to borrow and spend our way to prosperity is not a smart solution.”

We can do better.” “This stimulus bill is generational theft—passing on a record-breaking pile of debt to the next generation. Instead of targeting the real sources of job creation, America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs, this legislation is honeycombed with pet projects to satisfy liberal special interests.” “We can do better. Americans are hurting and runaway government spending is not the only thing that can fix this recession. A fast-acting and job-creating tax cut-based alternative that I voted for would have created twice the jobs at half the cost.” “Attempting to borrow and spend our way to prosperity is failed policy. We can do better.” “Today it saddens me that I cannot support this highly flawed stimulus package. Thanks to an opaque legislative process, we have had fewer than 12 hours to review the final legislation that runs to more than 1,000 pages. Very strong and viable compromises have been ignored. We could have done better.”

Republicans have proposed an alternative that creates twice the jobs at half the cost.” More than 425,000 Americans have signed a petition started by grassroots group Americans for Prosperity that urges Congress halt wasteful stimulus spending and the rampant growth of long-term national debt. Foxx joined Tim Phillips, president of AFP, and Congresswoman Tom Price (R-Ga.), Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, in presenting the signatures to Congress. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans are making their voices heard,” Foxx said. “Instead of borrowing and spending our way to prosperity, they want us to take a responsible and balanced approach that gives meaningful tax cuts to small businesses and hard-working families.” Congress is expected to begin debate on the final version of the stimulus package today. Final passage could come as early as Friday. Click here to learn more about the Republican alternative plan!
02.11.2009	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) has co-sponsored legislation that will suspend income taxes on unemployment benefits paid to jobless workers.

The IRS currently considers unemployment benefits to be “income” and levies normal income taxes on jobless workers that receive benefits. “Many North Carolina families are struggling to make ends meet as they face the loss of jobs and income at this especially difficult time and, believe it or not, the federal government taxes their unemployment benefits,” Foxx said. “By stopping the unfair taxation of unemployment benefits we can help jobless workers stay afloat and eventually get back to work.” The Suspension of Federal Income Tax on Unemployment Benefits Act (H.R. 155) suspends taxes on unemployment benefits for two years in an effort to help laid off workers make it through the current recession. Stopping the taxation of unemployment benefits will help millions of American families weather the economic storm by providing about $117 in additional monthly income to the average beneficiary. “Taxing the unemployed does nothing to spur economic recovery,” Foxx said. “Instead of allowing the IRS to kick jobless workers while they are down, this legislation offers a common sense solution to put more money in the pockets of struggling families.” Foxx is also pushing to include the suspension of unemployment benefits in the stimulus package making its way through Congress.

Foxx called on the Democratic majority (watch video) to allow House Republicans to bring their ideas to the negotiating table as the House and Senate hammer out the differences between the two competing stimulus bills: “America faces an unambiguously dramatic economic downturn,” Foxx told the House of Representatives. “And Americans are hurting in this very difficult economic time.” “But Republicans in the House are still waiting for an opportunity to bring our ideas for economic recovery to the table. So far we’ve have been shut out of negotiations.” “For instance, Republicans have proposed real assistance for the unemployed by slashing federal taxes on unemployment benefits. But our suggestions for effective economic recovery have been ignored. “The result? A bill that does little to stimulate the economy and lots to stimulate the federal government and our national debt. “We must pass a bill that helps struggling workers get back on their feet and that encourages entrepreneurs—the real engines for job creation—to take risks again. “Mr. Speaker, we cannot borrow and spend our way back to prosperity." Note: The House Republicans’ alternative Economic Recovery Plan contains targeted tax cuts for every family and small business. It includes the following provisions: Immediate Tax Relief for Working Families: Rather than a refundable credit based on payroll taxes, House Republicans propose reducing the lowest individual tax rates from 15% to 10% and from 10% to 5%. As a result every taxpaying-family in America will see an immediate increase in their income with an average benefit of $500 in tax relief from the drop in the 10% bracket and $1,200 for the drop in the 15% bracket. A married couple filing jointly could save up to $3,200 a year in taxes. Real Help for America’s Small Businesses: Small businesses (those employing less than 500 individuals) employ about half of all Americans, yet they can be subject to tax rates that siphon away one-third or more of their income. House Republicans propose to allow small business to take a tax deduction equal to 20% of their income. This will immediately free up funds for small businesses to retain and hire new employees. No Tax Increases to Pay for Spending: The stimulus proposal pending in Congress includes record levels of government spending that will substantially increase the current deficit. House Republicans are concerned that this level of spending will result in new tax increases on American working families. House Republicans are insisting that any stimulus package include a provision precluding any tax increases now or in the future to pay for this new spending. House Republicans believe that any stimulus spending should be paid for by reducing other government spending, not raising taxes. Assistance for the Unemployed: Incredibly, the Federal Government actually imposes income taxes on an individual receiving unemployment benefits. House Republicans propose to make unemployment benefits tax free so that those individuals between jobs can focus on providing for their families. The plan would also extend unemployment benefits for a full year. Stabilizing Home Values: The real-estate market is paralyzed as potential buyers wait on the sidelines waiting for prices to fall even further. This is becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. In order to encourage responsible buyers to enter the market and stabilize prices, House Republicans propose a home-buyers credit of $7,500 for those buyers who can make a minimum down-payment of 5%.

The website details the smarter, simpler stimulus plan proposed by House Republicans that will create twice the jobs at half the price of the economic package that Democrats forced through the House despite bipartisan opposition. "North Carolina’s families and job-creating small businesses are facing unprecedented challenges,” Foxx said. “My Republican colleagues and I have proposed an Economic Recovery Plan that will actually create jobs for North Carolinians. We believe that the focus of any stimulus package must be on helping working families and small businesses. I hope that you will visit this website and learn more about the House Republican Economic Recovery Plan.” Republicans are committed to an open and transparent exchange of ideas to find the best solutions to get the U.S. economy back on track. The Republican Economic Recovery Plan contains the constructive, common-sense ideas that should be included in any stimulus legislation. "This is a smart, simple, and stimulative plan—at half the price of the Democratic Majority’s $825 billion proposal,” Foxx said. “The Republican plan has no waste, just jobs.” “Our goal is to get America back on track without saddling future generations with trillions in debt or higher taxes,” said House Republican Whip Eric Cantor, leader of the House Republican Stimulus Working Group that crafted the recovery plan.

Americans expect Congress to take seriously the need to get the unemployed back to work and to help small businesses, the engine of our economy, create most of those jobs. Doing the right thing means we must cut taxes for small businesses and all American families rather than spending billions on pet projects that do nothing to stimulate the economy. “This $825 billion borrow and spend plan that shells out $7.7 billion for programs that already have a budget surplus, that spends more than $330 million for sexually transmitted disease programs and that fritters away another $400 million for NASA global warming research does not measure up. “We are being told that action is urgent but only 15 percent of the spending in this bill will get into the economy in 2009 and only 35 percent in 2010. That’s why today I will vote for an alternative plan that focuses on tax relief which leaves more money in the hands of working families instead of giving more money to government which is little more than pork barrel spending. “Borrowing and spending the equivalent of $10,500 for every household in America will do little to nothing to create new jobs and will put us further down the road to a national debt catastrophe. I urge my Democrat colleagues to consider the proposals put forth by Republicans to bring fast, efficient economic relief through targeted tax cuts for families and employers.”

But this doesn’t seem to be the case with Mr. Geithner. “Don’t you think the person who runs the IRS should follow our tax laws? Shouldn’t this person pay his own taxes? But it seems Mr. Geithner will get a free pass from the Senate, despite that fact that while working at the International Monetary Fund he failed to pay more than $30,000 in federal taxes. “Our nation faces historic economic turmoil. Don’t average Americans deserve leaders who are experts at economics AND ethics?”

The Rules Committee is the powerful House committee that determines what legislation comes to the House floor for a vote and under what circumstances that legislation is considered. “Joining the Rules Committee is a privilege and an honor and I am excited about the new opportunities this committee assignment gives me to stand up for hard-working Americans,” Foxx said. “I plan to play a productive role on the Committee that shapes the legislative agenda and debate in the House.” In addition to controlling the legislative agenda for the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee also controls the amendment process for each bill, determining which amendments are in order for specific legislation. “Congresswoman Foxx’s reputation as a hard-working and committed conservative makes her a great addition to the Rules Committee,” said Republican Leader Boehner. “She has been a tireless advocate for the rights of the Republican Minority and, more importantly, the rights of every American to be represented in the ongoing debates on Capitol Hill. “The Democratic Majority has routinely sought to silence the voices of tens of millions of Americans represented by Republicans by changing or ignoring House rules that traditionally guarantee fair and open debate. The Rules Committee is on the frontlines of this fight, and at no time are House Republicans and the Americans we represent counting on Rep. Foxx’s leadership more than right now.” Rules Committee Ranking Member David Dreier also praised Foxx as an ideal choice for the Rules Committee. “Virginia has a common sense approach to solving the problems confronting the American people, and is committed to holding the government accountable while reducing federal spending,” said Ranking Member Dreier. “She is an excellent communicator, a hard worker, and will be a tremendous asset to our Republican team on the Rules Committee."

The legislation is designed to take advantage of a provision in the 2008 bailout law that allows Congress to “disapprove” of the second half of the bailout. “In the days since I first voted against the bailout last year the $700 billion of taxpayer money has turned into a giant political slush fund,” Rep. Foxx said. “Not only did the administration completely change course in its use of bailout money, but there has been absolutely no oversight of the first half of the bailout. This is taxpayers’ money we’re talking about.” According to the 2008 bailout law, Congress has the power to withhold the second half of the bailout—$350 billion—when the President requests the money. Foxx’s legislation does just that. Thanks to the way the bailout law was written, Foxx’s measure must be considered by Congress within five days of when the White House requests the second half of the bailout cash. The federal government had already doled out most of the first half of the bailout money—including nearly $18 billion for bailing out Detroit automakers in December. During the distribution of the first $350 billion of the bailout the independent oversight required by the bailout law was virtually non-existent and the progress reports to Congress detailing where the bailout money was flowing were chronically late. “Today we’re hearing about bailouts for everyone ranging from life insurance and credit card companies to automakers and state governments,” Foxx said. “Where does it stop and what about the hardworking taxpayers?

Foxx asked them to account for the failures of the organizations they led and the costs borne by average Americans as a result of the government takeover of Fannie and Freddie. “You have been irresponsible,” Rep. Foxx told a panel of former Fannie and Freddie executives. “You have exhibited no sense of accountability for your actions. What in the world were you getting paid millions of dollars to do?” Foxx asked the CEOs. Earlier this decade, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac dramatically expanded their investments in securities derived from subprime and Alt-A loans made to homeowners with weaker credit or reduced loan verification requirements. According to media reports, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac moved into these investments despite both internal and public concerns regarding the potential risks of such actions. These Fannie and Freddie investments helped feed the subprime lending boom and as these investments began to fail, Fannie and Freddie’s actions contributed to the meltdown in the housing market “This is not a Democrat or a Republican issue,” Foxx said. “This is about protecting the people of North Carolina—average, responsible people who made prudent decisions and are now being hurt by the reckless greed of Fannie and Freddie’s corporate leadership. We cannot allow this to happen again.” Note: In June 2008, Fannie Mae alone owned or guaranteed nearly $400 billion in risky securities. On September 7, 2008, after watching both Fannie and Freddie post massive losses on their failed housing investments, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson helped orchestrate a federal government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and committed as much as $100 billion to each company. According to expect testimony from today’s hearings, more than 40 percent of Fannie and Freddie’s loans are “junk loans” for a total of $4.63 trillion in potentially bad debt. With the federal government’s takeover of these lenders, taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for the cost of these bad loans.

The Post also found that the independent oversight required by the bailout law is virtually non-existent and the progress report to Congress detailing where the bailout money is flowing is already late. According to the new bailout law, Congress can withhold the second half of the bailout—$350 billion—when the President in office requests the money. Foxx’s legislation does just that. Thanks to the way the bailout was written, by law this measure must be considered by Congress within five days of when the White House requests the balance of the bailout cash. “As the Treasury Department throws its weight around the economy, we’re hearing talk of bailouts for everyone ranging from life insurance and credit card companies to automakers and state governments,” Foxx said. “Where does it stop?” Read more: Foxx op-ed in Human Events: Bailing out of the Bailout Mt Airy News: Foxx seeks superior alternatives to bailout plan

These constituents are eligible for share: f t More than 800 Fifth District taxpayers can still claim stimulus payments Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today released a list of more than 800 Fifth District constituents that the federal government unsuccessfully attempted to mail an economic stimulus check to this year. These constituents are eligible for economic stimulus payments or other tax refunds, but did not receive a check because payments mailed by the IRS were returned. "Every North Carolinian who filed for an economic stimulus payment deserves to get the money that was promised to them,” Rep. Foxx said. “Taxpayers can check my web site, www.foxx.house.gov, for a complete county-by-county list of names and learn if they should have received a refund check from the IRS.” (Click here for complete list) Constituents whose names are on the list of refund checks returned by the U.S. Postal Service due to mailing address errors can claim their check by contacting the IRS directly. Unclaimed checks include both regular tax refunds and economic stimulus payments. To receive unclaimed checks, all a taxpayer has to do is update his or her address. The IRS will then send out all checks due. Taxpayers who did not receive their anticipated economic stimulus payment can use the “Where’s My Stimulus Payment?” feature on www.irs.gov to check on the status of the missing stimulus payment and update their addresses if necessary. Economic stimulus claimants without internet access can call 1-866-234-2942 to check on a missing payment. Taxpayers who did not receive their anticipated refund can use the “Where’s My Refund?” feature on www.irs.gov to check on the status of the missing refund, initiate refund tracers and update their addresses online, 24/7. Taxpayers without internet access can call 1-800-829-1040 to check on a missing refund. Taxpayers with undeliverable stimulus payments must update their addresses by November 28, 2008 to ensure the IRS can reissue the stimulus checks by the statutory deadline of December 31, 2008. Currently, in North Carolina, there are 3,038 undeliverable refund checks totaling $2,768,764 and there are 8,898 undeliverable economic stimulus payments totaling $5,005,510.
10.21.2008	The National Tax Limitation Committee has honored Congresswoman Foxx with its "Tax Fighter Award" for her work to keep taxes low in the 110th Congress. share: f t Contact: Press Office 202-225-2071 The National Tax Limitation Committee has honored Congresswoman Foxx with its “Tax Fighter Award” for her work to keep taxes low in the 110th Congress. "Congresswoman Foxx's votes on tax and spending issues earned her an 'A' grade and the Tax Fighter Award,” said NTLC President Lewis K. Uhler when he announced presentation of the award to Congresswoman Foxx. "Congresswoman Foxx has been a major asset to taxpayers across America. She has the courage to challenge the orthodoxy of Washington spending and earmarks." Foxx has consistently opposed federal tax hikes on families, seniors and employers. She fought to slash government spending, to end the death tax, to fix the Alternative Minimum Tax and to stop tax hikes on retirees’ Social Security payments. “It is an honor to be recognized for my work to keep taxes low for North Carolina’s working families,” Foxx said. “But the work of reining in wasteful spending never ends and I will continue to fight for low taxes and reduced federal government spending.” "Congresswoman Foxx has led the battle on behalf of taxpayers to eliminate the death tax, to eliminate the 1993 tax increase on Social Security earnings, to kill the Alternative Minimum Tax, to provide incentives for private savings, investment and job creation and to control the growth of federal spending.
10.17.2008	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx's "Electronic Paystub" legislation was signed into law this week. Her bill, the Electronic Pay Stub Act, ensures that all federal employees are given the option of receiving their pay stubs electronica share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Law helps protect federal workers from ID theft, saves millions in printing/mailing costs Congresswoman Virginia Foxx’s “Electronic Paystub” legislation was signed into law this week. Her bill, the Electronic Pay Stub Act, ensures that all federal employees are given the option of receiving their pay stubs electronically. The legislation has the potential to save the federal government millions of dollars each year and will ensure federal workers’ pay stubs are delivered faster and more securely. “This law is a common sense step that will save taxpayer dollars, reduce waste and help federal employees keep their identities secure,” Foxx said. “This legislation gives every federal employee the opportunity to receive their pay stub via a secure web site instead of in the mail. It will save millions in taxpayer dollars, dramatically reduce paper consumption and reduce the risk of identity theft for federal employees.” Many private companies, corporations and state governments like Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, South Dakota and Nebraska offer the option of accessing employee pay stubs electronically (e-stubs). Until now the federal government has not offered this option to every federal employee. Giving all federal employees the option of accessing their pay stubs electronically will save taxpayers millions every year. In fact, a study conducted in Idaho found that paper stubs cost ten times more than e-stubs: $.30 vs. $.03. E-stubs not only save money and paper, they are also safer than sending pay stubs via ground mail, reducing the chance of them getting lost or falling into the wrong hands. Employees who receive electronic pay stubs will be able to instantly access their pay information with considerably less risk of this information falling prey to identity theft. The Electronic Pay Stub Act, or H.R. 6073, is the second substantive bill authored by Foxx to become law. Her first bill, the HERO Act, was signed into law on Memorial Day 2006. The HERO Act changed IRS law to allow members of the armed services to save for retirement by investing their combat pay into Individual Retirement Accounts.
10.16.2008	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today announced that there are only two weeks left for students to apply for admission to the nation's service academies through her Congressional office. Students can submit applications to Rep. Foxx& share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today announced that there are only two weeks left for students to apply for admission to the nation’s service academies through her Congressional office. Students can submit applications to Rep. Foxx’s office for the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, the Merchant Marine Academy, the Coast Guard Academy and the Military Academy at West Point. “America’s service academies provide incredible opportunities for young people looking to serve as the next generation of American leaders,” Foxx said. “While the selection and training process are rigorous, the benefit of a lifetime of service to our country cannot be overestimated. With just two weeks left before the application deadline I encourage students to finalize and submit their applications.” The deadline for the 2008 application season is November 1, 2008. To be considered for an appointment to a service academy, an applicant must meet the eligibility requirements established by law and be nominated by an authorized person such as a Member of Congress. Students pursuing a nomination should contact Congresswoman Foxx’s District Office in Clemmons, NC at (336) 778-0211 or visit her website at www.foxx.house.gov for additional information about submitting completed applications. An applicant for a nomination must meet the following eligibility requirements as of July 1 of the year of admission to a service academy: He or she must be at least 17 years old, but not have passed the 23rd birthday, must be a United States citizen, and must be unmarried, not pregnant, and have no legal obligation to support children or other dependents.
09.18.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today introduced bipartisan legislation that will shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and businesses. The legislation fixes loopholes in a 1995 law t share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Legislation gives local governments, employers access to critical cost estimates U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today introduced bipartisan legislation (H.R. 6964) that will shed light on how federal policies impact the budgets of state and local governments and businesses. The legislation fixes loopholes in a 1995 law that reined in expensive and unfunded federal mandates. Ultimately, this legislation will help states and small businesses better manage and forecast their budgetary needs. “State and local governments and small business owners are all too familiar with the financial burden of new federal laws and regulations,” Rep. Foxx said. “During these difficult economic times North Carolinians rely on small businesses and local governments for jobs and for services like healthcare, education and job training. My bill holds the federal government accountable to the public by exposing the hidden costs of federal policies.” The purpose of this bipartisan legislation (The Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act of 2008) is to enhance transparency, accountability, and awareness of federal mandates. It amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which ensured public awareness of the crushing financial burden of federal mandates on employers and state and local governments. UMRA’s main objective in 1995 was to force the federal government to estimate how much unfunded mandates would cost local governments and businesses and rein in out of control mandates. Foxx’s bill expands the scope of UMRA by closing loopholes that allowed certain policies to escape its reporting requirements. “New, costly regulations and legislation are often created with little thought for how they will squeeze local governments and employers,” Foxx said. “By updating this law, we can ensure that Congress and the public are aware of how federal policies financially impact the people we serve.” Foxx’s bill also requires the federal government to report on how changing the requirements for existing federal grant programs would shift costs to local governments. For instance, grant programs—such as No Child Left Behind—that are administered by states are often altered by federal legislation. Under this bill the federal government would have to disclose how such changes could negatively impact state or local government budgets.

09.16.2008	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today voiced strong opposition to legislation drafted behind closed doors that will prohibit North Carolina from receiving revenue from new offshore oil drilling. Instead all revenue from new offshore dril share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Bill introduced last night would bar NC from oil revenue off its own shores Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today voiced strong opposition to legislation drafted behind closed doors that will prohibit North Carolina from receiving revenue from new offshore oil drilling. Instead all revenue from new offshore drilling leases will go straight into federal government coffers. The bill, HR 6889, does not allow for any amendments and was written and introduced without Republican input. “This bill is a slap in the face to the state of North Carolina,” Rep. Foxx said. “It would lock North Carolina out of a share of the $2.6 trillion in tax revenue from new drilling right off our shores. What a sham.” The new 290-page legislation was introduced just before midnight last night, only hours before it is scheduled for a vote. It does not allow amendments or Republican alternatives. In addition, bill was written behind closed doors and did not go through the normal committee process. “This bill is wrong for North Carolina and it is wrong for America,” Rep. Foxx said. “Is Speaker Pelosi so concerned with placating her extremist environmental backers that she has to push through this legislation to lock coastal states out of oil revenue?” “Today’s farce of a bill not only steals North Carolina’s new coastal energy revenue, but it also locks us out of the energy debate. Thanks a lot, Speaker Pelosi. This bill is a perfect example of the House Democrats’ broken promises.” Foxx today also voiced opposition to provisions in the legislation that would permanently lock up more than 95 percent of offshore oil on the west coast and 88 percent of offshore oil overall. Note: Gulf coast states like Texas and Louisiana currently receive a share of revenues from offshore drilling, which last year were about $9 billion. The Norfolk, Va. Virginian-Pilot reports that this bill blocks “coastal states from sharing in a $2.6 trillion bonanza of tax revenue expected to flow from offshore fields.”

Executives ousted in the wake of the federal gove share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Slams taxpayer-funded bailout of massive executive severance packages at lending giants Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has co-sponsored legislation (H.R. 6468) to stop executives at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae from receiving extravagant “golden parachute” severance packages. Executives ousted in the wake of the federal government takeover of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could take home more than $14 million and $9 million respectively in severance packages, according to media reports. “Don’t we pay CEO’s for successfully managing companies, not running them into the ground?” Rep. Foxx said. “Taxpayers are already on the hook for bailing out these massive lenders. They should not be forced to bail out fat cat executives who are receiving outrageous payouts for their failed leadership.” The legislation, introduced in Congress this week, amends the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 to specifically prohibit massive severance packages for executives at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. It would prevent the sort of multi-million dollar golden parachutes that departing CEOs at the two lenders are being currently offered. “American taxpayers have been already exposed to billions in risk and liability with the takeover of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae,” Foxx said. “Thanks to poor business decisions these two lenders need to be rescued. It is simply reckless to reward this kind of leadership with million-dollar payouts.” Note: Congress passed a so-called “housing bailout” bill in July. Despite warnings that the housing bailout bill (H.R. 3221) amounted to “private profit, public risk”, the flawed and rushed bill failed to protect taxpayers against having to finance these exorbitant and unnecessary executive payments. In fact, H.R. 3221 was so rushed that the 694-page text was not made available to lawmakers until 6:30 pm the night before it was voted on. All told, the bill was made available for review just 16 hours prior to its consideration in the House, was allotted just two hours of debate time, and was not open to amendment. The consequences of this hasty consideration of the most sweeping changes to housing law in a generation are now starting to become obvious.

Reports of prices upwards of $5.00 prompted Rep. Foxx to write to the FTC Chairman in ensure that potentially unlawful price increases are investigated. The text of the letter follows: Mr. Willian E. Kovacic Chairman Federal Trade Commission 600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20580 Dear Chairman Kovacic: The threat of Hurricane Ike’s effect on our nation’s oil supply is being reflected in an unnecessary, extreme increase in gasoline prices in North Carolina. This is of great concern to me, as consumers are already overwhelmed by high energy costs. Adding to this burden is extremely harmful to my constituents. While I understand that some of pipelines used to transport gasoline into North Carolina are based on the Gulf of Mexico, it does not seem reasonable that the price at the pump should have leaped in an excessive amount. Consumers have been experiencing prices that have increased by over $1 per gallon in one day. This is unprecedented and unwarranted, even in the case of a natural disaster. I request that you investigate these price fluctuations to ensure that prices are not being unlawfully increased. We must make certain that consumers are being treated fairly. Thank you for your time, attention, and consideration. Sincerely, Virginia Foxx Member of Congress

The Pentagon Memorial to 9/11 victims, which was dedicated today, on the 7th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks. “More importantly, we remember those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. We mourn with the families, the friends and the communities affected by the events of this tragic day. “On that September day the American spirit shone through like on few other days in our history. Thousands of heroes made unimaginable sacrifices and unwavering bravery marked the response of those who rescued the victims, those who fought back against tyranny and those who rebuilt shattered lives. “My prayers go with the many who lost family and friends seven years ago. And my prayers and gratitude are with the brave men and women of our armed services who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the campaign to bring the perpetrators to justice. May we never forget the sacrifices that have been made.”

Foxx said. “Working people are tired of being robbed of their hard-earned money with every visit to the gas pump. But Speaker Pelosi’s proposal is not a serious attempt to bring down the price of gas. Instead this bill is a farce that places American energy under lock and key and will drive up the cost of energy for all Americans.” “Make no mistake,” Foxx said. “This is not a drilling bill. It is a charade that will do nothing to bring down the price of gas. American deserves a real debate—a fair debate that allows for an ‘all of the above’ approach to our energy crisis. The Republican-authored alternative legislation—The American Energy Act—is a comprehensive plan that tackles sky-high energy prices by increasing production of American energy, promoting energy conservation and investing in alternative fuel sources. The American Energy Act will allow new environmentally safe drilling for American oil and gas which will help end America’s dependence on foreign oil.

Speaker Pelosi may have turned off the lights, cameras, and microphones, but we are still here fighting for Americans who are feeling the pain at the pump,” Foxx said. “Back home, my constituents are hurting from high energy prices. I recently received a letter from a Boy Scout in Winston-Salem who said that rising prices may prevent his family from being able to afford going to church. This is completely unacceptable for my constituents and also unacceptable for the constituents represented by my friends on the other side of the aisle,” Foxx said. “We are asking Speaker Pelosi to cut short her book tour and reconvene the House to vote on legislation to increase American-made energy. With American families paying record high gas prices, they expect leadership not more broken promises from Democrats.” ###

Airy on August 5th. The workshops will be conducted in cooperation with the Concord Coalition, a national, non-partisan grassroots organization that has developed a program to foster understanding of the federal budget process. “Many taxpayers are not familiar with how the federal budget is created,” Rep. Foxx said. “These workshops will give local taxpayers an inside look at the budget and let them use their personal spending priorities to create a model federal budget.” The Concord Coalition program, called Principles & Priorities, teaches participants about the federal budget and provides realistic insight into how some of the policy proposals in today’s news would affect the operations of the federal government. Principles & Priorities is an interactive exercise in which participants learn about how difficult it is to balance the federal budget by making many of the same policy decisions that lawmakers face. Participants will be able to review current spending priorities, suggest principles for the future, and then apply these principles by selecting from several dozen priorities currently being discussed in Washington. “Fiscal responsibility is more important than ever for the federal government and these budget workshops promise to help North Carolina taxpayers grasp just how much goes into creating a federal budget each year,” Foxx said. By considering issues such as federal spending, tax policy, and entitlement reform, participants will gain firsthand experience in addressing the difficult issues facing policymakers in today's fiscal environment. They will then recommend a package of policies to put America on a sound fiscal foundation for the next several years. The workshops conclude with a wrap-up discussion of the budget results and the lessons learned from the exercise. The events will take place on August 4th at the Iredell County Library in Statesville from 6:00pm to 8:00 pm and on August 5th at the Mount Airy library from 6:00pm to 8pm. This event is free to the public, so participants are encouraged to bring family and friends. For more information on this event, please contact Rep. Foxx’s office at 202-225-2071.

Foxx was joined on her visit by D&D Displays CEO James D. Brown as well as representatives from the Chamber of Commerce and local government. Foxx learns about manufacturing processes at the Wilkes County company. “Economic growth is a pillar of American freedom,” Foxx said. “I’m excited to see the progress that D&D Displays has made in Wilkes County to create good jobs and boost the local economy. D&D Displays announced a new project this week that could provide up to $22 million in new revenue for the North Wilkesboro-based company. Company CEO James D. Brown said that the company hopes to more than double its Wilkes employment rolls thanks to the new project. “Success stories like D&D Displays will help strengthen our economy,” Foxx said. “The simple fact is that strong businesses create good jobs and Congress must do everything it can to create an economic environment in which businesses can create jobs and thrive.” "D&D Displays is an American company producing American products, right here in North Carolina,” Brown said. “We would like to thank Congresswoman Foxx for her help in keeping manufacturing jobs here in North Carolina. With our newest Milestone reached, we should double if not triple our employment base in 2009. Congresswoman Foxx's support for the local Chamber of Commerce and her active role in our community has helped companies like ours grow and prosper in a tough economy." D&D Displays specializes in custom cabinetry and high end store fixtures for retail vendors such as Newell-Rubbermaid, Inc., Bosch Tool Corporation, Kronotex, USA, and S&K Men's Wear. D&D Displays has been in operation since 2000 and became a subsidiary of Expo Holdings of North Wilkesboro in 2006.

The legislation, called the American Energy Act (H.R. 6566), aims to increase the supply of American-made energy, improve conservation efforts, and promote new technology that will help bring down the cost of gas. “High gas prices are hitting North Carolinians hard and we must take bold action to wean America off foreign sources of oil,” Foxx said. “This legislation offers a broad set of solutions, with everything from new drilling to new investment in the fuels of the future.” The American Energy Act tackles high gas prices in three key areas: increasing supply, reducing demand and investing in alternative energy sources. It increases supply by opening deep water resources, the Arctic coastal plain and shale oil resources and by reducing the bureaucratic hurdles blocking construction of new refineries. It is estimated that these sources hold the potential to provide an additional 6.5 million barrels of oil per day. The legislation aims to reduce American demand for oil by improving energy conservation and efficiency. It provides tax credits for the purchase of fuel efficient vehicles, home-based solar power and biomass, energy efficient buildings, and energy efficient appliances. The American Energy Act also offers a cash prize for the development of the first mass-produced car that gets 100 miles-per-gallon. By way of promoting renewable and alternative energy, the American Energy Act creates a renewable energy trust fund with federal revenues from deep sea and Arctic coastal plain oil exploration. Additionally, it repeals the “Section 526” prohibition on government purchasing of alternative energy and promoting coal-to-liquids technology. It also makes the expiring tax credit for alternative energy production—including wind, solar and hydrogen—permanent.

Until Congress lifts its ban on drilling, billions of barrels of American oil remain under lock and key. “Increasing our domestic supply of oil will help reduce the cost of gas, signaling America’s willingness to develop American-made energy. New deepwater drilling is a critical part of a comprehensive approach to bringing down the cost of gas and ending America’s dependence on oil from the Middle East. “Congress must act now to lift the congressional ban on offshore drilling and show hard-working Americans that we are serious about easing the pain at the pump. We must pursue an “all of the above” energy strategy that taps into both American innovation and American sources of energy, from domestic oil in northern Alaska to solar power in the southwest and everything in between.” Read More: VIDEO: How Congress can take on high gas and food prices NEWS: Foxx presses Congress to vote on coal-to-liquid bill OPINION: It's time for a Declaration of Energy Independence

She pressed members of the House of Representatives on both sides of the aisle to allow debate on a bipartisan bill (H.R. 2208) that creates incentives for the production of diesel fuel from coal. “America has a 250 year supply of coal,” Foxx said. “We should be doing all we can to find a way to transform this abundant energy resource into clean burning diesel. This legislation will jumpstart the debate on coal-to-liquid technology and would encourage new investment in a promising source of American-made energy.” Foxx today joined more than 100 members of the House of Representatives who signed onto a measure called a discharge petition that would bring the Coal Liquid Fuel Act (H.R. 2208) up for a vote. The petition needs 218 Congressional signatures in order to get the Coal Liquid Fuel Act onto the House floor for debate. “Sky-high gas prices mean Congress needs an 'all of the above' approach to our energy problems,” Foxx said. “North Carolina families would benefit from projects like coal to liquid, wind energy, new domestic oil supplies or solar power—anything that can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil and bring down the cost of gas.” The Coal Liquid Fuel Act has been stalled in a House committee for more than 14 months. It would sanction government-backed loans for coal to liquid programs and encourage new investment in coal to liquid research and production. Coal to liquid technology turns coal into sulfur-free diesel fuel and promises to help offset the more than 400,000 barrels of diesel fuel imported by the U.S. each day.

Today’s Supreme Court ruling is a victory for individual rights and for the fundamental personal liberties every American enjoys each day.” Note: Last year Rep Foxx signed an amicus brief that was submitted to the Supreme Court urging the Court to overturn the District of Columbia’s unconstitutional gun ban. Rep.

Foxx voted in favor of the troop funding legislation last night, which includes approximately $165 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan through June 2009 and also includes $52 billion for veterans’ education benefits. “After months of negotiations we finally have a bill that funds the troops without billions in wasteful Washington pork and political strings attached,” Foxx said. “Commonsense prevailed and our men and women in uniform will have the funding they need for the next year.” The final compromise version of the troop funding bill cut more than $8 billion in wasteful, unrelated Washington spending inserted by Senate Democrats and did not include tax increases sought by House Democrats. “Not only does this legislation get our troops the funding they need when they need it, but our military commanders will be free to make strategic decisions without unnecessary and politically motivated meddling,” Foxx said. The provisions of the compromise version of H.R. 2642, the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 are: Provides Troop Funding for fiscal year 2008-2009. H.R. 2642 ensures that American troops have the resources they need, rejecting demands from Democrats to stop funding our troops as they make significant progress in Iraq and Afghanistan. Eliminates ALL War Restrictions. This bill gets our troops the funding they need for success without any politically-motivated restrictions. Includes NO Tax Increases. The legislation includes no tax increases of any kind sought by House Democrats. Provides New Education Resources for American Veterans. This new education program will help our veterans (or their families) get a better education after they return from Iraq and Afghanistan. Maintains Work Requirements for Unemployment Insurance. At GOP insistence, H.R. 2642 protects taxpayers by maintaining the 20-week work requirement in order for a worker to receive extended unemployment benefits. The agreement also limits the extension of benefits to 13 additional weeks. Cuts Wasteful Pork. The compromise bill cuts $8 billion in wasteful Washington spending added by Senate Democrats. Rejects Funding for Planned Parenthood. The legislation eliminates funding sought by Democrats for Planned Parenthood.

H.R. 4987 mandates the completion of a double-layer fence along the U.S.-Mexico border by June 30, 2009. Rep. Jones introduced the bill this January in order to restore funding to the border fence project and ensure its timely completion. Steve Elliott, President of Grassfire.org, presented the signatures of nearly 250,000 citizens who support the Fence By Date Certain Act to the members of Congress present at the press conference. Foxx also made the following remarks at today’s press conference: “We cannot solve our illegal immigration problem if we don’t enforce our laws and police our border. “Congress took decisive steps in 2006 to staunch the flow of illegal immigrants by passing the necessary legislation to build a border fence. But this past winter this law was hijacked and stripped clean of requirements to build the fence. The Fence By Date Certain Act remedies this national security disaster by requiring the construction of 700 miles of double-layer fence along the border, to be completed by June 30, 2009. “I commend my friends Mr. Jones and Mr. King for championing this important legislative fix to our border fence problem. I know from hearing from constituents back in North Carolina’s Fifth District that they have had it with illegal immigration and the poor enforcement of our nation’s immigration laws. “This important grassroots petition that we are presenting to Congress today, with its nearly 250,000 signatures, is a clarion call to meaningful action on illegal immigration. As a nation we cannot tolerate the widespread flaunting of America’s immigration laws. Illegal immigration fundamentally undermines our national security, our sovereignty and our centuries-old foundation of the rule of law. “Today we have more than 12 million illegal immigrants in America. The longer we wait to take decisive action and fix our broken immigration system, the longer the problem of illegal immigration will persist and erode our national security. The Fence by Date Certain Act is an important step in the right direction and we must bring it up for an up or down vote this year. “Our border lacks adequate security and we simply cannot afford to wait any longer to pass this legislation. So I call on Speaker Pelosi and the House Democrat leadership to schedule a vote now on the Fence by Date Certain Act.” Read more: Untangling the mess of immigration reform The Issues: Immigration
06.05.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today called on the Democrat-controlled Congress to take up legislation to increase the supply of American oil and gas. She also highlighted the different approaches that Democrats and Republicans in t share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Highlights contrasting records on American-made oil and gas U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today called on the Democrat-controlled Congress to take up legislation to increase the supply of American oil and gas. She also highlighted the different approaches that Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives take to domestic oil and natural gas production. “How high must gas prices go before Democrats in Congress allow a vote on legislation to increase American-made oil and gas?” Foxx asked. “North Carolina drivers are fed up with high gas prices and can’t afford to wait any longer for Congress to take action. We’ve got some very sensible proposals to tap our domestic oil supplies and invest in alternative energy, and they are just languishing, waiting for an up or down vote.” “The public record is abundantly clear,” Foxx said. “Over the past 15 years 91 percent of House Republicans have voted to increase American energy production while a mere 14 percent of House Democrats supported these commonsense proposals.” A study of voting patterns in the House since 1994 demonstrates that historically 91 percent of House Republicans have voted to increase production of American-made oil and gas, while 86 percent of their Democrat counterparts voted against increased production. The study also found that 97 percent of House Republicans voted to support coal-to-liquid technology and 78 percent of Democrats opposed this technology. Click here to watch a YouTube video where Congresswoman Foxx calls on Congress to vote on legislation to bring down the price of gas. About American Energy Production: In May, Rep. Foxx cosponsored The American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act (H.R. 6107), a bill that would allow for the production of oil on 2,000 acres of northern Alaska in ANWR. This legislation would reduce oil prices by allowing the U.S. to tap an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil and use the resulting revenue windfall to fund a wide array of existing renewable energy initiatives.
06.05.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today voted against the final 2009 federal budget which includes $683 billion in tax hikes over the next five years. These increases amount to the largest tax increase in American history. share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen 202-225-2071 Foxx opposes 2009 Federal Budget that increases taxes on every American U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today voted against the final 2009 federal budget which includes $683 billion in tax hikes over the next five years. These increases amount to the largest tax increase in American history. “Here they go again,” Rep. Foxx said. “This budget is stuffed with billions in new spending and, as usual, taxpayers are on the hook. The last thing hard-working Americans paying $4 per gallon for gas need is a massive tax increase.” The 2009 budget includes $24.5 billion in new spending, a number that grows to $241 billion in increased spending over the next five years. Under the Democrat budget plan, 116 million American taxpayers also would be nailed with an average tax hike of $1,833. Working families are hit especially hard by the 2009 budget: for instance, a family of four with two children that currently earns $50,000 a year would be forced to pay an additional $2,155 in taxes under the Democrat plan. This is a 191 percent increase in that family’s tax bill. “By allowing middle-class families’ taxes to skyrocket Democrats are simply polishing their bona fides as tax-and-spend legislators,” Foxx said. “The American people deserve a budget that reins in government spending, addresses our $43 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations, and provides real earmark reform. This is not that budget.” The Democrat budget resolution for fiscal year 2009 passed earlier today by a slim margin of 214-210, with no Republicans voting to approve it.
05.23.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today cosponsored The American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act (H.R. 6107), a bill that would allow for the production of oil on 2,000 acres of northern Alaska. This legislation would reduce oil prices by all share: f t Contact: 202-225-2071 Bill protects environment and uses oil revenue for alternative energy R&D U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx today cosponsored The American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act (H.R. 6107), a bill that would allow for the production of oil on a tiny section of northern Alaska. This legislation would reduce oil prices by allowing the U.S. to tap an estimated 10.4 billion barrels of oil and use the resulting revenue windfall to fund a wide array of existing renewable energy initiatives. “America has been held hostage by Middle Eastern oil for too long,” Foxx said. “This bill allows us to develop America’s largest untapped oil field and cut our dependence on foreign oil. But more importantly it creates a bridge to the future by dedicating the federal oil revenue to research in 18 different renewable and alternative energy programs.” Under H.R. 6107, ANWR oil lease revenue would fund existing, congressionally authorized programs that have been not yet fully funded. These programs include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass, cellulosic biofuel and marine energy programs. “The Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act is a comprehensive, problem-solving bill. It intentionally addresses energy supply and energy demand,” Foxx said. “Adding a million barrels a day of U.S. oil will reduce our nation’s demand for foreign oil by increasing American oil supply. And by using the revenues from more than 10 billion barrels of oil to research renewable and alternative energy we can permanently reduce our need for foreign oil and slash our overall oil consumption—without raising taxes on hardworking Americans.” H.R. 6107 also requires the strictest environmental regulations and restrictions ever to be applied to a major oil development project, ensuring that Alaska’s oil resources are tapped in the most environmentally safe manner possible. By using today’s most advanced technology and by employing strict environmental safeguards the U.S. could have oil production in ANWR and the resulting lower prices at the pump within five years. Once oil production begins, this oil field is expected to produce one million barrels a day for more than 30 years--equivalent to the production of the entire state of Texas. According to the Congressional Research Service, ANWR oil development would result in $191.1 billion in new federal revenues. H.R. 6107 Energy Provisions · Opens ANWR and brings an additional one million barrels per day online in less than five years; · Limits the footprint of oil and natural gas development to 2,000 acres; · Requires the most advanced, commercially-available technology; · Puts in place the strictest environmental regulations and restrictions ever to be applied to a development project; · Establishes a Coastal Impact Aid fund to address the concerns of/impact on local Native Communities; Alternative Energy Trust Fund H.R. 6107 establishes the ANWR Alternative Energy Trust Fund. Rents, bonus bids, and royalties revenue resulting from ANWR lease sales would be directed into the Fund to pay for the following renewable and alternative energy provisions authorized - but not funded - under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT) and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA): EPAct2005 Section 210 – Biomass grants Section 242—Hydroelectric Production Incentives Section 369—Strategic Unconventional Fuels Section 401—Clean Coal Power Section 812—Solar and Wind Technologies Section 931—Renewable Energy Grants Section 942—Cellulosic Biofuels Section 962—Coal & Related Technologies Section 968—Methane Hydrates Research Section 1704—Incentives for Innovative Technologies EISAct2007 Section 207—Advanced Biofuels Production Grants Section 607—Photovoltaic Cell Demonstration Program Title VI, Subtitle B—Geothermal Energy Title VI, Subtitle C—Marine and Hydrokinetic Energy Section 641—Energy Storage Competitiveness Title VII, Subtitle A—CCS R, D&D Section 1112—Capital Grants for Class II & III RRs Section 1304—Smart Grid Technology R, D&D

Mujica, Chairman of the Board of U.S. English. “At a time when there is renewed interest in preserving what unites us as a nation, we are grateful to Rep. Foxx for her dedicated and enthusiastic support of this issue.” The “A in English” award was given to Representatives who received “A” grades on the U.S. English legislative scorecard for the 110th Congress. Legislation that factored into the decision included co-sponsorship of H.R. 997, the English Language Unity Act, as well as a series of Congressional votes on reducing multilingualism in government and allowing employers the flexibility to enact English-in-the-Workplace policies. A full listing of the votes and grades can be found at http://www.usenglish.org. According to recent national polls, the vast majority of Americans support making English the official language of the United States. Polls conducted by Zogby International, the Winston Group and Rasmussen Reports have all found more than 80 percent of Americans in support of official English policies, with strong majorities among Republicans, Democrats and Independents.

The Swan Creek AVA is the second AVA in North Carolina, preceded by the Yadkin Valley AVA. Wines made from grapes grown within the geographical boundaries of the Swan Creek AVA may now carry that designation on their labels as well as the Yadkin Valley AVA. U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx, supporter of the Swan Creek AVA and representative of the district, said, “The approval of the Swan Creek wine region is tremendous news for North Carolina wine makers and the larger agricultural community. I am confident that this new viticulture area will provide an economic boost to both local vineyards and the people of Wilkes, Yadkin and Iredell Counties. I look forward to helping North Carolina growers like Raffaldini Vineyards and the associated vineyards of Swan Creek to continue to thrive and create sustainable economic growth in their communities.” Chief sponsor of the petition for the AVA, Raffaldini Vineyards, notes that the designation “aides our collective efforts to educate consumers about the quality of Swan Creek wines and what makes them unique from the rest of North Carolina and the Yadkin Valley.” The Swan Creek AVA encompasses 160-180 sq. miles in Wilkes, Yadkin and Iredell counties. Its proximity to the Brushy Mountains gives Swan Creek a distinct, loamy soil consisting of schist, mica and other minerals as well as a microclimate that make Swan Creek wines unique. There are currently five vineyards located within the Swan Creek AVA: Raffaldini Vineyards in Ronda, N.C. and Laurel Gray Vineyards, Buck Shoals Vineyards, Shadow Springs Vineyard and Dobbins Creek Vineyards in Hamptonville, N.C. Several varietals of vinifera grapes are grown within the Swan Creek AVA, including many traditional and unique French and Italian varietals not widely available in the U.S.

The 362,000-member, nonpartisan citizen group applauded Foxx for having the most “taxpayer friendly” voting record in North Carolina’s Congressional delegation. “Protecting North Carolina taxpayers’ money is a daily challenge in a Congress where compulsive tax-and-spenders hold the gavel,” Rep. Foxx. “But it is a fight worth fighting and I am pleased that the National Taxpayers Union has recognized my efforts on behalf of the taxpayers.” “While many Members of Congress talked about reducing the size of government last year, Congresswoman Foxx backed up those words with votes,” NTU President Duane Parde said. “This award proves that Foxx is a staunch ally we can count on in our battle to restore fiscal responsibility to Washington.” The Taxpayers’ Friend award is presented to those members of Congress who achieve an “A” grade in NTU’s annual Rating of Congress. The rating, which is based on every Congressional roll call vote affecting fiscal policy, assigns a “Taxpayer Score” to each Member of Congress that indicates his or her support for reducing or controlling federal spending, taxes, debt, and regulation. For 2007, a total of 427 House and 182 Senate votes were selected. “Representative Foxx’s pro-taxpayer score of 89 percent was one of the best in the entire House,” Parde said. “By consistently voting to reduce federal spending, taxes, and debt, Foxx has led by example in the fight to ease the burden on taxpayers everywhere. This is an achievement for which she should be proud.” From 2006 to 2007, the average “Taxpayer Score” in the House fell four points to 35 percent. In the Senate, the average pro-taxpayer score fell 11 points to 37 percent. However, true “high performers” in Congress are always rare. In 2007, 52 lawmakers earned scores sufficient to win the Taxpayers’ Friend Award. Meanwhile, more than 260 Members captured the title of “Big Spender” for scoring 16 percent or less in the House and 14 percent or less in the Senate. Unlike those of other organizations, NTU’s annual Rating does not simplistically focus on only a handful of equally weighted “key votes.” For this reason, it has received praise from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including the late Senator (and “Golden Fleece Award” creator) William Proxmire (D-WI). “If every Member of Congress had voted as responsibly as Representative Foxx did in 2007, Americans could have enjoyed much lower taxes and less waste in government,” Parde said. “Overburdened taxpayers in North Carolina and across the nation owe Foxx a debt of gratitude for her hard work on their behalf. She has truly earned the title ‘Taxpayers’ Friend.’” Click here to read the NTU ratings report. Click here to view photos of NTU presenting Rep. Foxx with the Taxpayers' Friend Award.

The Blogger Protection Act will transform current regulations that protect bloggers' rights into permanent federal law. "Bloggers are a vital part of our national dialogue," Foxx said. "Everyday, countless Americans take part in the political process via the blogosphere–breaking news, checking facts and voicing support or opposition to various candidates. We must ensure their rights are protected." The Federal Election Commission (FEC) issued regulations two years ago to ensure bloggers free speech rights were not infringed upon by certain campaign finance laws. This ruling protected bloggers from misinterpretations of the law. Concerns had been raised that some people might construe bloggers writing about or linking to federal campaigns as a contribution or expenditure on behalf of (or in opposition to) a candidate. Additionally, the FEC ruled that blogs should be treated like any other publication under federal campaign laws. Without such protections, bloggers could be subject to various limitations and reporting requirements under campaign finance law. But all of these blogger protections are merely regulatory–they are not in the law and can be changed without congressional action. "We must not leave the First Amendment rights of bloggers in the hands of the Federal Election Commission," Foxx said. "Bloggers' rights are too important to leave them to the whims of a panel of federal regulators." Note: H.R. 5699 does not alter contribution limits to candidates merely because the contributions are made online. Rather, the bill would turn existing regulations into law. It would protect activities such as bloggers linking to campaign websites and editorializing about candidates and would ensure that these activities are not regarded as contributions to candidates. ###

03.14.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today voted against the Democrats’ 2009 federal budget, which includes a $683 billion tax hike and $276 billion in new spending. This tax increase is the largest in American history. share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen202-225-2071North Carolina taxpayers will see $2,672 average tax increaseU.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today voted against the Democrats’ 2009 federal budget, which includes a $683 billion tax hike and $276 billion in new spending. This tax increase is the largest in American history.“Our country cannot afford this irresponsible budget,” Foxx said. “This budget fails to rein in spending and raises the taxes of 116 million hard-working middle class Americans. As average North Carolinians face a slowing economy, the last thing they need is a job-killing tax hike.”Under the Democrat budget, North Carolina taxpayers will be hit with an average tax increase of $2,672. With more than $3 trillion in annual spending, the Democratic budget increases discretionary spending by $22 billion in FY 2009 and by $276 billion over the next five years. “The federal government should not spend one penny more of taxpayer money than it needs to,” Foxx said. “American taxpayers deserve the kind of fiscal accountability that prioritizes balancing the budget without raising taxes on the American people. But this budget is straight from the same old tax-and-spend school of budgeting that Americans simply can’t afford.”Foxx also highlighted the absence of Medicare and Social Security reform proposals in the Democrat budget. The budget does not address the $38.7 trillion unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare. By 2013, under this budget, unfunded liabilities will balloon to about $52.5 trillion.“Our children and grandchildren face an uncertain retirement future under these enormous unfunded Medicare liabilities. This budget fails to meaningfully address runway entitlement spending. Ignoring entitlement reform today only saddles the next generation with crushing debt while risking future benefit cuts and massive tax hikes. The longer we wait to address entitlement spending the harder and more painful it becomes.” Read more:Questions about the Economic Stimulus Package?Foxx Introduces Tax Reform LegislationRep.

The legislation, H.R. 3548, requires federal government agencies to use “plain language” in all public documents. “If we had a dollar for every constituent who needed help deciphering incomprehensible government documents we’d be well on our way to balancing the federal budget,” Foxx said. “This legislation is a common-sense step towards making the federal government more responsive and open to average Americans. It lets the sunshine into notoriously dense government reports and documents.”Section two of the ‘Plain Language Act’ states that the bill is intended to “improve the Federal Government's effectiveness and accountability to the public by promoting clear communication that the public can understand and use.” The legislation also requires federal agencies to report to Congress annually on steps that they are taking to make government documents readable. “This bill moves us in the direction of making government documents more user-friendly,” Foxx said. Foxx also proposed an amendment to the Plain Language Act that would preserve and enhance the role of the English language in government documents. While it seeks to protect the use of English in federal documents, the amendment does not restrict the use of other languages. The Committee approved the amendment by a unanimous vote.H.R. 3548 passed the Oversight and Government Reform panel and now heads to the floor for consideration by the full House of Representatives.

This bipartisan legislation would have permanently fixed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, and enabled our intelligence community to effectively monitor foreign terrorists’ electronic communications. “A 6-month fix to FISA, the Protect America Act, expired on February 17. It had allowed our intelligence agencies to monitor foreign terrorists' electronic communications on foreign soil without time-consuming court orders. But the House refused to take up the bill that passed the Senate with broad bipartisan support by a vote of 68-29. More than 20 Democrats voted in favor of this legislation to make the Protect America Act permanent. By refusing to consider this legislation, the House is embarking on an act of reckless irresponsibility. “America cannot afford to hit pause on our surveillance of foreign terrorists. Now that the Protect America Act has expired, our intelligence community faces cumbersome bureaucratic hurdles to monitoring the communication of suspected foreign terrorists. This paper-pushing approach takes precious time, which could mean the difference in thwarting the terrorists' plans or even protecting the lives of our troops. “We must pass this bill now. The votes are there. Not acting endangers our Nation's security and puts barriers in the way of fighting radical terrorists.

Representative Virginia Foxx today reminded constituents that in less than a year the nation will undergo a change in the way TV stations transmit over-the-air signals. On February 17, 2009 all television stations will stop broadcasting analog signals and will only transmit digital signals. The federal government has established a converter box coupon program for households with analog TVs that will need a special converter box. All U.S. households may request up to two $40 coupons for the purchase of a digital-to-analog converter box. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), a federal government agency, began to issue the $40 coupons this week. “Every constituent is eligible to request a coupon for the digital-to-analog converter box,” Rep. Foxx said. “Anyone who has an analog TV that receives signals by means of rabbit ears or any other over-the-air antenna can use the coupon for a converter box that will help keep that TV in service.”The DTV transition will provide television viewers with clearer pictures and additional program choices. It will also free up major portions of the nation’s airwaves for public safety communications for police, fire and rescue. Households with an analog TV set connected to cable or satellite service will continue to receive a viewable image after the transition and do not need to purchase a converter box. All digital TV sets are also ready for the DTV transition. The digital-to-analog converter boxes will be available soon at major retailers and online. They are expected to cost between $50 and $60 each. Households that request the $40 converter coupons from the NTIA will receive a list of local retailers that sell the converter boxes. The converter box coupons expire 90 days after they are issued.Converter box coupons can be requested online, by phone or by mail. The coupons can be requested at www.dtv2009.gov or by calling 1-888-DTV-2009 (1-888-388-2009).

02.15.2008	Now that the economic stimulus package has been signed into law, many North Carolina taxpayers have questions about how the new tax refunds will work. Below is a list of frequently asked questions and answers based on information from the share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen202-225-2071Now that the economic stimulus package has been signed into law, many North Carolina taxpayers have questions about how the new tax refunds will work. Below is a list of frequently asked questions and answers based on information from the IRS and the House Ways and Means Committee.1. Question: How are the checks calculated? / How much will I get?Answer: Rebate checks will be calculated based on 2007 tax returns and will be the sum of two separate calculations: (1) A base amount and; and(2) A per child bonus. 2. Question: What is the base amount? Answer: The base amount is whichever is greater between two options:(1) Option A – Federal income tax paid in 2007, with a maximumof $600 for single filers ($1,200 for married filing jointly) or(2) Option B – Flat amount of $300 for single filers ($600 for married couples filing jointly), but only if the filer’s “qualifyingincome” in 2007 was at least $3,000, or the filer paid at least some federal income taxes in 2007.For this purpose, “qualifying income” includes earned income (i.e., salary, wages, etc); Social Security benefits (including Social Security disability payments); and certain payments made by the VA to disabled veterans and their surviving spouses. 3. Question: What is the per child bonus?Answer: Anyone qualifying for the base amount (because they had at least $3,000 in “qualifying income” or paid at least some federal income taxes in 2007) also receives an additional $300 per child, with no limit on the number of children. 4. Question: Will there be any income limits on the checks?Answer: Checks will be phased-out for single filers with adjusted gross incomes (AGI) above $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly) by $50 for every $1,000 of AGI over $75,000 ($150,000 for married couples filing jointly). Here are two examples of how the phase out works:· An individual with AGI of $80,000 and federal income tax liability in excess of $600 would qualify for a basic rebate of $600. Because this individual’s AGI exceeds $75,000, however, her rebate is reduced by $250 (the credit is reduced by $50 for every $1,000 of AGI over $75,000). The taxpayer thus will receive a check for $350.· A married couple with two children, AGI of $160,000 and federal income tax liability before the child tax credit exceeding $1,200 qualifies for a basic rebate of $1,200 and an additional per child credit of $600, for a total rebate of $1,800. But because the couple’s AGI exceeds $150,000, their rebate is reduced by $500 ($50 for each $1,000 by which AGI exceeded $150,000). The couple will receive a check for $1,300.5. Question: I know some people won’t get a stimulus payment. How do I know if I’m one of them?Answer: You will not receive a stimulus payment in 2008, if any of the following apply to you:· You do not file a 2007 tax return.· Your net income tax liability is zero and your qualifying income is less than $3,000.· You can be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s return (i.e., students who can be claimed on a parent’s tax return are not eligible).· You do not have a valid Social Security Number. If you are married filing jointly and your spouse does not have a valid Social Security Number, you are also not eligible for a check. Similarly, the $300 per child bonus is only available for children for whom the parents provide a valid Social Security Number.· You are a nonresident alien.6. Question: When will I receive my stimulus payment?Answer: The Treasury Department will start sending out payments in early May. A schedule for when they will be delivered has not yet been announced.7. Question: I have moved since filing my 2007 tax return. How will my payment reach me?Answer: You should file a Form 8822 with the IRS and a change of address notice with the U.S. Postal Service. This will ensure your check is sent to your new address. Without your current address, the check could be returned to the IRS as undeliverable.8. Question: Will my stimulus payment be included in my regular tax refund? Will the checks or direct deposits come at the same time?Answer: No and no. Taxpayers who over-withheld their taxes during 2007 will receive two separate payments. The first will be a repayment of the over-payment of taxes from 2007. The second payment, which will come later, will be a separate stimulus payment.9. Question: I have not yet filed my 2007 tax return. Can I still qualify for a stimulus payment in 2008?Answer: Yes, but you must file a 2007 tax return. Although the IRS has yet to announce a schedule for delivery of the stimulus payments, those who file after April 15 – either with or without a tax-filing extension -- are likely to receive their stimulus payments later than those who file by April 15.10. Question: Is my stimulus payment taxable?Answer: No. You will not owe tax on your payment when you file your 2008 federal income tax return. But you should keep a copy of the IRS letter you receive later this year listing the amount of your payment. You will need to know this amount next year when you fill out your 2008 return.11. Question: I don’t qualify for a stimulus payment based on my 2007 return. But my tax situation will be different in 2008. Will I qualify for any of the benefit when I file those taxes in 2009?Answer: Depending on your situation. The 2008 tax instructions will include a worksheet to help those who did not qualify for a payment or those who received a reduced amount determine if they can obtain a benefit when they file their 2008 tax returns next year.12. Question: What if someone would receive a higher benefit based on 2008 income rather than their 2007 income?Answer: That taxpayer can receive the benefits of the stimulus bill changes on her 2008 income when filing a tax return in April of 2009. So, for example, a couple who had a child in 2008 and meets other income tests could receive the benefit of the $300 per child bonus when filling out their 2008 tax return. Note that this “true-up” operates only in the taxpayer’s favor. Someone who retires in 2007 and who has no qualifying income in 2008 and who pays no federal income taxes in 2008 does not have to give back the amount of a check that was paid this year and calculated based on 2007 income.13. Question: I'm eligible for a payment but I still owe federal income tax from a prior year. Will my payment be reduced?Answer: Yes. For this purpose, the stimulus payment is treated like any other tax refund. This means that part or all of your payment can be used to pay past-due federal or state income taxes or non-tax federal debt such as student loans and child support. If this occurs, you will receive a letter explaining how the stimulus payment was applied.These answers are based on Ways & Means materials and the website of the Internal Revenue Service.###

Both Mr. Clemens and Mr. McNamee's testimonies will be subject to intense scrutiny. “Not only does the reputation of one of baseball's best pitchers lie in the balance, but how baseball looks to the future will be shaped by these outcomes. I trust that Senator Mitchell and Commissioner Selig will take their responsibilities in this matter very seriously.“However, this confidence does not address my underlying question about why these proceedings were even necessary in the first place. It is the duty of criminal investigators and prosecutors to do their job and investigate how the law might have been broken. “The truth will undoubtedly be hashed and rehashed in civil proceedings and it is clearly in the best interests of Major League Baseball to lead the way towards eliminating illegal drug use from within its ranks. Naturally, the press will be there reporting to the American people every step of the way. “It is questionable that any of this should be taking place in the Committee. Although hearing all of the juicy details may be intriguing, certainly the infinite wisdom of Congress has its limits. My hope would be that we stick to debating policy and reforming government. “Congress should not be conducting a dog and pony show simply for the benefit of a national TV audience when we could be investigating the billions of dollars that the federal government wastes every day. The committee should be spending its time on oversight and government accountability not on ‘he said, she said’ dispute resolution.” ###
02.11.2008	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today announced that she pledges not to conduct "robo" calls to voters in her district who have registered their phone number with the National Political Do Not Contact (NPDNC) registry at share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen (202) 225-2071 Foxx Signs Pledge Promising Not to Conduct “Robo” Calls to Constituents Registered at National Political Do Not Contact Registry U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today announced that she pledges not to conduct “robo” calls to voters in her district who have registered their phone number with the National Political Do Not Contact (NPDNC) registry at StopPoliticalCalls.org. Rep. Foxx is the first Member of Congress to take the “Do Not Robo Call” pledge since the non-profit Citizens for Civil Discourse launched the list last October. Rep. Foxx is leading the efforts in Congress to legislate a political “do not call” list and last year introduced H.R. 248, the Robo Calls Off Phones (Robo COP) Act. “It is a travesty that people can sign up for the Do Not Call list for commercial calls but political calls are exempt,” said Representative Foxx. “The public can’t stand it when the Congress makes one rule for constituents and another for politicians. We must not set Congress and other elected officials apart from the way we treat business and industry. Instead of people being encouraged to get out and engage with candidates, they are being turned off from the entire process with ‘robo’ calls.” “I am so pleased that Representative Foxx has taken the “do not robo call” pledge today,” said Shaun Dakin, founder and CEO of the NPDNC. “She has taken the first decisive step in what I believe to be the crucial effort of giving voters back their peace and quiet at home, as well as their privacy. Her constituents are fortunate to have her fighting for this cause in Washington.” The NPDNC fills a void in the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) National Do Not Call (DNC) registry. Because the First Amendment protects political speech, political calls are specifically excluded from the DNC. While Americans have registered nearly 150 million phone numbers with the DNC, Georgetown University research determined that 3 out of 4 voters do not know that political calls are exempt from the DNC. This gaping loophole has become a national epidemic. In fact, The Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that 81 percent of Iowa caucus voters received automated (or “robo”) calls during November 2007. “I started the registry to give voters back their sanity during election season,” said Dakin. “Many voters consider their homes to be a sanctuary and consider calls – especially the automated ‘robo’ calls – from politicians and political groups to be invasive. It’s so invasive, in fact, that the experience alone can turn people off from the entire electoral process. If the NPDNC can significantly reduce political calls during the 2008 election, we will have delivered an important win for the American family and for our political system overall.” About Representative Virginia Foxx: Dr. Virginia Foxx was reelected to her second term to represent North Carolina’s Fifth District in the United States House of Representatives in November 2006. She is the third woman in North Carolina history to serve in the U.S. House. Dr. Foxx has established herself as a visible leader in the House of Representatives. She was also the first member of her class to introduce and pass a substantive bill in the House. Dr. Foxx serves on the House Committees on Agriculture, Government Reform, and Education and Labor. Prior to serving on Capitol Hill, Foxx spent ten years in the North Carolina Senate where she successfully sponsored several statewide and local bills and consistently voted against tax increases and for legislation that would make governments more efficient and less wasteful. About the National Political Do Not Contact Registry: The National Political Do Not Contact Registry is a program of Citizens for Civil Discourse (CCD), non-partisan, non-profit organization (federal 501(c)(3) status pending) dedicated to elevating political discussion in the United States. CCD is based on the premise that the decline of civility in American political dialogue has diminished our nation’s capacity to address urgent problems. Founder and CEO Shaun Dakin believes that citizen action is required to restore decency, respect and common sense to public debate in this country. CCD created the National Political Do Not Contact registry as a first step towards its goal by reducing unwanted political phone calls, particularly automated messages (“robo” calls), which frustrate and annoy voters regardless of party and ultimately reduce political participation. Because the U.S. Constitution protects political speech, CCD advocates addressing this issue not by enacting new legislation but by encouraging voters to take back control of the political conversation and make free speech a two-way exchange.

02.07.2008	As tax season gets into full swing, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has introduced tax reform legislation that repeals the law requiring employers to withhold federal taxes from their employees’ pay. The Federal Tax Withholding Act of 2008 (H share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen202-225-2071Bill gives taxpayers freedom to forgo tax withholding As tax season gets into full swing, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx has introduced tax reform legislation that repeals the law requiring employers to withhold federal taxes from their employees’ pay. The Federal Tax Withholding Act of 2008 (H.R. 5175) will give working Americans freedom and flexibility in paying their taxes and will also help keep the federal government accountable to informed taxpayers. “It’s been more than six decades since the federal government forced employers to withhold taxes from taxpayers’ wages,” Rep. Foxx said. “The idea may have sounded great as a short-term wartime law in the 1940’s, but today it disguises the reach of the federal government into the pocketbooks of millions of Americans. We must end this practice and let the sunlight reveal the true burden of federal taxes.”Withholding was signed into law by President Roosevelt in 1943. Ostensibly a measure to help fund WWII, tax withholding became a mechanism that today allows the federal government to take ever-larger—but incremental—slices of workers’ paychecks without workers noticing the real cost of taxation. “It amounts to government slight-of-hand,” Foxx said.By repealing compulsory tax withholding, this legislation will allow taxpayers to invest the money normally pre-paid to the federal government, thus earning a return on cash that was withheld a year in advance. Donald Boudreaux and Andrew Morriss found in 1999 that federal tax withholding has cost taxpayers more than $400 billion in lost interest earnings since its enactment in 1943. “This bill puts the power back in average Americans’ hands,” Foxx said. “The federal government is in many cases taking more than it is due and then giving taxpayers a so-called refund? Why not let taxpayers keep the money in the first place? Most importantly, as Americans realize how much their government costs they will demand more accountability and much less waste.”The 362,000-member National Taxpayers Union also endorsed Rep. Foxx’s bill: “Through withholding, taxpayers are forced to make annual interest-free loans to the government and then wait for a refund until after the next filing season. This system is detrimental to taxpayers and shouldn’t be compulsory.” (See endorsement letter.) In a tribute to how harmful tax withholding is to Americans, the publication Human Events ranked federal income tax withholding as the fourth worst offender on its list of the Ten Most Harmful Government Programs and number seven on its list of the Ten Worst Tax Laws.For more information on H.R. 5175 please visit www.foxx.house.gov or contact Rep.

Virginia Foxx voted today for an economic growth package that aims to keep the United States economy strong. This legislation is the product of bipartisan negotiations between the leaders of the House of Representatives. It is designed to boost the American economy by putting money back in the hands of middle class families and by giving businesses incentives to create new jobs. “Today we witnessed a victory for hard-working Americans as the Republican principles of tax relief and job creation became the centerpiece of this important economic package,” Rep. Foxx said. “This legislation does just what we need it to do: it puts North Carolina taxpayers’ money back into their hands without raising taxes or creating harmful new spending increases.”The legislation, the Recovery Rebates and Economic Stimulus for the American People Act of 2008 (H.R. 5140), focuses on three areas to boost economic growth: tax relief for American families, tax relief for employers and home mortgage lending rule changes. The income tax relief will range from $300-$1,200 for individual and married couples, while families with children will be eligible for an additional $300 rebate per child. Business tax provisions include tax incentives for new business investment, with a particular focus on small business growth. On the home mortgage front, the bill increases the lending power of institutions like Fannie Mae to help home-owners in distress.“While this is not a perfect bill, it is a promising and bipartisan down-payment on our future economic prosperity,” Foxx said. “We got it right by keeping all tax hikes off the table. Congress would be wise to now move to enact long-term tax relief, which is the best medicine for sustained economic growth and job creation.” H.R. 5140 passed the House on an overwhelming bipartisan vote 385-35. It now heads to the Senate for approval and additional debate. ###See also: Foxx emphasizes need for earmark reform and tax cuts.

Congressional earmarki share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen202-225-2071Highlights the need for earmark reform and tax cutsWashington, DC—U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (NC-05) made the following statement after President Bush addressed a joint session of Congress for his 2008 State of the Union speech:“The message to the American people tonight was clear. Congressional earmarking is a broken system. The president has proposed cutting the number of earmarks in half. I think we can and must do better than that. That’s why at the end of last year I decided to request no new earmarks. “Earmarks represent spending that is often airdropped into legislation in the dead of night. Until the system is fixed, I call on all of my colleagues to put a moratorium on earmark spending. “Take for example, recent reports that quote Pentagon officials saying that they have received funding for more than $20 billion worth of projects that they either didn’t ask for or didn’t need. Last year alone, there were nearly 12,000 separate earmarks totaling more than $19 billion. At a time when we are discussing how best to keep the economy strong, wasteful spending is the last thing America needs for a robust and growing economy. “The best way to keep our economy strong is to cut taxes and encourage job creation. Congress must reign in runaway spending and return more tax dollars to average Americans. I believe we can build a future where the government spends less and wastes less and tax payers are more prosperous as a result. “We must also pursue common-sense policies that make our nation safer and more secure. This evening President Bush rightly called on Congress to make the Protect America Act permanent.“This legislation modernizes the outdated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and streamlines the way the U.S. intelligence community conducts surveillance on foreign targets. If the Protect America Act is not made permanent our intelligence community will start to lose its ability to track foreign terrorists. It’s that simple. We cannot continue to run our intelligence gathering on a month-to-month basis. “I also applaud the President for calling on Congress to continue to take care of our Wounded Warriors and fulfill our duties and obligations to the families of the brave men and women of our armed forces. “My hope is that this year is marked by the promise of bipartisan success that helps all Americans. Last week, the President and House leaders from both parties agreed on the principles for an economic stimulus package. I agree with the forward-looking perspective of low taxes and earmark reform articulated by the President tonight. By working together to ensure that Americans keep more of their hard-earned money we can create the best hope for our nation’s success."###

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx nominated Cassil for the fall term of the House program and Cassil has completed the September through January semester. “John Paul is an exceptional scholar and has proven to be a committed student of Congressional procedure,” Foxx said. “His success in the page program is a testament to his passion for learning and public service.”House pages attend daily classes for high school credit. After a morning of class, pages work in the Capitol each day carrying out a variety of duties such as delivering correspondence within the congressional complex, answering phones in the House Cloakrooms, and preparing the House Floor for sessions.Cassil, a homeschooler who will graduate in 2009, hopes to return to Washington for the Senate page program in the summer. His older sister, Alisa, was also a Congressional page for the summer 2005 page session.“The experience of being a page is unlike anything else I’ve ever done,” Cassil said. “Where else can you go to school in the library of Congress, which by the way is the first building in the world to have light bulbs? Where else do you get to meet and talk with members of Congress every single day?”In addition to keeping a busy schedule as a high school student, Cassil volunteers for Water Missions International, a non-profit organization that works to bring clean water to people in developing countries and disaster areas. He hopes one day to be involved in business or real estate. He also is interested in possibly joining the Coast Guard or Air Force. Cassil is the son of John and Donna Cassil.

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx requested the funding for the Deep Creek water project, which was included in the year-end federal spending bill (H.R. 2764).“As North Carolina deals with severe drought conditions, projects like this one on the Deep Creek are of paramount importance,” Rep. Foxx said. “This project will provide more than 6 million gallons of water a day to Yadkin County and will create a vital link in the area’s flood control system.”The federal funding of $4.94 million is in addition to matching amounts from the state of North Carolina and Yadkin County. By adding 6 million gallons of capacity a day to Yadkin’s water system, the Deep Creek dam will help increase water supply to meet the area’s growing needs. The new 135 acre reservoir, which will be 4 miles west of Yadkinville, will also provide valuable flood control in an area that is otherwise prone to occasional flooding.“Thanks to Rep. Foxx’s hard work we can now get to work in earnest on this critical dam-building program,” Lenuel Chamberlain, chairman of the Yadkin Soil and Water Conservation District Board said. “With the federal funding in place, Yadkin will soon have infrastructure in the works to help provide for our water needs for the foreseeable future.”Yadkin County Chairwoman Kim Clark Phillips said, “As county representative, I am greatly appreciative of Congresswoman Foxx’s hard work and diligence in acquiring the funding for the 5D project. Yadkin County is in need of additional water supply due to the effects of the drought that Yadkin County is experiencing. I am excited as to what this project means to Yadkin County’s future.”Now that the federal share of the project is complete local officials are meeting to determine the next steps to progress with the Deep Creek project. ###

The measure (HJ Res 15) pays tribute to both the cultural and economic significance of the Christmas tree in American life.“As a former Christmas tree grower myself, I can attest to the importance of recognizing this often overlooked, yet highly significant farming industry, Rep Foxx said on the floor of the House.” “Christmas trees have held an historic place in traditional American family values since 1850. Just as importantly, Christmas trees play a vital role in the North Carolina High Country’s economy by providing jobs and livelihoods for thousands of North Carolinians.”Americans purchased $1.2 billion in real Christmas trees in 2006 and the industry employed more than 100,000 people. In North Carolina alone there are approximately 50 million Fraser fir Christmas trees grown on more than 25,000 acres by at least 1,600 different Christmas tree growers. North Carolina ranks as the number one Christmas tree producing state in the nation in terms of the retail value of the trees sold and number two in terms of the number of trees harvested. “As a former Christmas tree grower I understand the importance of a strong market for live Christmas trees,” Foxx said. “That’s why I am so proud of the growers in the Fifth District who regularly produce the finest Christmas trees in America. In recognition of this excellence, this year’s White House Christmas tree once again came from the High Country.”###

Studies show that half of homeowners who enter foreclosure never contact their lender for help. The earlier homeowners seek help the easier it is to avoid foreclosure.“If you recently received a letter from the HOPE NOW coalition, please open it immediately and call your mortgage lender,” Rep. Foxx said. “The folks at HOPE NOW want to help homeowners in distress avoid foreclosure.” Like borrowers, lenders view foreclosure as the last possible resort, after all other options have been exhausted. The earlier a homeowner contacts a lender, the more choices the lender has in coming up with alternatives to a foreclosure.Click here to listen to a message for at-risk homeowners from Rep. Virginia Foxx.About the HOPE NOW Alliance: The HOPE NOW Alliance is a group of counselors, mortgage market participants and mortgage servicers working with the Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development to create a plan to help as many homeowners affected by the recent mortgage crunch as possible. The Alliance sent letters to more than 300,000 at-risk borrowers in late-November urging them to seek help if they thought they might fall behind on their payments.

Foxx told members of Congress about legislation she introduced this Congress called the Robo Calls Off Phones (Robo COP) Act. “Instead of people being encouraged to get out and vote and engaging with candidates they are being turned off,” Rep. Foxx told the Committee. “That’s the last thing in the world that I want to have happen in this country.”Foxx’s legislation (H.R. 248) would prohibit pre-recorded or robotic political calls to individuals who do not wish to receive these calls. This bill is similar to one Foxx introduced in the 109th Congress.“It is a travesty that people can sign up for the Do Not Call registry for everything but political calls. The public hates it when the Congress and politicians make different rules for us.” Foxx said. “We must not set Congress and other elected officials apart from the way we treat business and industry.”During the campaign season, voters are often targeted with robotic political calls that advertise, campaign, and solicit donations for or against political candidates or issues. These “robo-calls” typically come in the evening and interrupt family dinners and gatherings. Rep. Foxx's bill allows anyone who does not wish to receive such calls to opt-out by registering not to receive them, just as they can for telemarketing calls. The legislation applies to unsolicited politically-oriented recorded calls where a live person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. Click Here to watch a video of Rep. Foxx’s discussing her experiences with robo-calls during the 2004 primary election.To read a news report about the hearing click here.###

Foxx said. “Unfortunately this legislation creates new regulations and higher taxes that will result in only Americans paying more for energy.”The legislation, H.R. 6, will increase taxes on energy producers to offset federal government subsidies for certain favored energy producers. It also includes new regulations that will raise the cost of electricity in many southern states. Notably, the energy bill does not include provisions to lower gas prices or to increase domestic energy production. “There is no rationale for calling this an energy bill,” Foxx said. “Instead of pushing for new domestic energy production this bill does nothing to increase our energy supply and thereby lower the burden of high energy prices on average families.”The final version of H.R. 6 was pushed through the legislative process without allowing bipartisan input. In fact, Rep. Bart Stupak, a Democratic member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, yesterday said that “given the restrictive process used to develop this legislation, we reserve the right to vote against any Rule that would allow for floor consideration of this legislation…”H.R. 6 passed the House by a vote of 235-181. The legislation now goes to the Senate for final consideration.###

The amendment to the College Opportunity and Affordability Act (H.R. 4137) aims to protect the privacy rights of college students by keeping their personal and private information out of a massive federal database.“College students should not be forced to participate in a huge national database that catalogues their personal information and increases the risk of identity theft,” Rep Foxx said. “It would be a terrible mistake to address the cost of education, but ask students to forfeit their privacy in the process. This amendment adds vital privacy protections to a bill that is focused on the rising cost of college education.”Rep. Foxx’s amendment will prohibit the Secretary of Education from creating a national database of personal information from students that receive federal aid under the higher education bill. The House Education and Labor Committee voted unanimously today to approve HR 4137. The legislation addresses the rising cost of college and the obstacles that make it difficult for some qualified students to attend college.Click here for additional details and a transcript of Rep.

Foxx co-sponsors measure in opposition to granting licenses to illegal aliensCongresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) co-sponsored a Congressional resolution this week that calls on states not to issue driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. The issue of granting licenses to illegal immigrants arose recently when New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer proposed a plan to give driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants in the state of New York. “The idea of giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants is the worst kind of idea,” Rep. Foxx said. “Such a policy would severely damage our national security, undermine the rule of law and open the door to wide-spread voter fraud.” In many states individuals applying for a driver’s license are given the opportunity to automatically register to vote. These “motor voter” programs could be exploited to allow illegal immigrants to register to vote. In fact, The Wall Street Journal recently noted that eight of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were registered to vote, thanks to loopholes in some state laws that allow illegal aliens to get driver’s licenses.“A driver’s license is a gateway to many privileges in America, including the right of every citizen to vote,” Foxx said. “If we hand out licenses to every illegal alien who comes knocking then we put the democratic process at risk and water down the meaning of every valid vote cast.”The resolution (H. Res 800) currently has more than 50 bipartisan co-sponsors. H. Res 800 holds that states that provide official government-issued identification to individuals who are in the United States illegally are encouraging disrespect and disregard for federal immigration laws. ###

She will read the names of service members as part of a four day event in which all of the more than 58,000 names inscribed on the wall will be read aloud. “The brave soldiers who lost their lives in this war deserve the highest honor,” Rep.

PFC Lambert, 20, was killed in combat in Quang Nam providence. “It is a true honor to read the names of PFC Lambert and others who lost their lives in the Vietnam War,” Foxx said. “The names on this wall are a memorial to the soldiers who paid the ultimate price and we must never forget their sacrifices.”More than 2,000 volunteers will participate in the Reading of the Names at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. The 58,256 names will be read over the course of four days, starting today at 3 p.m. This is only the fourth time in The Wall’s 25-year history that all of the names have been read in Washington, D.C., according to the Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial Fund. ###

Foxx opposes language in HR 3685 that undermines Americans’ religious rights Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted to protect religious liberty and the states’ rights to define, protect, and preserve the institution of marriage. In voting against HR 3685, Rep. Foxx opposed language in the bill that would infringe on Americans’ First Amendment rights and that would force employers with moral beliefs on homosexuality to disavow their beliefs. “HR 3685 is a bill that undermines our nation’s religious freedom and does not offer adequate protections to business and organizations with religious convictions,” Rep. Foxx said. “In effect, this bill attempts to create a new protected class while at the same penalizing Americans for their decision to practice their religion.” HR 3685 contains vague, undefined “protections” that will open the door to costly litigation. The bill seeks to prohibit discrimination on the basis of “perceived” sexual orientation, yet the term is not defined in the bill. Employers will be held liable for their perception of an employee, with virtually no way to disprove the allegations of what they did or did not perceive.The term “perceived” is not contained in existing civil rights law, which protects against discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex or national origin. The addition of this language is a departure from the nation’s existing laws. “Discrimination is a real issue in our society, but watering down the concept of protection against discrimination to include ‘perceived’ sexual orientation is a serious mistake that will only lead to rampant, costly litigation,” Foxx said. “It looks like trial lawyers will benefit most from this legislation—all at the cost of the religious freedoms of millions of Americans and many religious educational institutions.”The bill’s exemption of religious organizations fails to include all religious educational institutions and as a result fails to shield them from the bill’s infringement on religious beliefs. By doing so it fails to provide religious organizations the hiring protections to which they are entitled under the Civil Rights Act.###
10.26.2007	After congressional Democrats yesterday introduced a tax bill that ranks as the largest individual tax increase in history, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) said the bill would harm small businesses and economic growth. Already known share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071Democrats introduce $1 trillion tax bill that will slow economy and job-growth After congressional Democrats yesterday introduced a tax bill that ranks as the largest individual tax increase in history, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) said the bill would harm small businesses and economic growth. Already known as the “Mother of all Tax Hikes,” the legislation introduced by Rep. Charles Rangel would raises taxes by more than $1 trillion. “Just when we thought we might make it to 2008 without another Democratic tax increase, the Democrats have proven—once and for all—that they are the tax and spend party,” Rep. Foxx said. “We saw this tax hike coming, but never imagined it would be this huge.”Rep. Rangel’s tax increase bill assumes the expiration of current tax cuts and increases the top tax rate to more than 44 percent. With this increase the United States will have a much higher top tax rate than most developed nations. In fact, the average top tax rate among developed nations is 35.7 percent. “America has long been a leader of the free world,” Rep. Foxx said. “But the high tax leader of the free world? In a competitive, global economy we can’t afford that kind of designation. Massive, punitive tax increases like this are an economic slap in the face to the small businesses and the people of America.”Democrats plan to bring back the marriage penalty under the new tax legislation, penalizing many married couples by taxing them at a higher tax rate than if they filed their taxes as singles. The legislation also includes provisions that reduce the value of deductions and hands out close to $40 billion in so-called “tax cuts” to people who do not pay income taxes. ###

She voted in favor of the Free Flow of Information Act (H.R. 2102), a bill that will shield reporters from being subpoenaed or jailed over confidential sources. The so-called media shield legislation passed the House by a vote of 398-21. “A free press is a vital component of our nation’s foundational liberties,” Rep. Foxx said. “By ensuring that reporters are not compelled by the government to reveal the identity of confidential sources this legislation protects the free flow of information—a fundamental component of a free and informed electorate.”The Free Flow of Information Act protects journalists from court subpoenas that would compel them to compromise otherwise confidential sources. The legislation includes provisions that limit this privilege in cases that could prevent acts of terrorism or that involve threats to national security.“This bill strikes the right balance between protecting reporters and protecting our national security,” Foxx said. “Media confidentiality privileges shield reporters from government harassment, but these privileges should be tempered by a concern for our national security.”The Free Flow of Information Act is the first federal media shield bill to actually pass the House of Representatives. Approximately 100 media shield bills have been introduced in Congress over the past three decades. ###
10.16.2007	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today voted to extend the ban on Internet taxation for another four years.

Her vote in favor of the Internet Tax Freedom Act Amendments Act of 2007 (H.R. 3678) ensures that Americans are not subject to burdensome, new taxes on Internet access. The current Internet tax moratorium was set to expire in two weeks, on November 1, 2007. “Any business or individual will tell you that the Internet is our most important resource for communicating, gathering information or doing business in today’s economy,” Rep. Foxx said. “Taxing this resource would surely damage our ability to compete and this bill extends the ban on harmful Internet taxes for four years. It’s a good first step, but the American people want a permanent ban.” H.R. 3678, which will extend the ban on Internet access taxes for four years, is yet another temporary ban on Internet taxes. More than 235 members of Congress are currently sponsoring a complete, permanent ban on Internet taxation. Despite broad bipartisan support for a permanent ban, House Democratic leadership refused to entertain a permanent ban and voted 20-15 against such a ban in the House Judiciary Committee. “My concern is that if a four-year ban makes sense,” Foxx said, “why not pass a permanent ban? Putting Internet taxes to rest once and for all is good public policy for every North Carolina consumer and business.”Rep. Foxx is also a cosponsor of the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would permanently extend the moratorium on Internet access taxes and duplicative taxes on e-commerce. Foxx was also a leader against the tax when she served in the North Carolina Senate. Congress first instituted a temporary Internet tax moratorium in 1998 to encourage the growth of online commerce.###

The decision came after the Architect of the Capitol last share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071Under pressure, Architect of the Capitol reverses decision to strike references to God Congresswoman Virginia Foxx today praised a decision allowing Members of Congress to use references to God on messages to constituents that accompany flags flown over the Capitol. The decision came after the Architect of the Capitol last week attempted to ban all references to God on the certificates sent by Representatives to constituents who requested flags to be flown over the Capitol. “The attempt to remove any use of God from these certificates was an outrage and the move to reverse this terrible decision is the right one,” Rep. Foxx said. “Communication between Congress and constituents should never be party to government censorship, especially when the censorship targets references to God.” The flag certificate controversy erupted when Rep. Michael Turner (R-Ohio) submitted a certificate for a 17-year-old Eagle Scout who planned to give it to his grandfather. It read, “This flag was flown in honor of Marcel Larochelle, my grandfather, for his dedication and love of God, Country, and family.” The Architect of the Capitol refused to approve the certificate with the reference to God included. “An Eagle Scout who wants to honor his grandfather for dedication to God, country and family should be celebrated, not given a gag order by a government employee,” Foxx said. “Average Americans are tired of attempts by politicians and bureaucrats to strike references to God from the public square. This decision is finally a sign that enough is enough.”Rep. Foxx is a co-sponsor of the Andrew Larochelle God, Family, and Country Act of 2007 (H.R.3779). The aim of this bill is to reverse the Architect of the Capitol’s policy prohibiting the inclusion of religious references on the flag certificates for flags flown over the U.S. Capitol.The new policy for certificates that accompany flags flown over the Capitol will allow for freedom of expression. The policy will now allow Representatives to include personal messages of up to 300 characters. ###

Foxx is an original co-sponsor of H Res 680, which condemns the actions of those who splashed an oily substance over much of the Wall in September.“The veterans who gave their lives in Vietnam deserve the utmost respect,” Rep. Foxx said. “Purposely defacing a memorial that honors the sacrifice of these veterans is the epitome of despicable, and I hope those responsible are brought to justice.” Police were first made aware of the vandalism on September 7. Park Service officials have indicated that they should eventually be able to repair the damage done to the wall. “Our nation’s veterans represent what makes this country great,” Foxx said. “They gave of themselves, fighting to preserve freedom at great personal cost. The very least we can do is preserve their legacy and not allow senseless acts of vandalism to in any way detract from their examples of sacrifice.” The Vietnam Memorial Wall celebrates its 25th anniversary in November. The granite Wall is inscribed with more than 58,000 names of those killed or missing in the Vietnam War. Since it was completed in 1982, approximately 80 million people have visited the Wall to pay respect to those who lost their lives in the Vietnam War.

Harry Yates, who has been growing Christmas trees in Watauga County for more than 30 years, will testify about the importance of streamlining burdensome migrant labor regulations. “Today’s farmers looking for laborers are forced to jump through too many regulatory hoops,” Yates said. “Farmers need a reliable, legal workforce, but federal regulations make getting the workers we need an almost full-time job.”Yates will testify before the full Committee about the impact of current work visa rules and regulations. He plans to share how his experience as a successful Christmas tree farmer has underscored the need for reform to the nation’s agriculture worker programs. “Reliable labor is a critical issue for North Carolina’s farmers,” Rep. Foxx said. “Without a steady workforce our farmers face the troubling reality of unpicked crops and heavy losses. I’m glad that Harry was willing to share his insight and years of experience with the Agriculture Committee. It is refreshing to hear from someone like Harry who has solid commonsense.”Foxx, who serves on the House Agriculture Committee, has been a proponent of reforming and simplifying the federal government’s complicated H2A visa program. Harry Yates will be one of six growers from around the country on a panel of farmers at Thursday’s 11 a.m. hearing. He will join producers of produce, dairy, citrus, cattle and other crops.To watch the Committee proceedings please go to the committee’s website at http://agriculture.house.gov/hearings/audio.html. ###

As a co-sponsor of the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (HR 743), Foxx joins a bipartisan group of members of Congress in support of legislation that will ensure Americans are not forced to pay new taxes on Internet access.“When we prevent new taxes on the people of the Fifth District, we encourage economic growth by leaving more of taxpayers’ hard-earned money in their pockets,” Foxx said. “Any Internet tax is an obstacle to doing business in an Internet-dependant economy. By banning Web access taxes, we can help spur the growth of small businesses and jobs that depend on the Internet for increased productivity and competitiveness.” The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act would permanently extend the moratorium on Internet access taxes and duplicative taxes on e-commerce. Foxx was also a leader against the tax when she served in the North Carolina Senate. Congress first instituted a temporary Internet tax moratorium in 1998 to encourage growth of online commerce. In 2004, Congress extended the moratorium for an additional three years, which is scheduled to expire on Nov. 1, 2007. “Congress acted to ban harmful Internet taxation before; now it’s time to make good on that down-payment and permanently extend this ban,” Foxx said. “This ban is good for families, schools and businesses. Everybody wins if we keep the government’s hands off Americans’ access to the Internet.”HR 743 would apply to a variety of Internet access services, including cable, DSL and wireless Internet access. The bill would forever prohibit three types of Internet taxes: taxes on Internet access, the double taxation (for example, by two or more states) of a product or service bought over the Internet, and discriminatory taxes that treat Internet purchases differently from other types of sales.###

It puts patients in the driver’s seat by giving average consumers access to clinical trial information and placing important restrictions on false or misleading pharmaceutical advertising.”The bill, which passed with broad bi-partisan support, gives the FDA new enforcement powers such as the ability to force drug companies to change labels on prescription drugs and fine non-compliant companies. It also creates a public, searchable database of clinical drug trials that will include important information on the safety risks of specific drugs. “This legislation makes the millions of North Carolinians who depend on safe and effective prescription drugs a priority,” Foxx said. “By empowering the FDA to take an even closer look at new drug applications we are taking important steps to keep risky drugs off the market.”HR 3580 seeks to protect consumers from potentially harmful side-effects of new prescription drugs and ensure that consumers are not misled by prescription drug advertising. The bill passed the House 405-7 and now moves to the Senate for consideration.###

I know that the people of this country will see right through this ridiculous attack and further isolate this fringe group.“My Democrat colleagues should denounce this shameless political stunt and align themselves with our troops who every day make great sacrifices for their nation. It’s time for them to step back from far-left political operatives who are out of touch with regular Americans. “Our troops and General Petraeus deserve better.”###

Calling the win "one of the greatest upsets in college football history," Foxx highlighted ASU's amazing start to the 2007 season and honored the ASU players and coaches. Full text of Rep. Foxx's speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives: Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute the Appalachian State University Mountaineer football team on their upset of fifth-ranked Michigan this weekend in their season opener. This win was one of the greatest upsets in college football history. Before last Saturday's win, no Division I-AA team had beaten a team ranked in the AP poll from 1989 to 2006. The Mountaineers' win was no ordinary upset. It was a down-to-the-wire game for the history books. The game hinged on the heroic field goal blocked by Corey Lynch with 6 seconds left that secured ASU's 34-32 victory over one of the most storied college football programs in America. With this upset, it looks like Coach Jerry Moore is poised to lead the Mountaineers to their third straight national championship. By beating Michigan, ASU extends their winning streak to 15 games, the longest among Division I teams. But this victory is about more than winning streaks or statistics. This is about the achievements of a hardworking championship team from a small town in rural North Carolina proving that tenacity counts. ###

The project will extend the local water infrastructure to the interchanges of Interstates 77 and 74. This funding was included in the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2643). “This federal funding will jump start a valuable project that will help form the foundation for future growth and economic activity in Surry County,” Foxx said. “As the Surry County economy continues to evolve and respond to recent job losses, this funding will be crucial for the county’s next stage of growth.”Surry County plans to bring water and sewer infrastructure to the Interstates Water and Sewer District where I-77 and I-74 intersect west of the city of Mount Airy. The current lack of sewer and water significantly limits development and growth in the area, according to county studies. “Surry County is extremely pleased to receive this funding and we are very grateful to Congresswoman Foxx for assistance in securing these funds,” said Jack Gardin, Surry County’s Water and Sewer Project Manager. “This project comes in response to increasing demand for water and sewer in the Interstate District. It will be the backbone of new development that we expect will attract many visitors to all of Surry County.” “These funds will go a long way towards creating an area which will serve as a gateway to Surry County for visitors and tourists—we like to think of it as the ‘front porch’ of Surry,” Gardin said.The House passed H.R. 2643 by a vote of 272 to 155 and the bill is now before the Senate for consideration.###

The Wake Forest medical research program is based in Winston Salem. The funding was included in the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2008 (H.R. 2641) and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of2008 (H.R. 3222). “These funds will support the life-changing research being done right now at Wake Forest,” Foxx said. “The experts at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine are engaged in pioneering tissue research that may soon provide an alternative to organ transplantation that will change the face of modern medicine.”The Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine does groundbreaking research into the use of autologous tissues as an alternative to transplantation or reconstructive surgery. Autologous tissues are derived from the patient’s own cells and are capable of correcting numerous medical problems. The first human application of cell-based tissue engineering was conducted by Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine researchers.“We are very excited to receive this funding and are extremely grateful to Congresswoman Foxx for her invaluable help throughout the process,” said Dr. Anthony Atala, Director of Wake Forest University’s Institute for Regenerative Medicine. “This funding will allow us to move forward and develop energy efficient processes to create engineered tissues and organs,” Dr. Atala said. “This is truly groundbreaking research, and will have a major positive impact on our healthcare system for the millions of Americans with conditions that require transplantation.”Wake Forest University Health Sciences has invested more than $60 million in the Institute for Regenerative Medicine and the National Regenerative Medicine Center. Over 80 researchers at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine are currently working to apply regenerative medicine techniques to build new organs and tissues such as kidneys, blood vessels, hearts, livers, pancreases, muscles, and nerves. “Wake Forest is on the cutting edge of regenerative medicine,” Foxx said, “and I am pleased that this funding will support their continued research and allow them to upgrade their facilities to take advantage of new technology.” The House passed H.R. 2641 by a vote of 312 to 112 and H.R. 3222 by a vote of 395 to 13.

The Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Michael McConnell, informed Congress on multiple occasions that FISA needed to be updated in order to close a terrorist surveillance loophole which kept the U.S. from effectively gathering intelligence.“We finally have a sensible bill that gives the government the authority to track the communications of dangerous terrorist elements,” Foxx said. “It’s high time we updated the FISA laws so that our intelligence community can respond to constantly changing foreign terrorist information.”The strained and outdated Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has prevented the intelligence community from acting with speed and agility to conduct necessary surveillance of foreign targets. Due to the outdated law, the National Security Agency (NSA) has been unable to monitor foreign terrorist communications that pass through communications infrastructure in the U.S.—even though these communications involve only foreign calls or e-mails.In an August 2 letter to Speaker Pelosi co-signed by Foxx and 189 Members of Congress she joined her colleagues in saying: “The Congressional Intelligence Committees and the House leadership have known about this problem since April of this year and yet, we are now approaching the August recess and still no action has been taken to fix the problem. Madam Speaker, our intelligence analysts are not able to connect the dots to keep us safe if they cannot collect the dots in the first place. This situation is unacceptable and places the American people at risk.”This legislation puts fixes in place that allow the U.S. to monitor foreign-to-foreign communications without a court order, even if those communications are routed through the United States. It will help clear what Admiral McConnell called a “huge backlog” of foreign intelligence that threatens U.S. security.###
08.03.2007	On Thursday, August 3 the House of Representatives suffered a crisis of confidence as the leadership of the Democrat party undermined a final vote on a measure that would have barred illegal immigrants from receiving government benefits. share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071On Thursday, August 3 the House of Representatives suffered a crisis of confidence as the leadership of the Democrat party undermined a final vote on a measure that would have barred illegal immigrants from receiving government benefits. An agriculture spending bill was up for debate and Republicans had introduced a measure to keep the federal government from granting benefits to illegal immigrants. Democrats invalidated the final vote when it became clear that it would not go the way that party leadership wished. As the news organization Congressional Quarterly reports, “[t]he House erupted into chaos late Thursday night when Democrats ruled that a roll call had failed even though, when the gavel fell, 215 members had voted for a Republican motion and 213 had voted against it.” At that point, Democrat leadership allowed vote changes so that the measure could be defeated. In protest, Republicans asked for a vote to adjourn and were promptly ruled out of order. Most Republicans left the floor in protest when it became evident that the Democrat majority was breaking the rules and no longer wished for the minority votes to count.Most Republicans refused to participate in the final vote as it was clear that the precedent of not changing a House vote after it had been declared final was shattered.Rep. Virginia Foxx issued the following statement in response to these events:“This is an unprecedented and serious moment in the life of our government,” Rep. Foxx said. “Never before has a final vote been utterly disregarded by the majority party. Members of Congress expect that the votes they cast in representation of their constituents will matter.“Last night that long-held, democratic assumption was violated by the Democrats in the House. This is completely shameful. There are no other words to express what happened last night. “This country is a beacon of hope because we operate under the rule of law. When the people running the very institution responsible for passing those laws disregard its rules, they are sowing the seeds of decline for our country.“Not only is this a crisis in process, it reveals that Democrats want to take money from hardworking American and the elderly and give it to illegal immigrants. “Leader Pelosi promised a Congress that was more open and more honest than ever before. But after last night the American people have real reason to question whether this majority is committed to their professed ideals. “The matter before us is extremely somber and serious. I hope that Speaker Pelosi will understand the gravity of this matter and take steps to remedy this crisis. We need to make sure this never happens again. Our democracy is too important for partisan politics to upend hundreds of years of democratic process.” ###

Beiter, a history, civics and economics teacher at Davie County High School, is the first Fifth District teacher to complete the two week internship tailored for high school teachers. “These two weeks offered Daric many opportunities to learn about the inner workings of Capitol Hill,” Foxx said. “I’m excited to see how this experience informs the way he teaches students about the legislative process.” Beiter spent the two week internship learning about Congress in a variety of contexts. He took a Library of Congress class on legislative research and also attended special meetings with officials from the House historian’s and the Senate historian’s office. Beiter attended committee meetings with Rep. Foxx and her staff, including an information session with staff from the House Education and Labor Committee. The internship also included research at the National Archives, meetings with Senate staff and visits to Washington, DC museums and memorials. As the first person to participate in the Teacher in Congress internship, Beiter’s learning experience will help to shape the Teacher in Congress internship for future educators from the Fifth District of North Carolina. “My experiences over the past week have changed the way I think about government,” Beiter said. “Being in Washington and capitalizing on this internship’s many opportunities has shed a tremendous amount of light on the day to day operations of the legislative branch.”With the 2007-2008 school year underway, teachers interested in applying for and participating in next year’s Teacher in Congress internship can contact Congresswoman Foxx’s office at (202) 225-2071. The application period begins in winter 2008. ###

The bill includes provisions on the disclosure requirements for lobbying activities and earmarks. “Making Congress more open and stripping away anything that smacks of secrecy is one of my top priorities,” Foxx said. “This bill claims to be about openness but it could have done much more to make this body focus on the American people and not on back room deal-making.” This bill is the third attempt by the majority to push lobbying reform through Congress after previous attempts stalled. It contains less earmark transparency than a Republican bill that passed last year. That bill applied reforms to all earmarks, while under the current rules it is impossible to challenge some types of earmarks—meaning billions in taxpayer-funded earmarks can be passed without sufficient scrutiny and debate. “We can do better than this,” Foxx said. “Last year we proved that we can make the entire process open—why not continue the trend this year?”The lobbying and ethics legislation also addresses the so-called “revolving door” on Capitol Hill whereby members of Congress move from elected office to high-paid lobbyist. But the bill fails to put equal restrictions on Representatives and Senators. As a result, House members will be governed by a weaker revolving-door prohibition than senators, and will be permitted to lobby their colleagues a year after leaving Congress, as opposed to the stricter two-year rule for the Senate.“The way this bill has been methodically weakened over time is disappointing,” Foxx said. “Americans deserve more, and I hope that we can deliver real substance next time around.”###

Virginia Foxx today voted for the final version of a bill (H.R. 1) that will enact several recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The bill contains provisions that allow for the screening of seaborne cargo as well as strong protections for individuals who report suspicious activity to authorities. “This legislation grants crucial protection to average Americans who are on the lookout for activity that looks suspiciously like terrorist activity,” Foxx said. “While this bill is far from perfect, it builds on previous Republican legislation that acted on 39 of the 9/11 Commission’s 41 recommendations to protect Americans.”The issue of protecting tipsters arose after a number of “John Doe” defendants were recently sued for reporting the suspicious behavior of fellow passengers on a flight last November. These protections were included in the bill at the urging of Republicans in both the House and Senate. In addition to measures to protect terror tipsters, this bill will improve homeland security information sharing among branches of the government. Though unrelated to the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, a provision granting collective bargaining rights to the Transportation Security Administration’s 56,000 baggage screeners was initially part of this bill. “Thanks to the efforts of Republicans, a Big Labor payback that would have hindered the government’s ability to protect travelers and respond to national security threats was removed from the original bill,” Foxx said. “This provision would have allowed Big Labor’s union contract negotiating to pull vital security personnel off the job, undermining our homeland security. Thankfully, this harmful provision did not survive the negotiating process.”The 9/11 Commission legislation passed the House on a vote of 371-40.###

The fund share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen202.225.2071 Foxx Shepherds Funding Through House to Improve Airport’s Infrastructure Representatives Virginia Foxx and Patrick McHenry yesterday secured $1 million in federal funding for the Statesville Regional Airport, which is included in the Fiscal Year 2008 U.S. Department of Transportation Appropriations bill. The funding will be used to expand and improve the airport by bolstering the runway, ramp area, and taxiways as well as provide for land acquisition. “I am delighted that Congressman McHenry and I were able to work together to secure these vital funds,” said Congresswoman Foxx. “Helping the Statesville Airport move forward will encourage economic development by bringing new jobs to Iredell County and adding to the tax base.” “One million dollars goes a long way in strengthening the Statesville Regional Airport’s infrastructure, which will provide for greater regional travel and commerce,” said Congressman McHenry. “It is always a great experience working with Congresswoman Foxx – and especially now because Statesville will see the results of our concerted effort.” The runway, ramp area, and taxiways will be strengthened to accommodate the rapidly growing corporate aviation clientele base in and around Statesville. Additional land will be purchased to construct south taxiways and provide hangar space for corporate and general aviation aircraft. The funding will also be used to cover land costs associated with the planned runway extension. The project is strongly supported by the Federal Aviation Administration and the North Carolina Department of Transportation’s Division of Aviation. “As Mayor of Statesville, I want to thank Congressman McHenry and Congresswoman Foxx for their continued support of the Statesville Regional Airport,” said Mayor Constantine Kutteh of Statesville “It continues to be a great source of economic development and a catalyst for additional growth for the community and surrounding area. We continue to have big hopes and dreams for our regional airport, and with their continued assistance, we hope to accomplish all of them.” ###

The agreement, which will be included in a bill that implements recommendations of the 9/11 Commission (H.R. 1), will provide legal protection for Americans who report suspicious-looking activities to authorities. “Average Americans are one of our best defenses against terrorism,” Rep. Foxx said. “No one should be afraid of reporting something that looks suspicious simply because he or she does not want to be sued.”The issue of protecting tipsters arose after a number of “John Doe” defendants were recently sued for reporting the suspicious behavior of fellow passengers on a flight last November. The passengers, a group of Muslim Imams, were removed from the flight.“Protecting the people who are doing their civic duty to report suspicious activity to the authorities is just plain common sense,” Foxx said. “Unfortunately, not everyone in Washington thought so and my Republican colleagues had to fight to convince many Democrats of the need to protect terror tipsters.”These sorts of protections have overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. On March 27, in a 304-122 vote, the House approved a Republican amendment to protect citizens from liability for reporting suspicious activity. Republicans unanimously voted for the amendment, with 199 “yes” votes. One hundred five Democrats voted “yes,” with 122 Democrats voting “no.”###

The deficit has been cut in half in just the last three years, and is at its lowest point in five years thanks to strong economic expansion and higher than expected tax revenue.“This report is great news for every North Carolina citizen,” Foxx said. “It means that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are working by encouraging economic growth and keeping more money in North Carolina taxpayers’ pockets.”As a fraction of the economy, the deficit is at its lowest level since 2002, right after the economic slump caused by the 9/11 attacks. At $205 billion, it is also much lower than the $244 billion deficit predicted by the government in February. “Pro-growth Republican policies have helped keep our economy strong, resulting in increased tax revenue even though taxes have remained low,” Rep. Foxx said. “This is the great paradox of tax cuts. They protect the family checkbook, and create the healthy economy that produces higher tax collections. “Eliminating the budget deficit is our responsibility to the American people and to future generations. Any Democratic attempt to tax-and-spend our way to a balanced budget will not achieve balance but will instead endanger our recent economic progress and take larger bites out of the family budget.”The past five years have been characterized by uninterrupted economic growth, with 8.2 million new jobs created since August 2003. Unemployment remains low at 4.5 percent. In the last six-and-a-half years, Republican passed tax relief has returned $2 trillion to taxpayers and fueled our economic growth and record of job creation. ###

Foxx introduced the bill in January shortly after the ASU Mountaineers (H. Res. 210) record-breaking victory over Massachusetts in the NCAA Division I-AA national championship game “Two national championships in as many years is reason to celebrate,” said Foxx, who managed the debate of the bill on the floor today. “I’m pulling for a third championship in 2007 and a third reason to honor these fine players and coaches on the floor of the House of Representatives.” The ASU Mountaineers finished the season 14-1 on the strength of a 14 game winning streak culminating in their national championship victory. In her remarks on the floor of the House, Foxx noted the Mountaineers winning streak is currently the best in the NCAA Division I.“I am so proud to represent Appalachian State University in Congress and to once again recognize their accomplishments on and off the playing field,” Rep. Foxx said. “Their repeat national championship performance this past season is a clear instance of the value of hard work and integrity.“I applaud the players and coaches who are receiving their due recognition for another fantastic season. I especially want to compliment Coach Moore for his open expression of his faith. He and his assistant coaches are excellent role models for the players and students that they lead.”Rep. Foxx’s bill, House Resolution 210 Congratulating Appalachian State University football team for winning the 2006 NCAA Division I-AA Championship passed the House on a unanimous vote.###

Congresswoman Virginia Foxx issued the following statement: “This defeat for the immigration bill signals that the American people have made it clear that under no circumstances do they support legislation offering amnesty to illegal aliens. The Senate finally heard the American people’s voices and voted to put the procedural brakes on an ill-conceived piece of immigration legislation.“Instead of wholesale amnesty, the issue of illegal immigration demands a careful, law-respecting solution. I have heard from hundreds of constituents who have expressed strong opposition to any legislation that undermines the rule of law by granting amnesty to illegal aliens. “This bill did not pass the test for fairness and justice and failed to respect the millions of people who worked within the system and emigrated legally. I will continue to oppose any legislation that short-circuits our longstanding tradition of the rule of a law. “The immigration debate is about more than the statistics and figures. It is about the future of America. It is about our future respect for the rule of law. Our nation is built upon this strong tradition. Immigration reform that dishonors the rule of law is short-sighted and will ultimately fail.”###

Her amendment simply keeps funding at FY 2007 levels, instead of enacting the major increases proposed in the underlying spending bill.In her remarks on the House floor during debate on her amendment Foxx said: “Given the tremendous amount of funding contained in the bill for the United Nations, I am particularly interested in encouraging that body to reexamine its spending habits so it can be more effective at fulfilling its mission. As most would agree, the purpose of the United Nations is to help promote peace and security throughout the world. “However, it has obviously failed miserably in that respect. Iran’s nuclear weapons program is still chugging along at a rapid pace, threatening Israel and the entire region. Genocide persists in Sudan. All of the minds at the United Nations cannot even agree on a definition for the word “terrorism” in an age where terrorism remains one of the biggest threats to humanity and civilization.“[T]he part of my amendment that should draw support from both sides of the aisle is the fact that my amendment does not cut a single dollar from U.S. spending on international organizations. My amendment simply maintains the Fiscal Year 2007 level. By holding the line on spending, Congress can have another year to work on balancing the books and finding other ways to fund the increased spending proposals contained in the underlying bill.“Mr. Chairman, at a time when Americans are being asked to do more with their budgets, it is only reasonable to expect the same out of those who benefit from generous American donations. That is why it should be clear to all of my colleagues why they should support my amendment.” ###

The Mexico City Policy, first enacted by President Reagan in 1984, ensures that organizations doing international population assistance work that promote abortion as a family planning method do not receive U.S. funding. “This is a critical policy that underscores the sanctity of human life by telling groups that if they want to promote abortion, they had better find a source of funding other than the U.S. taxpayer,” Foxx said during a debate in the House of Representatives. “It’s quite simple. If a group demonstrates a disregard for human life, they don’t get any funding.” The current wording of the foreign operations spending bill allows funds to flow to groups that promote abortion. Foxx voted to support the “Smith/Stupak amendment” to the bill which would eliminate the bill language that allows funding to go to groups that promote abortion. “Let me be clear,” Foxx said. “The Mexico City Policy and this amendment do not reduce funding for family planning programs. The focus is instead on channeling funds to organizations that remain neutral on the abortion issue. There is, therefore, no overall reduction in family planning funds.”This amendment reinstates the Mexico City Policy which would improve the credibility of international family planning programs by ensuring that they are entirely separated from abortion activities. It does not reduce funding for international family planning efforts.###

The bill would have forced American taxpayers to fund unproven, ethically questionable embryonic stem cell research requiring the destruction of human life.“Today’s veto is an important victory for the sanctity of human life,” Rep. Foxx said. “Unfortunately, the Democrats' decision to pass this bill illustrates their willful disregard for viable alternatives to embryonic stem cells. “By issuing a veto, the president has communicated that he will not stand for legislation that tramples on human life. I promise to vote to uphold this veto and to fight to preserve the sanctity of life. “I also support today’s executive order from the president supporting research into pluripotent stem cells – an emerging arena that holds the promise of advancing research into life-saving cures for debilitating diseases.”

The powerful Appropriations Committee will be inserting the spending requests—or earmarks—after the bills pass the House, effectively cutting off debate on potentially wasteful or controversial items.“Instead of the transparency and accountability they promised, the Democrats’ spending bills will essentially include a slush fund for billions of dollars in earmarks hidden from public scrutiny, said Foxx. “I honestly can’t believe it. These taxpayer-backed slush funds will fund earmarks without actually putting them into the bills before the House votes.”“American’s don’t want more secrecy, they want less. As the Baltimore Sun wrote yesterday, the Democrats’ new rules have ‘made the process exponentially worse,’” Foxx said. “We must restore accountability to the process lest the path to corruption is paved smooth by Congress’ neglect.”The new procedures make it impossible for Representatives to challenge individual earmarks so long as the legislation merely contains a list of such earmarks. This is a change from the Republican-enacted rules which allowed House members to challenge individual taxpayer-funded earmarks before a bill passed the House of Representatives.“Shining the light of public scrutiny into Congressional spending will improve accountability and fiscal responsibility,” Rep Foxx said. “But the majority has done the opposite, and I am appalled by their attempts to shroud the process in secrecy and drop earmarks into bills via a last minute slush fund.” ###

The State Department recently decided to allow travelers to show proof of a pending passport application for those who have been affected by the massive delays in new passport processing. Last week Foxx sent a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, urging immediate action to alleviate the problems faced by millions of Americans awaiting approval of their applications. “On a daily basis, our offices are inundated by concerns from frustrated constituents who cannot get their applications processed in time for their travel plans,” Rep. Foxx said in the letter to Secretary Rice. “These delays are unnecessary and burdensome, leaving some without the proper documentation for international travel.”Congresswoman Foxx’s office receives between 25 and 35 requests for assistance on passport matters each day. The temporary changes to the international travel requirements will allow constituents who have not received their passport due to delays in application processing to follow through with any plans they have for international travel. “By creating temporary rules the State Department has taken a vital first step in solving the problem of huge delays in passport applications,” Foxx said. “I urge Secretary Rice to deal with the systemic passport processing problem and implement long-term solutions that will help us avoid a similar crisis in the future.” ###

Her vote came in opposition to the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act (S. 5) which would grant federal money to expand the number of stem cell lines for research that uses human embryos. “We should not be giving taxpayer dollars to support a practice that is unethical, devalues human life and is opposed by tens of millions of Americans,” Rep. Foxx said. “I support stem cell research that does not take human life, and since embryonic stem cell destroys human embryos I cannot support it.”Embryonic stem cell research is currently legal and receives federal taxpayer funding. Under current guidelines, the NIH spends roughly $600 million per year on stem cell research, including $40 million for research involving human embryonic stem cells and nearly $100 million for non-human embryonic stem cell research. “Taxpayers are already paying their fair share for research that many find to be morally repugnant,” Foxx said. “Considering the very promising breakthroughs in stem cell research that do not require the destruction of human embryos, I think we should pursue other avenues for federal funding of stem cell research.” Advances in medical science as recent as this week are providing ways to do stem cell research without destroying human embryos. Today the New York Times reported a major breakthrough that could change patients’ skin cells into stem cells. The Times writes that the “surprising advance that could sidestep the ethical debates surrounding stem cell biology.”Under the current federal policy on human embryonic stem cell research, only stem cell lines derived before August 9, 2001, are eligible for federally funded research. This bill lifts that restriction. Stem cell lines would be eligible for federally funded research regardless of the date on which they were derived. The bill passed the House of Representatives and now faces a potential presidential veto. ###

Rep. Foxx racked up a 93 percent score in the last session of Congress and has an 86 percent ranking during her Congressional tenure. “Rep. Foxx proved to be a valuable ally to the business community last year, supporting measures to stimulate job creation and spur economic growth,” said Tom Donohue, Chamber president and CEO. “The business community appreciates Virginia’s dedication to a pro-growth agenda and we are proud to present her with this award.”The “Spirit of Enterprise” award is given to members of the House or Senate who have supported the Chamber’s position on key votes. During the 2006 session, the Chamber “key-voted” 15 House votes, including pension reform, tax relief and maritime security enhancement. ###

Her proactive stance resulted in the HERO Act—which allows soldiers earning hazard pay to make IRA contributions—being signed into law last Memorial Day and today fuels her desire to see further improvements to the way our military men and women are cared for. “There is nothing more important than honoring our soldier’s sacrifice by giving them the very best care,” Foxx said. “They have given everything for the cause of freedom. We owe them the finest medical care and services available.” The following bills include recent veterans legislation that Foxx has voted in favor of: The Wounded Warriors Assistance Act (H.R. 1538) creates a new system of case managers and counselors for wounded troops returning from combat overseas to help them get needed care and help them navigate the military's health care bureaucracy. The Veterans Outreach Improvement Act of 2007 (H.R. 67) establishes a program for the Veterans Affairs (VA) Department to help states reach out to veterans and their families to inform veterans about programs and benefits for which they are eligible. The Returning Servicemember VA Healthcare Insurance Act of 2007 (H.R. 612) more than doubles the VA medical services eligibility period for veterans who served in combat during or after the Persian Gulf War. The Traumatic Brain Injury Health Enhancement and Long-Term Support Act of 2007 (H.R. 2199) authorizes new research centers for traumatic brain injures and establishes a comprehensive program to treat brain trauma at VA health centers. The Early Access to Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Benefits Act (H.R. 2239) extends eligibility for vocational rehabilitation benefits from the VA to current members of the armed forces receiving medical care and who have been disabled in the line of duty and will likely be discharged from service due to that disability. ###

This latest bill to fund the troops does not contain a timeline for withdrawal from Iraq and funds the troops through the end of the fiscal year.“Congress finally found some common ground,” Rep. Foxx said. “After months of back and forth, a presidential veto and an endless stream of short-sighted bills, Congress has produced a more responsible bill that does not force our military commanders into a precipitous retreat from Iraq.”The troop funding legislation is the result of a compromise between House and Senate negotiators. It provides the full amount of money requested by the president to pay for ongoing efforts in the Global War on Terror. Former versions of the bill included deadlines for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq.“Our brave men and women in uniform deserve to be fully funded,” Foxx said. “Now, more than 100 days after funding was requested, they are getting the resources they need. This compromise bill recognizes that a hasty withdrawal from Iraq would endanger the future stability of Iraq and give up what our troops have been fighting for all along.” ###

Rep. Foxx cited concerns with a provision in the bill which allows Congress to raise taxes even more should spending outstrip tax receipts in the coming years.“The Democrats’ budget puts us on a dangerous, slippery slope,” Foxx said. “First, it raises taxes by $217 billion. Then it allows Congress to completely eliminate the Republican tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 if fiscal restraint proves too difficult. I simply don’t understand why we need a budget that gives Congress carte blanche to tax Americans whenever it wants to spend a new pile of cash.”Federal spending on non-defense domestic programs will increase by $22 billion more than the 2007 budget. The budget includes additional promises of $190 billion in new spending over the next five years—despite an absence of funds to pay for the promised spending. The Democrat budget also fails to comply with the Pay-As-You-Go rule they adopted at the beginning of this Congress. Contrary to their rule, any tax cuts would be financed out of budget surpluses, and not with new savings.“The Democrats have thrown fiscal restraint out the window again,” Foxx said. “With tens of billions in new spending this year and promises of much, much more to come it’s almost impossible to believe Democrat promises of fiscal responsibility.”“As if raising taxes wasn’t enough, the Democrats have ignored one of our biggest domestic challenges,” Rep Foxx said. “Despite warnings from a chorus of experts that Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security desperately need reform, this budget does nothing to address the long term problems we are facing.”###

05.10.2007	U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted against new troop funding legislation that calls for a 90-day deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq and allows only 60 days’ worth of funding for the troops. This legislation is th share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071Current troop funding bill inadequately funds U.S. soldiers in IraqU.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted against new troop funding legislation that calls for a 90-day deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq and allows only 60 days’ worth of funding for the troops. This legislation is the next version of troop funding drawn up by the Democrats on the heels of a veto of the last failed troop funding bill.“Despite the fact that the military is running out of money to fund our troops in Iraq, the Democrats are ramming more irresponsible and unacceptable legislation down our soldier’s throats,” Foxx said. “At this point it is crystal clear that the House Democrats’ bottom line is not providing for our troops—it is providing for their own political gain.” The troop funding legislation contains withdrawal deadlines nearly identical to the previous version. Perhaps the most significant difference in the new legislation is the major reduction in funding. Today’s bills contain funding for 60 days instead of the full funding for the rest of fiscal year. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has warned the he might have to “shut down significant elements of the Department of Defense” should the Democrats cut off funding in 60 days.“The Iraqi people are in the midst of a tremendous historical shift—from totalitarianism to democracy—and face the reality of violent extremists bent on taking over the country,” Foxx said. “If we cut funding and precipitously pull out of Iraq, we are abandoning the Iraqi people and endangering the future stability of the region.” “Our military leaders should be the ones making this decision, not a group of politicians looking to score political points by slowly choking off our troops’ funding and pushing our military to the brink of defeat. Failure in Iraq is more than just an ill-advised retreat: it is conceding to an enemy who will become more entrenched and pose a renewed threat to our nation,” Foxx said.The 90-day timeline for withdrawal was defeated 171-255. The 60-day funding bill passed the House by a narrow margin of 221-205. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated that it stands almost no chance of passing the Senate.###

The Democrat leade share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071Foxx votes against diminished homeland security billCongresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted against a weakened homeland security bill (H.R. 1684) that ignores direct recommendations of the 9/11 Commission—despite Democrat promises to enact these recommendations. The Democrat leadership also stripped the bill of bipartisan security measures, effectively reducing the country’s ability to guard against and respond to terrorist attacks. “Here we have another example of Democrats ignoring their promises—promises to enact 9/11 Commission recommendations and to work in a bipartisan fashion,” Foxx said. “I’m not sure what my Democrat colleagues hope to accomplish by eliminating funding that protects high risk sites like airports and nuclear power plants. But by stripping out vital security measures, such as funding for screening of employees at high risk sites, they have gutted an otherwise good bill.” Democrat editing of the legislation has quashed dozens of security provisions in the bill, including funds for anti-terror screening tools for customs agents. Democrat changes will also prevent first responder grants from being used for training for emergency situations, would strip out funds aimed at protecting America’s food supply from attack, and kill funds for a mobile bio-metric identification system for illegal aliens captured at sea. “Recent successes, such as the arrest of extremists planning to attack a New Jersey military base, are the result of homeland security programs at work. Eliminating or gutting dozens of programs does nothing to ensure future success on this front,” Foxx said.“How can we take the Democrats at their word? They promised in their campaigns to strengthen American security and enact the 9/11 Commission recommendations. But they ignored those promises with this legislation. The Democrats have concocted nothing more than a feeble attempt to look strong on security and tough on terror—all without a stitch of strength or toughness,” Foxx said.The bill passed the House of Representatives 296 to 126. The White House has threatened a veto because the bill undermines essential security programs and the effectiveness of the Department of Homeland Security. ###

This bill would protect the right of elected and appointed officials to express their religious beliefs through public prayer by placing all establishment clause court cases involving prayer by public officials under the jurisdiction of state courts. “Every elected official from any religious background should be free to pray in public without fear of irresponsible lawsuits distracting from their public service,” Foxx said. “I am proud to support this legislation on the day when America formally recognizes the immense value of prayer in our daily lives.” Congresswoman Foxx signed on as an original co-sponsor to the Public Prayer Protection Act as part of an effort to preserve America’s longstanding tradition of marking public life with prayer. In practice, this bill allows the Christian, Jew, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or elected officials of any religious affiliation to pray as they believe.“Millions of Americans will pause today and ask God for guidance in their daily lives,” Rep. Foxx said. “The National Day of Prayer is an opportunity to remember our humanity and our need to rely on God for protection and provision.”“The Public Prayer Protection Act is a Constitutional way to guard our sacred tradition of prayer for future generations,” Foxx said. “Reasonable legislation like this will help preserve the rights of every religious group without condoning or condemning any form of expression.”###
05.03.2007	Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted to support the constitutional rights of every American by voting against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R. 1592). The Hate Crimes Act would give special legal share: f t Contact: Aaron Groen(202) 225-2071Foxx votes against ‘thought crimes’ legislation that infringes on Americans’ Constitutional RightsCongresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted to support the constitutional rights of every American by voting against the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R. 1592). The Hate Crimes Act would give special legal status to members of certain groups, specifically adding “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” groups as federally protected parties. Two identical crimes committed against members of different groups could therefore be punished differently.“With legislation like this we might as well toss the Constitution out the window,” Rep Foxx said. “There is so much wrong with this bill—but its most egregious offenses are its utter disregard for the constitutional principle of equal justice under the law and for the First Amendment rights of American citizens.” This bill could infringe on the Free Speech rights of religious leaders who disapprove of homosexual or transgender behavior. H.R. 1592 raises the possibility that religious leaders or members of religious groups could face criminal prosecution based on their speech on these newly protected issues.The Hate Crimes Bill creates a new variety of Federal “Thought Crime.” Someone’s thoughts can be considered an element of a crime, even if they did not commit the actual crime. For instance, this law could implicate a pastor who voiced concerns about homosexual behavior from the pulpit. Under this legislation, the government is given the legal basis to tie his words to someone else’s crimes. “Does this bill stray close to a form of ‘big brother’ government? It’s worse than that. The Hate Crimes Act goes further and completely crosses the line into dangerous government intrusion,” Foxx said. “The government has no business telling Americans what to think and it has no business creating categories of people to receive special treatment by the legal system.”###

The House of Representatives’ attempt to override a presidential veto, which requires a 2/3 super-majority, was unsuccessful. Rep. Foxx voted with 203 other Representatives to bring the troop funding debate back to the House floor and forge a compromise bill.“This bill had veered into dangerous waters, and I voted today to ensure we debated funding for our troops without arbitrary deadlines,” Foxx said. “I hope the Democratic leaders will take a serious look at their obligation to work with Republicans in crafting a new bill that gives our troops the tools, equipment and flexibility they need to fight this battle. It’s time for the Democrats to leave the war planning to our generals.”Today’s vote will renew the discussions over troop withdrawal timelines and how troop funding is handled. Congress will now begin work on a new troop funding bill in light of the House’s failure to override the president’s veto.“Our troops have waited long enough for Democrats in Congress to send them funding,” Foxx said. “All that my Democrat colleagues managed to conjure up was a bill laced with more than $20 billion in pork mashed together with arbitrary deadlines. I welcome the opportunity to start from scratch and pass a clean bill that makes strategic sense.”###

The bill came to the floor again today after coming out of conference with the Senate. Rep. Foxx first voted against this measure in March.“This bill is reckless,” Rep Foxx said. “Our men and women in uniform deserve funding without strings attached. Instead, the Democrats insist on forcing the commanders in the field to comply with an arbitrary withdrawal date.”In its December 2006 report, the bipartisan Iraq Study Group opposed setting a deadline for withdrawal. Such a timeline would infringe on commanders’ ability to respond to events on the ground, according to the panel’s co-chairman, former Secretary of State James A. Baker.“Military leaders, not politicians, should be making the decisions that affect the conduct of this war,” Foxx said. “If my Democrat colleagues are opposed to the war they should vote to rescind the president’s authority to conduct it. But since they lack the courage to take this step they have resorted to a dangerous political tactic that delays vital funds for our troops.”The supplemental funding bill also contains more than $28 billion in spending not related to the war on terror—from money for drought assistance to funds for salmon fisheries. This spending has been added outside of the normal budget process and therefore is not subject to budget rules. “Shoehorning billions into an emergency bill is a cheap ploy to sidestep the budget rules that the Democrats themselves enacted,” Congresswoman Foxx said, “By skirting their own budget rules, Democrats have once again proven that their claims of fiscal restraint are a sham. We should not be muddying the waters of this important issue with completely unrelated spending.”The supplemental war funding bill passed the House by a narrow margin of 218-208. It now goes to President Bush who has promised to veto the bill and return it to Congress and that for a funding package that does not set a timeline for troop withdrawal.

Medicare is on the brink of insolvency and for the first time the trustees have issued a Medicare funding warning that calls for quick action from the President and Congress.” “Many of my constituents depend on Social Security to be there when they reach retirement. As the entire system hurtles towards a financial crisis we must summon the courage to get beyond political wrangling and fix this problem once and for all,” Foxx said.“But in their recent federal budget proposal, Democrats did nothing to meaningfully address the coming crisis. With each passing year it is going to get more difficult and more painful to fix the structural problems in Social Security and Medicare.” “If we push real reform off much longer we will have a true crisis on our hands. It is the responsibility of Congress to take a hard look at the challenges facing Social Security and Medicare. At this point political posturing and pandering to special interests should have no place in the discussion of how to ensure that Social Security and Medicare help secure the futures of both our grandchildren and today’s retirees.” ###

04.16.2007	Tax Day 2007 marks both low and high points in U.S. tax history. The Republican tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 lowered taxes to near-record lows.

The Republican tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 lowered taxes to near-record lows. In fact, the average federal tax rate for a four-person family earning the median income is 13.1 percent—the lowest it has been in 40 years. But at the same time, Congressional Democrats passed a federal budget blueprint last month that assumes the expiration of the Republican tax cuts by 2010—to the tune of a more than $390 billion tax hike over five years.“Tax Day 2007 is a reminder of the benefits of pro-growth Republican policies for North Carolina taxpayers,” Rep Virginia Foxx said. “While the tax code is broken, Republican policy has alleviated the damage the income tax does to taxpayers and helped bring America four straight years of economic growth as well as 7.5 million new jobs.”For evidence that tax cuts are working, taxpayers need look no farther than the fact that this year Americans will receive an average refund of $2,394. These steadily increasing refunds are a tangible result of the Republican tax cuts which killed the marriage penalty, created a new lower 10 percent tax bracket and increased the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. However, the federal budget blueprint passed by the Democrats would eliminate each of these fiscally sound tax cuts. “Unfortunately for millions of North Carolinians the Democrats seem bent on raising their taxes,” Foxx said. “Tax Day is a reminder that the progress we have made to reduce people’s tax burdens is endangered by the Democrat’s tax and spend agenda.”Americans agree. A survey release by the non-partisan Tax Foundation this month found that a majority of adults believe the federal tax code is complex and in need of major reform and that their income taxes are “too high.”

When these tax cuts are allowed to expire, the average North Carolina taxpayer would see a tax increase of approximately $2,671 in 2011. The expiring tax cuts would mean cuts to the child tax credit – from its current level of a $1,000 credit per dependent, to just $500. This would raise taxes on 31 million Americans with 49 million children by an average of $859 per year. The budget also assumes that the marriage penalty would return and push married couples into higher tax brackets than if they were filing as singles. “Congress can balance the budget in five years without raising taxes,” Congresswoman Foxx said. “I support the Republican budget plan that balances the budget by keeping taxes low, promoting economic growth, and ending excessive waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government.”“The Democrat budget threatens to kill important tax cuts for North Carolinians,” Foxx said. “I am disappointed by the Democrat’s failure to follow through on their pledges of fiscal responsibility and their disregard for the value of these tax cuts to the families and workers of this country.” ###

Virginia Foxx (NC-05) today voted to ensure America’s injured and wounded soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines receive the finest healthcare available through the military health system. The Wounded Warriors Assistance Act has the support of the senior Republicans and Democrats on both the House Armed Services Committee and the House Veterans Affairs Committee.“This new law ensures that every member of the military, and especially the brave soldiers who have been injured or wounded in combat, gets the care they deserve,” Rep. Foxx said. “This legislation alleviates the administrative burdens on hospitalized soldiers so that these courageous Americans and their families can access the medical care they need in a more expeditious and streamlined manner.”“Every American was upset by the circumstances at Walter Reed. Congress will do everything in its power to locate these kinds of problems and ensure that they don’t persist anywhere in the military medical system,” Rep. Foxx said. “It is critical to underscore that fact that this discussion is not a reflection on the hard work and dedication exhibited day in and day out by the military medical professionals who are responsible for saving countless lives. They should be celebrated as the heroes they are,” Foxx said.” H.R. 1538, the Wounded Warrior Assistance Act of 2007, creates a new system of case managers, advocates and counselors for wounded troops returning from combat overseas to help them get the care they need and to help navigate the military's health care bureaucracy. It provides the people, training and oversight mechanisms needed to ensure that wounded soldiers receive quality care and that the military health system will not fail them. The legislation also sets the stage for much needed reform of administrative processes that will restore member confidence in the integrity and efficiency of the disability evaluation system and begin the process of achieving a truly seamless transition of service members to the Department of Veterans Affairs programs.An overwhelming bipartisan majority voted in favor of the bipartisan Wounded Warrior Assistance Act for 2007 by 426-0.###

This massive spending spree means they can no longer hide behind rhetoric about fiscal responsibility.“The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which the Democrat budget assumes will expire, have spurred record tax revenues and economic growth. But this plan would allow these valuable tax cuts to expire, hurting married couples, families with children and single parents.“According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, the Bush tax cuts lowered the tax bills of nearly 3 million North Carolinians. More than 2.5 million experienced lower taxes as a result of a new 10 percent bracket that cut taxes for the lowest income taxpayers. “But the Democrat budget kills these tax cuts. This includes 936,000 married couples who—if the Democrat budget is approved—would see their taxes go up, as well as 837,000 married couples and single parents who face a major reduction in the child tax credit under the Democratic budget plan. “This budget signals the Democrat’s failure to follow through on their pledges of fiscal responsibility. It raises the taxes of tens of millions of Americans while refusing to rein in federal spending.”###

Under the new legislation, farmers and construction and industrial professionals in rural areas would be the primary beneficiaries of increased access to training on breakthroughs in energy efficiency technology.“This program harnesses the advances in energy efficient technology for our communities by using existing programs to educate our citizens,” Congresswoman Foxx said. “The Energy Technology Transfer Act is good policy for rural communities that need information on the latest breakthroughs and can benefit from lower energy bills and energy efficient technology.”The expanded program funds educational outreach efforts—without creating new layers of bureaucracy— that will teach farmers and professionals in the construction and industrial fields about technologies that promote energy efficiency. The program would help to fund the education efforts of nonprofit institutions, local governments and colleges and universities that disseminate information about energy efficiency technology and building practices. It also includes provisions to fund energy efficiency evaluations on existing buildings.“The Energy Technology Transfer Act focuses on transferring new energy-related research so that the average citizen can realize the benefits of energy efficient technology. Ultimately, this will enhance our efforts to become energy independent in an era of volatile energy prices,” Foxx said.

Foxx’s amendment ensures that federal agencies do not use children’s personally identifiable information to create national databases for the Head Start program.“Personal privacy is one of our nation’s foundational freedoms. I have worked hard in the past to make the privacy of students one of the highest priorities for agencies that collect data on our education system,” Representative Foxx said. “This amendment not only protects the privacy of children, but also guarantees that parents have access to their children’s records.”Foxx’s amendment was approved by the full House Committee on Education and Labor. It reaffirms the Head Start program’s commitment to parental involvement by restricting how federal agencies can use children’s personally identifiable information as Head Start works to improve the way it tests children across the nation. H.R. 1429 suspends a controversial nationwide program that gives high-stakes tests to 4-year-olds. It also protects local jurisdictions’ ability to determine how tri-annual testing is carried out in order to improve teaching methods. “As we continue to learn how best to assess the progress of children in Head Start programs, we must ensure that we do not compromise our children’s privacy,” Foxx said. “This amendment is a step toward enhancing the program’s accountability without damaging the rights of parents and students.”Foxx has successfully added language to past education bills to protect student privacy. She recently helped preserve student privacy by amending the College Access & Opportunity Act, which passed the House in 2006. Her amendment ensured that college students’ personal information would not make its way into Department of Education databases.Parents interested in more information on H.R. 1429 or the Head Start program can contact Foxx’s Washington, DC office at (202) 225-2071.###
02.26.2007	The Web site of Congresswoman Virginia Foxx was honored today by the Congressional Management Foundation, a non-profit, non-partisan management consulting and research organization in Washington, D.C., for being one of the best in Congr share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEContact: Todd Poole336-778-0211Only North Carolina Web Site HonoredWashington, D.C. – The Web site of Congresswoman Virginia Foxx was honored today by the Congressional Management Foundation, a non-profit, non-partisan management consulting and research organization in Washington, D.C., for being one of the best in Congress. The site, www.foxx.house.gov, was one of 615 evaluated in The 2006 Gold Mouse Report: Recognizing the Best Web Sites on Capitol Hill, which analyzed congressional Web sites including those of all Senate and House Members, committees (both majority and minority sites), and official leadership sites. Eighty-five Web sites were cited in 2006, with 18 winning Gold, 27 winning Silver, and 40 winning Bronze Mouse Awards. The Foxx web site was the only North Carolina delegation site honored with an award. "The staff and I are very pleased to receive this recognition of our website. Erica Shrader and the entire staff deserve much of the credit and I commend them for their commitment to making our site user friendly and packed with information that will help constituents of the 5th district,” Foxx said. “We are all there to serve the people of the 5th district and are focused on that in all that we do. This recognition will spur us on to have an even better site in the future."The Gold Mouse Report and Awards are part of the Congressional Management Foundation’s broader research project, “Connecting to Congress,” funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation. For this project CMF partnered with researchers from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, University of California-Riverside and Ohio State University to study how Members of Congress can use the Internet to improve communications with their constituents and to promote greater participation in the legislative process. “One of the key purposes of the awards is to highlight best practices so offices can improve their sites by learning from those doing a good job,” said Beverly Bell, executive director of the Congressional Management Foundation. “Web sites that garnered an Award in 2006 illustrate the best practices that we hope can serve as examples for others to follow.” “Congresswoman Foxx’s Web site shows that she has identified the needs of her various constituencies and has developed easily accessible content that meets their needs online,” said Bell. “Congresswoman Foxx is to be congratulated for being among the best of the best Web sites on Capitol Hill, and the Congressional Management Foundation is pleased to present her with the 2006 Bronze Mouse Award.”“The 2006 report shows that Web sites are an increasingly critical channel through which Members communicate to, and hear from, constituents. In a time when people can do everything online from renewing their driver licenses to paying their taxes, they understandably expect to find information on the Web about legislation and congressional assistance with federal agencies, as well as the opportunity to communicate their own views,” Bell said.Web sites were graded on how well they incorporate five basic building blocks that extensive research has identified as critical for effectiveness: audience, content, usability, interactivity, and innovation. Using these building blocks, an evaluation framework was developed by CMF and their research partners at Harvard, Ohio State, and the University of California-Riverside that would be fair and objective, while still taking into account important qualitative factors that affect a visitor's experience on a Web site. CMF will be assessing congressional Web sites again in 2007. All House and Senate Member, committee and leadership Web sites will be evaluated during the summer of 2007 and another report is expected to be released by the end of the year. A full copy of the report, the 2006 Gold Mouse Report: Recognizing the Best Web Sites on Capitol Hill, is available on the Congressional Management Foundation’s Web site at www.cmfweb.org ###

Foxx said this resolution is the Democrats’ next step in turning their backs on American troops in the field and leaving Iraq in chaos, without any consideration of the consequences. Congresswoman Foxx spoke out on this matter on the House floor stating:“Mr. Speaker, I rise today not only in support of the brave men and women of the American armed forces, but also in support of the cause for which they fight. They heroically give of themselves everyday to ensure the safety of our nation and the freedoms that Americans enjoy. Like my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I want America’s troops home as soon as possible, but disengaging at this time would invite the terrorists to follow us home. This resolution sends the wrong message and will have grave consequences. It will demoralize our troops and embolden our enemies.“We are combating a global adversary who sees an enemy in any nation that supports the ideals of freedom. In the interest of democracy, global safety, and world peace, victory in Iraq is absolutely crucial.“While some seem happy to complain about the war, they have offered nothing in the way of a solution to defeat the jihadists. It is fine to disagree, but your opinion holds little weight if you fail to offer a constructive alternative. Leadership takes strength and courage to succeed in the face of adversity although mistakes may be made along the way.“Many comments have been made by those who support this resolution, but one that deserves a response is the oft repeated phrase that this is an impossible war to win. What a terrible attitude for members of the US Congress to have. What if George Washington had succumbed to the critics of his day who said those things? What if Abraham Lincoln, FDR, and President Truman had taken that attitude? Where would we be now? We are here today because people who came before us refused to listen to the naysayers and the defeatists. The true leaders of this nation have always focused on the possible and accomplished it. These people remind me of the attitude of the Carter Administration in dealing with Iran. Let me quote a recent article written by Dinesh D’Souza that I submit to be included in the record, ‘…they are willing to risk the country falling into the hands of Islamic radicals. Little do the people waging the war against the war know that, in exchange for a temporary political advantage, they are gravely endangering America’s security and well-being, ultimately even their own.’“Let us band together as Americans, put aside political differences to show that we understand the need to defend freedom for the long and short terms.“This is the decisive battle of our generation and this is a defining moment of our time. We cannot afford to lose.”###

Frohlich202-225-2071February 6, 2007 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) honored country music legend and Sparta, North Carolina native Del Reeves on the House floor last evening. Reeves was a member of the Grand Ole Opry and had 55 charted hits. Del Reeves passed away on New Year’s Day, 2007 after a long and painful bout of emphysema. Below is the transcript of Foxx’s speech: “Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to a proud son of Sparta, North Carolina, country singer and Grand Ole Opry legend Del Reeves. Del Reeves passed away after a long and painful bout of emphysema on New Year’s Day, 2007. “Del Reeves was born in 1933 and was named Franklin Delano Reeves after Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was nominated to be the Democratic Presidential candidate just a few days before his birth. Del was a driven individual who knew at a very young age that he wanted to be a performer. “As a young child Del spoke of music on the radio and said, ‘I listened on the radio on Saturday nights and it was the ultimate,’ referring to the Grand Ole Opry. ‘As a child, I told my daddy I was going to sing on the Opry one day. He said, ‘Yea, sure you are.’ I kept my goal in mind and in ’66 we achieved it.’ He was one of the select members of the Grand Ole Opry for 40 years. “Del achieved that goal and many others. From a very young age, Del would borrow his brothers’ instruments and by the time Del had turned 12 years old, he had become a local radio star on WPAQ in Mount Airy on the Merry Go Round show, a program which is still aired today. But this was just the start for Del Reeves; he went on for years performing and recording numerous hits, including 55 charted hits, two of them in the top ten. “Del was more than just a performer; he attended what is now Appalachian State University and served in the Air Force at Travis Air Force Base, where he wrote a number of his songs. Del was very dedicated to his hometown and the advancement of others. He started the Del Reeves Scholarship Fund and for ten years came back to Alleghany for the ‘Del Reeves Homecoming,’ where he held concerts to benefit the scholarship fund he set up. I am so proud that Del, a Sparta native, was successful in his performing career yet never lost touch with his roots and never let go of his dedication to helping others. “Del had a wonderful career that spanned over forty years. Beyond being a member of the elite group of the Grand Ole Opry, Del also wrote and performed a number of hit songs and appeared in eight movies, including Sam Whiskey, starring Burt Reynolds and Clint Walker. Del also worked in television, hosting a TV program called the Del Reeves’ Country Carnival. Some of Del’s greatest hits were The Belles of the Southern Belle, his first hit in 1963; The Girl on the Billboard, his number one Billboard hit; Sing a Little Song of Heartache, which he wrote with his wife; and Looking through the Windshield his trucker anthem released in 1965. Other notable hits that charmed and thrilled country music fans were hits such as Woman Do Funny Things to Me, Good Time Charlie’s, Be Glad and The Philadelphia Fillies. In addition, Del wrote many songs for country legends such as Carl Smith, Roy Drusky, Rose Maddox and Sheb Wooly. “Del enjoyed performing lighter material as well as singing ballads and he reflected on that saying, ‘Under this clown’s face, there’s a serious guy…I’ve been clowning as long as I can remember.’ That is what made Del Reeves unique – he was such a multifaceted and talented person who enjoyed life and his work. “When asked how he would like to be remembered, he said, ‘I want to be remembered as a great showman and a nice guy…That’s all I could hope for.’ Well, that is exactly what Del got, as he certainly is remembered as a nice guy and a great showman. One of his closest friends, J.D. Higgins, appropriately commented that, ‘On New Year’s Day, country music lost a tremendous entertainer and I’ll miss him greatly. He’ll be missed by country music fans all over the world.’ I know he will be missed by family, friends and his numerous admirers. Del was a true inspiration who made his hometown friends and North Carolina proud. “Del Reeves showed his large heart and love for his hometown community by creating a scholarship fund and always ‘coming home’ to perform in Alleghany. Del’s contributions will serve as a lasting testimony of his tremendous talent, kindness, motivation and delightful personality. We will all miss Del Reeves but know that his timeless music will never be forgotten. He leaves quite a legacy for fans and future generations.” ###

Frohlich202-225-2071January 23, 2007 After President Bush addressed the nation during a joint session of Congress, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) released the following statement: “I believe the President gave an earnest speech that addressed the many challenges that confront our nation. I was pleased to see that the President focused his speech on both the prominent foreign and domestic challenges America currently faces. “The domestic policy initiatives he addressed must be dealt with head on if we wish to grow our economy and secure America for future generations. I agree that we must move forward on energy independence by exploring energy alternatives as well as increasing domestic production within our own boundaries in an environmentally sensitive way. In addition I applaud his focusing on fiscal restraint and spending reform. We spend too much money at the federal level and absolutely have to set priorities consistent with our Constitutional duties. “Health care is one of the most serious issues we face domestically today. I believe the President’s plan to make basic, private health insurance available and affordable for more Americans must be a priority. Additionally, Congress must continue to allow the President to exercise his Constitutional right to nominate judges and prevent gridlock in the nomination process. “I disagree with the President’s proposed ‘comprehensive immigration reform.’ We should close the borders and end illegal entry into the United States now. This is not the time to allow illegal aliens any form of amnesty or path to citizenship. The first step must be to secure our borders now and enforce current laws. “We must pursue foreign policy initiatives that make our nation safer and more secure. Failure in Iraq is not an option. Congress has an obligation to oversee the President’s initiatives and hold President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki accountable for progress in the Iraqi war. This war is the definitive ideological struggle of our time, and the United States must work with allies and nations in the Middle East to strive for stability. If we expect true success, we must also neutralize the detrimental effect of Iran and Syria who are escalating the level of violence in Iraq. To leave without victory would lead to ethnic violence and provide a haven for terrorists to plan further attacks on us on our own soil. “To make this nation safer and more prepared for the growing threat of nuclear proliferation by rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea, we must strengthen our military to make certain we are prepared for any threat we may face. “Last year the Democrats promised that this would be the most bipartisan Congress ever. The President has pledged himself to work in a bipartisan manner to meet the challenges of our nation. I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to fulfill their promises to allow open debate on ideas that will help find the best solutions for the American people.” ###

Berger. Upon signing the letter, Foxx issued the following statement: “I believe the penalty for the crime Mr. Berger committed was inadequate and unfortunate. He admitted to taking highly classified documents on three occasions from the National Archives. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Berger was to be given a polygraph test, and the Justice Department must follow through with this agreement. “The severity of this situation must be addressed. It is imperative that Mr. Berger be held accountable and questioned about the extent of his thievery of documents pertaining to President Clinton’s policy on terrorism. The probability that documents were destroyed and stolen to prevent their review by the 9/11 Commission is extremely disturbing. “Justice must be served in this matter. Without the full disclosure of historically relevant documents, the 9/11 Commission’s report may very well be missing critical information. The actions of Mr. Berger are an injustice to our nation and to the American people.” ###

Frohlich202-225-2071January 18, 2007 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) voted against H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act of 2007, a Democrat bill that would only increase taxes, raise fuel costs, result in more job losses for Americans and maintain America’s dependence on foreign oil. “Once again, the Democrats have proposed a bill that appears beneficial, but in reality it is anything but. This does nothing to alleviate America’s dependence on foreign oil,” Foxx commented. The Congressional Budget Office as well as the Joint Committee on Taxation estimate this legislation will result in $7.7 billion in tax increases over ten years, in addition to $6.3 billion in new royalty payments over the same period. The bottom line is that the increased revenues from this tax hike could be used for any federal discretionary spending, and there is not a single guarantee the money will be used for alternative energy sources or exploration. “This legislation pretends to foster alternative fuel sources, while it really raises taxes and maintains the status quo on America’s dependence on foreign oil. If this were to become law, the only result would be a loss of American jobs and an increased cost of gas and home heating oil. “We have not built a refinery in America since 1976, and if this Congress is serious about depending less on foreign sources of energy and true energy reform, we must begin to build refineries again, allow for responsible exploration of energy within our own borders and truly invest in energy alternatives. Anything short of this continues to put America at the mercy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and the nations that control it,” Foxx concluded. ###

Frohlich202-225-2071January 18, 2007 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) honored NASCAR racing legend and Fifth District native Benny Parsons on the House Floor yesterday. Benny was a truly inspirational figure who passed away Tuesday, January 16 after a long battle with cancer. Below is the transcript of Foxx’s speech: “Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate a true inspiration whose perseverance showed the very best of the human spirit. Yesterday, Benny Parsons, a NASCAR legend, passed away after a difficult battle with lung cancer. “Parsons grew up in the foothills of North Carolina in Wilkes County, and his dedication and drive lifted him from poverty to national recognition. He became an inspiration to countless fans and individuals. He was a beloved character who brought passion to the sport. Today, we mourn and also celebrate the life of this beloved man in the 5th District of North Carolina. “The chairman of NASCAR, Brian France, said of Benny Parsons, who was affectionately referred to as BP, that ‘Benny Parsons was a true champion, both on the race track and in life. Benny loved our sport and the people that make it up and those people loved him. He will be remembered as being a great ambassador for the sport.’ Words such as these convey the deep admiration, respect and love of Benny and the effect he had on those with whom he connected. “After leaving Wilkes County, Benny first took a job as a cab driver in Detroit, Michigan, before he progressed to become a NASCAR champion. While faced with fame and admiration, Benny never forgot his roots and the importance of where he came from. He was often referred to as ‘The Professor' after he retired from racing in 1988 and began broadcasting and commenting on NASCAR races for NBC, ESPN and TNT. He had an uncanny ability to deliver information in a relaxed and informative way for the last 6 years, even when he was going through the rigorous treatment for cancer. “Michael Waltrip, who recently tested his car at the Daytona track, said of Benny, ‘When you talked to him, he brought out the human element. The cars are nuts and bolts, but he talked through that. He was able to deliver to people. He just tried to be passionate about what he believed, and he did a great job of explaining what people were seeing.’ To show his admiration of Benny, Waltrip painted on the side of his car, ‘We love you, BP.’ “Respect, admiration and inspiration among colleagues, fans and the public made Benny Parsons the amazing and inspirational figure that he was, but it was his personality that espoused all of these qualities so many came to admire. It was his passion and commitment to NASCAR and his love of the sport that made Benny such a lovable person and such a great inspiration. Even at his sickest moments, he had set up a Web blog for his fans, continually sharing his optimism that he would recover and that the will to fight is so important. “Besides the inspirational spirit and the continual drive to fight any obstacle in front of him, Benny Parsons was quite the accomplished NASCAR driver. He was a member of NASCAR's 50 greatest drivers. He was the 1973 NASCAR champion and won 21 races, including the race in 1957 at Daytona. In addition to those accomplishments, Benny was the first driver to be a Cup competitor, to qualify for a race over 200 miles per hour, driving 200.176 miles per hour at the Winston 500 at Talladega Superspeedway in 1982. “Benny Parsons made 526 starts from 1964 until his retirement in 1988. With such an outstanding record, Benny was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 1994 and continued his passion by broadcasting from the pit and won a Cable Ace Award for best sports analyst on his first season in the booth. “I think that NBC sports champion Dick Ebersol said it best about Benny, commenting, ‘Benny was a beloved and widely respected member of the NASCAR community. He was a great driver and a terrific broadcaster, but above anything else, he was a kind and generous human being. His character and spirit will define how he is remembered by all of us.’ “Benny fought cancer to the end with optimism and grace, inspiring countless people. His compassion, generosity and charming personality will be missed. Benny had made North Carolina and NASCAR proud, and his memory will be a lasting one of inspiration and dedication.” ####

Frohlich202-225-2071January 11, 2007 Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) stood up today to protect the sanctity of human life by voting against H.R. 3, The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. This legislation permits federal funding for the first time of research involving the intentional destruction of human embryos to extract their stem cells."I fully support ethical stem cell research on stem cells derived from adults, placentas, cord blood cells, and amniotic fluid, but I do not support embryonic stem cell research which destroys human life. We all want and should work toward finding cures for diseases, but we should not sacrifice another human being's life to do so. The push for federal funding of stem cell research involving the destruction of human embryos is especially unwise when current, ethical research has given us 72 cures and therapies for diseases thus far and embryonic stem cell research over the past two decades has produced no treatments or cures. Indeed, because of the very negative results of embryonic research in animals, it is deemed too dangerous to try in humans."Embryonic stem cells are unstable, grow uncontrollably, and form tumors. To give hope that embryonic stem cell research is the panacea for many diseases is cruel and misleading. Furthermore, what Congress debated today involves federal funding for embryonic stem cell research. There is no ban on private funding of this research in America. We should not force American taxpayers to fund research many of them find unethical, immoral, and ineffective. I cannot in good conscience support federal funding for research that destroys human life. The sanctity of life is a gift from God and must be cherished and protected," stated Foxx. ###

We must maintain our efforts to provide security and stability for the Iraqi government and its people until they are able to do so themselves. We cannot walk away or we will face increased bloodshed at home and abroad. I applaud the President for recognizing the need for a new direction in the Iraq war in order to achieve this and presenting tangible solutions to the problems we currently face there. "This new approach has received approval by the top military leaders both at the Pentagon and in the field. I support making sure that the Iraqis take the lead and act aggressively and swiftly against any violence. Prime Minister Maliki has issued a commitment to meet these challenges, and the President must hold him accountable to this pledge. It is my hope that the proposals put forth will lead to success in the war in Iraq. “Our troops deserve unwavering support and this new direction the President has implemented must show progress. Now is the time to unite as Americans, and not as partisan politicians. I look forward to the day when a free and democratic Iraqi government and its people can defend themselves and be a model for others in the Middle East.” ###

This legislation would prohibit pre-recorded or robotic political calls to individuals who do not wish to receive these calls. This bill is identical to one Foxx introduced in the previous Congress.“During campaign season, households are bombarded with robotic political calls that advertise, campaign, and solicit donations for or against political candidates or issues. These calls often interrupt family dinners and gatherings, fill up answering machines and are seemingly non-stop as Election Day draws closer. Citizens should be allowed to stop automated political calls from coming to them just as they can stop telemarketing calls. Anyone who wants to continue to receive automated political calls will be able to receive them. I believe people should have this choice.” Foxx commented.Congresswoman Foxx's bill ensures that anyone who does not wish to receive such calls can opt-out by registering not to receive them, just as they can for telemarketing calls. The legislation applies to unsolicited politically-oriented recorded calls where a person is not available to speak with the individual answering the phone. “The people have made it loud and clear; they do not wish to receive these calls and it is time to allow them the choice to opt-out. I encourage all my colleagues to join me in passing this legislation and in respecting the privacy and wishes of the American people,” Foxx concluded.###

Ford, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) issued the following statement: “Our nation suffered a significant loss with the passing of President Ford. A combat veteran of WWII and a dedicated public servant, he devoted his life to America and the betterment of all its citizens. Known as a ‘man of the House,’ Gerald R. Ford served in the House of Representatives for 25 years and was elevated to the post of Minority Leader through his hard work, honesty and integrity. “Those integral qualities made Gerald R. Ford a natural choice for Vice-President, and after a terrible national nightmare, Ford ascended to the Presidency and served with the compassion and dignity needed to heal the wounds of a scarred nation. “Today’s service was a wonderful celebration of President Ford’s life and legacy and I was honored to be in attendance. He was a wonderful man who cared deeply for his country and served it with unprecedented grace in a time of need. “President Ford had close ties to the Fifth District of North Carolina, as an active supporter of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. President Ford’s eldest son, Mike received a degree from Wake Forest University in 1972 and since 1981 he has been the director of student development. Mike’s wife, Gayle also graduated from Wake Forest University in 1973. President Ford was a dedicated friend of Wake Forest University and an active supporter of the University through speaking engagements, fundraising and educational lectures.“My thoughts and prayers go out to the Ford family for their loss. I hope the comfort of friends and a grateful nation will help ease the pain of their loss.” ###

Frohlich202-225-2071Today, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-05) voted in favor of H.R. 6099 the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act. This is an informed consent bill that ensures mothers are educated of the evidence that their unborn child can feel pain by 20 weeks after gestation, if not earlier and would allow women to request pain medicine for their baby. When they have chosen an abortion, women are not currently informed of the extremely painful death their child will endure during an abortion.Congresswoman Foxx commented, “It is imperative that Congress take the appropriate measures to protect the sanctity of life and the rights of the unborn. Experts have shown that fetuses can feel pain at least 20 weeks after fertilization. We have taken action to ensure that the pain of livestock and laboratory animals is reduced and prevented, yet when it comes to unborn children we hesitate. If an unborn child can feel pain in the womb, I can’t imagine the pain felt during an abortion.“Life is a gift from God, and should be respected. We must do all we can to protect the rights of those unborn children with no voices and at the very least, help reduce the suffering they may endure,” concluded Foxx.###

Res. 96, a bill to recognize the contributions of the Christmas tree growers to the United States economy is pleased to announce its passage by voice vote in the House of Representatives today. H.J. Res. 96 not only recognizes the economic contributions of the live Christmas tree industry, but this legislation also acknowledges the historical importance of the Christmas tree to traditional family values.Upon passage of H.J. Res 96, Congresswoman Foxx stated, “I am very pleased to see the House of Representatives pass this legislation to recognize the live Christmas tree industry. The use of live Christmas trees goes back to 1850 and has become a staple of American tradition for the Christmas holiday.”The importance of the live Christmas tree industry is especially relevant to the 5th District of North Carolina where the Fraser fir, the most commonly grown tree in Western North Carolina was judged to be the nation’s best Christmas tree in a contest by the National Christmas Tree Association. The North Carolina Christmas tree industry is ranked second in the nation, producing 19 percent of the real Christmas trees in the United States. Over 100,000 people are employed in the live-cut Christmas tree industry and the retail value of live Christmas trees sold in 2005 was $1.4 billion dollars. “In addition to the cherished heritage of the Christmas tree and its importance as a symbol of traditional family values, the live Christmas tree industry is a vital part of the 5th District’s and America’s economy as all of the 50 states produce live Christmas trees,” Foxx concluded.###

Their dedication, sacrifice and willingness to answer the call of duty has preserved and spread freedom throughout the globe. While we commemorate those veterans who still share their wisdom and experience with us, we must never forget those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for America and her just causes.“Our veterans have fought as liberators, not just to protect America and her security, but to assist strangers in the fight against the bonds of tyranny, evil and oppression. As we observe Veterans Day, Americans owe their deepest gratitude and appreciation to all of those who have put on the uniform, faced peril and answered the call to defend liberty.“Our veterans are true American heroes and they have undoubtedly made America ‘the land of the free and the home of the brave.’”###

I have pledged to the residents of the 5th District I will always vote in favor of family values, and I intend to keep that pledge. I am humbled that my work has been acknowledged by the Family Research Council, and I am grateful this Republican led Congress has voted to uphold these values. I firmly believe these values must be protected and cherished, as they exemplify the best in America and how they have made this the great nation it is today.”The “True Blue” award is given biannually to members of Congress who voted on legislation to uphold family values, such as the Pledge Protection act; The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act; Public Expression of Religion Act and The Marriage Protection Amendment. Other criteria were to vote against destroying embryos for scientific research purposes and to vote against the use of taxpayer dollars to provide abortions on military bases. ###

If you don’t you get stuck in Iraq.” In response to the insulting remark, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) released the following statement:“I am troubled and disturbed by the remarks of Senator Kerry about our troops. This was not a joke taken out of context. It was an insult, plain and simple. Senator Kerry has insulted troops in the past when he testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1971, and he has done it once again. Our troops are the finest, the bravest and brightest and deserve nothing short of our unconditional support. Not only does Senator Kerry owe the men and women currently serving in the military an apology, but he owes everyone who has ever put on the uniform and has nobly served this country a sincere apology as well.”###

I have continually fought in Congress to end the ‘death tax,’ lower the tax burden on seniors and protect Social Security and Medicare. Congress must continually work to protect the benefits that current seniors have earned, as well as establishing a plan to reform Social Security, so future generations will benefit from the contributions they have made,” stated Foxx.The 60 Plus Association is a 15 year old organization that defends seniors interests such as permanently repealing the death tax, lowering the tax burden on seniors, defending Medicare and Social Security and working for lower energy and medical costs.“Senior citizens’ contributions to this nation have been invaluable and made this nation the greatest place in the world to live.

The Secure Fence Act authorizes 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing and mandates that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) achieve and maintain operational control over the entire border through various methods such as ground sensors, cameras and other surveillance technology. Not only does The Secure Fence Act provide for a physical barrier but it also calls for more systematic surveillance of our borders through adding more border patrol agents and state-of-the-art technology. Additionally, it requires DHS to give border patrol agents the authority to disable fleeing vehicles.Upon enactment into law of The Secure Fence Act of 2006, Congresswoman Foxx issued the following statement: “We will be safer as a nation as a result of this necessary step in securing our borders. Border security and national security are inextricably linked; the threat of terrorists crossing our borders is far too real. This law will address our country’s vulnerability and will dramatically reduce illegal immigration and the intrusion of terrorists. I am disappointed that 131 Democrats voted against this legislation when it passed in the House of Representatives, but I am pleased the Republican led Congress was able to deliver this bill to the President’s desk for his signature in spite of this.” The signing of the Secure Fence Act joins other key Republican border security accomplishments in recent weeks, the Border Tunnel Prevention Act, the Security and accountability for every (SAFE) Port Act and the FY 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Conference Report which included $1.2 billion for a border fence, all of which were signed into law by the President. Foxx has been a relentless advocate for border security and has a strong record in securing our borders and fighting against illegal immigration. Foxx supported and voted for H.R. 418, the Real ID Act, H.R. 4437, The Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act and H.R. 4954, the Security and Accountability for Every (SAFE) Port Act.###

I look forward to working with the 5th District agricultural industry to craft a new farm bill in 2007 that will give our farmers and ranchers the tools they need to continue providing their outstanding commodities to our great nation. I am committed to working in any way to improve opportunities for profitability for agricultural producers so that they can be economically strong, regionally diverse and globally competitive,” Foxx concluded.###

Ultimately Congress should disengage the federal government from housing assistance programs and encourage states and localities to do what they think is appropriate,” Foxx stated.The vouchers from The Department of Housing and Urban Development’s programs are designed to promote self sufficiency in child care, transportation, education, job training and employment counseling, substance and alcohol abuse treatment, counseling, household skill training and homeownership counseling.“These vouchers will help establish stronger communities and assist many who are working hard everyday for self sufficiency and financial independence,” concluded Foxx.###

It is important that we pay close attention to providing the best education. A strong education is paramount in helping children build a bright future.” commented Foxx.The first year that Waldo C. Falkener was tested under the NCLB the scores were low and the school had fallen short of the standards for progress. Falkener Elementary took a number of steps to improve results by using federal funding to pay for new laboratories, teacher collaboration, research and professional development as well as tougher accountability measures. They increased their focus on results and implemented a “Saturday Academy” for students in need of extra assistance. Through these efforts Falkener Elementary has met NCLB standards for three years in a row, exemplifying the progress and the success of the program.“I fully support the President’s statement that state and local government should be in control of education policies and that the federal government’s limited responsibility lies in providing incentives and accountability. As a member of the Education and Workforce Committee, I look forward to continue working with President Bush on strong education initiatives and focusing on the goals of the No Child Left Behind Act,” Foxx concluded. ###

This critical legislation establishes military tribunals where terrorists will be prosecuted fairly and effectively without compromising intelligence information that terrorists could use to harm our troops or citizens.“This is one more piece of the equation to success in the war on terror. Our military and intelligence community must be given all the tools necessary to obtain critical information from terrorists that will help save lives and prevent future terrorist attacks,” stated Foxx. “This new law clarifies the parameters in which a detainee can be held and interrogated while at the same time providing for the effective prosecution of these enemy combatants. This law further demonstrates our resolve in bringing the terrorists to justice and succeeding in the war on terror.” Foxx continued.It is abundantly clear that while Democrats continue to attack every effort Republicans make in the war on terror, they have no tangible plan to protect our nation from the most notorious terrorists and their murderous agenda. Democrats have consistently voted against missile defense, intelligence gathering, and terrorist surveillance, and by voting against this bill, they have attempted to grant known al Qaida terrorists such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammad and Ramzi bin al Shib the same protections American citizens enjoy under our Constitution. “It is disappointing that 162 Democrats chose not to protect our military and intelligence community in this way. Republicans are leading the way in defending this nation and are resolved to succeed in the war on terror,” concluded Foxx.###

This act shows the North Korean regime’s indifference to U.N. sanctions already in place before October 9th in addition to its desire to threaten peace and stability throughout the world. After the confirmation of a nuclear test, Congresswoman Foxx, (NC-05) issued the following statement:“The North Korean regime has once again proved it is a hostile and brutal regime bent on the acquisition on nuclear weapons. This nuclear test is an unacceptable threat and the world community has stood in solidarity against this,” stated Foxx.North Korea is a totalitarian regime know for its egregious actions in violating human rights and suppressing freedom of speech and religious freedom for its people. On October 14, 2006, the U.N. adopted a unanimous resolution condemning the actions of North Korea and imposed additional sanctions against North Korea. Of the many provisions of the U.N. resolution, the world community called upon the abandonment of its nuclear weapons program and further testing of ballistic missiles, as well as further sanctions to prevent the import or export of military and luxury goods to North Korea. In response to the unanimous vote, North Korea claimed this was a “delectation of war” demonstrating its defiance to the world community and further isolating itself from the world.“North Korea’s largest export is fissile technology, and the prospects of it selling nuclear weapons to rogue nations and terrorists are far too real and must be stopped. I stand behind the President and the world community in their actions to neutralize this threat and make our world safer,” Foxx concluded.###

Congresswoman Foxx also hailed the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ announcement that 51,000 jobs were created in September, marking the 37th straight month of job gains, and 19 consecutive quarters of economic growth.“This is fantastic news and proof that Republican policies of pro-growth, pro-small business and tax cuts are facilitating economic expansion,” stated Foxx. The Administration announced that the current FY’06 deficit is $248 billion, which is $71 billion less than the FY’05 deficit. The FY’04 deficit was $521 billion and while the Administration pledged to cut that deficit in half by 2009, this was accomplished three years ahead of schedule.The Bureau of Labor Statistics also announced encouraging news of a lower unemployment rate at 4.6 percent; lower than the average of the last four decades. In addition, wages rose 0.2 percent in September adding to a total increase of 4 percent over the last 12 months. The GDP also grew 2.6 percent in the second quarter of 2006.“With falling gas prices, a robust economy, and an ever expanding job market, it is clear that Republican initiatives have been successful. While Democrats charge the only way to reduce the deficit is to raise taxes, the Republican tax cuts prove that tax relief creates vibrant economic and revenue growth, thus shrinking the deficit,” added Foxx. Encouraged by the positive economic news and clear evidence that Republican economic policies are working, Foxx concluded, “I look forward to continuing my work in Congress to help grow the economy and ensure the prosperity of our nation.”###

Upon receiving the reward, Congresswoman Foxx stated:“It is an honor to receive such an important and prestigious award. I have always believed that the American people know how to spend their money better than the federal government, and I am pleased that my efforts in Congress have made a difference. “Since coming to Congress, I have continued to support the President’s tax cuts, and one thing is clear – they have bolstered our economy. Home ownership is up, the economy is steadily growing and the unemployment rate is at 4.7 percent, the lowest its have been over the last three decades. It is imperative that the federal government is fiscally responsible and ensure that we pursue a policy of tax cuts, including permanently ending the ‘death tax.’ Tax increases hurt American families, small businesses and the entire economy by taking hard earned dollars away from the American people. Again, I am thrilled to be a recipient of such a prestigious honor and pledge to continue my work in Congress to fight for tax cuts and fiscal responsibility,” Congresswoman Foxx summarized.###

Upon passage of the bills, Congresswoman Foxx released the following statement:“I am pleased to see that the House has taken the critical step in giving the President and our intelligence community the vital tools they need to triumph in the war on terror. Since 9/11 our nation has apprehended hundreds of terrorists and we needed to establish a system to prosecute them. That is exactly what the Military Commissions Act does,” commented Foxx. H.R. 6155 establishes military tribunals which will provide the basic rights of legal counsel, the right to obtain evidence and witnesses and the right to appeal a guilty verdict. At the same time it still protects classified information from disclosure to the terrorists on trial. In addition this act codifies Article 3 of the Geneva Convention to clarify vague provisions regarding interrogation of enemy combatants; ensuring American personnel are not subject to prosecution without just cause.Foxx added, “It was crucial to update our foreign intelligence surveillance laws to fit the needs of the 21st Century.” H.R. 5825 will make it easier to monitor terrorist communications and prevent future attacks, while at the same time protecting Americans’ civil liberties. By modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, Congress is assuring that every tool and option is available to gather intelligence from terrorists, as well as streamlining and speeding up the process of obtaining a FISA warrant. “The action taken by Congress this week will provide our intelligence community the authority needed to safeguard our troops and our homeland,” Foxx concluded.###

This research has real-world implications for our men and women in uniform facing great risks and all too often lose limbs or organs during combat. His discoveries are truly amazing and I am privileged to have aided his important work. This bill also allocates resources to the soldiers, ensuring they have all the proper tools and equipment they need, in addition to a well deserved pay raise,” stated Congresswoman Foxx.The Department of Defense Appropriations bill provides the funding for our troops who are protecting our nation and fighting the global war on terror.

After the House passed these crucial pieces of legislation, Congresswoman Foxx elaborated on her support, stating:“It is high time that Congress recognizes our nation’s Judeo- Christian values and acts to protect the freedom of public expression of religion as given by the First Amendment of our Constitution. It is far too common for one individual to be ‘offended’ by some religious symbol or speech. H.R. 2679 will not only show support for the freedom of religious expression but will also ensure that each party in an Establishment Clause lawsuit shoulders its own court cost which enables our states and localities to have equal footing. As Ronald Reagan said, ‘if we ever forget that we’re one nation under God, then we will be a nation gone under.’ We must protect the freedom of religion as an important part of our nation’s rich heritage, and a cornerstone on which this nation was founded. H.R. 2679 is a good start.”Congresswoman Foxx continued, “We must protect the safety of our nation’s children. As a member of the Pro-Life caucus and as a mother and a grandmother, I am thankful that the House and Senate have worked together on this strong bill that makes it a federal offense to transport a minor across state lines for an abortion in order to dodge the parental notification requirements in the minor’s home state. In addition, strong provisions are included to punish those who manipulate and abuse young, vulnerable pregnant girls. We must uphold the rights of parents and the laws of our states especially when it comes to the safety of minors. I strongly urge the Senate to act swiftly and pass this essential legislation.“Life begins at conception and this is a strong step in the right direction to protecting not only our children, but the sanctity of life, a sacred gift from God. I am pleased with the Republican leadership and their stewardship of these bills. I look forward to working on similar legislation in the future.”###

These bills expedite removal of alien criminals, empower state and local law officers to help enforcement of our immigration laws, and increase the penalties for constructing and financing tunnels across our borders. Upon passage of these three bills, Congresswoman Foxx released the following statement:“As a tireless advocate for securing our borders now and further protecting our citizens, I am pleased to see the House of Representatives acting on the issues most important to Americans and to the safety of our nation. These three bills will help secure our borders through a multi faceted approach and, when combined, will make it increasingly difficult to cross the border illegally as well as increase penalties on illegal aliens who commit crimes in addition to illegally entering our country.Upon enactment, these three bills will have a timely and direct impact on securing our borders and securing our nation. Time and again, I have reiterated the most important role of the federal government is to defend our nation, and through the passage of these bills, Republicans in the House of Representatives are taking important steps to fulfill that vital role.”THE THREE BILLS PASSED TODAY:1. H.R. 6094, The Community Protection Act of 2006· Allows the detainment time to be extended for dangerous aliens, who are dangerous to the community or are threats to national security. · Provides for the expedited removal of criminal aliens (those who have criminal records.) · Detaining and deporting alien gang members. This toughens the laws pertaining to aliens proven to be involved with criminal gangs and prevents future asylum or temporary protected status. 2. H.R. 6095, the Immigration Law Enforcement Act of 2006· Reaffirms the authority of state and local law enforcement to investigate, identify, apprehend, arrest, detain, or transfer to Federal custody.· Authorizes an increase in the number of attorneys to prosecute alien smuggling cases, and expresses Congress’ sense that the Attorney General should establish uniform guidelines for the prosecution of alien smugglers.· Ends the “Catch & Release” policy for illegal aliens apprehended along our borders and replaces it with a “Catch & Return” policy.3. H.R. 4830, the Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 2006· Criminalizes the construction and financing of border tunnels. · Increases criminal penalties of up to 20 years imprisonment for individuals who construct or finance a tunnel across a U.S. international border. ###

This exemplifies the enormous financial contribution of nurseries and farms, especially since many farms supplement their incomes during the off season as Christmas tree growers. While all 50 states grow Christmas trees, it is a major part of the North Carolina economy, especially within the 5th district.As the Christmas season draws near and many Americans come together and celebrate the holiday with family and friends, I want to pay tribute to the Christmas tree industry which is a vital part of our economy, in addition to its important role in preserving cherished traditions of many American families.” Congresswoman Foxx concluded.###

Res. 1000, providing for earmark reform in the House of Representatives. This resolution passed by 245-171 and will ensure greater accountability and transparency in the expenditure of federal dollars. Upon passage of the resolution, Congresswoman Foxx released the following statement:“H. Res. 1000 represents the latest in a continuation of my efforts to highlight accountability and protect taxpayer dollars from waste and abuse. By requiring the full disclosure of earmarks on funding, authorization, and revenue legislation, Members and the public will be able to easily identify projects which otherwise may be inappropriately hidden from adequate scrutiny in a timely manner.During my first term in Congress, I have vigorously engaged on the issue of ethics reform and fiscal responsibility. I will continue to make every effort to protect taxpayer dollars from abuse and ensure that the federal government is held accountable for the tax generated revenue it spends.This resolution, to put it simply, requires transparency when a House Member requests funding for a local or state project, thereby helping to ensure federal dollars are spent wisely and to ensure more accountability in the earmark process. While I will continue to fight for fiscal responsibility and against wasteful government spending, I believe this measure is a step in the right direction, and I will continue to support efforts such as these in the future.”###

Border fences have a proven success rate in drastically reducing the number of illegal alien apprehensions. For example, the fence along the San Diego/Mexico border mandated by Congress in 1996, helped decrease from 200,000 illegal apprehensions in 1992 to 9,000 in 2005. Congresswoman Foxx, a relentless advocate for border security has a strong record in securing our borders and fighting against illegal immigration, as she cosponsored and pushed for House passage of H.R. 418, the Real ID Act and H.R. 4437, The Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act. Upon passage of The Secure Fence Act today, Congresswoman Foxx issued the following statement:“I have long been committed to stopping the flow of illegal immigration and securing our porous borders. Today the House of Representatives passed a bill that will help secure the border and stem the unrelenting flow of illegal aliens into this country. My constituents have made it clear to me they want our borders secure, our laws enforced and the flow of illegal immigration stopped immediately. The recent 22 immigration field hearings held across the country during the month of August yielded the same mandate from the American people, secure the borders now. The amnesty provisions contained in the Senate-passed immigration reform measure earlier this year would encourage future illegal immigration and reward those who have violated America’s laws with a quick and easy path to citizenship. There is more to be done in dealing with illegal immigration, but securing the borders must be the first step. America cannot afford to wait any longer and I will continue to push to secure our borders now,” stated Congresswoman Foxx.The Secure Fence Act authorizes 700 miles of two-layered reinforced fencing, mandating the Department of Homeland Security to achieve and maintain operation control over the entire border through various methods such as ground sensors, cameras and surveillance technology. It also requires the Department of Homeland Security to provide necessary authority to border patrol agents to disable fleeing vehicles, similar to the authority granted to the U.S Coast Guard.Congresswoman Foxx explained that, “the provisions in this bill will address our country’s vulnerability and strengthen our operational controls along our borders. These provisions not only detail a physical barrier but also call for more systematic surveillance through more personnel and state-of-the-art technology. When enacted, this bill will dramatically reduce illegal immigration and make us safer.”###

While these attacks were intended to spread fear and cripple our nation, they had the reverse effect and only strengthened our nation with a determination to eradicate terrorism and the murderous ideology of a warped version of Islam these terrorists follow.To the families and friends of those who fell on September 11th, America remains united in ensuring your sacrifices and those of your loved ones, were not made in vain. This resolution also exemplifies the determination of our government to stand strong and continue the fight against terrorism. As President Bush said, ‘we will not tire; we will not falter; and we will not fail,’ this Congress will continue to bring the battle to the terrorists, so we will never again see our homeland under attack, and we will always defend the principles of freedom, democracy and the rule of law.”###

We mourn the loss of the thousands of innocent Americans who died that day and grieve with those who still ache for their loved ones. We will never forget the police officers, firefighters and rescue workers, heroes who courageously ran into the burning buildings to rescue those trapped inside, and the brave passengers on Flight 93 who laid down their lives to save others,” commented Foxx.As we continue to remember and mourn our fellow Americas who were killed on September 11, 2001, let us recommit ourselves to rooting out terror, wherever it may lie. We must remain eternally vigilant. As Ronald Reagan once said, ‘Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.’And we affirm once again our unshakeable resolve, that as long as terrorism threatens the life of even one innocent American we will fight against this evil,” Congresswoman Foxx concluded.###

We need a thorough investigation of the actions of the Justice Department,” stated Congresswoman Foxx“These agents act as our first line of defense at our border. Not only do they prevent drug smuggling and human trafficking, but they also prevent entry of countless illegal aliens, including potential terrorists. We do not want to discourage border patrol agents against performing their duties in an appropriate manner. We must make every effort to ensure that these agents are treated with the highest level of respect, as they put their lives on the line every day to protect America’s sovereignty and her citizens,” concluded Congresswoman Foxx.###

The hearing was scheduled to investigate and explore the legislative options before Congress in combating illegal immigration and the burden it places on American citizens.“Illegal immigration is having a tremendous negative impact on our state and local governments,” said Foxx. “The first step in immigration reform must be securing our borders, but we must also streamline the processes for deporting illegal aliens who commit crimes. Federal staff is inadequate to do all that it is tasked to do, and that is why we must empower local, state and federal officials to do their jobs more effectively.” Foxx added. Foxx proposed two new solutions at the hearing: 1) to evaluate the current effectiveness of the 287(g) program in order to streamline deportation of illegals; and 2) to develop a program that would allow community colleges to offer the 287(g) program to their students. “In less than three weeks, our nation will remember the fifth anniversary of 9/11, the most horrendous terrorist attack in our nation’s history. This hearing has helped us fulfill our responsibility to listen and become informed on how to shape the policies which can defend American sovereignty, the rule of law and prevent any future attacks on our homeland.” Foxx concluded.Note: The 287(g) cross-designation program allows the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency personnel to train local law enforcement officials on immigration law, civil rights, intercultural relations, and other legalities. With certification from this program, local law enforcement can enforce certain immigration laws, under ICE supervision. ###

Virginia Foxx (NC-5) voted to uphold President Bush’s first veto since he took office in 2001. The bill would have created incentives for the destruction of human life through embryonic stem cell research. Rep. Foxx hailed the House’s upholding of the veto when it failed to receive the necessary two-thirds majority this evening (235 voting “yea” and 193 voting “nay”).“I am proud of the President for making this decisive statement against using embryonic stem cells for scientific research and am proud to support his veto,” said Congresswoman Foxx. “As stewards of hard-working Americans’ tax dollars, we cannot ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos. It is imperative that we do all we can to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, the unborn. Embryonic stem cells have been available for research for nearly five years and during that time government and private research on those stem cells has produced nothing and cured no one. In the meantime, ethical bio-medical treatment not derived from embryos, like that at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in my district, has helped cure over 70 diseases and counting.”The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005, initiated in the House, passed the Senate by a vote of 63-37 and was sent to the President’s desk earlier today. He swiftly vetoed the legislation and sent it back to the House for Representatives for this evening’s vote to either uphold or override his veto.###

Virginia Foxx (NC-5) today voted to pass H.J. Res. 88: the Marriage Protection Amendment, which will protect traditional American values by defining marriage as a union only between one man and one woman. Foxx is an original cosponsor and outspoken proponent of the legislation that received majority support (236-187) in the House today, but did not reach the two-thirds majority required to pass. Today’s vote represents an increase of 9 votes from the last time it was considered in the House.“Constitutionally defining marriage as a union between one man and one woman has become necessary due to the recent rulings of activist judges and the erosion of family values,” Foxx remarked. “The Marriage Protection Amendment removes the definition of marriage from the hands of unelected judges and protects the sanctity of marriage as a sacred tradition. I am a proud original cosponsor of this legislation which would reinforce the family values that are the backbone of our great society.”According to the Joint Resolution, the Constitutional Amendment would read: “Marriage in the United States shall consist only of the union of a man and a woman. Neither this Constitution, nor the constitution of any State, shall be construed to require that marriage or the legal incidents thereof be conferred upon any union other than the union of a man and a woman.” If enacted, the Constitutional Amendment would effectively ban homosexual and polygamist marriages.“Marriage is an extremely important institution and I will do everything in my power to protect it and to continue to promote the important family values that my constituents revere,” Foxx concluded. ###
07.18.2006	U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx (NC-5) voted for two bills this evening: the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act (S. 3504) and the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Act (S. 2754). The Fetus Farming Prohibition Act bans the use of human fetal tissue from an aborted baby if the pregnancy was initiated to provide such tissue. The bill passed the House by a vote of 425-0.“I was proud to support this bill which will ban the despicable practice of growing human embryos for the purpose of harvesting them for their cells, tissue or organs,” Foxx commented.In addition, Foxx supported the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Act. The purpose of this bill is to promote research to find ways to produce pluripotent, “embryo-like”, stem cells. These cells, which may be used in place of cells harvested from actual embryos for scientific research purposes, can be found in muscle, blood, and bone marrow cells, among other places. Such research has consistently proven beneficial, is already helping to treat and cure diseases and is completely ethical. The bill was brought up under suspension of the rules and received a majority of votes (273-154), but failed to receive the two-thirds present majority necessary for a bill to be passed under suspension. The bill can be brought up again under regular order needing only a simple majority to pass.“It is my hope that in the near future, research using pluripotent stem cells will develop to the point where the use of human embryos is no longer sought. In addition to not harming or destroying innocent life, the use of pluripotent stem cells has the potential to cure more diseases and save more lives than embryonic stem cells,” Foxx said. “It was my pleasure to vote for a bill that will both protect human life and lead to scientific breakthroughs in the medical field. It is my extreme displeasure that some Democrats played politics with this bill, forcing a second vote on this straightforward, outstanding legislation,” Foxx concluded.Both of these bills received support from pro-life groups such as National Right to Life and the US Council of Catholic Bishops.In a related development, the Senate passed H.R. 810, a bill providing for embryonic stem cell research. Having passed both chambers, the bill is expected to be vetoed by President Bush tomorrow and returned to the House for a vote to override the Presidential veto as early as tomorrow evening. Congresswoman Foxx had been a consistent outspoken opponent of the legislation that allows for the destruction of human life.###

Foxx commented. “The Pledge reminds all Americans of the liberties we enjoy. It is an expression of support and appreciation for the rights and freedoms we cherish as Americans.”The Pledge Protection Act, H.R. 2389, gives Congress the power to limit the jurisdiction of Federal courts in cases concerning the Pledge of Allegiance. The Pledge, originally penned in 1892 by Francis Bellamy, is one of our nation’s most enduring symbols of liberty, justice, and the principles upon which America was founded. “We truly are one nation under God.” Foxx added. “I am thankful that God has bestowed His blessings on America and hope He continues to do so.”###

This bill cuts off funding for online gambling sites, increases criminal penalties for those who break the law and supports international anti-money laundering efforts.“Gambling websites are a serious threat to Americans, especially to our vulnerable children,” said Rep. Foxx. “Children of any age can easily go online and get into serious trouble on these websites. In addition, people can gamble for 24 hours a day and go into serious debt from making large bets with credit cards. Internet gambling is so easy and convenient that it often leads to addiction, bankruptcy and crime. I am pleased my colleagues and I passed this bill to help fix this serious problem.”Americans spend approximately $5.9 billion dollars each year on unregulated, offshore, online casinos. Because online gambling sites are easily accessible, many people do not realize that they are illegal. H.R. 4411 will address the problem of internet gambling by:· Applying the Wire Act (which bans the use of wire communication facilities to transfer bets or wagers) to Internet gambling;· Increasing the maximum penalty for Wire Act violations;· Cutting off Internet gambling sites’ funding by regulating payment systems;· Authorizing law enforcement to take action against those who aid Internet gambling; and· Supporting international efforts to combat illegal gambling and money laundering.H.R. 4411 is supported by a large number of organizations including the Family Research Council, the North Carolina Family Policy Council, Focus on the Family, the NCAA, the NFL, the NBA, Major League Baseball and 48 of 50 state Attorneys General.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took action today to change restrictive government policies that have stifled domestic energy production for years. She voted to pass the Deep Ocean Energy Resources (DOER) Act which will help America decrease its dependence on foreign energy sources by permitting the use of more energy sources from the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS.)"Off of America’s coastline lies one of the world’s largest oil and natural gas deposits. Yet, many years ago, our government prohibited tapping into this vast resource. As a result, families, small businesses, farmers, schools and hospitals in the Fifth District are facing skyrocketing energy costs and a greater reliance on foreign oil. That is why I am pleased we’re addressing this serious problem now,” said Rep. Foxx.Foxx noted that during this past winter, the cost of heating homes in North Carolina went up between 400 and 500 percent. Farmers and ranchers from the Fifth District saw their energy, production and supply costs increase by up to 50 percent. Others, such as brick masons, were forced to close parts of their operations because of increased costs. “I cannot stand by and watch my constituents suffer the negative effects of a volatile world energy market when part of the solution to our energy crisis lies miles off our coasts. That is why I support the DOER Act, which reexamines energy production in the Outer Continental Shelf and opens it up to oil and natural gas exploration."Currently, coastal states have jurisdiction over the waters that extend 3 nautical miles from their coastline. The DOER Act would give these states even more control through complete authority to permit or restrict energy production up to 100 miles away from their shores. The DOER Act would allow the Federal Government to produce energy in the deep waters beyond this 100-mile mark. This compromise will help America to develop the resources it needs to lower energy prices and create many jobs.The United States is the only nation in the world that has prohibited access to a substantial amount of its oil and natural gas resources. As a result, our country depends on foreign sources for more than 60 percent of our supply, which has resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of American jobs and higher energy prices. By producing more its own energy resources, the United States will lower consumer prices.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) demonstrated her ongoing commitment to fiscal restraint by voting to pass the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006. This bill gives the President increased authority to propose the removal of unnecessary or wasteful spending items from federal spending bills. “I am pleased that we passed legislation to help eliminate waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government,” said Rep. Foxx. “This bill is important because it will increase accountability and transparency within our budgeting process.”Currently, some Members of Congress slip unrelated spending projects into large spending bills. The Line Item Veto will allow the President to help weed out projects that do not belong in those bills and allow Congress to review and approve the President’s recommendations.“Many bills before Congress are mostly good, but contain some bad provisions. This legislation allows the bad parts to be stricken from otherwise good legislation without throwing the whole bill away,” said Rep. Foxx.The Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006:Gives the President 45 days to strike wasteful spending from bills ready to sign into law; Requires Congress to approve or disapprove of the President’s changes by requiring an up-or-down vote. This will allow Members of Congress who make worthwhile spending requests to defend them to their colleagues; Helps address the problem of unnecessary spending on federal programs that are automatically set to receive funding; and Directs the cancelled funds to be used toward deficit reduction.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted for permanent Death Tax relief for thousands of American families, small businesses and family farms. The House passed H.R. 5638, the Permanent Estate Tax Relief Act of 2006, in a 269 to 156 vote.“The Death Tax is an unreasonable burden on countless Americans,” said Rep. Foxx. “It is simply unfair for the federal government to capitalize on the passing of loved ones – especially when their assets were already taxed before their passing. Today’s bill will protect the vast majority of Americans from paying any of the Death Tax.”H.R. 5638 would:Increase the exemption amount to $5 million per person effective January 1, 2010 Reduce the tax rate on estates up to $25 million to the capital gains tax rate (currently 15 percent, set to increase in 2011 unless extended) Reduce the tax rate on estates of $25 million or more to twice the capital gains rate (currently 30 percent, set to increase to 40 percent in 2011 unless extended)“I have called for and supported the permanent elimination of the Death Tax for all those affected,” said Rep. Foxx. “This bill is a good compromise that will provide much-needed relief for those that deserve and need it. “The Death Tax is a major threat to the vitality of family-owned businesses and farms because most of their owners have the entire value of their business or farm in their estate. The federal government currently receives nearly half of an estate when the owner passes. As a result, more than two-thirds of family businesses do not survive the second generation and nearly 90 percent do not make it to the third generation. “Rather than encouraging people to build their own livelihoods, the Death Tax discourages hard work and savings. Today, the House did the right thing by voting for permanent relief,” said Foxx.Last year, Rep. Foxx voted to permanently repeal the Death Tax, but the U.S. Senate failed to get enough votes to take up the bill.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) is pleased to announce that she has secured $3.4 million for research and development at NanoTechLabs in Yadkin County. This funding will be used to develop nanotechnology-based defense products to keep our military safe. “I am delighted that these vital funds I have been fighting for were included in the Defense appropriations bill,” said Rep. Foxx. “Once NanoTechLabs completes its research, the military will likely want to develop more of their products. This has the potential of bringing dozens of new jobs to Yadkin County.”“The funding secured by Rep. Foxx will have a significant economic impact for Yadkin County and create ‘high tech, high skilled’ jobs that are critically needed in Northwestern North Carolina,” said Bobby Todd, Executive Director of the Yadkin County Chamber of Commerce. “Many of these jobs will require advanced degrees that will pay well above average wage in the county.”The $3.4 million will be used primarily to develop a new class of military aircraft sealants for Stealth fighter jets. While these fighters are constructed to resist radar detection, their binding materials typically do not. NanoTechLabs will use the funding to develop sealants that conduct electricity and resist radar detection. “This is a win-win situation. Not only is this research important for boosting our local economy’s growth, it will help keep our brave men and women in uniform safe,” said Rep. Foxx.NanoTechLabs (NTL) is a veteran owned, high-growth nanomaterials company that develops and commercializes custom and specialty materials to solve urgent defense needs. NTL’s 8,000 square foot manufacturing facility is located in the JF Industrial Park in Yadkinville, N.C. ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) is pleased to announce that she has secured $2 million for the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University. The funding was included in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for FY 2007, which passed the House tonight. “I am delighted that these vital funds were included in this bill,” said Rep. Foxx. “The research being done at Wake Forest has real-world implications for our men and women in uniform who face great risks and all too often lose limbs or organs during combat. As medical technology improves, the opportunity to avert or minimize the permanent damage caused by these injuries may come through the development of tissue engineering treatments.” “We are very proud of our work at the Institute, but especially proud and privileged to have Congresswoman Foxx work on our behalf to have funding appropriated for our research efforts with the Department of Defense,” said Anthony Atala, M.D., Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. “This funding will enable us to advance the development of our technology and apply it to the war fighter’s needs.” The team at the Institute for Regenerative Medicine is pioneering groundbreaking research into the use of autologous tissues to treat battlefield injuries. These tissues could potentially result in saving limbs or organs, including the replacement of cartilage, muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. Autologous tissues are derived from the patient’s own cells and are capable of correcting a number of pathologies and injuries. The use of autologous cells eliminates the risks of rejection and immunological reactions and drastically reduces the time that patients must wait for lifesaving surgery. The use of autologous tissues to create functional organs is one of the most important and groundbreaking steps ever taken in medicine. “The funds included in this bill will support the continued research of an experienced team of scientists at the Regenerative Institute and will allow them to upgrade their facilities and speed up their research process,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Foxx. “Our nation is more secure today thanks to the brave men and women of our armed forces, whose dedication, patriotism and bravery are helping advance freedom and democracy around the world.”During yesterday’s debate, Rep. Foxx recalled a soldier from Statesville, N.C. who came to visit her following his release from Walter Reed Army Medical Center. “Sgt. Dale Beatty was severely injured while fighting the Global War on Terror and he lost both of his legs. Yet, he is not angry. In fact, his resolve is even stronger today,” said Foxx. “He knows that he made a great sacrifice for a noble cause. Sgt. Beatty told me he’d gladly go back to the Middle East to fight alongside his comrades if he could… His morale and the morale of all the troops I have spoken with demonstrate that we are doing the right thing.”H.Res. 861 states, among other things, that: ·“It is essential to the security of the American people and to world security that the United States, together with its allies, take the battle to the terrorists and to those who provide them assistance.”·“The steadfast resolve of the United States and its partners since September 11, 2001, helped persuade the government of Libya to surrender its weapons of mass destruction.”·“It is not in the national security interest of the United States to set an arbitrary date for the withdrawal or redeployment of United States Armed Forces from Iraq.”###

Just last night, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the mastermind behind countless brutal acts of terror, was killed in an air strike. Al-Zarqawi was directly responsible for thousands of bombings, assassinations, kidnappings and other acts of terror in Iraq and around the globe. Thanks to the hard work and perseverance of our United States military and intelligence forces, he will no longer be able to kill again. This is a major victory in the War on Terror and a major setback to Al Qaeda, as al-Zarqawi was one of its strongest leaders. “This is also a major victory for the U.S. intelligence community. Today’s news is concrete evidence that the Iraqi people are cooperating with our military. This demonstrates their support of our efforts in the War on Terror and their desire to be free.“Yet, as President Bush said, we cannot expect the terrorists to give up just because one of their most visible leaders is gone. We must continue to prosecute this War on Terror until our mission is accomplished and until Iraq can defend and govern itself fully. The terrorists can hide, but they cannot hide forever.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took yet another step toward reducing America’s dependence on foreign oil and helping alleviate the high price at the pump by voting for H.R. 5254, the Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act. Despite the nation’s increasing demand for fuel, the United States has not built an oil refinery in over 30 years. Total capacity of current refineries is roughly 17 million barrels per day while demand is nearly 21 million barrels per day. “We cannot continue the trend of using more refined petroleum products than we can produce,” said Foxx. “It is vital that we move away from our dependence on foreign sources to fill this gap.”Foxx noted that our national security is threatened by a growing reliance on these foreign sources. “It is in our best interest to increase refinery capacity for gasoline, heating oil, and diesel fuel in the United States. Today’s long-overdue and environmentally sound legislation helps remove the red tape preventing the construction of new refineries,” she said. The bill will help reduce dependence on imports by:Establishing a federal coordinator to bring together all U.S. government agencies responsible for issuing permits and to help the permitting process move as quickly as possible; Bringing all federal and state agencies together in a coordinated capacity to make it easier to add fuel refining capacity;Eliminating unnecessary red tape and bureaucracy in the permitting process;Directing the President to suggest at least three closed military bases as suitable sites for new refineries.“By increasing our refinery capacity, we can increase gasoline supplies, which will help bring down the price at the pump. I will continue to support energy measures such as the Refinery Permit Process Schedule Act to help relieve the financial burden high energy prices are placing on the citizens of the 5th District.”###

It is very rare for legislation to pass both chambers of Congress and make it to the President’s desk, especially when it is introduced by a freshman. I am humbled that we have made it this far and am delighted to have helped our soldiers save for their futures.”Rep. Foxx introduced H.R. 1499 last year after being contacted by a constituent whose son spent most of 2004 in Iraq. The father, from Clemmons, N.C., was frustrated because his son did not earn enough taxable income to take full advantage of Individual Retirement Accounts. According to the current tax code, combat “hazard pay” is not considered taxable income. This is an important benefit for members of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to protect our freedom. Unfortunately, at the same time, it penalizes our heroes when it comes to contributions to their IRAs. “If anyone has earned the opportunity to save for their retirement, it is our military heroes who risk their lives daily to protect our freedoms,” said Rep. Foxx. “Our men and women in uniform should not be excluded from saving for their retirement because of a glitch in our tax code.”“I want to thank Rep. Foxx for not only listening to a problem that many men and women in uniform face, but moving so quickly to introduce a bill to fix it,” said Spc. Michael Hensley. “On behalf of all soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, I thank Virginia Foxx for fighting on our behalf in the United States Congress.”The H.E.R.O.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took further action to help alleviate the high prices at the pump by voting to pass H.R. 5429, The American-Made Energy and Good Jobs Act. This bill will help the United States reduce its dependence on foreign oil sources by authorizing oil and gas exploration in Alaska’s Artic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). “I am very sensitive to the fact that my constituents are burdened by the high gas prices and am doing everything I can to offer them some relief,” said Rep. Foxx. “Today’s bill will increase our domestic oil supplies in an environmentally sound fashion while at the same time creating over a million new jobs. With the political uncertainty in traditional oil producing nations, we cannot continue to depend on foreign sources for our energy needs. While we are waiting on home-grown renewable and reusable fuels to become economically viable, we must also increase our domestic oil supplies.”ANWR could be the single largest conventional energy resource in the United States. It is estimated that 10.4 billion barrels of oil are in the area -- more than double the reserves of Texas. Energy development in ANWR will deliver 1.5 million barrels of oil per day (roughly equivalent to what we import from Saudi Arabia) and could supply 58 years worth of oil to North Carolina alone.Energy exploration in ANWR will be limited to just 2,000 out of 20 million acres and it will take place under the most stringent environmental protection requirements. The amount of land open to exploration is minimal. “If ANWR were the size of a tennis court, the land affected would be the size of a dollar bill,” said Foxx, who visited oil drilling operations in Alaska last year.###

The funding was included in the FY 2007 Department of the Interior appropriations bill which passed the House last week.“I am delighted that these vital funds I have been fighting for were included in this bill,” said Rep. Foxx. “Not only will these funds address current wastewater management needs, they will serve as the foundation for improved future benefits. The funds secured will allow consolidation of wastewater treatment facilities serving the towns of Elkin, Jonesville and Ronda, North Carolina.”The consolidation of the wastewater treatment facilities serving these towns will be the catalyst for the Yadkin Valley Sewer Authority, which will administer the collection, treatment, and administration of wastewater services among the three towns. Currently, the towns operate separate treatment plants in close proximity to each other along the Yadkin River. By consolidating, the towns can address future wastewater issues head on and avoid potential inflow and transmission backups. ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) helped farmers and ranchers in Northwest North Carolina by voting to pass H.R. 5384, the annual Agriculture appropriations bill for FY 2007. “Our farmers play a vital role in our daily lives by producing food, clothes, pharmaceuticals and fuels,” said Rep. Foxx. “As someone who grew up milking a cow and raising row crops, I know firsthand what a difficult job farmers have and will support them every chance I get.”Today’s bill will support farmers and ranchers by providing much-needed funding for research into public health issues and food safety. The bill also provides:$904 million for animal and plant health inspection service activities $80 million for Avian flu/pandemic countermeasures and monitoring $1.054 billion for Farm Service Agency salaries and expenses. These funds will be used to continue delivery of farm programs $791 million for conservation operationsAdditionally, during floor consideration of the bill, Rep. Foxx opposed an amendment that would decrease the Farm Service Agency’s (FSA) computer and software upgrade accounts. “I will not support any decrease to the account while North Carolina tobacco farmers are depending on crucial software updates for buyout payments,” she said.Foxx has been disappointed with the USDA’s ability to provide local FSA agents with the software to completely carry out the tobacco buyout program and will continue working to ensure USDA has the resources needed to carry out its obligations. ###

Act to allow soldiers earning hazard pay to make IRA contributionsThe United States Senate has passed H.R. 1499, the Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (or H.E.R.O.) Act. The bill, introduced by U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5), will amend the IRS Code of 1986 to allow members of the Armed Forces earning hazard pay to make Individual Retirement Account contributions. Earlier this month, the House passed an improved version of the bill (H. Res. 803), also authored by Foxx, to allow combat pay earned in 2004 and 2005 to also be eligible for IRA contributions.“This is a huge victory for our troops fighting overseas,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am delighted that we have cleared the final legislative hurdle on this bill to greatly help our men and women in uniform save for their retirements. I am looking forward to seeing President Bush sign this into law.”Rep. Foxx introduced H.R. 1499 last year after being contacted by the father of a soldier who spent most of 2004 in Iraq. The father, from Clemmons, N.C., was frustrated because his son did not earn enough taxable income to take full advantage of Individual Retirement Accounts. According to the current tax code, combat “hazard pay” is not considered taxable income. This is an important benefit for members of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to protect our freedom. Unfortunately, at the same time, it penalizes our heroes when it comes to contributions to their IRAs. “If anyone has earned the opportunity to save for their retirement, it is our military heroes who risk their lives daily to protect our freedoms,” said Rep. Foxx. “Our men and women in uniform should not be excluded from saving for their retirements because of a glitch in our tax code.”The H.E.R.O. Act was well received in Washington, both in and out of Congress. Forty-seven Members of Congress co-sponsored the bill. In addition, the Military Officers Association of America and the Reserve Officers Association endorsed the legislation. The H.E.R.O. Act was the first policy-changing bill passed by a freshman Member of the House this session.###

The House of Representatives approved the Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act for FY 2007 by a vote of 395 to 0.“Ensuring that our troops and veterans receive first class medical care and benefits continues to be one of my highest priorities,” said Rep. Foxx. “We have a moral obligation to take care of those who have laid their lives on the line to protect our freedoms.”H.R.5385 will do the following: Provide $25 billion for Veterans Medical Services – $2.6 billion above last year’s level, representing a 70 percent increase in total funding over the last 6 years;Increase funding by $20 million for facility improvements in existing state veterans’ homes; Increase basic medical research funding by $13 million, for a total of $412 million; Add $12 million to upgrade Veterans Affairs medical research facilities nationwide; and Increase the defense health program by $1 billion, for a total of $21 billion.“Our men and women in uniform and those who served before them have done so much for our nation and I am happy that we are able to help them in return,” said Foxx.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted for the FY 2007 House Budget Resolution. This plan strengthens our nation’s most critical programs, reforms the federal government and uses tax dollars wisely.“I am pleased that we have passed a budget that will fund our top priorities, continue our pro-growth economic policies and reform federal government programs,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am especially encouraged that this budget will continue our efforts to control federal spending. I know that my constituents work very hard for their money and believe they know how to make decisions with their tax dollars much better than the federal government does.”The budget will help cut the federal deficit in half by 2009 by nearly freezing non-security indirect spending without implementing any tax increases. It will also save $6.8 billion in programs that receive automatic funding over the next five years. The plan will also help streamline the federal government, reform ineffective and outdated federal programs and provide greater accountability to the American people. “It is important that we stop funding programs that no longer serve their intended purpose or perform a vital function,” said Rep. Foxx.Finally, the budget will devote $50 billion to support our troops and strengthen our national defense.Earlier, Foxx joined her colleagues in the House Republican Study Committee (RSC) in voting for an alternative known as “Contract with America: Renewed.” Rep. Foxx and her colleagues in the RSC introduced this alternative in an effort to renew Congress’ commitment to limit the growth of federal government spending and balance the federal budget. “While I am pleased that we passed the FY 2007 House Budget Resolution, I am disappointed that more of my colleagues did not join our efforts to curb government spending, increase accountability and rein in the federal deficit even more,” said Rep. Foxx. The RSC budget would have balanced the federal budget within 5 years, paid down the national debt and maintained tax relief for American families, all at the same time. It would have stopped spending on 150 wasteful programs, reduced foreign aid by $31 billion over five years and repealed the federal gas tax in 2012.“Even though the RSC alternative did not pass, I will continue to work to find ways to get the Congress’ out-of-control spending under control,” said Rep. Foxx.###

There is nothing more important to me than the safety and security of this country. Border security is the starting point for ensuring that all Americans remain safe. “Illegal immigration is a major problem that is having a very negative impact on countless aspects of our daily lives. Immigration laws exist to provide the steps for safe and legal entry into this country -- and we must enforce them.“I support doing whatever it takes to secure our border and enforce our laws, including deploying members of our National Guard to our southern border. I also support denying government benefits to illegal aliens, making English our official language and cracking down on those who knowingly hire illegal workers. However, I do not support a guest worker program that has any amnesty component or that leads to citizenship for those who break our laws.”###

Foxx. “This critical bill goes a long way in ensuring our troops have the necessary equipment and supplies to remain one step ahead of the enemy. With so many of our family members and loved ones overseas prosecuting the War on Terror, I am honored to send this strong statement of support to our troops.”Among other things, the National Defense Authorization Act provides for:$50 billion in supplemental funding to support the War on Terror; An increase of $390 million for continued production of enhanced body armor and body armor components; Additional funding for force-protection needs, including up-armored Humvees, improvised explosive device (IED) jammers, Humvee IED protection kits and gunner protection kits; and A 2.7 percent across-the-board pay raise for members of our Armed ForcesFoxx also voted for an amendment to authorize members of the Armed Forces to assist the Department of Homeland Security (upon request) in protecting the U.S. border.Finally, today’s bill prohibits the proposed TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Standard fee increases and zeroes out co-pays for generic and formulary mail order prescriptions for military beneficiaries and veterans.“I remain committed to improving health care benefits for our Armed Forces and veterans,” said Rep. Foxx. “These folks paved the way for the freedoms we have today and they deserve our support.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took action today to prevent tax increases on working families, seniors and small businesses by voting for the conference report for H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. “I was happy to support this bill to help every American family keep more of their hard-earned money,” said Rep. Foxx. “Lower taxes and pro-growth economic policies have created millions of American jobs and have prompted 32 consecutive months of job growth. Unemployment is lower than the average of the 1960s, 70s, 80s and 90s. Our GDP is growing and consumer confidence is high. It only makes sense to extend the tax relief that helped bring about our economic growth in the first place.” The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act will do the following:Prevent a middle-class tax hike by extending alternative minimum tax relief for an additional year.Extend the increased limit on small business expensing.Extend the lower tax rate on dividend income through 2010, preventing a $13 billion tax increase over the next four years. Half of all taxpaying senior citizens will benefit, including many who live off of their dividend income.Extend the lower tax rate on capital gains income through 2010, preventing a $7 billion tax increase over the next four years. Nearly 1 in 3 senior citizens will benefit.Rep. Foxx said it is unfortunate that some of her colleagues in the minority party continue to fight against extending tax relief. “The only thing they want to do is raise taxes and spend your money. This mentality puts the family checkbook and America’s prosperity at risk,” she said.###

Foxx. “They can rest assured that I am focused on their concerns and am doing everything in my power to address this issue.”In order to offer immediate relief, Foxx has co-sponsored H.R. 3683, the Gas Tax Relief Act. If passed, this bill would temporarily suspend the 18.4 cent federal excise tax on gasoline for 30 days. Foxx also voted for the Gasoline for America’s Security Act, which will ban price gouging and increase U.S. fuel supply by encouraging new refineries while at the same time promoting conservation efforts. This bill passed the House but still needs immediate attention in the U.S. Senate.In addition, Foxx voted for the Energy Policy Act, which reduces the costs of energy, reduces our reliance on foreign oil sources, encourages the use of alternative power sources and improves our electricity transmission capability. It also provides relief to our hardworking farmers by providing tax incentives and money for research and development for ethanol and biodiesel energy sources.Foxx has repeatedly supported legislation to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil and gas exploration. She has cosponsored legislation to end the federal moratorium on the outer Continental Shelf for exploration for natural gas, which would help alleviate high home heating costs.“I will do everything I can to address rising energy prices,” said Rep.

This bill reauthorizes programs of the Higher Education Act and strengthens our country’s higher education system by expanding college access for lower and middle-income students. It also includes two provisions authored by Foxx to protect the privacy of college students and to increase accountability in TRIO grant programs.“As a former community college president as well as university administrator and instructor, I am deeply committed to our students and seeing that they receive the full value of their education. And the bottom line is this bill provides greater access for those of lesser means who wish to attain it,” said Rep. Foxx during debate yesterday. The congresswoman said in order to keep our nation on the cutting edge, we must have a highly educated workforce. She praised the bill for strengthening math, science and foreign language instruction and including incentives to recruit more and better prepare current teachers in these critical areas. Rep. Foxx said she is especially pleased that two of her provisions were included in the bill. The first would prohibit the Department of Education from creating a federal database of personal information about college students. “The privacy of the individual is one of the main tenets on which our great nation was founded. It is a fundamental protection that we hold dear, and this provision will help ensure that privacy isn’t threatened simply because a student chooses to enroll in college,” she said.Her second provision calls on TRIO grant programs to better demonstrate their effectiveness and results. “As a former director of the Upward Bound and Student Support Services Programs at Appalachian State University, I have seen firsthand how these programs have helped many of our youth achieve their goals of a higher education,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am a strong believer in the TRIO programs, and that is why I am committed to making them stronger. There is nothing in current law that provides a way for these programs to demonstrate their effectiveness. If we want to help these programs prove that they are doing all that we know they are, we must institute accountability measures so their purpose and effectiveness won’t continue to be questioned.” The College Access & Opportunity Act passed the House in a 221 to 199 vote.###

She introduced this amendment as a part of her ongoing efforts to cut unnecessary spending and increase accountability within the Federal Government.“I am sure there are many folks who can tell us the merits of international broadcasting operations like Radio Free Europe, but we should debate the merits of that another time,” said Rep. Foxx. “This war supplemental spending bill was supposed to be solely for emergency spending for the war. It should not be used as a free-for-all for non-emergency spending that should be debated in our yearly budget and appropriations process. Providing essential equipment for our troops is one thing. Increasing funding for additional international broadcasting is another. While I am open to debating the need for the additional funding, it does not belong in the emergency funding bill for the War in Iraq.”Rep. Foxx also noted that $652.4 million had already been appropriated for international broadcasting in the FY 06 Science, State, Justice, Commerce Appropriations Bill.Foxx’s amendment was defeated in an 88-333 vote. She responded by saying, “I am very disappointed that more of my colleagues did not join in my efforts to move the debate over this non-emergency spending to the appropriate time.”###

She made the following remarks:“Methamphetamine abuse is a growing problem across our country. In my home county in Northwest North Carolina, we generally have a very low crime rate. However, in recent years, we have had several methamphetamine-related homicides and robberies. This drug is wreaking havoc in our local neighborhoods and isendangering the lives of many, including ourinnocent children and ourbrave law enforcement officials. The challenge meth poses is strong, serious and immediate and so too must be our response. My colleagues and I are meeting that challenge, and with the President’s signature today, we are keeping our constituents and law enforcement officials safer.“The meth provisions in the PATRIOT Act will make it more difficult to obtain the ingredients necessary to manufacture the drug. This bill will also crack down on meth cooks, traffickers and smugglers by strengthening federal criminal penalties. “I have seen the ravages of meth first hand. Currently, there is a volunteer firefighter named Darien South from my district who is in the hospital struggling for his life. He responded to a house fire without realizing that it was a meth lab that exploded. He was just doing his job, but now he is going to suffer for the rest of his life. The people who are responsible the meth lab will only spend two years in prison. We must protect our children and law enforcement officials.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) participated in a hearing this afternoon to investigate claims of exploitation, fraud and ethical problems in Human Cloning and Embryonic Stem Cell Research. The hearing was sponsored by the Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources, of which Rep. Foxx is a member.Foxx, an ardent supporter of the right to life, has been a vocal critic of embryonic stem cell research. She has also had ongoing discussions with pastors and other constituents throughout the district who care deeply about protecting human life.“This hearing was very important because it further illustrated that embryonic stem cell research is unethical and unnecessary,” said Rep. Foxx. “We examined a case that had been touted by the national media and other interest groups as the major ‘success story’ for human cloning and stem cell research. And it turned out to be a sham.”Today’s hearing focused on a recent scandal in South Korea. In 2004, prominent scientist Woo Suk Hwang published a paper in the U.S. journal, Science, claiming to have produced the world’s first embryonic stem cell line from a cloned human embryo. One year later, Hwang published another article in Science claiming to have successfully created 11 patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines from cloned embryos.However, in November 2005, Hwang admitted that he lied about the way he obtained eggs for his research. He acknowledged that many women were paid large sums of money for their eggs, and female assistants were coerced to “donate” their eggs for the stem cell and cloning research. In addition to these problems, questions about fraud in the underlying science arose. As of mid-January, Hwang’s two groundbreaking papers were retracted by Science. The publication determined that a significant amount of data was “fabricated” and “invalid.”During the hearing, Foxx interrogated the panelists about how such fraud could occur.“Human cloning and embryonic stem cell research just do not make sense,” said Rep. Foxx. “Some of our local scientists at places like the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine have proven that adult stem cells can be used successfully to treat medical conditions – without the destruction of human life. It is time that we end the destructive practice of embryonic stem cell research.”###

02.01.2006	This afternoon, U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted to pass the conference report for the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted to pass the conference report for the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. This legislation will eliminate waste and duplication in the federal government and yield approximately $40 billion dollars in savings for American taxpayers; including $3.5 billion in savings and a “one percent across-the-board spending cut” that will save $8.5 billion.“As a fiscal conservative, I was proud to support this important legislation to provide greater accountability to the American people,” said Rep. Foxx. “The approximately $40 billion saved by this plan will go a long way towards streamlining our government and getting our finances back in order.”Last year’s natural disasters have further highlighted the need to reduce massive federal spending in government programs and to re-evaluate priorities. The Deficit Reduction Act contains a number of provisions that offset the cost of Gulf Coast disaster relief, trim the federal deficit and reform government programs including:Lowering prescription drug costs Reducing waste, fraud, and abuse Strengthening and simplifying student loan programs Rebuilding community first responder capabilities by freeing up vital spectrum airwaves Protecting workers’ pensions by placing the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation on a more solid financial foundation and protecting taxpayers from the cost of a massive bailout Restricting non-citizen access to food stamps and helping prevent illegal aliens from getting Medicaid“Like every family in Northwest North Carolina, we need to make tough budget decisions and cut back on spending. This is not easy, but it is the right thing to do,” she said.Rep. Foxx also expressed her disappointment with colleagues on the other side of the debate. “Even though members of the Minority complain about the deficit, they want to increase spending astronomically with no accountability measures in place. They have no plan to reduce the deficit. Their only answer is to raise taxes. At a time when we must be mindful of every hard-earned tax dollar we spend, the last we thing we need is more of the old ‘tax and spend’ mentality,” she said. “I am pleased we were able to win today’s victory for working families.”###

Foxx. “Our region will receive approximately $15 million over a three-year period. This funding will support education and workforce development within our region to drive economic competitiveness and increase job growth.”Ninety-seven applications were considered for the grant. The U.S. Department of Labor used the following criteria when selecting the Piedmont Triad and the other 12 regions:Demonstration of strategic partnership that is representative of the entire region and is comprised of a strong team of regional leaders Presence of impacted economic elements in the region and description of the economic and labor market conditions that are driving the need for transformation Demonstration of how the region will undergo transformation through the implementation of new efforts designed to drive integration among workforce, economic development and education systems Innovation in addressing challenges and utilizing and building upon existing structures, resources and legislatively funded programs.“Our region is in a critical transition point and I will continue to do everything I can to bring higher skilled jobs to this part of the state,” said Rep. Foxx. “We are evolving from a manufacturing economy into a high-skilled ‘hot spot.’ This WIRED grant will go a long way in promoting economic development, education and entrepreneurship within the Piedmont Triad.” ###

I know that she was an outstanding representative for the Fifth District and North Carolina.” Dick currently serves as the Director of the Yadkin County Elder Affairs Department. She is a member of the North Carolina Senior Tar Heel Legislature Executive Board where she served two terms as Speaker, Speaker Pro-Tempore of the National Silver Haired Congress House of Representatives, a member of the North Carolina Governor’s Aging Advisory Council, the Region I Area Chair of the Agency on Aging Advisory Board, Co-founder and Vice-President of the Yadkin County Volunteer Medical Ministry Executive Board and Chair of the Yadkin County Aging Planning Board.

Foxx. “Many have declared war on Christmas and have vowed to do away with any reference to the sacred day.”Foxx noted that several stores have banned the phrase ‘Merry Christmas’ and some schools have prohibited students from singing Christmas carols. “Things are getting so out-of-hand that even the secular symbols of Christmas – such as candy canes and Santa Claus – are now on the endangered species list. Ninety-six percent of all Americans celebrate Christmas. It is time we set aside ‘political correctness’ and allow people to celebrate Christmas instead of some made-up commercial holiday.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) helped lead the national movement to stop illegal immigration by co-sponsoring and voting for H.R. 4437, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. The bill strengthens American borders, cracks down on those who hire illegal aliens, increases the punishment for those who smuggle people into our country illegally and expedites the swift deportation of illegal aliens. Rep. Foxx was one of just three original co-sponsors to join House Judiciary Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner in introducing this legislation. “We cannot have a secure nation without secure borders,” said Rep. Foxx. “Every day that we fail to secure our borders is another day when a hardened criminal or even a terrorist might slip through the cracks. Illegal aliens must be caught and removed – not simply caught and released, and those who knowingly employ illegal aliens must be held accountable and face stiff consequences. Our nation's security is at risk and nothing else is more important.”H.R. 4437 includes key provisions that:Institute employment eligibility verification systems that will check Social Security numbers and alien identification numbers against Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security databases to ensure that potential employees are legal citizens. Increase civil and criminal penalties for knowingly hiring or employing an illegal worker. Empower local sheriffs in the 29 counties along the southern border to enforce immigration laws and collaborate with Federal law enforcement. Stiffen penalties for illegal alien smuggling, including mandatory minimum sentences. Increase DHS authority for long term detention and for strengthened removal process. Establish tougher penalties for illegal aliens who re-enter the United States after being deported. Rep. Foxx also introduced her own immigration reform bill today, HR 4580, dubbed the STOP L.O.A.N. Act (STOP Loans Offered to illegal Aliens Now Act) to prohibit federal agencies from approving loans to illegal aliens. Her bill would require that name, date of birth, and Social Security number be checked to ensure that loan applicants are lawfully present in the U.S. “An important step to securing our borders is to deny government services to illegal aliens,” said Rep. Foxx. “If we are going to require private employers to verify the legal status of employees, it only makes sense that we hold the government to the same standard.” Rep. Foxx was motivated to introduce her bill after learning that illegal aliens like Gilberto Cruz Hernandez, who is accused of eight rapes in the Piedmont Triad, have easily obtained federal loans. Hernandez received a $123,000 Federal Housing Administration loan that allowed him buy a new home in Winston-Salem despite the fact that he had been deported back to Mexico by the U.S. Border Patrol 16 months earlier.“What has happened with Mr. Hernandez shows how easy it is for illegal aliens to take many of the privileges of an American citizen even when the authorities have previously determined they are here illegally,” said Rep. Foxx. “This case is further illustration of why we need to crack down on illegal immigration.”The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that over 300,000 illegal aliens live in North Carolina. “These individuals are breaking the law and their behavior should not be tolerated or rewarded. America is a beacon of freedom and opportunity for the world, but while we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. Only those who are in this country legally should receive these benefits,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted to pass H.R. 2830, the Pension Protection Act of 2005. The bill will protect and secure pensions of current workers and retirees and will help place the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation on sure footing so a costly bailout by all taxpayers can be avoided.“Far too often we’ve seen hard-working Americans contribute money into a pension plan only to find their benefits dwindle or depleted entirely,” said Rep. Foxx. “We must find ways to ensure that employers act in good faith to keep their promises to their retiring workers and I believe we have done so in this bill.”The Pension Protection Act will:Ensure employers properly and adequately fund their worker pension plans; End excessive compensation for executives if an employer plan is severely under funded; Protect taxpayers from costly bailouts of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; Require companies to provide more information to workers about the status of their pension plans“The two most important parts of the Pension Protection Act are provisions to require more accountability and provisions that ensure fiscal responsibility,” said Rep. Foxx. “This bill strengthens current law and requires more accountability on the part of employers in funding their workers’ benefit plans. It requires employers to put more cash contributions into worker pension plans. It closes loopholes allowing under funded plans to skip pension payments. And it calls for more transparency about the status of workers’ pension plans. How could anyone oppose instilling more accountability in the pension system?”The Pension Protection Act is supported by a broad coalition of labor unions and employers like the United Auto Workers, the Brotherhood of Carpenters, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Financial Services Roundtable. ###

This will protect the citizens of the Fifth District from artificially inflated costs associated with heating their homes.“With the onset of winter already upon us, Northwest North Carolinians are bracing for the high cost of keeping their homes warm,” said Rep. Foxx. “Although supply and demand has driven natural gas prices up, there is a growing concern of artificially inflated natural gas prices on our commodities markets as well. That is why I supported Chairman Bob Goodlatte’s amendment to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reauthorization.” The amendment directs the CFTC to investigate market manipulation during price spikes and gives them the authority to obtain trading data when it suspects manipulation may have occurred. The amendment also increases the penalties for manipulation. “I am pleased this amendment passed,” said Rep. Foxx. “With high natural gas prices, I will do everything I can to keep the cost low for Fifth District families and farmers.”###

The President and I are committed to continuing the positive economic climate by working to make tax relief permanent and exercising spending restraint,” said Rep. Foxx. “I was pleased to support this bill which will help every American family keep more of their hard-earned money.”Key provisions in the Tax Relief Extension Reconciliation Act include:Preventing a tax increase on all Americans by extending economic policies that are proven to stimulate economic growth.Extending the reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income through 2010. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, over 60 percent of Americans receiving capital gains or dividend income make less than $100,000 per year.“Lower taxes and pro-growth economic policies have created millions of jobs across America,” said Rep. Foxx. “Unemployment is lower than the average of the past four decades, our GDP is growing and consumer confidence is higher. We must continue on this path that has brought about this tremendous economic growth.” Current tax relief has led to a 15 percent increase in federal revenue over the past year, while the budget deficit is estimated to be reduced by $100 billion.Rep. Foxx said it was unfortunate that some of her colleagues on the other side of the aisle continued to fight extending tax relief. “The only thing they want to do is raise taxes and spend your money. This mentality puts the family checkbook and America’s prosperity at risk,” she said.###

The President talked about the successes of the American economy and called on Congress to make tax relief permanent. He also stated, “I appreciate Congresswoman Virginia Foxx -- we're right here in her congressional district -- she's doing an excellent job on behalf of the people of this part of the world.”Rep. Foxx made the following welcoming remarks prior to the President’s speech:“Good afternoon! It is a pleasure to be back here with my friends at Deere- Hitachi in Kernersville and to welcome so many good folks from the Fifth District, our guests from Washington and other districts. We are pleased to have Treasury Secretary Snow and, Commerce Secretary Gutierrez who are working with President Bush in creating the very positive economic climate we enjoy today.“Senator Burr, it is always a pleasure to be with you. We have been working together since 1994 when we were elected to our previous positions and I am grateful to you for your friendship over the years.“We also have Congressman Howard Coble who represents North Carolina’s Sixth District right next door. Congressman Coble is the dean of the North Carolina delegation and a real leader in Washington.“We are also fortunate to have Congressman Patrick McHenry from the Tenth Congressional District. Congressman McHenry and I are both freshmen who have rolled up our sleeves and gone straight to work in our first year. “Finally, Mayor Curtis Swisher, it is always a pleasure to be here in Kernersville. I was here on Friday but am pleased to be back. We agree that any day in Kernersville is a good day.“I am delighted to be back here at Deere-Hitachi. I toured your plant back in March and was incredibly impressed with your highly skilled and motivated workforce and your state-of-the-art facilities.“I had the pleasure to witness firsthand the assembly of your hydraulic excavators which are widely used in the construction industry as earth moving digging machines. I learned much about Deere-Hitachi being a model of how U.S. manufacturing companies can compete successfully in the global economy. “The employees here at Deere-Hitachi have worked incredibly hard, and I am pleased that they will soon be receiving recognition from President George W. Bush!“You know, the last time we had the President in Kernersville, it was the other George W… George Washington! I hope it won’t be that long before the President comes back.“It is a tremendous honor to have the President in my Congressional district. When I ran for Congress, I told you that if elected I would take the ideas and common sense from the people of the Fifth District to Washington with me to make sound policy. And I promised to bring to North Carolina the decision makers in Washington so they would know the people from the Fifth District and understand our needs and concerns. Well in just my first year in office, I have been able to host the Speaker of the House and now, today, the President of the United States. That’s not too bad for a freshman member, is it?“We all have a lot to be grateful to our President for. Under his leadership, our economy is flourishing and getting stronger. One of the main reasons why our economy is so strong is President Bush's tax cuts. And, we need to make them permanent.“I am proud of President Bush’s leadership and agenda for a strong economy. I will continue to work with him and my colleagues in Congress to make tax relief permanent, exercise spending restraint and cut the federal deficit.

The Deficit Reduction Act contains a number of provisions that trim the federal deficit and reform government programs including:Lowering prescription drug costs Reducing waste, fraud, and abuse Strengthening and simplifying student loan programs Rebuilding community first responder capabilities by freeing up vital spectrum airwaves Protecting workers’ pensions by placing the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) on a more solid financial foundation and protecting taxpayers from the cost of a massive bailout Restricting non-citizen access to food stamps and helping prevent illegal aliens from getting Medicaid “Like every family in Northwest North Carolina, we need to make tough budget decisions and cut back on spending. This is not easy, but it is the right thing to do,” she said.Rep. Foxx also expressed her disappointment with colleagues on the other side of the debate. “Even though members of the Minority complain about the deficit, they want to increase spending astronomically with no accountability measures in place. They have no plan to reduce the deficit. Their only answer is to raise taxes. At a time when we must be mindful of hard-earned tax dollars, the last we thing we need is more of the old ‘tax and spend’ mentality,” she said. “I am pleased we were able to win today’s victory for working families.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) announced today that she was able to secure $2.5 million for improvements to the Statesville Regional Airport. The funding was included in the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, HUD, the Judiciary and the District of Columbia Appropriations conference report which is expected to pass the House today. “We appreciated the reception Statesville received in March when we first visited with Congresswoman Foxx regarding possible airport funding,” said Statesville Mayor-Elect Costi Kutteh. “Her and her staff’s efforts in securing this funding demonstrate her commitment to economic prosperity for Statesville and its surrounding communities. We truly appreciate her recognizing the importance of Statesville Airport and making this funding a reality.”“I am delighted that I was able to secure these vital funds,” said Rep. Foxx. “Helping the Statesville Airport move forward will encourage economic development by bringing new jobs to Iredell County and adding to the tax base.”Rep. Foxx has been actively involved with the airport all year and has worked closely with airport officials, local government officials and representatives from Lowe’s Aviation. She also enlisted the support of House Aviation Committee Chairman Rep. John Mica (R-Fla.), who visited the airport as Rep. Foxx’s guest last June.The City of Statesville and Iredell County have become a favorite area for corporate relocations in recent years. These corporations have increasingly depended on the Statesville Airport to meet their travel needs. Not only are the numbers of aircraft operations increasing, but the size of aircraft using the facility are increasing as well. In order to meet this demand, the airport began an aggressive phased expansion plan, which includes extending the runway to 7000’ (from 5000’) and installing an Instrument Landing System (ILS).Rep. Foxx worked especially hard to speed up the process of implementing the ILS at the Statesville Airport. The ILS project had apparently stalled at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and was costing the airport money and jobs since businesses want to locate near an airport with an ILS system. Rep. Foxx contacted the appropriate FAA officials and helped usher the project through expeditiously. Other phases include new taxiways, pavement strengthening, and other improvements, with each phase meeting FAA requirements and further enhancing aircraft safety. “Upon completion of this phased project, aircraft will be able to fly non-stop to the West Coast as well as internationally,” said Rep. Foxx. “These improvements will have a tremendous economic impact on the community and will allow Statesville Airport to keep up with its growing usage demands.”###

Local leaders have identified these projects as key economic development priorities for the area. The funding was included in the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, HUD, the Judiciary and the District of Columbia Appropriations conference report which passed the House today. “Transportation and infrastructure are key components of my economic development efforts for Forsyth County,” said Rep. Foxx. “That is why I worked so hard with local officials and Congressional leaders to secure these vital funds.”Rep. Foxx was able to obtain:1. $500,000 for the Northern Beltway Eastern Extension in Winston-Salem. These funds will go toward improving the eastern section from U.S. Highway 52 to Business 40, and the Eastern Extension from Business 40 to U.S. Highway 311. These roadways will become part of the new I-73/74 high priority corridor.2. $150,000 for renovations to the Central Branch Library. Built in 1952, the facility is over-crowded and unable to accommodate demand for services. A renovated and expanded Central Library will help promote the redevelopment of downtown by providing a wide array of services to the business community, downtown residents and public schools.3. $250,000 for the Winston-Salem Union Station Intermodal Transportation Facility. This will help expand the bus facility and possibly allow new bus purchases.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) is pleased to announce that the House of Representatives has approved funds for the Appalachian Enology & Viticulture Services Center at Appalachian State University. She was able to secure $1 million for the project in the FY06 Science, Departments of State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Conference report that passed the House yesterday. The legislation will now go to the Senate, where passage is expected later today.“I am delighted to support ASU in their efforts to expand the wine industry in North Carolina. I am especially grateful for the hard work by Rep. Charles Taylor (N.C.-11) to help obtain these funds,” said Rep. Foxx. “As a strong supporter of viticulture, I understand that vineyards and wineries create many jobs and attract tourist dollars to our rural communities. They also offer an opportunity for farm diversification and farmland preservation. Therefore, we must do whatever we can to encourage the growth of this important Western North Carolina industry.”Currently, there are 350 vineyards and 42 wineries in North Carolina, which is over double the amount in 1999. The Yadkin Valley is North Carolina’s first federally recognized American Viticultural Area. Located in the northwestern part of the state, it includes all of Surry, Wilkes and Yadkin counties, as well as portions of Stokes, Davie and Forsyth counties. There are currently 14 wineries and more than 400 acres devoted to vineyards in the Yadkin Valley.The Appalachian Enology & Viticulture Services Center will contain laboratories and training facilities to help improve the quality and competitiveness of North Carolina’s wine industry. One unique aspect of the center is that it will have a mobile laboratory that can be dispatched for on-site research. This lab will diagnose vineyard problems and come up with rapid solutions.The Center will also conduct international research in horticultural and biotechnological strategies for expanding viticulture in higher elevations, investigating the health benefits of moderate wine consumption and much more.###

The legislation will now go to President Bush’s desk for final approval.“I am delighted that the vital funds I have been fighting for to equip our first responders were included in this conference report,” said Rep. Foxx. “The Mobile Data Network will greatly help our dedicated emergency service personnel keep our Forsyth County families safe.” In a letter dated April 7, 2005 to Rep. Frank Wolf, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies, Rep. Foxx made the case to obtain funds by writing:“The risk to police officers involved in potentially dangerous situations is minimized when personnel in the field have ready access to critical information. The City and the County would like to implement a mobile data network, using computer devices already placed in emergency response vehicles. The mobile data network will connect public safety personnel to criminal, motor vehicle and driver information using secure, reliable and wireless data communication technologies. “Specifically, the mobile data network will provide public safety officers with access to criminal databases, field reporting and real-time messaging. In addition, personnel will have the ability to prepare and submit reports via the computer, which will greatly reduce the time wasted in report writing and subsequent data entry. Furthermore, the mobile data network will allow multiple agencies within Forsyth County to process information more accurately and efficiently - eliminating duplication of efforts.”###

The legislation will now go to President Bush’s desk for final approval.“I am delighted that these vital funds I have been fighting for were included in this conference report,” said Rep. Foxx. “The research being done at Wake Forest has real-world implications for our military who face great risks and sometimes lose limbs or organs during combat. As medical technology improves, the opportunity to avert or minimize these injuries may come through the development of tissue engineering treatments.” The team at the National Regenerative Medicine Center at Wake Forest is pioneering groundbreaking research into the use of autologous tissues to treat battlefield injuries. These tissues could potentially result in saving limbs or organs, including the replacement of cartilage, muscle, nerves, and blood vessels. Autologous tissues are derived from the patient’s own cells and are capable of correcting a number of pathologies and injuries. The use of autologous cells eliminates the risks of rejection and immunological reactions and drastically reduces the time that patients must wait for lifesaving surgery. The use of autologous tissues to create functional organs is one of the most important and groundbreaking steps ever taken in medicine. “The funds included in this conference report will support the continued research of an experienced team of scientists at the Regenerative Center, allow them to upgrade their facilities and to speed their research process,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Foxx and McHenry were able to secure $150,000 for the project in the FY06 Science, Departments of State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies Appropriations Conference report that passed the House today. The legislation will now go to President Bush’s desk for final approval."I was pleased to work with Sheriff Phil Redmond to provide his department with the resources they need to keep criminals off the street," said Rep. Foxx. "Keeping my constituents safe is one of my top priorities. I want to thank Congressman McHenry and Senators Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr for working with me to secure the funding for this very important project."“The Iredell County Sheriff’s Office will use this money to continue their success in providing safety and security in our community,” said Rep. McHenry. “The funds will go toward increasing the capabilities of our law enforcement officials, which is an important step forward for the people of Iredell County. I commend Rep. Virginia Foxx and Senators Elizabeth Dole and Richard Burr for joining me in the fight to support our police force.” The ISCO is constructing a crime lab which will eventually develop into a regional lab for other law enforcement agencies in the area. For that crime lab, ICSO needs federal assistance to purchase the Omnitrack Fingerprint Identification System. This system will help classify and identify fingerprints, as well as search the federal Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for a match.The outdated and inefficient current system only allows for fingerprints from booked inmates to be sent to AFIS for positive identification. ICSO needs a system by which officers can instantaneously submit an unknown latent fingerprint from a crime scene, or a fingerprint from an unknown person, for AFIS to analyze and identify. Currently, ICSO has fingerprint cards on file and analysts must physically go through each card for comparison to find a match. If there is no card match, the print is sent to the State Bureau of Investigation for analysis, which can take up to 18 months. The Omnitrack Fingerprint Identification System will expedite the identification process and also avoid human error.###

This agreement will allow American textile and apparel businesses the certainty they need to plan for the next three years.“This agreement will also cut China’s market access in 14 apparel categories by 2.5 percent in 2006. It will place 20 new textile and apparel categories under the three year quota, allowing a total of 34 categories to be controlled. “China has been crippling our manufacturing economy by illegally flooding our markets. China’s idea of fair trade has been government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports, currency manipulation and forgiveness of loans by its government banks. Today’s agreement is a good step in addressing China’s unfair trade practices. However, it is only a temporary fix. We must continue to take action to prevent China from damaging our economy in the future. “Today’s announcement is an encouraging sign as we head into the next rounds of WTO talks in December. My colleagues on the Congressional Textile Caucus and I have called for separate talks on textile issues so that negotiators can focus on important issues such as safeguards past 2008, China’s monetary policy and other critical issues facing the industry.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) acted to protect personal property rights by voting for H.R. 4128, the “Protection of Homes, Small Businesses and Private Property Act of 2005.” This bill, which passed 376 to 38, will cut federal funding for municipal governments that use eminent domain for commercial business development.Rep. Foxx and her colleagues were driven to take action following last summer’s U.S. Supreme Court Ruling in Kelo v. New London. The High Court ruled that government may seize personal property if it believes it is in the best interest of commercial business development. With that decision, Susette Kelo and 15 of her neighbors lost their homes to a hotel and other business developments. One resident forced to sell her home had been born there in 1918.“Stripping law-abiding citizens of their property rights in order to help promote commercial development is unconscionable,” said Rep. Foxx. “This is not what our Founding Fathers intended when they wrote the Fifth Amendment. The concept of eminent domain used to mean that government could purchase property for highways, utilities and other public infrastructure – but not shopping malls, swimming pools and amusement parks.” Rep. Foxx noted that the Kelo decision will especially hurt the poor and elderly because the government can purchase their land at a lower cost. Furthermore, these people generally do not have the means to afford legal fees in taking a case to court.Under H.R. 4128, federal funds would be denied to states or localities that abuse their power by using “economic development” as the reason for seizing private property. The bill also allows those affected by this type of seizure to have access to federal or state court. “The protection of our homes, small businesses and other private property against government seizure is one of the fundamental principles upon which our country was founded,” said Rep. Foxx. “If the highest court in our land will not protect this right, then it is up to this Congress to do so.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) renewed her call for more accountability and commended President Bush for responding to calls for disaster oversight by naming FDIC Chairman Donald Powell the federal coordinator of Gulf Coast reconstruction. “I am pleased that the administration has heard the calls my conservative colleagues and I have made for more accountability in disaster response. I am hopeful that Mr. Powell will provide the type of oversight we need,” said Rep. Foxx. “It appears President Bush has taken an important step to protect American taxpayers and ensure greater responsibility in our relief efforts. However, we must continue to take additional steps to increase financial oversight and to examine the federal government’s fundamental role in disaster relief.”Earlier this fall, Rep. Foxx was one of 11 Members of Congress who voted against a $51.8 billion Katrina supplemental bill, citing high potential for the waste, fraud and abuse of federal tax dollars. She has long pushed the administration to provide greater oversight and accountability. Rep. Foxx co-sponsored legislation to create a Chief Financial Officer to oversee the federal government’s relief efforts. She also voted to create a bi-partisan committee to investigate the government’s response to Hurricane Katrina and to determine the appropriate role of the federal government in disaster relief.Since the $51.8 billion supplemental bill passed Congress, less than half of the funds have been spent. There have been numerous reports of waste and misuse of funds. Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) has called on Congress to re-program the money because she claims the money is not going to help those in need, as intended. President Bush has also indicated that he will ask Congress to re-direct some of the funds to reconstruction efforts.“When Congress was asked to approve the massive $51.8 billion supplemental, I was very vocal about my concern that the money be spent wisely,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am pleased that the President and my colleagues in Congress are taking steps to correct this mistake and better guard our taxpayers.” ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took an important step to help farmers in Northwest North Carolina by voting for the Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report for FY 2006. “I am pleased that we were able to pass a bill to help our farmers and rural communities,” said Rep. Foxx, a member of the House Committee on Agriculture. “Farmers are the backbone of our communities and we must provide the resources they need.”One important aspect of the bill is it delays the implementation of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) on meat and meat products. “This is a very important issue to the beef, poultry and pork producers in the Fifth District. Delaying the implementation of COOL will save farmers millions of dollars,” she said.Rep. Foxx personally contacted Chairman Henry Bonilla to ask for assistance in delaying the rule until there was legislation to address COOL. “I am very pleased the Chairman listened to my request and helped the farmers and ranchers of the Fifth District,” she said.The conference report will also maintain funding for the Resource Conservation and Development Program which provides resources to local communities for economic development. Finally, Rep. Foxx is pleased to report that she was able to include the Wilkesboro/Kerr Scott Reservoir Intake project in the conference report. This project will help the towns of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro by providing for the installation of a new raw water intake on the prong of the Kerr Scott Reservoir and a new raw water booster pumping station. “This project will guarantee an adequate water supply for residents of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro and enhance the towns’ image by providing sufficient water supply to attract new industries,” said Rep. Foxx.Once the conference report is signed by President Bush, it will become law.###

H.R. 420, the Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2005, passed the House in a 228 to 184 vote.“It is a sad fact that lawsuit abuse is costing Americans well over $200 billion per year. While some claims are legitimate, a great number contain no merit at all,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am pleased that this bill will provide a number of sanctions against those who file frivolous lawsuits. Anyone who files a baseless claim to prey upon innocent Americans and small businesses must face the consequences.”The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act will restore mandatory (rather than discretionary) sanctions on attorneys and parties who file reckless lawsuits. It will permit requiring the reimbursement of attorney’s fees and litigation costs in connection with frivolous lawsuits. In addition, it will limit forum shopping, which gives attorneys the ability to hand pick a court and bring lawsuits to jurisdictions that have a history of providing plaintiffs with huge awards.The bill will also abolish the “free pass” provision which permits parties to avoid sanctions by withdrawing a lawsuit within 21 days after a motion for sanctions has been filed.“Without strong consequences for filing baseless lawsuits, innocent Americans will continue to suffer. This bill is a positive step in stopping out-of-control trial lawyers from threatening the vitality of our small businesses,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted today to pass H.R. 3893, the Gasoline for America’s Security (GAS) Act of 2005. This legislation takes a number of steps to lower gasoline prices over time by increasing refinery capacity, streamlining the fuel supply and fighting price gouging.“Many of my constituents are concerned about high gasoline prices and have every right to be,” said Rep. Foxx. “Today several of my colleagues and I took action to address rising energy costs. These problems took decades to develop and will not be solved overnight. However, we are moving in the right direction.”Hurricanes Katrina and Rita dealt a blow to the Gulf Coast oil supplies and highlighted the importance of expanding our refinery capacity to produce energy here at home. The United States has not built new refineries or increased existing refinery capacity since the 1970s, even though demand has increased sharply. The GAS Act will simplify the refinery permitting process while maintaining environmental standards. It will also encourage building refineries on former military sites and limiting the proliferation of fuel blends used to satisfy Clean Air Act requirements. The GAS Act will also address price gouging by requiring the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate nationwide gasoline prices and to create a national standard for price gouging within a year of the bill’s enactment.“I was proud to support the GAS Act, which would lower gasoline prices over time within the market system without resorting to price controls. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will act quickly and pass this vital piece of legislation,” said Rep. Foxx.###

The measure passed the House of Representatives on a vote of 347 to 70.“In our post 9/11 world, we cannot separate national security from border security,” said Rep. Foxx. “Passage of this Homeland Security bill is a step in the right direction toward strengthening border security.” The bill provides $30.8 billion for DHS operations and activities in fiscal year 2006. Rep. Foxx cited the bill’s border patrol and immigration enforcement measures as key factors in her support.H.R. 2360 provides $19.1 billion for border protection, immigration enforcement and related activities. The bill also funds traditional missions such as immigration services, law enforcement and trade. It provides $25 million to enforce laws related to forced child labor, intellectual property rights and textile transshipment.Rep. Foxx also pointed out that $2.6 billion is set aside for traditional Coast Guard operating activities, including maritime safety, drug interdiction and fisheries, environment and humanitarian missions.“These funds support next generation technology to screen high-risk cargo coming through our land and seaports; an expansion of cargo inspection at foreign ports; improvements to supply chain security; maritime security and support a robust revitalization of immigration enforcement efforts both along our borders and within the interior of the nation,” said Rep. Foxx.“The number one threat to our national security is our unsecured border. H.R. 2360 helps combat the inflow of illegal aliens by providing the resources enforcement agencies need,” she said.###

She has had a long, successful legal career at the very highest levels of government. In addition, she has valuable, practical experience outside of the courtroom.“I applaud President Bush for choosing someone who will strictly interpret the Constitution rather than legislate from the bench. I am pleased that his choice to succeed Justice Sandra Day O’Connor is qualified, competent and a strict constructionist who also happens to be a woman.“It is a shame that some ideological groups have been lined up for months, ready to attack the President’s nominee before she was even named. It is my hope that the Senate will handle this nominee with the same dignity and restraint that was given to Chief Justice John Roberts. I also hope they will move quickly to hold hearings and provide an ‘up or down’ vote to fill this important vacancy as soon as possible.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) is a co-sponsor of a comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced in the U.S. House today. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. J.D. Hayworth (Ariz.-5.), aims to drastically improve border security and crack down on individuals who employ illegal aliens.“Border security equals national security,” said Rep. Foxx. “The number one threat to our national security is our porous border. I am pleased to co-sponsor this outstanding legislation that will enable us to eliminate illegal immigration and secure our nation.”The “Enforcement First Immigration Reform Act of 2005” takes a number of steps to stop the inflow of illegal aliens, provide the necessary resources enforcement agencies need and increase penalties for those who employ illegal aliens.The bill will increase the number of investigators and attorneys in the Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. It will also authorize hundreds of thousands of state and local law enforcement officers to enforce immigration law and add 400,000 illegal aliens with standing deportation orders to the National Crime Information Center database.The legislation will strengthen border security by authorizing 10,000 border patrol agents, as well as provide funding for aerial vehicles, cameras, radar and sensors and allow U.S. military forces to aid in border security.Finally, the bill will increase IRS fines for employers that submit false W-2 data and raise the fine for employing illegal aliens from $10,000 to $50,000. Further, those who are found guilty of hiring illegal aliens will face a jail term of up to 5 years per violation.“Illegal immigration should not be tolerated or rewarded,” said Rep. Foxx. “We should do all we can to protect against unlawful entry into our country. We are a nation of immigrants, but also a nation of laws. We must increase our efforts to secure our borders while respecting those who wish to enter this great nation legally.”###

Thus, I am absolutely committed to ensuring they receive the benefits they deserve,” said Rep. Foxx. “With this increased insurance coverage, we help ensure that our armed service personnel and veterans can provide for their families.”H.R. 3200, the Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance Enhancement Act of 2005, increases the maximum coverage available to servicemembers and veterans by $150,000. This increase, enacted earlier this year, was set to expire on September 30, 2005. H.R. 3200 will make the increases permanent.“One of our greatest duties as a nation is to take care of those who have sacrificed to protect our freedom,” said Rep. Foxx. "I am glad to see that we are improving and increasing these important life insurance benefits. Our country is fortunate to have the best-trained and most dedicated soldiers and veterans in the world. They have certainly earned our full support."The bill also boosts the incremental increases in both of these life insurance programs from the current $10,000 to $50,000.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted for an amendment to the School Readiness Act (H.R. 2123) that would include important hiring protections for religious organizations. The amendment passed in a 220-196 vote.“The Constitution of the United States explicitly states that Congress shall make no law… prohibiting the free exercise of religion,” said Rep. Foxx during debate earlier today. “Prohibiting our churches, mosques and synagogues from hiring people with similar beliefs is not only an affront to their very core, but also contrary to this great nation’s Constitution.”Rep. Foxx noted that the First Amendment allows Americans the freedom to think, speak and believe as they choose. “Secular groups, such as Planned Parenthood or the Sierra Club, are free to hire based on their ideologies and missions, but still use federal funding. Why should there be a double-standard for faith-based organizations?” asked Rep. Foxx. The Congresswoman argued that religious organizations have a right to provide the same services and programs as secular organizations. The 1964 Civil Rights Act echoes the intent of the Constitution by specifically protecting the rights of faith-based organizations to hire people who share the same beliefs. “Are we going to deny many of our poorest and less fortunate children the opportunity to learn in these early childhood education programs simply because a church is administering it? This is about our children, and denying them exemplary services just because the organization providing them happens to be a religious one is just cruel,” she said.Finally, Rep. Foxx praised houses of worship for their contributions to society. “To not allow these organizations -- who have proven they are some of the best at feeding the hungry, healing the sick and housing the homeless -- to provide early childhood education for our children, is just wrong,” she said. “Just because an organization has among its purpose and basic tenets to serve others is not a reason to discriminate against them.”###

This annual observance of our nation’s founding charter was made official by President George W. Bush on December 8th, 2004. However, Constitution Day has been celebrated for the past eight years with the recitation of the Preamble by students, military servicemen and women abroad and others across the country. This is a special occasion as it will mark the first simultaneous recitation of the Preamble.“In reciting the Preamble, we join as a nation to celebrate not only a document but a way of life and to acknowledge freedoms given by God that no state or power can take away. Our nation’s founders knew well the need for a government that would not impose burdens upon the people but would enable them to secure the blessing of liberty.“On this Constitution Day I remind the Congress of our duty to preserve a strict interpretation of this document. The Framers of the Constitution knew what they were doing. They knew the dangers of a state that grows out of control and imposes its will on the citizenry. We owe it to our constituents to maintain an independent judiciary that is co-equal with the other two branches of government; a Judiciary that seeks to interpret the law, not write it. As we observe Constitution Day, let us honor the Constitution’s framers and embrace their foresight and wisdom by teaching this monument to liberty.”###

Foxx on the House floor today. “We must do everything we can to protect our children.”In conjunction with pre-existing laws, the Children’s Safety Act of 2005 will give residents and local law enforcement as much information as possible about offenders who move into their communities, and will augment law enforcement’s ability to find missing children before any harm can come to them.“One of the most crucial problems we currently have is that over 100,000 sex offenders are ‘missing’ – this means that they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements,” said Rep. Foxx. “This legislation remedies this crisis by ensuring compliance and enforcement at a national level.”The legislation aims to prevent crimes against children through a coordinated law enforcement approach that includes a broadening of the definition of such crimes, increased reporting requirements for know offenders and increases in penalties for those convicted of sexual and violent crimes against minors.“Child exploitation and sexual abuse are a growing problem,” Rep. Foxx said. “It is time to shed light on this most egregious crime and tighten the outlets sex offenders use to desecrate our nation.”###

Today is very important because it reminds us to remember and honor those who lost their lives and to pray for their loved ones. It reminds us to give thanks to the hundreds of firefighters, police and emergency personnel who made the ultimate sacrifice while striving to rescue their fellow Americans. And it reminds us to support our brave troops who are steadfastly fighting the War on Terror to ensure that nothing like this ever happens to our country again.“The terrorists who waged war on America on September 11th sought not only to take lives and crumble towers -- they sought to kill the American spirit. And I am proud to say they failed their mission. September 11th united our country in a way I had not witnessed before. Americans are determined to stand up to the terrorists’ bullying and protect our freedoms for future generations. During the past four years, we have made great progress. We have captured terrorists, destroyed their safe havens and brought freedom and democracy to many oppressed people.“Yet, while conditions have gotten much better over the last four years, we cannot grow complacent and we cannot ever forget the lessons we learned on that September morning. The terrorists are evil and they will never give up their fight to bring down our way of life. America is strong, and as long as we maintain our resolve, we will prevail.“May God bless the families of the victims of the September 11th and may God bless America.”###

He then went on to graduate Magna Cum Laude from Harvard Law School where he served as editor of the Harvard Law Review. Judge Roberts also clerked for our late Chief Justice William Rehnquist. “Judge Roberts has argued 39 cases before the Supreme Court, earning him a reputation as one of the finest advocates in the nation. Only a handful of the 180,000 members of the Supreme Court bar come close to this record. “Since 2003, he has served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. This court is regarded as the second most influential court in the nation. Judge Roberts was confirmed unanimously for this important position by the U.S. Senate. “Judge Roberts is exactly the kind of judge we need. He will apply the law as written and decide each case on its merits, regardless of his personal political views.“Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Judge Roberts offers everything we could ask for in a Chief Justice nominee.

If you don’t have a computer, you can reach FEMA’s disaster help line at 1-800-621-3362 or 1-800-462-7585 for the hearing/speech impaired.2. Have local officials’ phone numbers handy, such as the Sheriff’s Department and Fire Department. Additionally, have Red Cross information available. They can be found on the internet at www.redcross.org, or you may call the Red Cross Carolina’s Blood Region at (704) 376-1661.3. Prepare an evacuation plan. Always evacuate immediately if the police or other officials issue a warning. Discuss with your family what do if a hurricane watch or warning is issued and plan safe escape routes. Plan ahead where you would go and take the phone numbers of these places with you. Take a road map in case the weather forces you onto unfamiliar roads. Do not drive over standing water, as floods may have damaged the roads. The Red Cross provides helpful information about flood-related disasters at www.redcross.org/services/disaster/. 4. Prepare a hurricane kit. A first aid kit with necessary medications is essential. Make an emergency contact list and give this list to every family member. Have canned food with an opener, plenty of water, flashlights with batteries, a battery powered radio, raingear, sleeping bags and protective clothing in your hurricane kit. 5. Remove debris from gutters, storm drains, ditches, and culverts cleared before an impending hurricane. Property owners are responsible for clearing ditches to help prevent flooding and wind hazards. If you see that debris or trees are blocking a bridge or culvert, notify your city engineer or other community official, so that they can perform necessary maintenance. 6. Pay attention to National Weather Service and emergency broadcasts. Heed warnings and evacuate the area if hurricanes or related severe weather or flooding are forecast. 7. Keep copies of insurance policies and other important documents in a safe place. This should be a place less likely to be damaged during a hurricane, such as in a waterproof box, a safe-deposit box, or with a friend or relative in another area.8. If possible, buy National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood insurance. To learn how, contact your insurance agent or call 1-888-CALL-FLOOD, ext. 445.###

It is my hope that the United States Trade Representative (USTR) and other U.S. negotiators will be successful in reaching an agreement extending current safeguards so that our producers can plan for the future and grow textile and apparel jobs in this country. “My constituents in the Fifth District expect us to be tough with our trading partners, and I will continue to encourage the Administration to be extremely firm with China.“We must put a stop to China’s attempts to cripple our manufacturing economy leading to the elimination of U.S. jobs by illegally flooding our markets. China’s idea of fair trade is government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports to the United States, currency manipulation and forgiveness of loans by its government banks. We must take immediate action to address this problem. If we fail to do so, we will continue to lose American manufacturing jobs. That is unacceptable.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5). share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071Military veteran leaders from 12 counties in Northwest North Carolina came together today for the first set of Fifth District Veterans Advisory Council (VAC) meetings hosted by U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5). Rep. Foxx created the advisory council to facilitate communication between her office and the veteran community in the Fifth District. The VAC will meet with Rep. Foxx periodically to discuss important issues facing veterans. The council is made up of veteran service officers and representatives of all of the veterans’ organizations in the Fifth District.“Once of our most solemn responsibilities as a nation is to take care of our veterans,” said Rep. Foxx. “The Veterans Advisory Council will help me keep the lines of communication open with the veterans in the Fifth District.”The VAC discussed a number of topics at today’s meetings including access to health care and benefits. “The information and advice I received today will be invaluable as I go back to work in Washington,” said Rep. Foxx. During the meetings, Rep. Foxx discussed the steps she is taking to help veterans. She noted that she is either supporting or co-sponsoring several bills including:H.R. 303 to provide for all military retirees, not just those 50 percent disabled H.R. 1366 to expand eligibility for combat-related special compensation to permit certain additional retired members who have a service-connected disability to receive both disability compensation from the DVA for that disability and combat-related special compensation by reason of that disability H.R. 783 to lower the retirement age for National Guard and Reserve members from 60 to 55.H.R. 808 to repeal the offset from surviving spouse annuities under the military Survivor Benefit Plan for amounts paid by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as dependency and indemnity compensation H.R. 968 to change the effective date for paid-up coverage under the military Survivor Benefit Plan from October 1, 2008 to October 1, 2005 H.R. 602 to restore health care coverage to retired members of the uniformed services instead of turning them over to Medicare“Our veterans risked their lives to protect the freedoms we all cherish. Thus, I am absolutely committed to ensuring they receive the benefits they rightfully earned and look forward to our future advisory council meetings,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Foxx. “That is why I worked to support this loan application to build a new fire station.”The funds will be used to construct a new 9500 square foot fire station to replace the old station which has become inadequate and obsolete. The new station will be constructed on the same site and will include 5 drive-thru bays, a meeting-training area, a kitchen and handicap accessible bathrooms. The new station will allow the fire department to improve their efficiency and could lead to improved insurance rating. This would mean an insurance premium reduction for each property owner in the fire district. ###

Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) announced yesterday that she has secured $4 million in the conference report of a highway funding bill for the I-40/I-77 interchange project in Iredell County. Local leaders have identified this project as a key economic development priority for the area.“Transportation and infrastructure are key components of my economic development efforts for Iredell County,” said Rep. Foxx. “That is why I worked so hard with local officials and Congressional leaders to secure these funds.”The $4 million was included in the conference report for H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives today. The bill now goes to the President’s desk for final approval.Foxx met with Iredell County officials earlier in the year to discuss funding priorities.. She has also worked closely with Chairman Don Young of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to ensure the local funds were included in H.R. 3.“I am pleased this bill will finally become law because it will encourage economic development, reduce traffic congestion and increase driver safety,” said Rep.

With Foxx’s support, the measure passed the House this afternoon by a vote of 230-194. share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071United States Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) today voted for H.R. 5, the Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare (HEALTH) Act of 2005. With Foxx’s support, the measure passed the House this afternoon by a vote of 230-194.“Skyrocketing insurance premiums and out of control lawsuits have diminished our nation’s health care delivery systems for far too long,” Rep. Foxx said on the House floor. “Health care dollars should be spent on patients in the hospital – not on lawyers in the courtroom.”The HEALTH Act addresses the issue by creating reasonable guidelines, not caps, on punitive damages. According to the bill, a plaintiff may recover punitive damages totaling either $250,000 or double the amount of economic damages awarded -- whichever is greater. The HEALTH Act accomplishes this meaningful reform without limiting compensation for 100 percent of plaintiffs’ economic losses, their medical costs, lost wages, future lost wages, rehabilitation costs and any other out-of-pocket loss suffered as a result of a health care injury. The bill seeks only to limit the punitive damages that lawyers aim to inflate.“This legislation is pro-patient in every way. It will increase quality of care and decrease patients’ costs,” said Foxx. “The HEALTH Act actually empowers courts to maximize patients’ awards because the court can now ensure that an unjust portion of the patient’s recovery is not misdirected to his or her attorney.”The bill will also discourage baseless lawsuits by limiting the incentive to pursue meritless claims. Without this provision, attorneys could continue to pocket large percentages of an injured patient’s award, leaving patients without the money they need for their medical care.“Lawyers never cure anyone. Spending health care dollars on frivolous lawsuits instead of treating and curing the sick is a travesty. I urge our Senators to drastically improve America’s health care system by passing this bill as soon as possible,” said Rep. Foxx.The HEALTH Act passed the House in 2003, but was not taken up by the Senate before the end of the 108th Congress.###
07.27.2005	This afternoon, United States Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took action to stop China from flooding American markets by voting to authorize a countervailing duty law to exports from non-market economies. share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071This afternoon, United States Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took action to stop China from flooding American markets by voting to authorize a countervailing duty law to exports from non-market economies.“China is crippling our manufacturing economy and eliminating our jobs by illegally flooding our markets,” said Rep. Foxx, a co-sponsor of H.R. 3283, the U.S. Trade Rights Enforcement Act. “China’s idea of fair trade is government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports to the United States, currency manipulation, and forgiveness of loans by its government banks. We must take swift action to stem this tide. This legislation is a good first step, but we must do much more.”Currently, American companies can only file antidumping trade cases against companies in non-market economies, but they cannot bring countervailing duty cases against businesses whose products are being subsidized by those countries. This WTO-legal bill would close this loophole by allowing our manufacturers to file unfair-trade complaints against companies who receive subsidies from countries such as China.The Trade Rights Enforcement Act establishes a system to monitor Chinese compliance with its trade obligations on intellectual property rights; market access for American goods, services and agriculture and accounting of Chinese subsidies. The bill would require the President to issue semi-annual reports to Congress on the specific steps the Chinese government is doing to meet its obligations. In addition, it would require the Administration to provide a description of how it will obtain compliance if China fails to meet their commitments.“I am pleased that we are urging fair trade practices with non-market countries such as China, but again, we must do more,” said Rep. Foxx. “Challenging unfairly subsidized products, fighting counterfeit goods and intellectual property theft and holding countries accountable for an unfair currency regime will help American companies remain competitive.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) announced today that she has obtained $1 million for the construction of a water treatment plant for the Towns of Sparta, N.C. and Independence, Va. “This is a tremendous project between the two towns,” said Sparta mayor John Miller. “I am thrilled to have Congresswoman Foxx’s help and support on such an important project to our communities. We are so glad to have her in office looking after us.”Rep. Foxx sought funding because the existing Sparta and Independence water systems have wells with capacities at less than 60 percent of their original values. “Continued well development is not a good idea for long-term water supply in this region,” said Rep. Foxx. “The uncertainty of the existing water supply sources creates distress within the existing systems and adversely affects their ability to meet current and future water demands.”Construction on the water plant would include a 1.0 MGD surface water treatment plant withdrawing from the New River approximately 46,000 LF of 12” water line, three booster pump stations, two storage tanks and related improvements. The pumping station and water treatment plant capacity would be one million gallons per day. The project would serve approximately 1,870 customers, including a residential population of about 3,500 people.“This project is of critical importance to the infrastructure needs of Sparta and Independence,” said Patrick Woodie, Executive Director of New River Community Partners. “These are two small communities, but they realize innovative projects such as this are the key to providing a better way of life for their people. Having the federal government as a partner in their endeavors ensures their visions will be realized. I would like to thank Congresswoman Foxx for her recognition and support of this project and to her staff for working diligently to see it to fruition.”“I am pleased that my request for critical funding was included in the Interior and Environment Appropriations Act,” said Rep. Foxx. “A water treatment plant will help create a safe, reliable, long-term water supply to serve water customers within the two towns.”###
07.26.2005	At United States Rep. Virginia Foxx’s request, Watauga County Sheriff Mark Shook spent the afternoon on Capitol Hill testifying about his experiences fighting methamphetamine (meth) in Northwest North Carolina. share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071WASHINGTON — At United States Rep. Virginia Foxx’s request, Watauga County Sheriff Mark Shook spent the afternoon on Capitol Hill testifying about his experiences fighting methamphetamine (meth) in Northwest North Carolina.“It was truly an honor to join Virginia Foxx in Washington, D.C. to fight meth abuse,” said Sheriff Shook. "Like me, Congresswoman Foxx is committed to eliminating meth in Watauga County and nationwide. Her tenacity during the hearing left me feeling hopeful about our prospects, and thankful for her representation."The Sheriff testified before the House Government Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources in a hearing entitled “Fighting Meth in America’s Heartland: Assessing the Impact on Local Law Enforcement and Child Welfare Agencies.” This hearing continued the Subcommittee’s ongoing study of how meth is adversely affecting our nation. “Sheriff Shook and I have teamed up to minimize and eliminate the problem, and with his leadership and tireless efforts we have made great strides,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am indeed proud and honored to have Sheriff Shook here today to share his successes with Congress and I know his story will be of benefit to the Subcommittee and to other communities that are afflicted with meth abuse. The challenge this drug poses is strong, serious and immediate, and so too must be our response. The outstanding job Sheriff Shook has done at the local level must be duplicated at the Federal level if we are to eradicate methamphetamine from our communities.”“Methamphetamine was something we heard about but believed it was a far away problem; a California problem,” said Sheriff Shook in his testimony. “In the spring of 2002 our 312 square mile semi-rural Western North Carolina County with a population of 48,000 full time residents was seriously impacted by the scourge of methamphetamine. We were not prepared...”“In our small county we have had methamphetamine related homicides, robberies, and sex offenses. In a county where murders are few and far-between, most of the murders that have occurred in our county recently have had various ties to methamphetamine. Houses, mobile homes and apartments have burned due to the flammability and toxicity of the chemical mixtures people use while trying to manufacture methamphetamine,” he said.Sheriff Shook went on to encourage Congress to take a look at state laws cropping up across the country that have enhanced the punishment for offenders and have made it more difficult to get the materials necessary for manufacturing meth. He also explained how the Watauga County Sheriff's Department has been diligent in educating and creating awareness of how local retailers can help prevent the problem. ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) offered and passed an amendment to the Higher Education Act that would promote greater competition and accountability in TRIO grant programs. Her amendment would require the Secretary of Education to establish minimum performance standards for these programs and to evaluate their quality and efficacy.“A performance-based grant selection process would ensure that the most qualified applicants receive grants,” said Rep. Foxx. “This leads to a better value for American taxpayers and better results to those benefiting from the grants. I am pleased that my colleagues on the Committee on Education & the Workforce helped to pass this common-sense amendment.”Since 1990, TRIO funding has more than tripled, but current law does not require recipients to prove results in achieving the program’s stated purpose. Rep. Foxx believes that any program receiving government funding should be able to prove the effect of the program.“Taxpayers deserve to know that their tax dollars are producing results,” she said.Rep. Foxx’s amendment would help remedy this problem by identifying strengths and weaknesses in programs and implementing training and assistance where it is needed. Should a program not meet criteria, then grants would go elsewhere.“The competition increases quality by fostering higher expectations,” said Rep. Foxx. “TRIO eligible students deserve to be served by the highest quality program that is available. My amendment would accomplish that.”The Higher Education Act reauthorizes the federal government’s major student aid programs in addition to other significant programs that provide aid and support services to institutions of higher education. The Higher Education Act was last reauthorized in 1998 and is typically authorized every 5 years.“I applaud Chairman John Boehner and Subcommittee Chairman Buck McKeon for their hard work and effort to reform and strengthen federal student aid and higher education programs. This bill makes great strides towards expanding college access and ensuring a quality education for every American student with more effective use of federal resources,” said Rep. Foxx.###

The following is the text of her speech:“Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a young man who bravely risked his own life to save the life of another. “Fifteen year old Tyler Macemore of Yadkinville, N.C. rescued an anonymous 10-year-old boy caught in a rip tide at Atlantic Beach, North Carolina last year.“One might wonder what motivated Tyler to selflessly enter the ocean that day. But it is clear that his choice was in some way guided by the lessons and experiences he has learned as a member of Boy Scout Troop 65 in Yadkinville.“Using only a boogie board, Tyler paddled out to the distressed young boy. With reassuring words and a confident, yet calm demeanor, he placed the boy on the board and paddled against the dangerous surf back to safety.“That day, Tyler Macemore became a true hero. By exhibiting a high level of maturity and bravery, he prevented a tragedy.“Since the rescue, Tyler has furthered his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America. He is now a Life Scout and working on his Eagle Scout. “Ironically, Tyler will be certified in Lifesaving at camp this summer, where he will also be awarded the coveted Honor Medal for his courageous act by the Boy Scouts of America. I am proud and honored to recognize this outstanding young citizen.”###

Foxx in a subcommittee markup this morning. “It is a fundamental protection that we hold dear, and this amendment will help ensure that privacy isn’t threatened simply because a student chooses to enroll in college.”The congresswoman’s amendment would prohibit the Department of Education from creating a federal database of information on nearly every facet of college students’ lives. “If implemented, this federal database would take ‘big brother’ to a whole new level,” said Rep. Foxx. “I’m sure those who proposed this system are well-intentioned, but creating a federal database of personal student information is an unacceptable way to go about measuring education trends.”The Chairman of the House Committee on Education & Workforce, Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) praised Rep. Foxx in a committee press release today. “It is essential that we enact safeguards to ensure students’ personal information is protected, and I applaud Rep.

Foxx. “I am pleased that we passed these bills to cut red tape, improve workplace safety and promote small business growth.”Rep. Foxx made the following remarks on the House floor during debate this afternoon:“Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support and cosponsor all four of these important pieces of legislation on OSHA reform. Each is an integral step to come to the aid of our small businesses.“Not only are our small businesses increasingly faced with greater competition from the bigger competitors in the U.S. but also are they faced with greater competition from across the globe. The last thing they need are unnecessary and burdensome regulations from their own government back home. According to a study discussed in the Office of Management and Budget’s Draft Report to Congress on the Costs and Benefits of Federal Regulation for 2005, it is estimated that the “total cost of Federal regulation (environmental, workplace, economic, and tax compliance regulation) was 60 percent greater per employee for firms with under 20 employees compared to firms with over 500 employees.” In another recent study, these costs translate to approximately $7,000 in regulatory costs per employee per year. We need to aid our small businesses in being more competitive, not help force them out of business. Certainly, the goals of the Occupational Safety and Health Agency to ensure workplace safety and health are laudable, and protecting our workers is and must remain paramount. But oftentimes good intentions do not result in the best practices. Our small businesses and our workers deserve better. ###

Foxx. “Mountain biking is a fun and healthy activity that residents of the Fifth District can do literally in their own backyards.”The Congresswoman was inspired to create the day by the memory of Jacob “Jack” Mock Doub, a teenage mountain biking enthusiast from Statesville, N.C. who passed away in October 2002. Jack was introduced to mountain biking at age 11 near Grandfather Mountain, N.C. He quickly became a talented cyclist and won nearly every cross-country race he entered. His greatest passion, however, was encouraging other young people to take up the sport. He would often skip chances to spend time with his friends in order to teach other kids to ride.Sadly, Jack passed away due to complications from a bicycling injury. In honor of Jack, his family and friends have joined the International Mountain Bicycling Association in encouraging children to learn to ride and lead a physically active lifestyle.“I urge my colleagues to honor the memory of Jack Doub and motivate other children to be healthy by voting to establish “National Take a Kid Mountain Biking Day,” said Rep.

As they outlawed this practice, they sat directly underneath our Ten Commandments.“In 1950, the Florida Supreme Court stated: “A people unschooled in the sovereignty of God, the Ten Commandments, and the ethics of Jesus could never have evolved the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence, and the Constitution. There is not one solitary fundamental principle of our democratic policy that did not stem directly from the basic moral concepts of the Ten Commandments…”“The Ten Commandments are found more often in public buildings than in individual churches, demonstrating that Americans from all faiths and walks of life recognize their impact on our American laws and culture.“Yesterday’s ruling sets a dangerous precedent.

This bill eliminates many inefficiencies and shifts resources to programs that actually work, all while saving taxpayers $3.8 billion.”Rep. Foxx emphasized that while the bill saves taxpayer dollars, it still increases funding for many key programs. For example, maximum Pell Grant awards, which make it possible for needy individuals to attend college, are now increased to $4100. This is the highest level in our nation’s history. In addition, total funding for the program is now increased by more than $1 billion over last year.The appropriations bill also expands access for small community and faith-based service providers and increases funding for community-based abstinence education programs.On the health care front, the bill provides a $100 million increase in funding for Community Health Centers and increases funding for research at the National Institutes of Health by $145 million.

Foxx. “This Intelligence Authorization Act for FY06 is an important piece of legislation. Keeping Americans safe has to be our number one priority. If we don’t protect our citizens, then nothing else matters.”Rep. Foxx said that Congress has made great strides in improving intelligence since passing the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. She said she looks forward to more progress with the passage of today’s Authorization Act.“The actions taken by Congress have worked. America is much safer today than we were two years ago,” said Rep. Foxx. “I am going to do everything in my power to see that we make America even more secure.”The Congresswoman noted that the first bill she voted to pass, the Real I.D. Act, implemented much-needed driver's license reforms, closed asylum loopholes, enhanced border security and strengthened deportation laws for illegal aliens. “The passage of today’s bill proves that we are staying on the right track to protect our homeland,” she said.###

These funds will bring at least 18 to 24 new jobs to Alleghany County. One company executive predicts that dozens of new jobs could later open up as a result.“I would like to thank Congresswoman Foxx and her staff for working diligently on this important project,” said Grant Godwin, Vice President and General Manager of Martin Marietta Composites in Raleigh. “If our company is successful in receiving contracts for the lightweight composite trailer chassis, we could open up to 100 new jobs in the area.”The lightweight composite trailer chassis will help soldiers by revolutionizing the way the Army can transport equipment and cargo.“This project meets two of my highest priorities,” said Rep. Foxx. “It gives our men and women in uniform the best possible equipment and brings jobs to Alleghany County.” ###

Foxx. “This is an important first step towards securing this much needed funding.”In a letter dated April 7, 2005 to Rep. Frank Wolf, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies, Rep. Foxx wrote:“The risk to police officers involved in potentially dangerous situations is minimized when personnel in the field have ready access to critical information. The City and the County would like to implement a mobile data network, using computer devices already placed in emergency response vehicles. The mobile data network will connect public safety personnel to criminal, motor vehicle and driver information using secure, reliable and wireless data communication technologies. “Specifically, the mobile data network will provide public safety officers with access to criminal databases, field reporting and real-time messaging. In addition, personnel will have the ability to prepare and submit reports via the computer, which will greatly reduce the time wasted in report writing and subsequent data entry. Furthermore, the mobile data network will allow multiple agencies within Forsyth County to process information more accurately and efficiently - eliminating duplication of efforts.”This project will have to be approved by the U.S. Senate before a House and Senate Conference committee agrees on the exact dollar amount.###

Rep. Foxx’s request would help fund a project to establish a fingerprint system for the Sheriff’s crime lab.“I appreciate Virginia Foxx's commitment to protect the citizens of her district,” said Iredell County Sheriff Phillip Redmond. “The Congresswoman worked closely with me as soon as she took office to determine the needs of Iredell County. Thanks to her hard work, we are one giant step closer to reducing the time it takes to get criminals off the street.”In a letter dated April 7, 2005 to Rep. Frank Wolf, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce and Related Agencies, Rep. Foxx wrote:“The ICSO is constructing a crime lab which will eventually develop into a regional lab for other law enforcement agencies in the area. For that crime lab, ICSO needs federal assistance to purchase the Omnitrack Fingerprint Identification System. This system will help classify and identify fingerprints, as well as search the federal Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for a match. “The outdated and inefficient current system only allows for fingerprints from booked inmates to be sent to AFIS for positive identification. ICSO needs a system by which officers can instantaneously submit an unknown latent fingerprint from a crime scene, or a fingerprint from an unknown person, for AFIS to analyze and identify. Currently, ICSO has fingerprint cards on file and analysts must physically go through each card for comparison to find a match. If there is no card match, the print is sent to the State Bureau of Investigation for analysis, which can take up to 18 months. The Omnitrack Fingerprint Identification System will expedite the identification process and also avoid human error.”This project must now pass the U.S. Senate before a House and Senate Conference committee agrees on an exact dollar amount.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took an important step to help farmers in Western North Carolina by voting for a $1.8 billion Agriculture Appropriations Act for FY 2006. “I am pleased that we were able to pass a fiscally responsible bill to help our farmers and rural communities,” said Rep. Foxx, a member of the House Committee on Agriculture. “Farmers are the backbone of our communities and we must provide the resources they need. My colleagues and I worked hard to exercise fiscal restraint on this bill without cutting those programs crucial to helping farmers.”One important aspect of the bill is that it will prohibit the use of federal funds to implement Country of Origin Labeling on meat and meat products. “This is a very important issue to the beef, chicken and pork producers in the district and needs to be handled through proposed legislation,” said Rep. Foxx.The bill will also increase funding for the Rural Community Advancement Program’s water and waste disposal grants by $42 million. This program provides resources to small rural communities to develop and finance water and waste disposal systems.Finally, the bill will maintain funding for the Resource Conservation and Development Program which provides resources to local communities for economic development. Rep. Foxx is also pleased to report that she was able to include the Wilkesboro/Kerr Scott Reservoir Intake project in the appropriations bill. This project will help the towns of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro by providing for the installation of a new raw water intake on the prong of the Kerr Scott Reservoir and a new raw water booster pumping station. “This project will guarantee an adequate water supply for residents of Wilkesboro and North Wilkesboro and enhance the towns’ image by providing sufficient water supply to attract new industries,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) took yet another step to help keep America safe. She joined her colleagues in voting for H.R. 1815, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006, which passed the House 390 to 39. This balanced and comprehensive package will help ensure our troops have the resources needed to carry out their missions and win the War on Terror."The number one priority of the Federal Government is to provide for a strong national defense and I am glad to see that we are taking care of our chief responsibility," said Rep. Foxx.The bill authorizes $441 billion for the Department of Defense and other national security programs. In addition, it allots $49.1 billion in supplemental costs to help fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and will add 10,000 active duty Army troops and 1,000 active duty Marine troops. These supplemental funds will also be used to purchase new equipment such as humvees, body armor, night vision devices, and improvised explosive device jammers.The Congresswoman said that while she is pleased with the progress being made in the War on Terror, we cannot neglect our homeland. Therefore, she supported an amendment introduced by Rep. Virgil Goode (Va.-5) to permit troops to patrol the borders in an effort to prevent terrorists, illegal aliens and drug traffickers from entering the United States."I urge my colleagues to support the Goode Amendment so that we can continue fighting terror in the streets of Baghdad and in the mountains of Afghanistan - rather than in our cities and communities," said Rep. Foxx during debate earlier this afternoon. "Without the Goode Amendment, the Authorization Bill is incomplete - and its goals are unmet."Rep. Foxx also spoke on the House floor today to oppose an amendment introduced by Rep. Susan Davis (Calif.-53). Her amendment sought to mandate federal dollars to fund abortions at military facilities."Military treatment centers -- which are dedicated to healing, nurturing and saving life -- should not be forced to facilitate the taking of the most innocent human life: the child in the womb," she said. "This amendment is a barely germane, blatant distraction from the important bill we are considering today." Rep. Foxx added that the amendment "... contradicts fundamental U.S. military values such as honor, courage and taking responsibility for one's own actions." Foxx said that as a steward of hardworking Americans' tax dollars, she could not ask her constituents to fund the killing of innocent human life on military bases. The Davis amendment was defeated.###

Foxx and her pro-life colleagues, the bill passed the House in a 238 to 194 vote."I am extremely saddened that this irresponsible bill has passed," said Rep. Foxx. "Supporters of this bill are asking taxpayers to foot the bill for the destruction of viable and innocent human embryos. This is a very sad day for the House. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to do what is morally right and vote against this bill. I also applaud President Bush for committing to veto this bill if it passes the Senate."Rep. Foxx has worked hard throughout this session to protect the sanctity of human life. She made the following remarks during debate this afternoon:"Mr. Speaker, as stewards of hard-working Americans' tax dollars, we cannot ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos."Like the rest of my colleagues joining me today, I am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life."But to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible."While stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector, President Bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive, government funded research nearly 4 years ago."In these 4 years, government and private research on those stem cells has produced nothing, cured no one and there is no indication that will change!"In the meantime, ethical research, not derived from embryos, in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases."The private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood and adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas. Let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research. "Mr. Speaker, we do have 'the power of the purse,' and we cannot misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life."###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) earned a major victory for our country's men and women in uniform. Her first piece of legislation, the Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (H.E.R.O.) Act has passed the U.S. House. It was the first policy-changing bill introduced by a freshman Member to pass.The H.E.R.O. Act is a common sense bill that will amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow members of the Armed Forces earning hazard pay to be eligible to make retirement account contributions. The current tax code prohibits many soldiers serving in combat zones from taking advantage of Individual Retirement Accounts.“Hazard pay wages are not taxed – nor should they be. However, since this compensation is non-taxable, the wages are not eligible for IRA contributions. This is a serious problem that I am happy to fix,” said Rep. Foxx. “I believe that those who are responsible enough to save should be able to take full advantage of IRAs – especially since they have served their country.”Foxx took action to amend the tax code after receiving a letter from a constituent in Forsyth County , N.C. The constituent's son, an Army soldier who spent nearly a year in Iraq , did not earn enough taxable income to take full advantage of an IRA.“I am glad this constituent brought this problem to my attention. After contacting the IRS, I decided to do something to solve this problem,” said Rep. Foxx. “The best ideas always come from my constituents back home and that's why I spend so much time in the district. I'm pleased to be able to help this soldier and his comrades.”The H.E.R.O. Act was well received in Washington, both in and out of Congress. Forty-seven Members co-sponsored the bill. In addition, the Military Officers Association of America and the Reserve Officers Association endorsed the legislation.“I look forward to working with members of the Senate to see that this makes it to the President's desk and is signed into law,” said Rep. Foxx. ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) has voted for a $30.85 billion homeland security appropriations bill (H.R. 1817) that will help better protect our nation's citizens, borders and infrastructure. The funding will also benefit first responders and enhance transportation security. “I applaud my colleagues for helping to pass this vital piece of legislation,” said Rep. Foxx. “The Preamble to our Constitution requires that we ensure domestic tranquility and promote the safety of our citizens. As your Representative in Congress, that is my first responsibility.” The appropriations bill provides for 1000 additional border patrol agents to help prevent terrorists from crossing our borders. In addition, it will expand cargo inspection at foreign ports and improve technologies for the screening of passengers, baggage and high risk cargo. The bill benefits first responders by achieving a balance between basic formula grants and funds for high risk areas. It will also protect our vital infrastructure by developing better communications systems between federal, state and local authorities. Foxx said the bill is a step in the right direction toward fiscal responsibility. Just last week, the House reformulated the allocation process for Homeland Security funding to ensure funds are not wasted and are used properly for our direct Homeland Security needs. “In this post-9/11 world, everything must be done to keep America secure,” said Rep. Foxx. “If we fail at protecting our nation, nothing else will matter.” ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) made the following remarks on the House floor this morning:"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and commend President Bush and the Committee on Implementation of Textile Agreements for recently implementing safeguards against Chinese imports of cotton shirts, cotton trousers and cotton and man-made fiber underwear. Since the lifting of quotas by the WTO in January, shirts, trousers and underwear, which represent more textile jobs than any other section in America, have been under attack due to the flood of Chinese imports currently coming into our country. This fast action will save thousands of textile jobs in this country and my District. "However, Mr. Speaker, I was disheartened to hear the comments on the safeguard sanctions by the spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. He said in a statement that China believes its exports of cotton knit shirts, cotton trousers and cotton and man-made fiber underwear have not disrupted the U.S. market. I think a 1,573 percent increase in trouser imports in first three months of this year constitutes market disruption. I think a 1,277 percent increase in shirt imports in the first three months of this year constitutes a market disruption. Let me repeat, those numbers are for the first three months of this year! Think what would happen if we didn't implement the China safeguards. "The Ministry of Commerce went on to say, The U.S. decision runs counter to the World Trade Organization's agreements on trade of textile and apparel products and deviates from the WTO spirit of free trade. I took specific note of this statement because China's idea of fair trade is government subsidies of its textile and apparel exports to the United States, currency manipulation, export tax rebates, forgiveness of loans by its government banks and direct payments to its state-owned textile and apparel industry. Fortunately, the rest of the world does not think like the Chinese."I applaud Secretary Gutierrez and his panel for helping to level the playing field for our domestic textile and manufacturing. Thank you."###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) made the following remarks on the floor of U.S. House of Representatives regarding the nomination of John Bolton to serve as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations:“Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of John Bolton's nomination as our ambassador to the United Nations. “Although I am not able to vote on his nomination, since I am not a Member of the United States Senate, I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to support his nomination. I am pleased that the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has agreed to put his nomination before the full Senate for an up-or-down vote. “Mr. Speaker, the United Nations is in serious need of reform. From enforcing the resolutions the United Nations and its member countries have adopted over the years, to its misuse of funds for many programs across the world, the U.N. is in serious need of reform. The United Nations is rife with fraud, mismanagement, and abuse in many areas of its operations. From the U.N. Oil-for-Food program, to its lack of action with respect to the genocide in Darfur, Sudan, to the horrendous human rights abuses during the U.N. mission in the Congo, the U.N. is in serious need of reform. “I think we can all agree that the most urgent threat to international peace and security today is terrorism, yet the U.N. cannot even agree upon a definition for terrorism. Perhaps this is because its membership consists of several terror-sponsoring states. The U.N. counts the world's leading human rights violators and repressive governments among its membership, and even taps many of them to be in leadership positions on its subcommittees. I find this completely outrageous and dangerously ironic. “Last time I checked, the U.N. charter states that it is supposed to ‘maintain international peace and security; to promote equal rights and self-determination of peoples without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; to help solve problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character; to encourage social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.’“The U.N. needs reform and Mr. Bolton is the right man to voice our encouragement for these reforms. Mr. Bolton has a proven track record in working with the United Nations in the past. In conjunction with efforts by Secretary James Baker to resolve conflict in the Western Sahara, he actually worked for the U.N. pro bono between 1997 and 2000. While serving as Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations from 1989 to 1993, he worked on other key diplomatic initiatives and U.N. reforms, including the repayment of arrearages in U.N. assessments that had been created during the 1980s. He has worked tirelessly in various capacities to help combat the spread of dangerous weapons of mass destruction through his lengthy and distinguished career. BOLTON SUPPORT“Mr. Bolton has served this Nation well. There is no doubt in my mind that he will serve our great Nation with distinction and will be a strong voice for reform at a time when the United Nations desperately needs it. I applaud his nomination and encourage his approval by the U.S. Senate to serve our great Nation. Let Mr. Bolton be our voice to the U.N. that these reforms must be made.” ###
05.12.2005	Today U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) demonstrated her enduring loyalty to emergency service personnel by voting to ensure more effective and efficient funding for first responders. “While there are many other important issues, homeland security is the most significant priority for our nation,” said Rep. Foxx. “Without strong homeland security, the other issues cannot be dealt with. One of my top priorities as a Member of Congress is to make sure fire fighters, police officers and EMS workers get the support and share of homeland security money they deserve.”The Faster and Smarter Funding for First Responders Act (H.R. 1544) will streamline terrorism preparedness grants by moving the planning process ahead of the grant making. “This common sense change will help eliminate unnecessary delays and waste of vital homeland security dollars,” said Rep. Foxx. “Now homeland security plans will be in place before a grant is ever awarded.” The bill will also encourage regional cooperation to increase emergency preparedness. Interstate and intrastate regions will now be permitted to apply for terrorism preparedness grants.Finally, H.R. 1544 will provide priority assistance to first responders facing the greatest risk. This change coincides with recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission. Currently, funding is distributed to localities based on population rather than risk. “As it stands, North Carolina is the 13th largest state, but 49th on the priority list for homeland security funds,” said Rep. Foxx. “With Fort Bragg, the Research Triangle Park and other key terrorist targets, our state is certainly not the second to last in need of funding. This legislation will change that.”The bill was endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, International Association of Fire Fighters, National Volunteer Fire Council, American Ambulance Association, Major County Sheriff’s Association, National Troopers Coalition and many other emergency response associations. It passed the House in a 409-10 vote.###

However, Mr. Speaker, more still can and must be done to secure our borders and combat illegal immigration.“The terrorist attacks on our homeland highlighted the potential disastrous effects of porous borders and the need to bolster border security.“The problem of illegal immigration also has additional far-reaching dangerous effects. Ultimately, it punishes all who follow the laws and processes of the United States.“Immigration affects virtually every aspect of life in America. With more than a million legal and illegal immigrants settling in the United States each year, a level higher than any other time during our nation’s history, immigration has an impact on education, health care, social security, taxes, employment, the environment, crime and countless other areas of American life.“Mr. Speaker, I sympathize with those who desperately wish to live the American dream here, on American soil. I understand their desire for liberty, free markets, and guaranteed rights. The demand for access to America is a resounding testament to the greatness of our Nation.“However, immigration laws exist to provide the necessary steps for safe and legal entry into this country. We have an immigration process in place that simply must be followed.“ILLEGAL immigration must be stopped, but we cannot and should not close our doors to those who wish to enter the country legally.“We must increase our efforts at achieving closed borders with open, guarded doors.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted for an emergency wartime supplemental conference report (H.R. 1268) to provide funding for both national defense and border security. The report passed 368-58. “I applaud my colleagues for providing $75.9 billion in defense funding to train and equip our troops,” said Rep. Foxx. “These men and women risk their lives for us on a daily basis. The very least we can do is provide the resources they need.” The conference report will increase financial aid to families who lose their loved ones in combat by increasing life insurance benefits and the one time death gratuity. The maximum Servicemember Group Life Insurance benefit will increase from $250,000 to $400,000 and the death gratuity will increase from $12,000 to $100,000.The report also provides for a new insurance benefit allotting up to $100,000 for soldiers who lose a limb or suffer other traumatic injuries. Provisions of the “Real I.D. Act” are also included in the conference report. “This will complete the mission of the 9/11 Commission’s recommendations by implementing common sense reforms to strengthen border security and protect our homeland,” said Rep. Foxx.Among the most significant reforms are increased standards for obtaining state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. H.R. 1268 will now require that identification used for federal purposes (such as entering federal facilities or boarding commercial airlines) must meet strict federal security standards. These include providing proof of lawful presence in the United States.“Driver’s licenses have become the main form of identification in our country,” said Rep. Foxx. “The majority of the states have recognized the need for setting high standards for obtaining them. However, 11 States, including my State of North Carolina, issue valid driver's licenses and identification cards without requiring proof of legal status. In a time where terrorism is a real concern, we cannot allow this type of loophole to exist.”Upon passage by the U.S. Senate, H.R. 1268 will go to President Bush for final approval.###

Armed with the proper skills, our students can achieve anything they set their minds to do. “Mr. Boehner and Mr. Castle are to be commended for putting together a bill that strengthens accountability so that we can ensure that the vocational and technical courses provided to our students are the best that can be offered. Our students deserve no less. “This bill also includes provisions to ensure states and local communities will have more control, rather than the federal government. In this bill, state and local communities are empowered to determine academic content and curriculum. This is an extremely important part designed to provide students with an appropriate education based on what skills and industries are important to their local communities. “H.R. 366 streamlines federal funding of vocational and technical education programs; thereby, increasing flexibility for states and allowing more funding to reach the local communities. “The benefits of vocational and technical education to our communities are incredible. With the world changing so rapidly and all of the constant changes in our workforce, education is the key to our success as a nation. In order to keep our nation competitive in the global economy, we must ensure that our students maintain the best opportunities to better themselves, learn a new skill, and give back to their communities. “The key to good education does not lie in the hands of the federal government; it lies in the willing and able hands of those in our localities. That is why I am supporting this bill. Our students deserve no less than the best education. With these tools, the possibilities are endless.” ###
04.29.2005	Bill Adheres to RoboCop’s Prime Directives: Serve the public trust, protect the innocent, uphold the law United States Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) has introduced legislation that would allow citizens to be placed on a “do not call list” fo share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071WASHINGTON – United States Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) has introduced legislation that would allow citizens to be placed on a “do not call list” for recorded political telephone messages or “robo calls.”The “ROBO C.O.P.” bill, which stands for Robo Calls Off Phones, will direct the Federal Trade Commission to revise its regulations for the “do-not-call registry” and allow politically oriented recorded messages to be added to that list.At her constituents’ request, Rep. Foxx pledged to introduce the bill after dozens of recorded political calls went out in the weeks prior to last year’s elections.“During my campaign, I made thousands of personal calls to voters to ask for support. Many of them were relieved to hear from a live human being but frustrated about the number of ‘robo calls’ they were receiving,” said Rep. Foxx. “Many indicated they would not vote because of those ‘robo calls.’ As candidates, the last thing we should do is discourage people from voting.”Rep. Foxx explained that when a live person makes calls for a campaign, it gives voters the opportunity to ask questions about a candidate and his or her platform. She also pointed out that live calls allow voters the opportunity to ask to be removed from a calling list. Recorded calls do not offer voters that opportunity. “Just like unsolicited calls from sales companies, ‘robo calls’ are a nuisance to many families. We should allow voters who do not want to receive these calls to opt out. Those who do not mind recorded calls do not have to sign up for the list,” said Rep. Foxx. “This is simply an issue of respecting people’s privacy.” ###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) joined her colleagues in the U.S. House tonight in voting for the FY 2006 Budget Resolution Conference Report. The budget provides additional funds for a stronger national defense and implements $106 billion in tax relief over the next five years. The budget also steers the country on the path to reduce the federal deficit in half by 2010. “I am pleased that we are working to slow the rate of growth on federal government spending,” said Rep. Foxx. “This budget is fiscally responsible because it calls for $35 billion in savings in mandatory spending and $843 billion in cuts in discretionary spending over the next five years. It also presents ample tax relief to hard working Americans.”The Budget Resolution Conference Report will increase defense funding by 4.8 percent and homeland security funding by 2.3 percent. Overall discretionary spending will be cut by almost one percent.“This budget will hold federal programs to a firm test of accountability and ensure that the government spends taxpayers’ dollars more wisely,” said Rep. Foxx.The Fiscal Year 2006 Budget Resolution Conference Report passed the U.S. House 214 to 211. The U.S. Senate will vote on the resolution tomorrow.###
04.27.2005	Tonight U.S. Rep.

Virginia Foxx, (N.C.-5) voted to make it a federal offense to knowingly transport a minor across state lines in order to obtain an abortion in a state without parental notification laws. The Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act, which Rep. Foxx co-sponsored, passed the House 270 to 157.Rep. Foxx made the following remarks during debate on the House floor earlier this afternoon:“Unfortunately, only about half of our states currently have parental notification or consent laws in effect. All too often, these laws are circumvented by those wishing to take minors to other states that do not have parental notification requirements. This often happens under heavy pressure from older boyfriends or at the urging of abortion providers.“In order to protect the welfare of young girls and the rights of their parents, Congress has a duty to regulate this interstate activity.“Furthermore, those who manipulate and abuse young, vulnerable pregnant girls should be punished. This must include irresponsible abortionists who perform abortions on young girls from other states.“As federal lawmakers, we also have an obligation to protect the rights of the states.“Unfortunately, when it comes to abortion, these state laws are being trampled on at the expense of vulnerable young girls and their families.“Life does begin at conception and it is sacred. We should do all we can to protect life. This includes empowering the states that have parental notification laws to enforce them.“Abortionists should not be rewarded for opening their businesses to new markets in other states. The health and well being of these young girls is at risk.“I am optimistic about the future of this legislation because of the tenacity of Congresswoman Illeana Ros-Lehtinen, the 129 co-sponsors of this bill, and the support the Judiciary Committee Chairman and our leadership in the House.“Life is a gift from God delivered at conception. It must be protected and cherished from that point forward. I am happy and honored to be here with my colleagues today to celebrate another great stride toward that goal.”###

His record of success places him fifth on the NCAA career coaching wins list, just behind Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, Bob Knight and Jim Phelean. “Under Coach Gaines’ leadership, the Winston-Salem State Rams won eleven CIAA titles and became the first predominantly black college to ever win an NCAA basketball title. “Coach Gaines was inducted into many halls of fame and was named CIAA Coach of the Year several times. He was also named NCAA Coach of the Year in 1967. “Coach Gaines was a truly remarkable man and he will be missed. My condolences go out to his wife, Clara, and his two children.” ###
04.13.2005	New law will help save small businesses, family farms U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5.) voted this evening to permanently repeal the Death Tax. Prior to voting on H.R. 8, she submitted the following statement for publication in the Congre share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071WASHINGTON – U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5.) voted this evening to permanently repeal the Death Tax. Prior to voting on H.R. 8, she submitted the following statement for publication in the Congressional Record:“Today I voice my strong support for the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005. It is imperative we pass this very important legislation. The Death Tax is an unreasonable and unfair burden on thousands of American families, small businesses, and family farms. The Death Tax is the largest threat to the vitality of family-owned businesses and farms because most of their owners have the entire value of their business or farm in their estate. The federal government currently receives nearly half of an estate when the owner passes. As a result, more than two-thirds of family businesses do not survive the second generation and nearly 90 percent do not make it to the third generation. So much for the American dream. Rather than encouraging people to build their own livelihoods, the Death Tax discourages hard work and savings.According to the Heritage Foundation, the Death Tax costs our country up to 250,000 jobs each year. By permanently abolishing this tax, we could add more than 100,000 jobs per year. As my colleague, Rep. Sam Johnson, said: Americans receive a birth certificate when they are born, a marriage license when they are wed, and a tax bill when they die. This is a disgrace. I encourage my colleagues to vote ‘YES’ for the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005.”H.R. 8 passed the House of Representatives in a 272-162 vote.###
04.11.2005	‘H.E.R.O.’ Act will help soldiers save for retirement U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) announced today that she has introduced her first piece of legislation.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) announced today that she has introduced her first piece of legislation. The Heroes Earned Retirement Opportunities (H.E.R.O.) Act seeks to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow soldiers earning hazard pay to be eligible for retirement account contributions.Rep. Foxx introduced H.R. 1499 in response to a letter from the father of a soldier who spent most of 2004 in Iraq. The father, from Clemmons, N.C., was frustrated because his son did not earn enough taxable income to take full advantage of Individual Retirement Accounts. According to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, combat “hazard pay” is not considered taxable income. This is an important benefit for members of the Armed Forces who risk their lives to protect our freedom. Unfortunately, our heroes are penalized when it comes to contributions to their IRAs. “If anyone has earned the opportunity to contribute to an IRA, it is these heroes,” said Rep. Foxx.The H.E.R.O. Act would count hazard pay as taxable income for the purpose of IRA contributions without actually taxing it. This will allow soldiers to make the maximum yearly contribution to their retirement accounts. Rep. Foxx said she believes those who are responsible enough to save should be able to take full advantage of IRAs – especially since they have served their country.“The purpose of hazard pay is to reward soldiers for their service, just as one goal of our tax code should be to encourage savings,” said Rep. Foxx. “The H.E.R.O. Act is a common sense, fiscally responsible piece of legislation that will help our servicemen and women without costing taxpayers a penny.”“I want to thank Rep. Foxx for not only listening to a problem that many men and women in uniform face, but moving so quickly to introduce a bill to fix it,” said Spc. Michael Hensley. “On behalf of all soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, I thank Virginia Foxx for fighting on our behalf in the United States Congress.”If the H.E.R.O. Act passes, it will apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) commended the U.S. Department of Commerce for taking action this week to protect American textile and apparel manufacturing jobs. She also joined four major American textile associations in calling for tougher restrictions on textile and clothing imports from China.“I commend Commerce Secretary Gutierrez for self-initiating the China Textile Safeguard on cotton trousers, shirts and underwear,” said Rep. Foxx. “Too many North Carolinians have lost their textile manufacturing jobs since the quotas on Chinese imports were lifted at the beginning of this year. It is unfair that China has been able to subsidize its industry and export its products without any limitations. No industry playing by free-market rules can compete with a country that allows illegal currency manipulation, state-owned enterprises and reduced or free utilities. ”Foxx said that Secretary Gutierrez has taken a “good first step” in addressing the problem but pointed out that more categories of American textiles need protection. Today the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, the National Council of Textile Organizations, the National Textile Association and the National Cotton Council of America filed seven petitions to limit additional categories of textile imports from China. The categories include both cotton and man-made fiber versions of non-knit shirts, sweaters, brassieres, dressing gowns and fabrics as well as man-made knit shirts and trousers.“We must implement safeguards on these additional categories immediately before more American plants close and more workers lose their jobs,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Pope John Paul II was a wonderful humanitarian who was much more than just the leader of the Catholic Church. He was a servant of God whose purpose in life was to work on behalf of all of humanity.“The Pope was a courageous man who worked to make the world a better place by fighting for basic human rights.

A new station will help the Fire and EMS Department to improve their response times and increase the overall quality of their services.”She continued, “Our firefighters and emergency service personnel risk their lives for us on a daily basis. It is important that we provide them with the resources they need to do their jobs.”The USDA’s rural development funds will be used to build a new 16,000 square foot station. The facility will service a 52 square mile region, including business, ski resort and historical areas.###

Virginia Foxx voted against legislation that would permit federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell lines. H.R. 810, the Stem Cell Research Act, would order federal funding of stem cells derived from killing human embryos. Despite the work of Rep. Foxx and her pro-life colleagues, the bill passed the House in a 238 to 194 vote.“I am extremely saddened that this irresponsible bill has passed,” said Rep. Foxx. “Supporters of this bill are asking taxpayers to foot the bill for the destruction of viable and innocent human embryos. This is a very sad day for the House. I strongly encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to do what is morally right and vote against this bill. I also applaud President Bush for committing to veto this bill if it passes the Senate.”Rep. Foxx has worked hard throughout this session to protect the sanctity of human life. She made the following remarks during debate this afternoon:“Mr. Speaker, as stewards of hard-working Americans’ tax dollars, we cannot ask our constituents to fund the killing of human embryos.“Like the rest of my colleagues joining me today, I am strongly in support of scientific research to save and improve human life.“But to fund federal research on stem cells derived from killing human embryos is unethical and irresponsible.“While stem cell research has never been prohibited in the private sector, President Bush permitted the usage of embryonic stem cell lines sufficient for extensive, government funded research nearly 4 years ago.“In these 4 years, government and private research on those stem cells has produced nothing, cured no one and there is no indication that will change!“In the meantime, ethical research, not derived from embryos, in the public and private sectors has helped cure almost 60 diseases.“The private sector has proven the superiority and promise of cord blood and adult stem cell research by choosing to fund those areas. Let us learn from their example and not squander taxpayer dollars on unethical research. “Mr. Speaker, we do have ‘the power of the purse,’ and we cannot misuse it by funding the slaughter of human life.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) is pleased to announce that the U.S. House of Representatives took emergency action early this morning to save the life of Terri Schiavo. The House joined the U.S. Senate in passing legislation permitting a federal district court to review Schiavo’s case. President Bush signed the bill this morning. Rep. Foxx made the following remarks during debate on the House floor last night: “Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day in America when a society as great as ours and filled with as many opportunities as ours, turns its back on one of it’s most vulnerable, disabled citizens. It is unfortunate that it has come to this. “Those who have said that this issue should be a private and personal matter are correct. I agree with them. Congress has no business interjecting its opinion in the ‘end of life’ decisions of any family. But that is not what we’re doing here. Terry Schiavo is not ‘brain dead.’ She is not on artificial life support. She is not terminally ill or in the process of dying. She is brain damaged, but if given the chance to be rehabilitated again, there’s no telling what she can do. “Congress is merely saying to the nation that we think a federal court should look into this case and determine whether or not her Constitutional right to life has been infringed upon. “‘End of life’ decisions are excruciatingly difficult for any family to have to make. I don’t think anyone here in this legislative body wants to interject their opinion in any family’s decision. “But starving a woman to death – when death is not imminent – is wrong. Terri Schiavo deserves to have her Constitutional rights protected. “Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers are with Terri and her parents and siblings tonight. I just hope she doesn’t starve to death before her constitutionally protected rights are given back to her.” ###

Federal law protects witnesses called before official Congressional committee proceedings from anyone who may obstruct or impede a witness’ attendance or testimony. The House subpoena has been joined by a Senate investigation. Rep. Foxx issued the following statement today: “I applaud Government Reform Committee Chairman Tom Davis and the House leadership for initiating an inquiry into the long term care of incapacitated adults and taking this step to protect the life of Terri Schiavo. This is a critical public policy issue that affects many disabled Americans and their families. We need to be diligent in examining the policies and procedures involved in this case. “I am absolutely committed to protecting all innocent human life. People with disabilities, like Terri Schiavo, have the right to be valued and protected. This subpoena is a good first step in making sure that her right to life is not infringed.” ###

In order to keep spending in check, Foxx also joined her colleagues in the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC) in changing House rules to improve fiscal discipline. “I am encouraged that we have passed a fiscally responsible budget that funds our top priorities while reining in spending and reducing the federal deficit,” said Rep. Foxx. “This budget promotes continued growth by stimulating our economy and creating jobs.”Foxx said she is pleased the budget will cut the federal deficit in half by 2009 without implementing any tax increases. The budget will lower the deficit by reducing total non-security discretionary spending by 0.8 percent and slowing the growth of mandatory spending by 0.1 percent over five years.“It is important that we hold federal programs to a firm test of accountability and stop funding programs that no longer serve their intended purpose or perform a vital function,” she said.The budget will implement $106 billion in tax relief over five years and provide for top priorities such as national defense, homeland security and job creation. In order to improve fiscal responsibility, Foxx and other members of the RSC secured a change in House rules that would require a vote if a spending bill goes over the budget. This vote will make sure that Congress lives within its budget. The budget does not determine or dictate specific funding or policy decisions. It simply sets the top-line budget authority number. Decisions about funding levels for specific programs are made by the Appropriations Committee.###
03.16.2005	Congresswoman also pushes to increase survivor benefits This afternoon, U.S. Rep.

H share: f t FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASECONTACT: Amy Auth202-225-2071WASHINGTON – This afternoon, U.S. Rep. Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) demonstrated her ongoing commitment to U.S. troops and their families by voting to pass an $81.4 billion wartime supplemental bill. H.R. 1268 provides the funds necessary to continue fighting the War on Terror while providing our men and women in uniform with vital equipment and training.“Our country is fortunate to have the best-trained and most dedicated soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines in the world,” said Rep. Foxx. “The funds included in this supplemental bill will help ensure that our troops have the proper supplies and protective gear they need to stay safe and carry out their missions.” The bill provides $75 million to purchase 47,000 additional sets of body armor and $185 million to buy an additional 1700 armored Humvees. It also includes the funds necessary to create at least 10 additional combat brigades, which will reduce the stress on the current active duty combat forces.In addition, the supplemental bill recognizes the need to provide for the families of soldiers who lose their lives in combat. It increases the death gratuity from $12,000 to $100,000 and raises the maximum Servicemember Group Life Insurance benefit from $250,000 to $400,000. Finally, the bill appropriates nearly $7 billion for training Iraqi and Afghani security forces to prepare them to defend their own countries. “Training our allies to defend themselves and protect their newly found freedoms will certainly help us to bring our troops home faster,” said Rep. Foxx.Foxx joined with other conservatives to remove $592 million from the bill for construction of a U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. Citing fiscal responsibility, Foxx said she believes this was not an emergency expenditure and should be addressed in the normal budgetary process.“I believe in exercising fiscal restraint whenever possible,” said Rep. Foxx. “Protecting our country and taking care of our men and women in uniform should be our top priority.”###

Local leaders have identified these projects as a key economic development priority for the area.“Transportation and infrastructure are key components of my economic development efforts for Forsyth County,” said Rep. Foxx. “That is why I worked so hard with local officials and Congressional leaders to secure these funds.”The $9 million was included in H.R. 3, the Transportation Equity Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday. The bill now awaits approval from the U.S. Senate. The projects that Foxx was able to include in the bill are:$1 million for the 1-40/Union Cross Road Interchange. This project will reduce traffic congestion leading into the Dell computer plant which is expected to open in the summer of 2005.$5 million to improve the eastern section from U.S. Highway 52 to Business 40, and the Eastern Extension from Business 40 to U.S. Highway 311. These roadways will become part of the new I-74 high priority corridor.$3 million for transportation improvements at Piedmont Triad Research Park. This project will fund a new road network with interstate connections, pedestrian trails, bridges and rail relocation. The PTRP will be the nation’s largest urban research park and will bring thousands of jobs to Forsyth County.Foxx held a listening tour with community leaders in January to discuss funding priorities. She also worked closely with Chairman Don Young of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to ensure the local funds were included in H.R. 3.“I am pleased this bill has passed the House because it will encourage economic development, reduce traffic congestion and increase driver safety,” said Rep. Foxx. “This is a great first step and I strongly encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to pass this important legislation.”###

Foxx. “Scottish-Americans have played a tremendous role in making our country great. Nearly half of the signers of the Declaration of Independence were of Scottish decent. In addition, Scottish-Americans have contributed greatly to America’s success in the fields of science, medicine, government, politics, economics, architecture, literature and the arts.” April 6 has special significance because the Scottish Declaration of Independence, the Declaration of Arbroath, was signed on April 6, 1320.

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted today for H.R. 27, the Job Training Improvement Act. This bill, which passed the House 224-200, will strengthen America’s job training system and help states and localities prepare workers to find quality jobs. “I want more money for workers who need job training and less to money for Washington bureaucrats,” said Rep. Foxx. “As a former community college president, I understand as much as anyone just how important this job training money is for the people in my district.” The Job Training Improvement Act will help streamline the country’s job training system by reducing unnecessary rules and regulations, consolidating programs, increasing cooperation among workforce development partners, increasing flexibility and reducing administrative costs. The legislation builds upon reforms made in the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) improvements that were implemented in 1998. However, while those reforms have provided workers with tools necessary to rejoin the workforce or retrain for better jobs, several areas of waste and inefficiency still plague the system. Also included in the job training bill are hiring protections for faith-based service providers that participate in the job training programs. The 1964 Civil Rights Act protects the rights of religious organizations to take maintain their mission in their hiring practices. “This debate is about whether a religious organization should have the ability to select employees who share common values and sense of purpose. This is a vital criterion for all organizations, especially religious organizations,” said Rep. Foxx during debate on the House floor this afternoon. “A secular group, such as Planned Parenthood or the Sierra Club, which receives government money is currently free to hire based on its ideology and mission, but still use federal funds… How can we allow this for groups such as these and not allow it for groups who are religious by nature?” Finally, H.R. 27 will offer personal reemployment accounts of up to $3,000 to help unemployed Americans to purchase job training and other services such as child care, transportation services and housing assistance as they try to get back to work. These personal reemployment accounts are available by application in competitive grant processes. “I am delighted that we have passed the Job Training Improvement Act so that those people in the Fifth District who desperately need job training services may benefit,” said Rep. Foxx. ###

Act,’ particularly its provisions calling for stronger standards for obtaining driver’s licenses. Page 47 of the 9/11 Commission Report states, ‘Without freedom of movement, terrorists cannot plan, conduct surveillance, hold meetings, train for their mission or execute an attack.’“Others have argued that the proposal involves an unprecedented preemption of State authority regarding the issuance and production of driver's licenses. This is untrue. Let me be clear: We are not preempting State authority in this area. What we are doing is establishing minimum standards for Federal acceptance of such documents. This is consistent with actions taken by individual states. Today, Nevada and New Mexico do not accept as proof of identity a state-issued driver's license or identification card from states that do not meet their standards. “The federalism issue is one of extreme importance, and that is exactly why the language has been crafted as it has. Driver's licenses have become the primary form of identification in the United States. They permit people to apply for other forms of identification, transfer funds to bank accounts, obtain access to Federal buildings, purchase firearms and board airplanes.“The majority of the states have recognized the privilege that a license brings and have set high standards for obtaining them. However, 10 States, including my state of North Carolina, issue valid driver's licenses and identification cards without requiring proof of legal status. That is scary. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, these travel documents are just as important as weapons are to terrorists. “The Real I.D. Act would require that Federal agencies accept only driver's licenses and state-issued identification cards from States that prove the legal status of applicants. The bill would also require States to review the legality of existing license holders upon renewal or replacement. The bill does not seek to set State policy for who may or who may not drive a car. It aims to set rigorous standards for what may be used as a form of ID to a Federal official. BORDER SECURITY PASSAGE“As I have stated before, I am a strong advocate of States' rights. However, if certain States act irresponsibly and place the national security of the rest of the country at risk, then Congress must get involved. We must do what it takes to make America safe.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) voted to strongly encourage the U.S. Department of Defense to continue to support the activities of the Boy Scouts of America. The Department has shared its resources with the scouts for over 30 years with permission from Congress. However, the Pentagon recently informed American military bases that they should not sponsor Boy Scout troops because the scouts are required to swear an oath to God. The Pentagon took this action to settle a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against the Department of Defense alleging a violation between the separation of church and state.“The Boy Scouts of America is an outstanding organization. It teaches young boys time honored values such as loyalty, preparedness, citizenship and character. To deprive this organization of support simply because they swear an oath to God is beyond comprehension,” said Rep. Foxx.Approximately one million children are enrolled in the Boy Scouts. Troops often use Department of Defense facilities such as military bases to hold meetings and jamborees because many would not be able to afford the use of a private facility.“To let the ACLU dictate policies that infringe upon scouts’ right to continue their time honored traditions and exercise their First Amendment right of free worship is unconscionable,” said Rep. Foxx. “I applaud Chairman Joel Hefley (R-Colo.) for bringing this important issue to the floor.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) made the following remarks on the floor of the United States House of Representatives:“I commend President Bush for proposing a fiscally responsible budget that will rein in federal spending and protect our top priorities such as national defense, homeland security, and job creation. While we may have some differences of opinion on a few of the details, I believe that the President’s budget is a good first step in the right direction. I am encouraged that he wants to hold federal programs to a firm test of accountability and eliminate programs that no longer serve their intended purpose or perform a vital function. This action alone will save over $20 billion in 2006. The President’s proposed budget will also save an addition $137 billion in spending during the next 10 years. I look forward to working with the President and Congress to craft a budget that will cut our federal deficit in half by 2009 and improve our economy.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) has voted to strongly discourage the European Union from ending its arms embargo against the People’s Republic of China. Rep. Foxx believes that if the EU ends its sanctions, the United States could ultimately face a serious national security crisis.The United States and European Union imposed arms embargos on China following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Hundreds of unarmed political protestors were killed or wounded while calling for reform. However, citing a growing deficit with China, along with the potential for increased trade, the EU may lift the embargo within the next six months. China has agreed to forgive European debt in exchange for weapons and military technology.What concerns Rep. Foxx is that nothing would prevent China from transferring the weapons or technologies to less stable regions of the world. In addition, nothing would prevent China from using the resources to continue to violate basic human rights within its own country. “If the EU lifts the sanctions, what is going to stop China from selling the weapons to North Korea or terrorists in the Middle East?” asked Rep. Foxx. “What will stop them from using these weapons to repeat Tiananmen Square?”In addition to these concerns, Rep. Foxx points out that the end of the weapons embargo will heighten tensions between China and its current military targets, Taiwan and Japan.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) attended the State of the Union Address and issued the following remarks:“Tonight, the President did a magnificent job outlining his domestic and foreign policy goals for the next four years. “He made the case for Social Security reform so that our children and grandchildren can have a secure retirement. Obviously, the details on how we are going to get there will have to be ironed out in the upcoming months. I look forward to seeing the details of his plan. “The President also spoke about building on the economic momentum of the past few years, noting that 2.3 million jobs were created in the last year alone. He emphasized the need for legal and tax reform and stressed his commitment to fiscal discipline so that we can cut the federal deficit in half by 2009. I look forward to working with him to reign in federal spending. “The President paid appropriate tribute to the troops who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to secure our freedom. They are doing the right thing in the War on Terror by helping to advance the spread of freedom and democracy throughout world.“After attending the State of the Union, I am convinced more than ever that President Bush is leading our nation in the right direction. I look forward to continuing to work with him and the rest of Congress to make positive changes for our country.”###

This election is an important step on the road to peace and stability in the Middle East. The Iraqi people will no longer be forced to live under tyrannical rule, as they have for the past three decades. With the Transitional National Assembly in place, the Iraqi people will finally have the opportunity to draft a constitution that represents their will to have a secure and democratic way of life. “While the road to building a democracy in Iraq has not been easy, it is the right thing to do. I applaud our President and our allies in the international community for supporting the Iraqi people’s desire for freedom.“I would also like commend our brave men and women in uniform who are doing a tremendous job in the war on terror. They are performing magnificently under difficult conditions. Without their sacrifice, this election and the freedom that the Iraqi people now enjoy would not be possible. Without their sacrifice, Americans would not be able to continue to enjoy the freedom we cherish.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) joined House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner, (R-Wis.) in sponsoring major legislation seeking to tighten our borders and strengthen immigration reform in the United States.The “Real I.D. Act” is the first bill Foxx has co-sponsored since being sworn in to Congress earlier this month.The legislation calls for the establishment of rigorous proof of identity and strong security requirements for all applicants for driver's licenses and state issued identity cards. It will also strengthen asylum reform, close a hole in the border fence and permit all terrorism-related grounds for inadmissibility to be grounds for deportation.“The implementation of this bill is vital to our homeland security,” said Rep. Foxx. “Currently, anyone in North Carolina and nine other states can receive a driver’s license or I.D. card without proving their legal status. To me, that is just begging for disaster.”This security crisis was brought closer to home in recent reports by CNN and The Greensboro News & Record highlighting security lapses at the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles. Both reports highlighted multiple instances of state driver’s licenses being issued to “unlawful immigrants.”The News & Record article released today contained excerpts from a memo issued in August 2003 by the supervisor of the driver’s license section of DMV. “If local law enforcement wants to make an issue of their legal status, that obviously is their right and responsibility depending on the statutes under which they operate,” said Wayne Hurder. “But let me make it clear – for the umpteenth time – North Carolina General Statutes, Chapter 20 does not involve itself with a person’s legal status in determining their eligibility to apply for a license.” DMV officials are distancing themselves from the memo. However, the need for reform remains clear.Rep. Foxx points out that each of the terrorists who hijacked the airplanes on Sept. 11 was issued valid driver’s licenses or identification cards. “By allowing undocumented aliens to receive valid driver’s licenses, we are compromising our national security. We must not give legitimacy to individuals who are breaking the law,” she said.Under the terms of the bill, foreign visitors can receive temporary driver’s licenses that expire when the terms of their stays expire.IMMIGRATION REFORM BILLThe bill also includes asylum reform by overturning the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals precedent that barred immigration judges from denying asylum claims. The 9th Circuit Court granted asylum to many aliens whose governments believed they were terrorists because it felt that they were being “persecuted” for their political beliefs.“Terrorists have been abusing our immigration system for years,” said Rep. Foxx. “Many after claiming asylum, such as Ramzi Yousef who planned the first World Trade Center attack, were released from detention and went on to plot and commit crimes. This is unacceptable.”Finally, the bill will expedite closure of a three mile hole in the border between the United States and Mexico near San Diego, Calif. It will also enable the United States to deport aliens for terrorism related offenses that were previously considered to be inadmissible, such as knowingly contributing to a terrorist organization disguised as a charitable organization. The bill was introduced after many of these important provisions were taken out of the 9/11 Commission legislation conference report last month. “I’m pleased that we’re working to see that these issues are addressed and resolved,” said Rep. Foxx.###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) delivered her first “special order” speech on the floor of the United States House of Representatives. Her remarks addressed the issue of medical malpractice reform. The following is a transcript of her statement:“Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss an issue of great importance to the citizens of the Fifth District of North Carolina. We are deeply concerned about the skyrocketing cost of medical malpractice insurance because it is limiting access to quality and affordable health care in the rural portions of Western North Carolina. “The escalating cost of health care is a major concern in the Fifth District. Just two weeks ago, I held meetings with community leaders in all twelve counties in my district. The issue of the rising costs of medical insurance was raised at each and every meeting. After all, the American Medical Association has determined that North Carolina is one of 19 states in the country that is currently identified as a ‘crisis’ state. Due to an onslaught of frivolous lawsuits, our physicians are being forced to pay exorbitant premiums on their liability insurance. The rates have risen so high that many family practitioners and OB/GYNs are being forced to retire early or simply go out of business. Doctors are refusing to deliver babies or perform surgery because they’re afraid of being sued. This is especially a problem in our rural communities where many doctors are sole practitioners. “Just as alarming, our medical school enrollments are on the decline, which will limit the health care available to our future generations.“Recently, I spent two days with medical professionals in my district. According to the experts in the medical community of Forsyth County, there was at least a 20 percent to 40 percent increase last year in medical malpractice insurance. The biggest impact was felt in the specialty fields like OB/GYN, emergency medicine and surgery. What is happening across North Carolina is that doctors are no longer going into specialized fields like Obstetrics. This is shortchanging the people of the Fifth District because it is limiting access to the health care specialists they need. We must remember that this is an issue that affects everyone, not just doctors.“In early 2003 with the backing of the Bush Administration, the U.S. House of Representatives moved quickly to address medical liability reform by passing HR 5, the HEALTH (Help Efficient, Accessible, Low-cost, Timely Healthcare) Act. Unfortunately, the U.S. Senate failed to pass this meaningful and important legislation. I look forward to the debate this year in the House. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House and Senate to address this health care crisis. We need to enact meaningful medical malpractice reform.MEDICAL MALPRACTICE SPEECHMy priority is that the citizens of the Fifth District of North Carolina and all across the nation have continued access to quality, affordable health care. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I yield back the balance of my time.”###

Virginia Foxx (N.C.-5) attended a briefing at the Pentagon by Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on important issues pertaining to national security and foreign relations. The topics discussed at the private briefing for freshman Members of Congress included the progress being made in the War on Terror and the upcoming elections in Iraq. Foxx and her colleagues also learned about the structure and operations of the Department of Defense. “This was an extremely valuable and informative briefing which helped me to gain a better understanding of the inner workings of the Pentagon,” said Rep. Foxx. “After this meeting, I am more committed than ever to standing firm behind President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld and our troops in the War on Terror.” Rep. Foxx said that she was especially impressed by the success stories of our nation’s men and women in uniform. “They’re winning the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people,” she said. The Congresswoman said that there is no alternative to victory in Iraq and that she looks forward to seeing the Iraqi elections move forward as scheduled at the end of the month. She said that while building a democracy in Iraq will not be an easy task, it is necessary for the Iraqi people to exercise their democratic rights even under difficult circumstances. “This election will be a huge milestone on the road to peace in the Middle East because it will help bring stability and democracy throughout the region. Of course, I want our troops to be home safe just as much any anyone. And the only way to bring them home is to turn over the security of Iraq to the Iraqi government,” she said. ###
