03.13.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) tomorrow will introduce the Student-Athlete Equity Act, legislation that would amend the definition of a qualified amateur sports organization in the tax code to remove the restriction on student-athletes using or being compensated for use of their name, image and likeness – forcing the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to change it's current model.SPORTS ILLUSTRATED | Rep. Mark Walker Explains Why Congress Is Adding to the NCAA's Amateurism Battles “The NCAA and the schools that run it have long figured that if something doesn’t go their way in federal court in Oakland, they can run across the country to Washington and have congressional Republicans legislate away the pain. If those pesky athletes keep demanding a bigger slice of an ever expanding pie, then the status quo can be maintained as fast as a bill can become a law. But something very interesting has happened in the past week.” … “So the NCAA and schools won’t be needing the GOP caucus to do them a solid. That’s probably a good thing for them, because on Thursday their rules will be challenged in a novel way by a Republican member of the House of Representatives.” ... “That’s what it comes down to for Walker: a basic right. ‘We’re not asking the NCAA or a university to pay a single dollar to any student athlete at any point in time,’ he says. ‘The only thing we’re doing is to remove the ban. When they have to sign over and put a moratorium on their likeness and image, we think that’s un-American. We think that’s wrong, and it’s time for that to be resolved.’”THE WASHINGTON POST | Texas QB sounds off ‘unpaid internship’ of college football “Texas quarterback Sam Ehlinger compared playing college football to an unpaid internship and said he supports a bill expected to be introduced in Congress that would give athletes more opportunities to earn money.”THE SCORE | Politician to propose bill allowing NCAA players to profit off likeness “Walker notes the bill wouldn't produce more costs for the schools or the organization, but rather alleviate the strict income restraints athletes currently face.”BARSTOOL SPORTS | The NC Congressman Who Issued A Bill To Let NCAA Players Get Paid Has My Vote For President “I’ll be honest. I don’t give ONE S&%T about politics. But I will run as VP, I will vote, I will do whatever this guy wants if this bill gets passed. If this is what needs to be done in order for the dumba$# way the NCAA defines amateurism to get changed so be it. I’m here for it.”THE ATHLETIC | Why one congressman is pushing the NCAA to loosen its amateurism rules “Walker moved to North Carolina in 1991, which he describes as the ‘Fab Five vs. Duke days.’ Watching those five freshman stars at Michigan eventually planted an idea in Walker’s head. Sure, three of those Wolverines — Chris Webber, Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard — went on to make millions in the NBA. But what about Jimmy King and Ray Jackson? ‘Those two couldn’t really profit from anything — not from the shoe companies, or for wearing those longer shorts and black socks,’ Walker says. ‘But all these other entities were making millions of dollars off these five kids.’ Now, the 49-year-old Republican representing North Carolina’s 6th District is in position to do something about it.”SPORTS ILLUSTRATED | Recent Legal News Could Have Big Implications for College Football—but Not for Its Video Games “That bill would allow outside entities to pay athletes because of their reputations as athletes, so it would give EA Sports a way to compensate those athletes.”YAHOO SPORTS | Congressman to propose bill that would allow NCAA athletes to make a profit “College athletes and their supporters have been arguing for it for years on end. While making their ascent through the rankings of stardom, many college athletes are struggling to make ends meet practicing a full-time sport while their universities profit selling their name, images and likeness. Think back on how popular college athletes such as Johnny Manziel were during their playing days. Now, think about the fact that of all the memorabilia sold with Manziel’s number and likeness — he failed to make a single cent for any of it. “Mark Walker, a Republican congressman representing North Carolina, plans to propose a bill that will allow NCAA athletes to be able to make a profit for themselves off their name, imagery and likeness from third parties.”ROLL CALL | Rep. Mark Walker wades into fight over student-athlete compensation “In an op-ed last year for the News and Observer, Walker threatened the NCAA with legislative action.” “Walker was a three-sport letterman at Trinity Baptist College and still gets out on the field. Last year he was the the GOP’s starting pitcher at the annual Congressional Baseball Game.”
03.11.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and Tony Cárdenas (D-Calif.) today introduced a resolution expressing support for April 2019 to be recognized as Second Chance Month. A Senate companion bill is being introduced by U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio)."The American story is a history of second chances," Walker said. "From prison to prosperity, we must continue to restore families, heal communities, and help people find redemption. Second Chance Month will promote these opportunities and honor the nonprofit organizations and employers who are empowering individuals with life change." "America is a place of dreamers, second chances, and redemption. Millions of Americans in this country have criminal records, and those who have paid their dues and served their time deserve the opportunity to be contributing members of society," Cárdenas said. "In December, Congress passed the bipartisan First Step Act to help people in jails and prisons prepare for life in the community. With Second Chance Month, we look to shine a light on ways to unlock opportunities for those in search of new life." One in three American adults has a criminal record, which limits their access to education, jobs, housing, and other essentials. These barriers can lead our neighbors back into the cycle of crime. In fact, two-thirds of these individuals are re-arrested within three years of their release. The Second Chance Month designation can contribute to increased public awareness about the impact of collateral consequences, the need for closure for those who have paid their debt, and opportunities for individuals, employers, congregations, and communities to extend a second chance. People who have made mistakes can still have a bright future, and their communities can benefit from their contributions. Walker was a key co-sponsor of the now signed into law First Step Act. In April 2018, Walker and Richmond penned an op-ed for The Hill calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford criminal justice reform the national attention it deserves. The following month, the House passed the original version of the First Step Act. Read the full text of the resolution here.
03.08.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) this week introduced H.R. 1589, the CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2019. Walker serves as the Ranking Member for the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism. This legislation requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), within the Department of Homeland Security, to conduct analysis of terrorist capabilities related to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) materials, as well as threats to the homeland from global infectious disease. The bill further directs I&A to consider how to leverage intelligence information to improve CBRN prevention and recovery programs and requires the agency to share threat information with state and local entities as well as appropriate stakeholders. "Combatting the threat of terrorism takes an international, national, and most importantly, local approach," Walker said. "This legislation will ensure that government entities correctly share information and communicate to keep our communities safe and prosperous." "Information sharing and coordination across the government is essential to combatting terrorism," Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said. "Intelligence and Counterterrorism Ranking Member Walker’s legislation will improve communication among government entities on the threat of weapons of mass destruction. I applaud Rep. Walker for his leadership on such a critical issue." Terrorist groups have long strived to employ CBRN materials in their attacks. Osama bin Laden saw it as an Islamic duty to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and security experts believe this goal has remained a top priority for al Qaeda. As recently as last month, terrorist supporters online were promoting the use of poisons and chemicals in lone wolf attacks.

03.08.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement on H.R. 1, the For the People Act of 2019:“While House Republicans remain committed to producing results, our colleagues across the aisle seem only interested in retaining power and resisting productivity. In an attempt to legislate electoral advantages for their candidates, House Democrats are attempting to force North Carolina taxpayers to pay for campaign ads for California politicians. Instead of counting ballots from the Capitol, the new House majority should be counting the number of people who will be hurt by their policies that will cost $600,000 per household and make private health insurance illegal.” Additionally, today Walker released a mock campaign ad highlighting how the legislation would force taxpayers to pay for campaign ads:
03.07.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement as H.R. 1, the For the People Act, continues to advance in the U.S. House of Representatives, with a final vote on passage expected tomorrow:"For years, conservatives who questioned ballot harvesting – a practice where unvetted organizers can go door-to-door, collecting absentee ballots like Halloween candy – were criticized and demeaned. Now, as we see election fraud in my home state and House Democrats are rightfully calling for additional election security measures, they are rejecting commonsense proposals, fearing a breakdown of their legislated electoral advantages. Ballot harvesting is a cooking pot for election fraud and abuse, and we need to get all the cooks out of the kitchen." Ballot harvesting is a practice where campaign workers or volunteers collect absentee ballots from certain voters and drop them off at a polling place or election office. While the practice is illegal in most states like North Carolina, where we recently saw the North Carolina State Board of Elections issue a new election in the 9th Congressional District under allegations of illegal harvesting of ballots, it is legal in California. Walker introduced an amendment to H.R. 1 during the committee markup that would prohibit the practice of ballot harvesting but was voted down by Committee Democrats, three of which are from California. House Democrats also rejected an amendment offered in Rules Committee by a group of Members from California to prohibit the practice of ballot harvesting."We cannot create election reform aimed at making our system more secure without tackling the clear problem that currently exists with ballot harvesting. It opens the door to ballot manipulation by allowing an unsecure delivery service from your home to the polling precinct. If the Democratic majority were serious about election security, why didn’t they address this real election security threat in H.R. 1?" said Committee on House Administration Ranking Member Rodney Davis (R-Ill.). "I completely support the assistance of delivering ballots for anyone who is unable, but we cannot be naïve to think that this practice is not being taken advantage of on a larger scale by political operatives."
03.07.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today was featured in a story in the Raleigh News and Observer, "NCAA must allow players to profit from name and image, NC Republican’s new bill says." The story details that next week, Walker will introduce the Student-Athlete Equity Act legislation that would amend the definition of a qualified amateur sports organization in the tax code to remove the restriction on student-athletes using or being compensated for use of their name, image and likeness. “Signing on with a university, if you’re a student-athlete, should not be (a) moratorium on your rights as an individual. This is the time and the moment to be able to push back and defend the rights of these young adults,” said Walker, a former college athlete and vice chair of the Republican conference. “Here’s the thing: We’re not asking the university, we’re not asking the NCAA to pay a single dollar into this. You’ve done your part offering a full scholarship. Just don’t restrict the rest of it.”Read the article in its entirety here and below:NCAA must allow players to profit from name and image, NC Republican’s new bill says The News and Observer By: Brian Murphy March 7, 2019 WASHINGTON - The NCAA must allow student-athletes to use their name, image and likeness, opening the door for players to profit while in school, under new federal legislation proposed by a member of Republican House leadership. The bill, to be introduced by Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina next week, would amend the definition of a qualified amateur sports organization in the tax code to remove the restriction on student-athletes using or being compensated for use of their name, image and likeness. “Signing on with a university, if you’re a student-athlete, should not be (a) moratorium on your rights as an individual. This is the time and the moment to be able to push back and defend the rights of these young adults,” said Walker, a former college athlete and vice chair of the Republican conference. Walker, a third-term congressman from Greensboro, called on the NCAA to change its rules in May, saying at that time that legislation could follow. Now he plans to bring forward the Student-Athlete Equity Act. Walker’s bill introduction will happen just days before the start of the NCAA men’s basketball tournament. CBS and Turner Sports are in the middle of a 22-year, $19.6 billion television contract, which includes an eight-year, $8.8 billion extension signed in 2016, to broadcast the event through 2032. “They’ve had time to have their meetings,” Walker said. “Here’s the thing: We’re not asking the university, we’re not asking the NCAA to pay a single dollar into this. You’ve done your part offering a full scholarship. Just don’t restrict the rest of it.” Walker said he is open to considering possible NCAA restrictions or guidelines, but not the current blanket policy. Walker has met with the representatives of the NCAA. The NCAA has made several large enhancements to student-athlete welfare in recent years, but it has fought against any proposal that would allow players to be paid above the cost of attending college — either in salary or stipend from the universities or in endorsement or service contracts from outside entities. “Allowing student-athletes to endorse commercial products would undermine the efforts of both the NCAA and its member schools to protect against the “commercial exploitation” of student-athletes,” Judge Claudia Wilken wrote in her 2014 decision in the O’Bannon v. NCAA case which challenged the rules prohibiting players from receiving compensation for use of their name, image and likeness. But Walker said the current set-up is denying athletes — 99.4 percent of whom, he is fond of saying, won’t collect a paycheck from a professional sports organization — a chance to monetize their talents. “it’s just odd that in our free market system that this is the one area where we say, ‘No. We’ll let you make money for the university, but you can’t have any access to your name or likeness,’” he said. “This is an earning opportunity for 99 percent of these student athletes who will never have another access to do something like this. It’s in that moment that your earning opportunity is prime.” Ralston Turner, who played basketball at LSU and N.C. State, pointed to college stars like Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel and former LSU football player Tyrann Mathieu — and the amount of money made selling jerseys and shirts with their numbers or likeness. “Take the NCAA out of it: If somebody is using your likeness, you can have access to some of that,” Turner, who played two seasons in the NBA’s G-League and now works for Merrill Lynch in Alabama, said in a phone interview Wednesday. “If somebody was doing something to make money off your likeness, you would want some of it.” Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski said last year that he’d like to see younger players be able to profit off their talents before they reach college. Current Duke star Zion Williamson, for example, had developed an enormous following based on videos of his high school dunks, but he was prohibited from profiting from it in any way, lest he risk his NCAA eligibility. “Make sure that the kid and his family are afforded the opportunity to max out like anyone else in our country what talent will give you,” Krzyzewski said during the NCAA Tournament. A former University of Central Florida kicker was ruled ineligible for making advertising money off his YouTube videos. Kansas basketball coach Bill Self said so many entities are trying to make money off the “big, big business“ of amateur athletics that the current model needs to change. “You could make an honest case that the student-athletes obviously are the ones that create the money but really receive very little of it. I think there will be an adjustment,” Self said during last year’s NCAA Tournament. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who chaired a commission on college basketball, has endorsed allowing players to profit from their name, image and likeness. She, like Walker, wants the NCAA to set the parameters. The NCAA is unlikely to act until Wilken offers a decision in Alston v. NCAA, which challenges the NCAA’s limits on what a scholarship can include. Walker played soccer, basketball and baseball at Trinity College in Jacksonville, Fla. He did not have a scholarship. An avid Alabama football (he was born in Dothan, Ala.) and Duke basketball fan (he moved to North Carolina in 1991, the year Duke claimed its first basketball title under Krzyzewski), Walker has discussed his bill with several former players, including former Duke basketball star and current ESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas, an outspoken critic of the current system. In 2016, the NCAA moved seven college championships that were scheduled to be played in North Carolina, including two rounds of the men’s basketball tournament, in retaliation for the state’s passage of House Bill 2, which critics said was discriminatory toward LGBT people. Walker, a former Baptist pastor, said at the time of the move that the NCAA were “elitists who are attempting to extort and embarrass North Carolina for defending its citizens.” The law has been partially repealed, and the NCAA has returned events to the state.
03.06.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today questioned United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristjen Nielsen on the border crisis in a hearing with the House Committee on Homeland Security titled, "The Way Forward on Border Security." Yesterday, new data showed that the crisis at our border has reached a breaking point. More than 76,000 illegal migrants came across our border in February – an average of more than 2,000 each day. Additionally, in questioning, Nielsen also revealed alarming numbers on the rate of drug and human trafficking."The [drug and human trafficking] numbers continue to rise, so, as we look at all these numbers, in summary, can you tell the American people this is not a manufactured crisis, this is a legitimate national emergency," Walker asked. "This is a legitimate national emergency." Nielsen responded. "This is a twin crisis and we can do better as a country. We have to have a system where we can protect vulnerable populations. We can secure our border, which is our sovereign responsibility. We can protect communities while facilitating legal trade and travel."Watch Walker's full questioning and read the full transcript below: WALKER: Thank you Chairman. Thank you Secretary Nielsen for being here today. Secretary Nielsen, what is the volume of drugs that is coming through the southern border illegally? NIELSEN: I don’t have the exact figure at my fingertips, but it’s going up, particularly on cocaine, methamphetamines, and unfortunately fentanyl. WALKER: Our numbers shows in FY12, about 15 million pounds ceased, does that sound, like that’s the ballpark? NIELSEN: It does, but it sounds like it might not include the Coast Guard. WALKER: Okay. 15 million pounds. Would you say that’s a crisis? 15 million pounds? NIELSEN: Yes sir. WALKER: We talked about Fentanyl a little bit earlier, drug so powerful that less than five pounds can kill over a million people. Our numbers show that almost 1700 pounds in the FY2018. Is that somewhere in the ballpark? NIELSEN: Yes Walker: Would that be a crisis to the DHS? NIELSEN: It is because it’s an extraordinary danger to our communities, but it’s also a danger to those who are inspecting packages who spent a lot of time on training. We had to do a lot of things differently, even for the dogs, who were dying, just by virtue of breathing the fumes from the fentanyl. WALKER: We’ve talked about the massive amount of individuals or people coming across the southern border. Do you have any estimates per year of what that looks like? NIELSEN: We are on track right now to be at 900,000 this year. WALKER: Okay. Are apprehensions of family units and aliens of accompanied alien children increasing or decreasing right now? NIELSEN: They are increasing extraordinarily rapidly. Family units went up around 30 percent from last month, and the same for UACs. Those are the two vulnerable populations that are dramatically increasing. WALKER: Yeah I think in the FY2018, the number was 107,000. Already the first four months of FY2019, that starts in October, is 99,000. Now have you had a chance to meet former DHS Secretary Jay Johnson? NIELSEN: Yes. WALKER: Okay. I wonder if he would also consider this a crisis because since the previous administration, that number has increased 572 percent. My question is at what point does it become a crisis? NIELSEN: Sir, if you ask the men and women of DHS, they would tell you when one migrant dies, when one person is not afforded the opportunity to efficiently claim asylum, they would tell you for a community that has been the victim of violence due to criminals that come in that flow, they would tell you, any, it just takes one. It takes one terrorist, it takes one criminal to ruin a family’s lives and it takes one overdose to kill an American. WALKER: Did you have any idea of the level of how difficult and dangerous the issue was just a few years ago when you took the position, or has this been something that’s been sort of a knowledge that you’ve ascertained since you’ve been in the position of Secretary? NIELSEN: Before becoming Secretary, I did not have the opportunity to speak in detail to the men and women on the front lines and no I was not aware of how dangerous this situation is. WALKER: Do you think most Americans truly understand how dangerous this situation is? NIELSEN: I do not, no. Walker: If most Americans had a chance to go to the border, would they consider this a crisis? NIELSEN: Yes sir, just by the pure numbers coming in and our inability of the system to properly take care of them. WALKER: What kind of job do you say that men and women that work for ICE, what kind of job on the front lines are they doing? NIELSEN: Extraordinary. They work everyday, many times at risk of their own lives. assaults on border control officials continue to rise. They do it with compassion, they live in these communities. They enforce the law, but they want to make sure and continue to ask me, to ask Congress to change the laws so that the system can be more humane. WALKER: You know we talk a lot about as far as people having input who actually are on the front lines doing the work. According to our numbers, in 2017, we talk a lot about children and we should. We should make sure that we restore as many children as we can. I did hear the three reasons why that maybe a problem sometimes prosecutorial, the guardian poses a risk, or there’s another issue that you had to take a look at, but according to our numbers, there were 906 children that were rescued from exploitation just in 2017, does that number match your numbers as well? NIELSEN: Yes sir. Human trafficking, child exploitation are something that we’re working on, we’re about to release the first ever DHS strategy to combat that, but yes the numbers are going up. WALKER: So all of these numbers continue to go up whether it’s the human trafficking, whether it’s the drug smuggling, the former colleague talked about the more we squeeze the border. Well, evidently the numbers continue to rise, so as we look at all these numbers, in summary, can you tell the American people this is not a manufactured crisis, this is a legitimate national emergency? NIELSEN: This is a legitimate national emergency. This is a twin crisis and we can do better as a country. We have to have a system where we can protect vulnerable populations. We can secure our border, which is our sovereign responsibility. We can protect communities while facilitating legal trade and travel.
03.06.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representatives Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and Tom Suozzi (D-N.Y.) yesterday re-introduced the Lessening Impediments From Taxes (LIFT) for Charities Act. This bi-partisan and bi-cameral legislation would eliminate a measure that requires charities, churches, and traditionally tax-exempt organizations to pay federal taxes on provided employee benefits. "Churches and charities serve on the frontline of our battle against the generational cycles of poverty and the traps of government dependence," Walker said. "Washington should ensure their work in our communities is not restricted by unnecessary taxes and strenuous compliance processes. The LIFT for Charities Act will maintain that non-profits and places of worship remain uninhibited by federal burdens." "Last year’s tax bill placed a new tax on religious institutions and nonprofits. That’s simply wrongheaded." Suozzi said. "That is why I am proud to co-lead this bipartisan bill with my colleague so that nonprofits and places of worship can continue their important work without an unnecessary financial burden." Examples of employee benefits that would be subject to taxation if the LIFT for Charities Act is not adopted include parking spots, provided meals, and transportation benefits. These benefits are critical to the mission of the organizations; for example, many Goodwill centers offer transportation to employees. Another additional impediment to non-profit organizations without the passage of the LIFT for Charities Act is compliance burdens and fees. These organizations traditionally have not been required to file returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the passage of this legislation, these organizations will spend millions collectively on IRS compliance, further diminishing the resources they are able to spend on serving communities. You can read the full text of the legislation here. U.S. Representatives Randy Weber (R-Texas), Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.), Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), and Jody Hice (R-Ga.) are also co-sponsors on this bill. U.S. Senators James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) re-introduced the Senate companion last week. "Tax reform was designed to help simplify the tax code and reduce burdens on small businesses, not add burdens on nonprofits," said Lankford. "The legislation introduced today would eliminate this problem once and for all." "As co-chairs of both the National Prayer Breakfast and the Senate Prayer Breakfast, Senator Lankford and I believe that we have a moral obligation to support our neighbors most in need, and nonprofits play an essential role in doing just that," said Coons. Tim Delaney, President, and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, the largest network of charitable nonprofits in the US, said: "Taxing tax-exempts is the very definition of an oxymoron. But worse, this tax is also illogical, unworkable, and unfair. Almost everyone in Congress acknowledges it was a mistake, an error, and this legislation shows there is bipartisan support for its repeal. Hundreds of thousands of nonprofits, houses of worship, and foundations will be forced to divert money away from their missions to make tax payments soon unless this tax is repealed – retroactively – in the coming weeks." "The Council supports the reintroduction of this bill, which would eliminate the tax imposed on nonprofits, foundations, and charities for offering transportation benefits to their employees. We have heard from our members, whose mission is to serve the needs of their communities, about the burdens both financially and administratively that these provisions are now causing our members and their charitable grantees and will continue if not repealed. It is our hope that this bill is acted upon quickly to provide needed relief to the sector," said Council on Foundations Interim President and CEO Gene Cochrane. "If left unaddressed, the new tax on transportation fringe benefits will divert an average of $12,000 away from each nonprofit organization's mission, hurting the individuals and communities who need help the most," said Daniel J. Cardinali, President, and CEO of Independent Sector. "The LIFT for Charities Act is a welcome recognition that this burden is unacceptable, and we urge Congress to act on it swiftly." In November 2017, Lankford and Walker also introduced the Universal Charitable Giving Act in both the Senate and House, which would create a universal charitable deduction in addition to the standard deduction for individuals and married couples that do not itemize.
02.28.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today spoke on the importance of protecting life and fighting the injustice of abortion at the 2019 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) hosted by the American Conservative Union. Walker also highlighted his upcoming trip to Alabama to remember and honor the heroes and moments of the Civil Rights Movement. “I want you to think about one word this evening. I want you to think about the word injustice,” Walker said. "For the sake of millions of lives, we must never quit." Watch his full speech here:

02.22.2019	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) was named an AbilityOne Champion at Greensboro Industries of the Blind on West Gate City Boulevard. Accoring to the National Industries of the Blind, "an AbilityOne Champion is an elected federal policymaker who has demonstrated support for the AbilityOne Program and for related community-based nonprofit agencies in his or her district or state through congressional actions while supporting the enhancement of opportunities for economic and personal independence of persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities." "Every human life has value and potential," Walker said. "Thank you Greensboro Industries of the Blind for your work eliminating all barriers for the visually impaired in our community. I am proud to be named an AbilityOne Champion for building opportunities for prosperity and independence for the blind and disabled." Accoring to the National Industries of the Blind, "an AbilityOne Champion is an elected federal policymaker who has demonstrated support for the AbilityOne Program and for related community-based nonprofit agencies in his or her district or state through congressional actions while supporting the enhancement of opportunities for economic and personal independence of persons who are blind or have other severe disabilities."
02.21.2019	ASHEBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored the Randolph County Color Guard as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for February 2019. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. The Randolph County Honor Guard is a volunteer organization of honorably discharged veterans who give back to their community by providing honor guard services for veteran funerals and remembrance ceremonies. They cover 15 counties in central North Carolina, and have more than 70 members. The Honor Guard provides funeral rites at veteran’s funerals free of charge, paid for by donations and fundraising. The Honor Guard is currently coordinated by Trinity-resident Joe Thomas, who has been with the organization for nine years. "This group of exceptional men have never stopped serving their nation," Walker said. "Their passion and dedication to ensure that every single veteran gets the respectful funeral they deserve inspires us all to reach higher, serve stronger, and always remember." Walker presented the group with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in their honor at CJ's Restaurant in Asheboro.
02.21.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released a video commemorating the one-year anniversary of the death of Rev. Billy Graham and provided an update on the process for getting his statue placed in the United States Capitol. The National Statuary Hall Collection, located in the Capitol building, holds 100 statues from all 50 states. Each state is allowed only two to honor persons notable in their history. North Carolina currently has two statues placed in the Capitol: Zebulon Baird Vance and Charles Brantley Aycock.The statue of Vance, who was governor of North Carolina and a U.S. Senator, was placed in the Capitol in 1916. The statue of Aycock, who was a governor of North Carolina, was placed in the Capitol in 1932. Aycock has a history of white supremacist views that, to Walker, make him an unworthy representation of North Carolina in the heralded Capitol space. As reported by the Citizen Times, "In more recent times, people have taken more notice of Aycock's efforts to keep African-Americans from voting. Aycock, a Democrat, pushed for passage of a constitutional amendment that effectively disenfranchised blacks and ran a race-baiting campaign for governor. His victory was a major setback for Republicans and their allies." Currently the process for replacing Aycock's statue with a new one of Rev. Graham is at a point where the North Carolina General Assembly is accepting artists submission for statue designs. They are accepting submissions through April 1st. Once an artist is selected work on the statue can begin. The process is expected to be completed with the placement of the Rev. Graham statue in the Capitol no later than September of 2020. The process began in 2015, with then-Governor Pat McCrory (R-N.C.) signing House Bill 540, An Act Requesting the Joint Committee on the Library of Congress to Approve the Replacement of the Statue of Charles Brantley Aycock in National Statuary Hall With a Statue of the Reverend William Franklin "Billy" Graham, Jr., into law. The process was then placed on hold until Graham's death, as the statues can only be created posthumously. "Reverend Billy Graham was the premier example of how faith, hope and love can transcend political parties, backgrounds, cultures and affiliations," Walker said. "Despite holding favor and serving as a spiritual advisor to presidents, kings and queens – and having a world renowned impact and legacy – Graham always remained grounded in humility. His statue belongs in the Capitol representing our state and I look forward to assisting in its completion."Watch Walker's update and a few remarks on the legacy of Rev. Graham:
02.15.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) penned an op-ed in The Hill comparing the "Green New Deal" to the failed Fyre Festival."Supporting a proposal that promises to terminate our domestic cow population (or at least stop their flatulence) because your favorite ‘influencer’ posted on Instagram is dumber than buying a four-figure ticket to see Blink-182 without an address," Walker wrote."Here is the biggest difference: In business, as Billy McFarland found out, fraud will end with jail time and financial ruin. In politics, there are fewer repercussions and taxpayers pick up the bill," Walker continued. Earlier this week, Walker released a video on the same topic. Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:The Green New Deal will set the world on Fyre The Hill By: Rep. Mark Walker February 15, 2019 Having spent nearly two decades serving as a vocational minister, I have planned dozens of concerts, productions and major events. That is why the debacle around the Fyre Festival is so fascinating to me. One rule in event planning – and also in politics – is to manage expectations and have a full scope of an undertaking. Fyre’s first move, a video claiming the event would be “on the boundaries of the impossible,” was a complete misstep. It turns out the hype was impossible, falling far beyond that boundary. It reminded me of something marketed to the American people last week: the Green New Deal. Instead of a hype video promising a tropical paradise, the Green New Deal listed an unrealistic utopian manifesto of guarantees leading to dystopia, including paychecks for those “unwilling to work,” government-provided wages, the elimination of all fossil fuels and the upgrading or rebuilding of every building in the United States. To be fair, the sponsors of the proposal did hamper expectations by admitting they “aren’t sure” that they could eliminate “cows or air travel” within 10 years. It is estimated these ideas could increase American families’ electric bills by $3,800 per year, eliminate all airplanes and gas-burning cars, and put millions of Americans out of work. Taking a train from North Carolina to California hardly sounds like utopia to me. But what did we learn from Fyre? When an unproven idea can’t stand on its own merits, it’s always good to have influencers and promoters, right? In their minds, it’s not false advertising if they don’t know what they’re selling. Billy McFarland knew the power of celebrity. If you have the right people on your side, you can always work out the details later. People will buy it. Enter the 2020 Democratic presidential field and freshmen House Democrats. Sens. Cory Booker (N.J.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) were all racing to the gate to endorse the Green New Deal, broadcasting their endorsement to their combined 10 million Twitter followers. It’s all about the likes, nevermind the deliverables. Supporting a proposal that promises to terminate our domestic cow population (or at least stop their flatulence) because your favorite ‘influencer’ posted on instagram is dumber than buying a four-figure ticket to see Blink-182 without an address; maybe you can tell, I am not “Feeling This.”. To be fair, some congressional Democrats were not as quick to sign off. Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), known for passing bills without reading them, seemed to belittle the effort by members of her own caucus, saying, “the green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it, right?" The green dream is a good characterization, but does not go far enough. When you look at the cash that American taxpayers will have to put down, on top of the up to $3,800 increase in annual electric bills, it becomes the green nightmare. A Stanford University study estimates that a similar plan on a slower implementation window would require $13.4 trillion in capital investment, or about two-thirds of the entire U.S. economy. Supporters of the Green New Deal do not seem concerned with these practical questions. They say we will figure out how to pay for it later. "The question isn't how we'll pay for it, but what we will do with our new shared prosperity,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said. Right. And if you believe that I have a luxury cabana on a private island in the Bahamas to sell you. Oh, and you need to preload this wristband. Don’t ask questions, just send your money. The Green New Deal is Washington’s Fyre Festival. What is being sold sounds great but that is because it is unrealistic, unserious, and distracts from the gains we have already made in protecting our environment and modernizing our energy markets. In fact, Vermont tried a similar experiment, cancelling even nuclear energy. The result was an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Here is the biggest difference: In business, as Billy McFarland found out, fraud will end with jail time and financial ruin. In politics, there are fewer repercussions and taxpayers pick up the bill.
02.14.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) tonight released the following statement after announcing he will vote against the Conference Report to Accompany H.J. Res. 31, the Consolidated Appropriations Act: "After decades of failed promises and months of debate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave the House less than 20 hours to read and vote on a 1,200 page bill that builds just 55 miles of barrier to secure a 2,000-mile border. This flippant approach to a national crisis will do little to nothing to stop illegal immigration or human and drug trafficking. We can be the Congress that finally solves this problem, but it will take real action. Specifically, congressional action."
02.11.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) tonight asked for unanimous consent to bring U.S. Representative Ann Wagner's (R-Mo.) Born Alive Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote. Following the request, Walker published an op-ed in LifeSiteNews calling on House Democratic leadership to allow the legislation to come to the floor."Democratic leaders, supporting the abortion industry agenda, refused to even consider the legislation, fearing the thought of allowing their members to vote their conscience and what they know to be morally straight," Walker wrote. "The question is whether they will continue to silence their members and the voice of the unborn, or if they will allow the House Democratic rank-and-file to speak for themselves and the majority of the country." Watch a video of the floor exchange and read the full op-ed here and below. I’m a member of Congress. Here’s why I’m pushing Democrats to ban infanticideLifeSiteNews.com By: Rep. Mark Walker I just left the House floor where, for the fourth straight legislative day, House Democrats blocked a vote on a bill that would protect babies who survive abortions from being murdered. I just asked for “unanimous consent” to bring Rep. Ann Wagner’s (R-MO) Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote. Democratic leaders, supporting the abortion industry agenda, refused to even consider the legislation, fearing the thought of allowing their members to vote their conscience and what they know to be morally straight. In the wake of Virginia Governor Ralph Northam’s comments endorsing infanticide and abhorrent legislation in Virginia and New York that lifts essentially all limits on abortion, my GOP colleagues are making it clear that we stand firmly with both the born and the unborn, protecting the fundamental right to life. Though not news to many, Governor Northam laid bare the startling and sickening reality of the pro-abortion lobby – they want abortion on-demand, in the last moments of pregnancy, and even after birth. Though they refuse to go on the record and vote on the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, the new House majority has already showed where it stands on these atrocities. Last Congress, the Republican majority boldly led the way in protecting life, passing a permanent ban on taxpayer-funded abortions, preventing abortions after the child can feel pain in the womb, and supporting the Trump Administration as they protected life around the world. But our new Congress – comprised of the most pro-abortion majority in history and led by Nancy Pelosi – wants to deny the rights of children and the unborn. On day one, the new Democratic majority passed a bill to force taxpayer dollars to fund abortions in foreign countries. Their legislation would also have given $37.5 million to the United Nations Population Fund, which supports wide-scale, coercive abortions, involuntary sterilization, and unjust eugenic programs around the world. Even further, a number of House Democrats joined with abortion giants to push for the repeal of the Hyde Amendment – a move that would force every American to pay for abortions. These positions are radical and out of touch with what we know to be true and right as Americans. Now, it is imperative that we talk about the importance of life and what it means to conservatives. Two events in the early part of the year remind us why it’s important to fight for life. The first is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Dr. King understood that to “sacrifice the future of his children for immediate personal comfort” was a recipe for failure. He also professed the value and hope of every single human life. The second is the March for Life. Every year, since the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling, pro-life advocates have flooded our nation’s capital to boldly speak for those who can’t speak for themselves. They march to remember the more than 58 million unborn children who have had their futures stolen by abortion. Both events were just a few weeks ago. Each was a celebration of life, justice, and human potential. But, as my friend Benjamin Watson put it, in the middle of these events, we saw a “sad and evil day.” Mr. Watson recently retired from the NFL and spoke last year at a Historically Black College and University Conference I hosted with Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). His conviction to speak up on issues of faith and life makes him a bold example for all of us. Last week, he said, “it is a sad and evil day when the murder of our most innocent and vulnerable is celebrated with such overwhelming exuberance.” He was responding to the image of cheers in the legislative chamber to celebrate a new law in New York. The law allows for abortion up to birth – practically without limits. It authorizes the legal murder of a fully viable human baby. This is what was being celebrated. This was why the Freedom Tower was lit bright pink. New York already faces a cataclysm. In New York City, more than 500 abortions are performed for every 1,000 births. The numbers are even more staggering for African-American babies – more of whom are aborted than born. This is the greatest injustice of our time. I support federalism and the idea that New York can make its own laws for New York. My question is not a legal one, but a moral one. How long will our American society allow this? Can we expect the new House Democratic majority to continue down this path? To revive the American Dream, we must reclaim America’s soul. That means standing with the majority of the American people to reject federal funding of abortion. That means putting the life and health of women ahead of the desires of abortion giants like Planned Parenthood. That means valuing every single human life and the potential he or she has – both 20 weeks before birth and 20 weeks after. This is what House Republicans are dedicated to doing. We are dedicated to the value of all human life. We will not stop fighting. For those of you fighting on this issue, there’s no more noble cause than to fight for those who are defenseless. For these children who have no voice, never stop raising yours. Tomorrow, and as long as it takes, we will continue to ask the Democratic House leadership to bring the Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the floor. They will have another opportunity to save babies from murder during their most vulnerable moments. The question is whether they will continue to silence their members and the voice of the unborn, or if they will allow the House Democratic rank-and-file to speak for themselves and the majority of the country.Rep. Mark Walker represents North Carolina’s 6th District in the U.S. House of Representatives.
02.11.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.), the ranking member on the House Committee on Homeland Security's Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee, today accepted letters from the National Sheriffs' Association, representing more than 3,000 sheriffs nationwide, calling a Democratic proposal to reduce the number of detention beds utilized by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to 16,500. The letter says the proposal would "cripple ICE's ability to detain criminal aliens and other aliens who pose a risk to public safety or are a flight risk." The letter notes "to achieve the 16,500 adult average detainee population (ADP) caps for the remaining 7 months of the fiscal year, a net reduction of 9,264 adults by the end of this fiscal year would be required. Approximately 72% of ICE's current detention population is subject to mandatory detention due to the alien having certain convictions or having committed certain act." Walker met with the group of more than 50 sheriffs and talked about the impact the policy would have on enforcing immigration law and protecting national security. "Sheriffs who protect communities all across our nation know the dangers of an unsecured border, the damage done by unchecked drug flow and releasing criminals back out on our streets," Walker said. "My Democratic colleagues would be well-served by heeding their pleas and working on solutions that keep American families safe, instead of placating to calls for open borders. The government shuts down on Friday. It’s time to put up or shut up."Following his meeting with the sheriffs, Walker went on Fox News to relay the concerns they shared. Watch the below. "This dangerous Congressional proposal not only jeopardizes the risk of our national security, but hinders our law enforcement officers from effectively enforcing and upholding the law and protecting their communities," the letter ends. Read the full letter from the National Sheriffs Association here.
02.07.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) tonight led a "special order" on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives where he shared the story of Sharon Gross, a constituent from Archdale, N.C. who has been negatively impacted because of illegal immigration."As her daughter was driving home, she saw a white SUV heading the opposite direction swerve from the outer lane," Walker said. "The vehicle hit them head on. Sharon described the next moment: 'The next thing I remember was the sound of the metal crashing and twisting in front of us. I vaguely remember everyone running to us and telling us to get out because the car was about to explode. I couldn’t get out and could barely breathe.'" "The driver of the white SUV was a man by the name of Mr. Rodriguez," Walker continued. "He had a blood alcohol concentration of .20, two and a half times the legal limit. Mr. Rodriguez is in our country illegally. He did not own the vehicle he was driving, nor did he have a driver’s license. This was his third drunk driving charge. He served only eleven months in prison and has now been released."Watch the full speech and read the transcript here and below: "What makes this such a calamity is not only the cost to the Americans we have talked about tonight, but the fact that these tragedies are completely avoidable if Congress would do its job and secure the border. "I want to tell you about Miss Sharon Gross from my district in North Carolina. Just over a year ago, Sharon had finished a five mile bike ride with her eighteen year old daughter at Creekside Park in Archdale. They began the trip home in “Roxie,” the vehicle her daughter had received for her sixteenth birthday. "As her daughter was driving home, she saw a white SUV heading the opposite direction swerve from the outer lane. The vehicle hit them head on. Sharon described the next moment: “The next thing I remember was the sound of the metal crashing and twisting in front of us. I vaguely remember everyone running to us and telling us to get out because the car was about to explode. I couldn’t get out and could barely breathe.” "Sharon thanks God that her daughter was largely unharmed, but Sharon suffered 5 broken bones in her back and a severely broken sternum, leaving a large hole in her chest. She has chronic pain that impacts her daily life. "The driver of the white SUV was a man by the name of Mr. Rodriguez. He had a blood alcohol concentration of .20, two and a half times the legal limit. Mr. Rodriguez is in our country illegally. He did not own the vehicle he was driving, nor did he have a driver’s license. This was his third drunk driving charge. He served only eleven months in prison and has now been released. "Mr. Rodriguez’s time in prison may have come to an end, but the physical, mental, and emotional scars Sharon has will never fade. Making matters worse, Mr. Rodriguez was uninsured, leaving thousands of dollars in medical bills adding to the emotional and physical pain for Sharon’s family. "Sharon said, 'It is very difficult for me to have all this constant pain and then deal with all the emotions I am feeling about someone who comes into our country illegally and gets a little pat on the hand when he breaks all our laws.'" "'To say my life was shattered is an understatement." "We can do better. We have to do better. For Sharon and all the Americans who have been impacted by illegal immigration. 'That means an all of the above approach to border security, including construction of additional physical barriers. Border security not only helps us keep our families safe, but it also continues the American tradition of being a welcoming nation. "Many of us are proud of our are legal immigrant heritage. Though it goes under-reported, America has the most generous legal system in the world. Think about that for a minute. We proudly welcome one million legal immigrants into our country each year. "In fact, in 2016 America opened its doors to 1,183,505 legal permanent residents and in 2017 the number was 1,127,167. "These are people from all over the world who’ve raised their hand promising to obey the laws of our land and contribute to our blessed nation. "As President Trump said on this very floor just two days ago, 'legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.'" "America can do both. We can continue to be the beacon of hope throughout the world and we can do much better in protecting the American people. After all, it’s the first oath we take. "The clock is ticking. We face another impasse next week. Will our Democratic colleagues support common sense policies to end this crisis? Or will they continue to disengage on solutions, suggesting ideas like abolishing ICE and stopping additional funding for the Department of Homeland Security? "It’s time to put productivity over personality and people over politics. Anything less would be immoral."
02.06.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced the HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students (HBCU PARTNERS) Act in the House with U.S. Representative Alma Adams (D-N.C.) to strengthen partnerships between federal agencies and the country’s more than 100 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.) introduced the companion bill in the Senate.The introduction of this legislation falls on the same day Scott and Walker hosted their 3rd annual HBCU Fly-In Event, bringing together HBCU Presidents and Chancellors from across the country to discuss legislative priorities and partnerships. The HBCU PARTNERS Act builds on the President’s 2017 executive order on HBCUs. It will require federal agencies with relevant grants and programs to undertake annual planning and coordinate their efforts to support and expand HBCU participation those programs. The bill strengthens the rigor and transparency requirements of existing law by requiring that agencies track their progress toward past goals and share their plans with Congress. In addition, it codifies the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, ensuring an ongoing avenue for the institutions’ priorities and policy concerns to be raised."As the husband of a proud two-time Winston-Salem State University graduate and being privileged to represent North Carolina A&T State University, the largest public HBCU in the country, I know the value Congress can play in fostering partnerships to help our HBCU schools and students succeed," Walker said. "By fostering bipartisan and multi-industry relationships, we can help HBCUs with a pipeline from potential-filled students to prosperous workers." "Today is a special day for bipartisanship and for HBCUs. This morning we re-launched the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, which is now 80 strong with Members in both the House and the Senate. Now, leaders of the Caucus mark our re-launch by introducing bipartisan legislation that codifies a comprehensive federal strategy for HBCUs - a major goal for our Caucus," said Adams. "This bill will require every administration to strategically engage and invest in HBCUs. These institutions provide over $15 billion annually to our economy and have provided pathways of opportunity for millions of Americans, particularly low-income and first generation college students." "HBCUs today continue their tradition of opening higher education to new generations of students," Coons said. "They educate 300,000 students across the country, 70 percent of whom receive Pell grants, and charge almost 30 percent less tuition that their peer institutions. I’m proud to make sure that federal agencies actively work to support HBCUs’ critical missions." "Our HBCUs have provided amazing opportunities for generations of students, and I am excited to introduce this bipartisan bill with my friend Senator Coons to help our HBCUs continue that tradition. The HBCU PARTNERS Act is a great step forward for these schools and their students," said Scott."The Thurgood Marshall College Fund (TMCF) is proud to support the 'HBCU Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students Act' (HBCU PARTNERS Act)," said Dr. Harry L. Williams, TMCF president and CEO. "Having all federal agencies formally develop and submit annual plans for increasing HBCU capacity building for grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements, to Congress will ensure that the most important elements of President Trump’s HBCU Executive Order are not only developed, but acted upon."
02.06.2019	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after eBay announced they have chosen Greensboro to launch a new company program supporting of the city's entrepreneurs and local businesses:"The Gate City has just bridged a new partnership with eBay that will provide great opportunities for Greensboro’s small businesses and entrepreneurs. In North Carolina and across the country, we have seen the power of the internet in fueling prosperity and opening locally made products to the world.

The program, called Retail Revival, according to eBay, "harnesses the power of technology and eBay’s global marketplace to support and grow small businesses, strengthen local economies and foster vibrant community growth." The aim is to "bring Main Street businesses to the global marketplace, all while bolstering local economies through the retail sector." The partnership was announced at an event today featuring Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan and Suzan Deering, Chief Marketing Officer for eBay Americas, at the International Civil Rights Museum.
02.05.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after President Donald J. Trump delivered the 2019 State of the Union Address:"Tonight was a call for all of Washington to put productivity over personality, partnerships over parties, and people over politics. Though there are many paths of opinion, if we choose to work together to solve the issues our nation faces, we can meet on the path of American greatness. The proposals outlined by the President tonight should have broad consensus as we look to protect our workers, defend our homeland, and help our families prosper."
02.05.2019	Merenda Walker (right) with her son, Drew. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today announced that his guest at the State of the Union Address will be his sister-in-law, Merenda Walker. Merenda's brother, Scott Aaron, was a U.S. Army veteran, close friend of Rep. Walker's, Department of Veteran's Affairs employee, and college basketball player at Piedmont International University. Aaron suffered a knee injury that required surgery and was prescribed opioids to manage the pain. He developed an addiction that resulted in heroin use and ultimately the taking of his own life. Scott Aaron (middle) with nephews Drake, Drew, and David (left to right). Walker invited Merenda to serve as a reminder of the toll of the opioid epidemic and the importance of securing the border and equipping the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to stop drug and human trafficking at the southern border. 90 percent of the heroin sold in the United States comes from Mexico."People like Merenda and her brother Scott are examples of how Washington needs to put aside egos and personalities, placing people over politics," Walker said. "The heavy toll of addiction and the dangers of an insecure border are far-reaching, adversely impacting every race, creed, political party, and community – including migrant families. These tragedies are preventable, so long as rifts become secondary to results."Every Member of Congress is allowed to invite one guest to attend the President's address.
02.05.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today entered a statement into the permanent Congressional Record recognizing the bicentennial of the Underground Railroad in North Carolina."Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the bicentennial anniversary of the Underground Railroad in North Carolina," Walker said. "With the first known stop of the Underground Railroad being in Guilford County, this portion of North Carolina’s Sixth Congressional District became a refuge for slaves seeking hope and freedom. I am proud to stand and reflect on the brave individuals like Vestal Coffin and his family, New Garden Quakers who sacrificed immensely for the cause of freedom and justice. In honor of the bicentennial anniversary of the North Carolina Underground Railroad, Guilford County will be hosting several ceremonies, forums, and educational events. As we celebrate National African American History Month, I join the citizens of Guilford County and North Carolina in recognizing this important moment in our nation’s history."Walker is sending an official copy of the Congressional Record to the Greensboro City Council to commemorate the important landmark.

01.31.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today announced that he will serve as the Ranking Member for the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism for the 116th Congress."Rep. Walker is a proven leader on counterterrorism and intelligence issues and I am thrilled that he is taking on a new role leading the subcommittee that will tackle those matters head on.," House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said. "The opportunity to be the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence is humbling," Walker said. "I look forward to protecting our homeland through efforts to combat terrorism and improve intelligence sharing across agencies and law enforcement. I have worked hard in Congress to create partnerships and coalitions that deliver results. To adapt to the ever-changing national security threats that America faces, we need this kind of approach and leadership."According to the Committee on Homeland Security, "the Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee focuses on the capabilities and efforts of the Federal government, particularly the Department of Homeland Security, to identify and deter threats to the Homeland through the collection and sharing of counterterrorism and homeland security information across Federal, State, and local law enforcement."Walker will also serve the committee on the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Innovation.
01.30.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced the Bad Lawmakers Accountability and Key Emends (BLAKE) Act, legislation to place a lobbying ban on lawmakers who do not follow the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) Reform Act, signed into law on December 21, 2018. Specifically, the legislation would bar former Members of Congress who refuse to reimburse the U.S. Department of Treasury for taxpayer-funded sexual harassment settlements from lobbying Congress. "People across this country are through with Washington getting to live by a different set of rules," Walker said. "Using taxpayer funds to cover up your inappropriate behavior, only to evade responsibility and then enrich yourself off your time in Congress is an abuse of power, an absence of character, and a violation of trust. Congress has made strides in promoting accountability and protecting victims, but more needs to be done to ensure this never happens again."As reported by Jennifer Bendery of The Huffington Post, "since the bill can’t be applied retroactively, Walker also plans to send a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) urging them to enforce the spirit of his bill and refuse to meet with ex-lawmakers like Farenthold."As a member of the Committee on House Administration, and an original co-sponsor of the CAA Reform Act and the Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act during the 115th Congress, Walker has been a leader on ending taxpayer-funded sexual harassment settlements by lawmakers.Walker has also publicly called for congressmen who used the "hush fund" to pay the money back to the taxpayers – even after they left Congress.Read the full text of the BLAKE Act here.
01.25.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement on the deal to temporarily end the partial shutdown:"We already have a commission to secure the border. It’s called Congress. When boys and girls are being trafficked and families are burying addicted children, we should be building physical barriers proven to work, not commissions that don’t."
01.24.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced the SOAR Reauthorization Act of 2019, legislation to extend the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Act, along with the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program (OPS).The introduction of the legislation falls during National School Choice Week, a series of events held every January to highlight effective education options for children. Yesterday also marked the 15-year anniversary of the signing of the SOAR Act. The SOAR Reauthorization Act is the House companion bill to legislation introduced in the Senate by U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Tim Scott (R-S.C.)."I am excited to launch this effort with a champion for school choice, Senator Ron Johnson," Walker said. "The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program provides low-income students the chance to succeed and break the cycle of poverty by helping them to escape failing or underperforming schools. We need to reauthorize this program and the great results it has produced, raising graduation rates and improving all education centers – traditional public schools, charter schools and private schools." "The Opportunity Scholarship Program has helped students from low-income households attain a graduation rate 21 percentage points higher than comparable students. The fact that twice as many children apply for the program as can be accommodated shows how strong demand is from parents seeking such positive results for their children," Johnson said. "This is about providing hope for a better future to students by allowing them to choose schools that meet their needs. I sincerely hope my colleagues will join our bipartisan group in supporting a program that gives children the opportunity to create a better life for themselves."The SOAR Reauthorization Act is co-sponsored by School Choice Caucus Co-Chairman U.S. Representative Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.), as well as U.S. Representatives Rick Allen (R-Ga.), Jim Banks (R-Ind.), Michael Burgess (R-Texas), Jeff Duncan (R-S.C.), Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), Garret Graves (R-La.), Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.), Andy Harris (R-Md.), Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), Debbie Lesko (R-Ariz.), Alex Mooney (R-W.Va.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Gary Palmer (R-Ala.), Bill Posey (R-Fla.), John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.), and Randy Weber (R-Texas).Specifically, the legislation will reauthorize funding for D.C. public schools, charter schools, and the OSP for five years. Currently, the program will expire at the end Fiscal Year 2019. It will also take steps to improve the U.S. Department of Education's evaluation of the OSP. Since it's inception, the OSP has served more than 10,000 students, most of them African-American or Latino, living in the District of Columbia. The program creates scholarships for children from low-income families, allowing them to attend any private school of their families' choosing. It is the only federally-funded private school voucher program in the country. The program has produced significantly higher graduation rates, given parents more peace of mind, and increased student safety. As noted by Lindsey Burke of The Heritage Foundation: "An evaluation of the program, published by the Department of Education, found that participating students graduated at a rate 21 percentage points higher than their peers who applied for, but did not receive, a scholarship. That is, 91 percent of the kids able to use the voucher program successfully graduated, compared to only 70 percent in the control group." A poll conducted by the American Federation of Children and Beck Research, a Democratic polling firm, shows that 67% of voters support school choice.

01.16.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today announced that he will serve on the Committee on Education and Labor in the 116th Congress and will be rejoining the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on House Administration. "I am thrilled for the opportunity to serve on these committees and what it means for our ability to represent the people of North Carolina with diligence and principle," Walker said. "The security, education and workforce of Americans are all issues intimately linked to our nation’s future. I look forward to working in these committees to make a lasting difference, promoting and expanding the hope and prosperity of the American dream."Walker's appointment to the Committee on Education and Labor (formerly known as the Committee on Education and Workforce) follows his acclaimed leadership on the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) Act, legislation that empowers parents, teachers and local administrators to better address the needs of students and schools in their communities. The committee responsibility also comes after Walker's awarded advocacy of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina and throughout the country. Walker will join North Carolina colleagues U.S. Representatives Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.) and Alma S. Adams (D-N.C.) on the committee. Foxx serves as the committee's ranking member, the title given to the highest-ranked minority party member.
01.09.2019	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Greensboro's Anna Freiberg as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for January 2019. Guilford County Commissioner Justin Conrad, a longtime friend of Freiberg, was in attendance at the presentation. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Freiberg is the owner of Bender's Tavern on West Market Street in Greensboro. She has consistently used her time, talent, and treasure to help others. Most significantly, her parents started a tradition of feeding people who struggle with homelessness in Guilford County on Christmas Day. Freiberg has been able to continue this tradition, expanding it to Forsyth County as well. On Christmas Day 2018, she served more than 4,200 people at her restaurant. Freiberg has also hosted fundraisers for many causes over the years, including cancer treatment and research, Toys for Tots, and assistance for local tornado victims.“Anna Freiberg is one of the most giving people I’ve ever met," Conrad said. "Whenever there is a need, be it feeding the homeless, working in our community during a crisis like this past year’s tornado, or simply helping a friend through a tough time, Anna is always front and center. I’m honored to call her my friend.” “Anna is walking the walk," Walker said. "As soon as you meet her you can tell that she has a deep and genuine love for our community and everyone in it. She gives back to say thank you for how the community has embraced her business – and she does it almost without limits. Anna's selflessness to spend Christmas Day serving thousands and self-funding most of the meals is inspiration for us all.” Walker presented her with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in her honor.
01.08.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the address by President Donald J. Trump on border security:“The debate on securing our border cannot be measured in partisan jabs. It has to be measured in the human toll caused by our porous borders – one in three migrant women are sexually assaulted, seven in ten migrants are victims of violence, and 20,000 migrant children were illegally smuggled just last month. America is exceptional enough to stop this humanitarian crisis, protect our border and be a beacon of hope for the world.”
01.03.2019	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the House passed the H.R. 21, the Making appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 and H.J. Res 1, the Making further continuing appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2019, legislation that funds the remainder of the government through the fiscal year, while only funding the Department of Homeland Security through February 8, 2019:“It is a sad day for America when political posturing becomes more important than the safety of our citizens. Saying you will fund the government for a full year – except for the Department of Homeland Security – is like buying a house and removing the front door. Today, every Member of Congress took an oath to protect and defend. Instead, the new House majority decided to pass a bill that sends $54 billion to foreign nations without securing our own.”
12.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after President Donald J. Trump signed S.3749, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act into law, legislation co-sponsored by Walker:"The existence of a secret hush fund that uses taxpayer money to settle sexual misconduct from members of Congress highlights exactly why people don’t trust Washington. That’s why we are ending it. From now on, members of Congress will be held accountable for their misbehavior, just like every other American. This is a great start, but in the next Congress, I will be working to ensure more accountability for former members who continue to profit off their time in Congress, despite leaving due to such actions."The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act was written following multiple Committee on House Administration hearings on the matter.As reported by USA Today: "It holds lawmakers, including those who leave office, financially liable for settlements resulting from all types of harassment and retaliation, but doesn’t cover discrimination claims. It also eliminates mandatory counseling, mediation and the 'cooling off' period victims are currently required to wait before filing a lawsuit or requesting an administrative hearing. "The bill requires public reporting of settlements, including identifying lawmakers who are personally liable, and extends protections to include interns, fellows and other staff."

12.21.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed the Senate-revised version of his legislation, H.R. 5415, the the Good Accounting Obligation in Government (GAO-IG) Act, in a 382-2 bipartisan vote:“I am proud to lead this successful effort with Senator Todd Young, sending legislation to the President’s desk that fights the Washington status quo and holds federal bureaucrats accountable to the people of North Carolina. It’s unacceptable that federal agencies ignore thousands of recommendations on how to become more efficient and save taxpayer dollars. The GAO-IG Act will improve government, while bringing needed accountability and saving hardworking Americans as much as $87 billion.”The GAO-IG Act would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. The bill is a House companion to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Read the full text of the GAO-IG Act here.On December 7th, the Senate passed the GAO-IG Act with revisions. The now House-passed legislation heads to the President's desk for final signature.These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations. In May, Walker addressed the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the legislation preceding its committee approval. Watch Walker's remarks and see a full transcript here and below: "The Government Accountability Office and the inspectors general are the two best sources for recommendations to improve federal government operations. GOA and IG efforts help fight waste, fraud, and abuse, and promote effectiveness and effective executive agencies. GAO and IGs conduct audits and investigations, which often results in reports with recommendations directed to a specific agency. "As of May 16, 2018, GAO has issued 1,566 products with 4,827 open recommendations. "And since 2014, OIGs have issued over 8,900 reports with approximately 40,300 total recommendations. Now during the same time period, OIG has identified over 99 billion dollars in potential savings through their audits and investigations and associated recommendations. But those recommendations are only as valuable as the agency’s commitment to implement them. "The GAO-IG Act requires an agency to report on the recommendations from their OIG and GAO within the budget justification to Congress. The agency must also report on the implementation status of each recommendation, and why they may have not been implemented fully."This creates a process in which agencies must take stock of their open and unimplemented recommendations. It is my hope that the increased transparency will cause agencies to work toward closing these outstanding recommendations. "Congress can also use the new report to improve its oversight activities. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars."I urge my colleagues to support the bill."
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the House passed the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 695, the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act of 2019, legislation to finish government funding and provide $5.7 billion for border security:“Nancy Pelosi learned two things today. First, it’s not 2009 anymore. Second, hubris is not the same as leadership – you don’t get to march into the Oval Office and dictate your demands without compromise. Now, each of the House Democrats who kowtowed, elevating her to Speaker-assumed will have to tell their constituents why they just voted to shutdown the government and prioritize leaving our borders open to gangs, terrorists, and drug and human traffickers over protecting American families.”
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after text from his legislation, H.R. 6460, the Lessening Impediments From Taxes (LIFT) for Charities Act was added to H.R. 88, the Retirement, Savings, and Other Tax Relief Act and passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in a 220-183 vote.“Never in our nation’s history have we placed a tax on places of worship, always respecting the sanctity of our religious liberty. In this season of giving, our charities and churches should be encouraged to know that the House is dedicated to stopping new taxes and compliance fees that threaten to impede the life-altering work they perform in each of our communities. I am thankful for the leadership of my friend Chairman Kevin Brady in helping get this important legislation passed.”SEE RELATED: Walker Introduces LIFT for Charities Act to Maintain Non-Filing Tax Status for Charities and Churches On November 28th, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) added the text of the LIFT for Charities Act as a manager's amendment to H.R. 88, which was adopted by the House Rules Committee and added to the legislation. The LIFT for Charities Act would eliminate a measure that requires charities, churches, and traditionally tax-exempt organizations to pay federal taxes on provided employee benefits. Examples of employee benefits that would be subject to taxation if the LIFT for Charities Act is not adopted include parking spots, provided meals, and transportation benefits. These benefits are critical to the mission of the organizations; for example, many Goodwill centers offer transportation for employees. Another additional impediment to non-profit organizations without the passage of the LIFT for Charities Act is compliance burdens and fees. These organizations traditionally have not been required to file returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the passage of this legislation, these organizations will spend millions collectively on IRS compliance, further diminishing the resources they are able to spend on serving communities. You can read the full text of the legislation here and read the full manager's amendment to H.R. 88 here. The LIFT for Charities Act follows Walker's work introducing the Universal Charitable Giving Act, which establishes an universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction.
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, today released the following statement after the passage of S. 756, the First Step Act, the most substantial reforms to federal prison and sentencing laws in decades, in a bipartisan 358-36 vote:"In April, we said 'passing significant reforms to our criminal justice system could bring relief to families and communities in every state, district and territory.' Today, we took a step – a first step – in that direction. We commend House and Senate Leadership for answering the call to consider and pass positive reforms to our criminal justice system this year. "Looking forward, we must continue to restore families, heal communities, and help people find redemption – rather than condemnation – through additional reforms. Hopefully, with the success of the First Step Act, we have demonstrated the bipartisan support for these continued efforts.”In April, Walker and Richmond penned an op-ed for The Hill calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford criminal justice reform the national attention it deserves. The following month, the House passed the original version of the First Step Act.Last week, the Senate passed the legislation with revisions. The now House-passed revised legislation is headed to President Trump's desk for signature. You can read the full text of the legislation here.As reported by Axios, the First Step Act will: Send up to 4,000 prisoners home by increasing the amount of time inmates can cut off of their sentences due to good behavior. Allow more male and female inmates to serve time in house arrest or halfway homes instead of prison cells, with exceptions for high-risk inmates. Require that prisoners be placed within 500 miles of family. Outlaw shackling during child birth. Mandate the provision of sanitary napkins and tampons to female inmates. Reduce the mandatory penalty from life to 25 years for a third conviction of certain drug offenses, and from 25 to 15 years for a second conviction. Prohibit the doubling up, or "stacking," of mandatory sentences for certain gun and drug offenses. Give judges more discretion in giving less than the mandatory minimum for certain low-level crimes. Make the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, which changed sentencing guidelines to treat offenses involving crack and powder cocaine equally. This could impact nearly 2,600 federal inmates, according to the Marshall Project.
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced a proposed rule intended to move more able-bodied recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits to self-sufficiency through the dignity of work: “While the Farm Bill gave our agriculture community needed certainty, it also missed a key opportunity to free trapped Americans from a system and cycle of poverty. Every person who cares about those struggling families should applaud this action by Secretary Perdue and the Trump Administration, leading where Congress failed. With the unemployment rate at a generational low, there has never been a better time to help people get off the sidelines and on the path to the American Dream.”According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the rule "focuses on work-related program requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents (ABAWDs). The rule would apply to non-disabled people, between the ages of 18 and 49, with no dependents. The rule would not apply to the elderly, the disabled, or pregnant women." USDA also noted that "under current SNAP requirements, ABAWDs must work or participate in an employment program for at least 20 hours a week to continue to receive benefits for more than three months over a 36-month period. States may request to waive the time limit in areas with an unemployment rate above 10 percent or where there are ‘not sufficient jobs,’ which current regulations primarily define as an unemployment rate 20 percent above the national average. With today’s strong economy, that could include areas with unemployment rates of under 5 percent – a rate normally considered to be full employment. In 2016 there were 3.8 million individual ABAWDs on the SNAP rolls, with 2.8 million (or almost 74 percent) of them not working.Walker was a key advocate for work reforms in both the American Health Care Act (AHCA) and the 2018 Farm Bill.

Dori and Cindy have known one another for eight years, and Dori says that even if she hadn’t been a direct match for Cindy, she would have been willing to go into the network and donate to someone else. Dori noted that “testing is easy and quick. There are so many people in need." The procedure is scheduled or Tuesday, December 4th.“I always had a peace that the Lord would provide a donor.” Cindy said. “It’s sobering to think about what a huge sacrifice this is for Dori and her husband, Bill. I’m still amazed at her willingness to do this.” “Living organ donation is an important lifesaving measure for so many.” Walker said. “It is inspiring to see someone like Dori respond to a plea for help and selflessly sacrifice for another. In this season of giving, I am proud to not only bring awareness to living organ donation but also present Dori with the December Community Hero of the Month award.”Dori Goebel lives in Greensboro with her husband, Bill, and their three kids: Will, Jessa, and Elisa Kay.

10.12.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after a Turkish court freed pastor Andrew Brunson, a North Carolina native:"Every American should be proud that we are finally bringing North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson home. His release today, after a two-year unjust imprisonment, was only possible through millions of prayers and the concerted efforts of President Trump, Vice President Pence, Secretary Pompeo and members of Congress. This needs to be the end point for the many acts of aggression and human rights violations for Turkey and President Erdogan."SEE RELATED: Fox News: "Rep. Walker fights to bring American pastor home from Turkey" In July, Walker introduced the Turkey International Financial Institutions Act, legislation that would direct U.S. representatives at international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to oppose loans to Turkey, pending the release of Brunson, U.S. citizens, and consular staff. In May, Walker was part of a bi-partisan House effort, sending a letter with 153 other Representatives to President Erdogan demanding the release of Brunson. On July 26th, the House passed the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in a 359-54 vote, which included a provision added by Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) that directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress reviewing the Turkish government's participation in the F-35 program.Brunson, the pastor of Izmir Diriliş (Resurrection) Church in Izmir, Turkey, was detained on October 7, 2016 on charges of "support of a terrorist organization" and "political or military espionage." Brunson was transferred on July 25, 2018 from jail to house arrest while awaiting the next hearing on his case. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), "Pastor Brunson initially was held in a cell with 21 other inmates that was built to hold only eight prisoners. He was transferred in August 2017 to Kiriklar Prison where he was in a cell with two other men who have been accused of being members of the Gülen movement. He spends 24 hours a day in his cell, leaving for one hour weekly for visits. Sometimes he is allowed family visits and the U.S. Embassy sees him regularly." "The case against Pastor Brunson seems to be based on secret evidence and a secret witness," USCIRF adds. "He has been incarcerated since October 2016 without due process and inadequate physical and psychological support."
10.05.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Greensboro’s Cambre Weller and Chelsea Spohn as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for October 2018. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Cambre Weller and Chelsea Spohn met in 2008 during a Westover Church prayer group that focused on human trafficking. When they learned that this horrible crime was impacting lives in the Triad, they both felt called to join the fight on behalf of local survivors and also work to prevent human trafficking in the area. They founded Abolition NC as an organization to meet these needs. As Executive Director, Chelsea’s background in social work makes her uniquely skilled to support and mentor survivors, while Cambre’s former work as a Guilford County Schools curriculum developer made her perfectly poised to lead Abolition NC’s prevention awareness program."Chelsea and Cambre are amazing champions of marginalized individuals who have been subjected to the horrors and abuse of human trafficking," Dr. Sandy Sikes, a Abolition NC board member, said. "They spend endless hours working tirelessly to care for the victims of these atrocities. The Greensboro community is truly blessed to have women such as Chelsea and Cambre working to fulfill their mission here among us.""I’ve been familiar with the work of Abolition NC for several years now, and I am always impressed with their heartfelt dedication to the fight against human trafficking," Walker said. "When I learned that Chelsea and Cambre are unpaid volunteers who have committed full work weeks to take on this ministry for a decade, I knew that they truly deserved to be honored as community heroes. Human trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time, destroying, enslaving and exploiting human life. Together, through continued legislative efforts and community organizations like Abolition NC, we can continue to raise awareness of this issue and work together to end it." Chelsea lives in Greensboro with her husband, Michael and her two children. Cambre lives in Greensboro with her husband, Blake, and three children. They were presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor. Watch this video to learn more about the mission and efforts of Abolition NC:
09.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed the House Amendment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6, Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, in a 393-8 vote:"Far too often, as I visit with communities across North Carolina, I hear heart-wrenching stories of towns plagued with addiction, families torn by drug dependence and remembrances of loved ones lost to overdoses. It’s time to turn these tragic tales into stories of triumph and opportunity. Together, through expanding access to proven treatments, a tough hand stopping the flow of drugs and a compassionate approach to ensure families aren’t fighting this alone, we can overcome the opioid crisis and bring hope to struggling communities." The changes to the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act are bipartisan and bicameral. The Senate is expected to quickly pass the measure and send it to President Donald J. Trump's desk. This bill will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The legislation follows the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act last Congress, and represents the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.The reforms focus on treatment and recovery by improving and expanding access to treatment and recovery services and establishing comprehensive opioid recovery centers. It also helps prevent addictions by encouraging non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain and improving data to identify and help at-risk patients and families. Additionally, the legislation gives local law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of communities and to stop the importation of illicit and synthetic drugs. You can read the full text of the legislation here.In October 2017, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina. Many of the reforms in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act adhered to specific feedback Walker received from different organizations and sectors during the tour.Read more about Walker's opioid crisis tour in a story in the Washington Examiner here.As the story notes, "since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, nationwide drug overdoses now kill more Americans than gun homicides and car crashes combined."This month, Walker released a five-part video series called "A Haven of Hope" on the opioid crisis, the work of Hannah's Haven – an addiction recovery center for women, and congressional action. You can find each of the videos here.

09.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018, legislation he is a co-sponsor of, in a 220-191 vote:“After we kept our promise to deliver on historic tax reform, unemployment is at record lows, job openings are at record highs, paychecks are growing, wages are rising, and employer benefits are expanding. North Carolina families are winning again and we want to continue the momentum. Tax Reform 2.0 will provide our families and local employers more certainty, solidifying lower taxes, a permanent doubling of the Child Tax Credit and the first-ever Paid Family Leave Credit, while lowering the share of the tax burden for middle-income workers and raising it for millionaires.”The Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 makes permanent the tax reform measures for individuals, families, and small businesses (also called pass-through entities) in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The legislation, along with the already House-passed Family Savings Act of 2018 and American Innovation Act of 2018 are part of "Tax Reform 2.0," a legislative effort to promote ongoing economic success, lock in tax cuts for middle-income families, and show Congress' commitment to continuously updating our tax code to stay fair and competitive. The Family Savings Act of 2018 reforms retirement accounts and family-friendly saving accounts to increase flexibility and encourage savings, and creates a new universal savings account. The American Innovation Act of 2018 makes it easier and less costly for an entrepreneur to start a new business by providing for more deductions of start-up and organizational costs in the business’s first year.According to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, Tax Reform 2.0 will: Provide $140 billion in annual tax relief for middle-income families Create 1.1 million new jobs Drop the federal tax burden for taxpayers with incomes under $50,000 from 4.2 percent to 3.9 percent Raise the federal tax burden for millionaires from 19.6 percent to 20.2 percent Provide an average 5.2 percent tax cut for taxpayers, and 2.3 percent for taxpayers who earn more than $1 million You can read the full text of the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts Act of 2018 here.
09.26.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed his legislation, H.R. 4809, the Guidance Out Of Darkness (GOOD) Act, with unanimous bipartisan support:"I am proud to lead this successful effort to boost accountability and transparency in government, helping our families and small businesses succeed. Federal agencies are using veiled actions to circumvent the normal rule-making process, greatly costing North Carolina families and employers with compliance burdens and wasted time navigating a bureaucratic nightmare. Every dollar and hour blown managing this is an opportunity lost, a job not created, and investment not going into our community."This legislation would increase government accountability and transparency, while lessening the burden on small businesses by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents online in an easy to find location. The bill is a House companion to S.2296, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).Walker released the following video upon passage, explaining the impact of the GOOD Act: To circumvent responsibility and the legal rule-making process, the previous Administration had federal agencies issue "guidance" to serve as de facto regulations. "The Obama Administration made an art of evading public scrutiny by replacing formal rule-making with a stream of 'guidance,' 'bulletins' and 'statements of policy,'" The Wall Street Journal wrote. While the regulations themselves were often erroneous and harmful to businesses, they also created undue burden in compliance as the guidance took on many different forms – blog posts, memos, letters, and news releases. The GOOD Act would bring clarity to the process by forcing all federal agencies to publish guidance documents on their website. The GOOD Act has received praise from Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). "Requiring vastly more disclosure, ensuring that federal agencies post all guidance documents online is a sensible and essential step to beginning to hold federal agencies accountable for their actions," Clyde Wane Crews, vice president for policy at CEI said. Read the full text of the GOOD Act here.On Wednesday, Walker spoke on the House floor about the legislation prior to its passage. Watch a video of his remarks here:

09.10.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – President Donald J. Trump has approved the request to declare that an emergency exists in the State of North Carolina and ordered Federal assistance to "supplement State, tribal, and local response efforts due to the emergency conditions resulting from Hurricane Florence beginning on September 7, 2018, and continuing." According to the White House: "The President's action authorizes the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), to coordinate all disaster relief efforts which have the purpose of alleviating the hardship and suffering caused by the emergency on the local population, and to provide appropriate assistance for required emergency measures, authorized under Title V of the Stafford Act, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety, and to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in all 100 North Carolina counties and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. "Specifically, FEMA is authorized to identify, mobilize, and provide at its discretion, equipment and resources necessary to alleviate the impacts of the emergency. Emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, will be provided at 75 percent Federal funding. "Brock Long, Administrator, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Department of Homeland Security, named Albert Lewis as the Federal Coordinating Officer for Federal recovery operations in the affected areas."Earlier today North Carolina’s entire Congressional delegation, led by Senators Thom Tillis and Richard Burr, sent a letter to President Trump requesting that the administration approve Governor Roy Cooper’s Emergency Declaration in advance of Hurricane Florence’s landfall. “Hurricane Florence poses an imminent and dangerous threat to North Carolina, and its approach necessitates the state to once again activate the State Emergency Response Team and numerous other state resources,” the members wrote. “An Emergency Declaration will provide the needed assistance to the state and local communities to allow them to properly prepare for the effects of Hurricane Florence.

09.10.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released a five-part video series focusing on the opioid crisis in North Carolina, recent congressional action, and Hannah's Haven, a Greensboro-based non-profit addiction recover program for women. The series, titled "A Haven for Hope," focuses on the personal stories of addiction and recovery in North Carolina, the House-passage of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, and the path forward in combatting battling addiction and drug trafficking. "The opioid epidemic is the largest public health crisis in our country with one in four Americans being close to someone who is addicted to these drugs, Walker says in the video. "Since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, leaving nearly 2,000 opportunity-filled futures tragically ended. For the many, North Carolinians struggling with addiction, finding hope can be hard." "With the passage of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, we can better serving people in our community struggling with addiction and their families," Walker adds. "There is hope. There is a future. And there is power in redemption." In October 2017, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina.

09.04.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the U.S. House passed H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, legislation he co-sponsored:“Today is a great day for manufacturing in North Carolina as $71 million – the most of any state in the nation – is freed up to reinvest in our community and our people. Unnecessary and harmful taxes on materials our manufacturers need for production, but can’t find in the United States, has plagued the growth of our builders and job-creators. When I came to Congress, I made it a priority to reform this system with transparency and accountability, and now we are seeing the fruits of those improvements as we send this legislation to President Trump’s desk. Two years ago, I was told this would never get through the House. I’m elated for our office and staff who have been instrumental working on behalf of our manufacturers to make this happen.​”The Senate passed this legislation on July 27, 2018, meaning the bill now goes to President Trump's desk for final approval.To learn more about this legislation, please read the information here or below in a release from January 15, 2018. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018 was scheduled for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives for Tuesday, January 16th:“This legislation will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities. We have worked hard to deliver on this reform that will lead to millions of dollars being reinvested in North Carolina as we continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It is my hope that my colleagues will move quickly to send this bipartisan bill to the President’s desk.” This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States. Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018. “[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)SEE RELATED: Local Business Praises Walker for His Work on the Passage of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act To learn more about the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, watch the video below which features Vern Hawkins, President of Crop Protection at Syngenta in Greensboro, N.C., explaining the economic impact these tariffs have on their business and the North Carolina economy. Looking at the MTB petitions that make up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, one thing is clear, North Carolina is a big winner. The legislations consists of 1,686 petitions – American manufacturers who need to purchase materials for production that are not available in the United States. Of those 333 petitions, 19.75%, are manufacturers in North Carolina, more than any other state. That represents a savings of $71 million in 2018, also the most in the nation. Examples of manufacturers in North Carolina’s 6th congressional district who will be impacted by this legislation are: Syngenta of Greensboro, N.C. | 47 petitions representing $13.7 million Glen Raven Inc. of Glen Raven, N.C. | 9 petitions representing $6.4 million Revlon Inc. of Oxford, N.C. | 4 petitions representing $1.9 million BGF Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C. | 2 petitions representing $445,900 These needless taxes, which do nothing to support the production of American products, drive up production costs and ultimately the final costs of the product being manufactured. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities. Manufacturing represents more than one-fifth of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of the state’s workforce.
08.29.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after Publix announced they plan to open a $400 million distribution center in Guilford County, employing more than 1,000 workers: "In the last 24 hours we have learned that more than 1,100 jobs are coming to the 6th Congressional District, while national consumer confidence is at its highest level since 2000 and the U.S. economy is growing at 4.2 percent – even faster than initially estimated. Whether it is Japanese companies laying roots in Lee County, or national brands making significant investments in east Greensboro, it’s clear that our economy is roaring back and creating new opportunities for our families. While we still have far to go, we are restoring the chance of the American Dream."The news from Publix follows yesterday's reports that Dowa Thermotech, a Japanese company that "provides heat treatment to make engine parts, electronics and and other equipment more durable" will open a plant in Lee County and employ 109 workers.In addition to the economic development and job growth news in Walker's congressional district, the national economy has stayed in the spotlight following reports of consumer confidence rising "in August to its highest level since October 2000, building on July’s solid result," and "gross domestic product, the value of every good and service produced domestically, rose at an annual rate of 4.2%." Following the announcement, Walker released a video talking about the economic developments at the future home of the Publix distribution hub.
08.28.2018	EDEN, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Walter "Skip" Johnson of Eden as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for September 2018. The presentation was held at Eden City Hall with Eden Mayor Neville Hall, County Commissioner Reece Pyrtle, officers of the Eden Police Department, and leaders of the Rockingham County Salvation Army in attendance. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Johnson was a captain with the Eden Police Department for 30 years. Although he is now retired, his service to the community has never faltered. He has the goal of doing something good for someone every day, and he far surpasses that with his ongoing community service. Johnson spends time visiting senior centers and volunteering through the Salvation Army. His peers in the community have praised his ability to touch lives and care for others in ways big and small. Pyrtle, who formerly served as Johnson's boss when he was the Eden Police Chief praised his efforts. “Skip continues his selfless acts in countless ways," Pyrtle said. "Whether he is dropping off sweets for employees and patients at the hospital, preparing meals for a local nursing home or Camp Carefree, mowing a neighbors grass or putting bicycles together for the Salvation Army, he does it all with an energy and attitude that encourages others to join in.” “Skip is an extraordinary person," Mayor Hall said. "His acts of kindness touch many people. His caring, generous spirit and humble attitude make an amazing difference, and he is a true gem for our community." "Individuals like Skip Johnson are the fabric of our community," Walker said. "Skip wakes up every day wanting to make a difference for someone, and he does just that. He shows the heart of what the Eden community and our state are all about: putting people first and always sacrificing for others." Johnson was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor.
08.24.2018	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today joined CNN host Poppy Harlow to discuss his minority outreach efforts and how the Republican Party can improve in reaching into new communities following a USA Today profile published Monday, "In Donald Trump era, a GOP leader looks to recast his party's image with black voters.""I did something that was specifically in my heart and I believe individual liberty and opportunity, prosperity – that should be good for all communities," Walker said. "Probably the thing we’re most proud of is those relationships but they weren’t pre-oped or photo-oped before, when I ran for Congress. Those relationships have been longstanding." The interview included a clip of Walker's 2017 speech at the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference, where he challenged the audience to listen to people with opposing views, and to work hard to share the conservative message of economic prosperity and upward mobility with new communities."Make time for those who disagree with you. It’s easy to preach to the choir, but we must take our message to new places, to new neighborhoods and new communities. Learn to listen," Walker said in the 2017 speech. "Hold your leaders accountable, but remember your fellow man is not your enemy. Whether Democrat, muslim, minorities, or those who identify with the LGBTQ community, why? Because every American deserves the opportunity to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Even those that are unborn."Watch the full interview here and read the full transcript below: On if the Republican Party is doing enough to bring in minorities: "I believe there’s a lot of improvements to be made. I never read that report . I wasn’t even aware of it when I left the ministry to run for Congress. I did something that was specifically in my heart and I believe individual liberty and opportunity, prosperity – that should be good for all communities. Probably the thing we’re most proud of is those relationships, but they weren’t pre-oped or photo-oped before, when I ran for Congress. Those relationships have been longstanding. Our work in the inner cities of Cleveland, New York and Baltimore and recently I became the first Republican, elected Republican, to speak keynote at the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation. I took great pride in that because that goes beyond the Republican-Democrat."On 2017 CPAC Speech: "Exactly – and that speech you just played there, that speech was not a non-partisan crowd, that was one of the more conservative conferences there in Washington, D.C., so we try to be consistent with our message."On if the President's controversial comments makes minority outreach harder: "Sometimes it can be difficult to explain some of the tweets, there is no question about that. What we’re trying to do is look at the results instead of the personality, sometimes. I have three children; I think you have a couple as well. We want to set good standards. President Obama was a good man, had a good marriage. I love for my children to exemplify that component. But you cannot deny his policy added people to the poverty arena. We believe President Trump’s policies as well as the House Republicans’ are helping pull people out of that poverty situation. Ultimately, we have to get away from this government notion that adding more people to a government program is a good solution. It’s not – it actually stymies the American Dream for many of these people."On if Walker finds the President's comments racist: "I find them offensive. To be able to label someone a racist is sometimes trying to judge where their heart’s intent. Some of the undertones, some of the things that I hear is not language that I use because I know how hurtful and painful it is to many of my friends in these communities. We’ve got to continue to try to raise the standard, but we’ve got to get past this place also. Are we measuring more this Administration about personality or about policy, about results? I hope that – both matters, I get that. Character, integrity, and class always matter, but we want to make sure that we don’t get distracted by some of this to miss some of the things that we believe are helping all of our communities."
08.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today was featured in a story by USA Today, "In Donald Trump era, a GOP leader looks to recast his party's image with black voters." The article highlights Walker's outreach efforts and his determination to expand the conservative message of opportunity and individual liberty to new communities. The story reads: "At the forum attended by influential conservatives such as House Speaker Paul Ryan and former presidential adviser Karl Rove, Walker elaborated on a message he has delivered in other private conversations with Republicans. Walker's message resonated enough with the audience that after the event, Rove reached out to talk further. ... "Walker, an affable former pastor, represents a North Carolina district that is one-fifth African-American. He is championing criminal justice reform and adequate funding for historically black colleges and universities, issues that are high priorities for many African-American voters. "Walker spokesman Jack Minor said the lawmaker is working on legislation that would allow student athletes – many of whom are black – to be compensated for their publicity rights. Walker also has hosted two Washington summits with HBCU leaders, meetings that helped pave the way for year-round Pell grants for HBCU students. He teamed up with North Carolina Democratic Rep. Alma Adams to establish an internship program for students from HBCUs. Walker also was the first Republican in years to give a keynote address at the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation dinner in June. All of the group's members are Democrats. ... 'Walker took the findings to heart during his first run for Congress in 2014, when he sought the support of local Democratic leader the Rev. Odell Cleveland. It took three meetings for Walker to win over the pastor, including a chat in Cleveland's office, coffee together at McDonald's and a small group lunch they attended together. "'I’m a lifelong Democrat and proud of it, but I just believe we have to find common ground,' Cleveland said. He added he still 'vehemently' disagrees with some of Walker’s votes, like one to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but he likes him. ... "Walker and other Republicans may find an opening with African-Americans who feel the Democratic Party is taking their vote for granted and parachuting in at the last minute to get their support. Sabrina Singh, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, said the party learned in 2016 that it needs to start organizing in minority communities earlier and has been since. "For her part, Anita Estell head of CELIE, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement, said she didn’t think the focus on Trump should prevent people from listening to Walker. Estell said she’d be happy to engage with Walker on diversity."'I come from an era where Democrats and Republicans worked together,' Estell said. “If Mark Walker is trying to be a public servant for all of the residents of North Carolina, God bless him.'"

08.08.2018	ASHEBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Vanessa Ornelas of Asheboro as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for August 2018. The presentation was held at the Randolph-Asheboro YMCA with Executive Director Patrick O’Hara in attendance. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Ornelas is an avid volunteer at the YMCA and a substitute teacher for Asheboro City Schools and the Randolph County School System. At the YMCA, she serves people young and old, being an integral part of the Special Olympics every year, while working with children on a personal level, and creating crafts and activities for seniors to participate in. Ornelas is a key part of the YMCA’s Cooperative Outreach Garden, which with her help has donated more than 12,000 pounds of produce to Christians United Outreach Center, Our Daily Bread, Family Crisis Center, as well as YMCA members and guests."Vanessa epitomizes the mission of the YMCA, influencing countless lives here in Randolph County," Walker said. "Walking around the YMCA garden and through the halls of facility, you could see the impact Vanessa has on its patrons. Her smile is electrifying and communicable, a quick symbol of the lasting affect she is having on our community." Ornelas lives in Asheboro with her husband. She has eight children and thirteen grandchildren. Seven of her children have served in the U.S. Armed Forces, with the eighth being married to an active-duty service member. She was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in her honor.
07.27.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018:“Today, we saw more evidence of how delivering on our promise to cut taxes on hardworking families and businesses has helped our nation prosper with the announcement of 4.1 percent second quarter growth. Tariffs on imported goods are a tax on American families and businesses, especially when those tariffs are on imported materials needed for American manufacturing, but unavailable domestically. Passing the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act will help our workers continue to thrive without government intervention or the choosing of winners and losers in the economy.”The U.S. House of Representatives passed this legislation on January 16, 2018. The text was amended prior to Senate passage, meaning the House will revote on the legislation before it goes to the President's desk for approval.To learn more about this legislation, please read the information here or below in a release from January 15, 2018. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018 was scheduled for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives for Tuesday, January 16th:“This legislation will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities. We have worked hard to deliver on this reform that will lead to millions of dollars being reinvested in North Carolina as we continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It is my hope that my colleagues will move quickly to send this bipartisan bill to the President’s desk.” This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States. Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018. “[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)SEE RELATED: Local Business Praises Walker for His Work on the Passage of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act To learn more about the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, watch the video below which features Vern Hawkins, President of Crop Protection at Syngenta in Greensboro, N.C., explaining the economic impact these tariffs have on their business and the North Carolina economy. Looking at the MTB petitions that make up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, one thing is clear, North Carolina is a big winner. The legislations consists of 1,686 petitions – American manufacturers who need to purchase materials for production that are not available in the United States. Of those 333 petitions, 19.75%, are manufacturers in North Carolina, more than any other state. That represents a savings of $71 million in 2018, also the most in the nation. Examples of manufacturers in North Carolina’s 6th congressional district who will be impacted by this legislation are: Syngenta of Greensboro, N.C. | 47 petitions representing $13.7 million Glen Raven Inc. of Glen Raven, N.C. | 9 petitions representing $6.4 million Revlon Inc. of Oxford, N.C. | 4 petitions representing $1.9 million BGF Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C. | 2 petitions representing $445,900 These needless taxes, which do nothing to support the production of American products, drive up production costs and ultimately the final costs of the product being manufactured. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities. Manufacturing represents more than one-fifth of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of the state’s workforce.
07.26.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced the Turkey International Financial Institutions Act, legislation that would direct U.S. representatives at international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank, International Finance Corporation (IFC) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to oppose loans to Turkey, pending the release of U.S. citizens and consular staff. Turkey is highly dependent on these loans, especially as the largest borrower from the EBRD last year. “For nearly two years, North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson has been wrongfully imprisoned by the Turkish government on false and unfair charges simply for sharing his Christian faith," Walker said. "Today, we draw the line in the sand. President Erdogan must release Brunson now and return him to the U.S. or face crippling sanctions to his already limping nation.”Walker is introducing the legislation with 20 original cosponsors: Representatives Ralph Abraham (R-La.), Robert Aderholdt (R-Ala.), Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), Dave Brat (R-Va.), Ted Budd (R-N.C.), Warren Davidson (R-Ohio), Chuck Fleischmann (R-Tenn.), Bob Gibbs (R-Ohio), Vicky Hartzler (R-Mo.), Jody Hice (R-Ga.), Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), Randy Hultgren (R-Ill.), Mike Johnson (R-La.), Steve King (R-Iowa), Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Ralph Norman (R-S.C.), Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), John Ratcliffe (R-Texas), Randy Weber (R-Texas), and Ted Yoho (R-Fla.). The full text of the legislation can be read here.SEE RELATED: Fox News: "Rep. Walker fights to bring American pastor home from Turkey" This action is a direct response to the Turkish government's wrongful imprisonment of North Carolina native Andrew Brunson, a pastor who has been serving in Turkey for 23 years, as well as documented human rights abuses, and the "arbitrary arrest and detention under the state of emergency of tens of thousands, including members of parliament and Turkish-national employees of the U.S. Mission to Turkey."This legislation is the House companion to similar legislation by Senator Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) that was passed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today.Today, President Donald J. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence both tweeted their support for Brunson's immediately release, threatening "large sanctions" and "consequences," respectively. The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a great Christian, family man and wonderful human being. He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2018 "And to President Erdogan and the Turkish government, I have a message on behalf of the President of the United States of America: Release Pastor Andrew Brunson now, or be prepared to face the consequences," Pence said at a Thursday speech at the Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom. "If Turkey does not take immediate action to free this innocent man of faith and send him home to America, the United States will impose significant sanctions on Turkey until Pastor Andrew Brunson is free."In May, Walker was part of a bi-partisan House effort, sending a letter with 153 other Representatives to President Erdogan demanding the release of Brunson. On July 26th, the House passed the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in a 359-54 vote, which included a provision added by Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) that directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress reviewing the Turkish government's participation in the F-35 program.Brunson, the pastor of Izmir Diriliş (Resurrection) Church in Izmir, Turkey, was detained on October 7, 2016 on charges of "support of a terrorist organization" and "political or military espionage." Brunson was transferred on July 25, 2018 from jail to house arrest while awaiting the next hearing on his case in October 2018. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), "Pastor Brunson initially was held in a cell with 21 other inmates that was built to hold only eight prisoners. He was transferred in August 2017 to Kiriklar Prison where he was in a cell with two other men who have been accused of being members of the Gülen movement. He spends 24 hours a day in his cell, leaving for one hour weekly for visits. Sometimes he is allowed family visits and the U.S. Embassy sees him regularly." "The case against Pastor Brunson seems to be based on secret evidence and a secret witness," USCIRF adds. "He has been incarcerated since October 2016 without due process and inadequate physical and psychological support."
07.26.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed the Conference Report to Accompany H.R. 5515, the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) in a 359-54 vote:“North Carolina is the nation’s most military friendly state with more than 112,000 active duty and reserve members and nearly 60,000 school-aged military children. This defense bill secures their financial future with the largest pay raise in nine years, while securing our entire nation. In addition to providing newer and safer military equipment to combat an alarming rise of deadly accidents as well as fighting sexual assault and opioid addiction, this legislation invests nearly $250 million in military construction at North Carolina bases like Fort Bragg, Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune.” This legislation authorizes and prioritizes funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) and military activities and construction, and prescribes military personnel strengths for Fiscal Year 2019. The NDAA will also supports a 2.6 percent military pay raise, creates a three-year pilot program to limit the use of opioids and stop opioid addiction, and promotes sexual assault prevention and response to better assist victims.

07.25.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 6199, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act, and H.R. 6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act:“Every year, more Americans are turning to health savings accounts (HSAs) for their freedom, choice and affordability. Obamacare failed to deliver on these promises, but also limited the scope and use of HSAs, restricting the ability to purchase over-the-counter drugs and choose coverage that works best for each individual family. These bills will help lower the cost of health coverage and medicines for North Carolina families, giving them relief from the broken government policies that have crippled our healthcare system for decades.” The Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act expands the flexibility of HSAs, allows for other health-related savings and spending accounts to be converted to HSAs, repeals restrictions Obamacare placed on the purchasing of over-the-counter medications with a HSAs and allows for certain qualified sports and fitness expenses to be treated as qualified medical expenses. Obamacare limited payments for medications from health savings accounts to only prescription drugs or insulin. This legislation would allow non-prescription medications and health products to be purchased using HSA funds.The Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act allows for leftover funds to be rolled over to subsequent years for Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), allows for working seniors enrolled in Medicare Part-A to contribute to their HSAs, authorizes all Americans to purchase a catastrophic health care plan, permits HSAs to be used on bronze and catastrophic plans, and delays the Obamacare health insurance tax. According to the American Action Forum, the Obamacare health insurance tax "will substantially raise premiums for small businesses and households." The estimated impact is nearly $5,000 per family over a decade. Half of the tax is paid by people earning less than $50,000 a year. Since HSAs became activated in 2004, their popularity has continually increased. America’s Health Insurance Plans cites that the number of HSA enrollees grew by almost 10 percent from 2016 to 2017, totaling 21.8 million.

07.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 184, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, in a 283-132 bi-partisan vote:“Part of Obamacare’s deeply-flawed approach to healthcare reform was the creation of a new medical device tax that drove up the cost of life-saving medical equipment, while depleting research and development innovation for patients and killing medical jobs. Congress has expressed its bi-partisan disdain for this bad policy by delaying the healthcare tax twice, with even Democrats admitting its failure. Repealing it completely will help permanently lower healthcare costs for North Carolina families and allow our state to continue leading in critical medical research.” The Protect Medical Innovation Act repeals the 2.3 percent excise tax on the sale of a medical device by a manufacturer, producer, or importer, such as hip implants or pacemakers. The tax was part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The medical device tax went into effect in 2013, but only remained active for two years. It was delayed in 2016 for two years and then again in January 2018 for two years. Both votes received bi-partisan support. A study of the economic impact of the medical device tax from 2013 to 2015 showed that research and development was reduced by $34 million in 2013, with a $188 million decline in the sale of medical devices. Another study from 2017 estimated that 21,900 jobs in the medical device industry were lost during the two years the tax was active. The tax is also considered to drive up the costs of medical devices as manufacturers pass along the cost of the tax to consumers, making it harder for people to gain access to life-saving equipment.
07.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House unanimously passed H.R. 3500, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act:“Replacing John Koskinen was a great stride in our efforts to bring accountability and trust back to the IRS, but we still have a long way to go. In the final years of the Obama administration, the IRS rehired hundreds of former employees who had been fired for poor performance, abuse of power and misconduct. Federal bureaucrats shouldn’t receive special treatment and be rehired despite wrongdoing, they should be held to the same standard as the people of North Carolina.” The Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act prohibits the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from rehiring any individual, previously employed by the agency, who was removed for misconduct or was involuntarily separated for cause.A report released by the U.S. Department of the Treasury on July 27, 2017 highlights the IRS rehired more than 200 former employees between January 2015 and March 2016 that had previously been terminated for misconduct or performance issues. Examples of misconduct included falsifying employment forms, failure to maintain a successful performance level, forgery, theft, abusive actions, and excessive absence. On Tax Day this year, Walker introduced the Ditto Act, legislation that ensures the IRS maintains the same record-keeping standards as the department expects from taxpayers.
07.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced the conference report for the FY 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes his provision that directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress reviewing the Turkish government's participation in the F-35 program: “I am thankful for the efforts of Senator Tillis to add language into the National Defense Authorization Act to suspend the transfer of vital military equipment to Turkey. President Erdogan and Turkey’s acts of aggression, violation of human rights and unjust imprisonment of North Carolina pastor Andrew Brunson will not go unpunished. We cannot allow Americans traveling abroad to be falsely accused, detained and abused.”SEE RELATED: Fox News: "Rep. Walker fights to bring American pastor home from Turkey" According to Tillis' office, "the provision stipulates that the Department of Defense may not deliver any F-35 to Turkey until the report has been submitted to Congress. The provision requires an assessment of Turkey’s participation in the F-35 program, including an assessment of the impacts of a significant change in Turkish participation in the F-35 program. This reporting requirement contains language specifying that the Department of Defense should be prepared for all potential outcomes that would result if Turkey completes a purchase of the S-400 from Russia by conducting the assessment of a significant change in Turkish participation in the F-35 program, including a reduction or elimination of such participation." This action is a direct response to the Turkish government's wrongful imprisonment of North Carolina native Andrew Brunson, a pastor who has been serving in Turkey for 23 years. Brunson, the pastor of Izmir Diriliş (Resurrection) Church in Izmir, Turkey, was detained on October 7, 2016 on charges of "support of a terrorist organization" and "political or military espionage." According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), "Pastor Brunson initially was held in a cell with 21 other inmates that was built to hold only eight prisoners.

"He has been incarcerated since October 2016 without due process and inadequate physical and psychological support."
07.23.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 1689, the Private Property Rights Protection Act, with bi-partisan support::“The right to own private property is fundamental to all of our other freedoms. North Carolina farmers and families need certainty that the federal, state or local government cannot seize their property with unfair and inappropriate claims of eminent domain. Government taking private property only to transfer it to another private party is in clear violation of the Fifth Amendment.” The Private Property Rights Protection Act prohibits states that receive economic development funding from exercising eminent domain for economic development. Eminent domain is the process by which the government gains ownership of private property for public use without the owner’s consent. Traditionally, this power has been used by governments to build public use projects such as highways, railroads, and parks. A more recent development in eminent domain practice has been for governments to seize private property for “public benefit” such as economic development. A 2005 United States Supreme Court decision, Kelo v. City of New London, dealt with this practice. This legislation includes a sense of congress that rural lands are unique in that they are not typically considered high tax revenue generating properties and need long-term certainty of their property rights and that the use of eminent domain is a threat to agricultural and other property in rural America. It also includes a sense of Congress that precautions should be taken to avoid unfair taking of property from Hurricane Katrina survivors. It would require that if a court determines that a violation of this act has a disproportionate impact on the poor or on minorities, the Attorney General would be required to use reasonable effort to locate past owners and tenants and notify them of violations.
07.23.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after the Senate voted to confirm Robert Wilkie as the next Veterans Affairs Secretary:“North Carolina should be proud to have one of its own leading the Department of Veterans Affairs. Calling the nation’s most military friendly state home, Robert Wilkie is a veteran of the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and has served in posts at Ft. Bragg, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill. Wilkie’s already distinguished record of service will only grow as we work with the new secretary on reforms to help our nation’s heroes – like the now signed-into-law VA MISSION Act.” Wilkie, a North Carolina native, previously served as the acting secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.On May 16th, the House passed H.R. 5674, the Department of Veterans Affairs Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (VA MISSION) Act. According to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, the VA MISSION Act "would streamline the department’s duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program; create a non-partisan process for reviewing VA’s assets to ensure veterans can access the care they have earned and expand the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras." The legislation, which has the support of nearly 40 veterans service organizations, the VA, and the White House, would also extend the Veterans Choice Program, permitting veterans greater options to get faster care outside of the VA.
07.19.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced H.R. 6460, the Lessening Impediments From Taxes (LIFT) for Charities Act. This legislation would eliminate a measure that requires charities, churches, and traditionally tax-exempt organizations to pay federal taxes on provided employee benefits."This Congress has made historic strides to free American families and small businesses from burdensome regulations and taxes that inhibit the American Dream," Walker said. "Another important player in the fight to break the generational cycle of poverty are the charities and churches who serve our community. We need to make sure their critical work is not restricted by unnecessary taxes and strenuous compliance processes." Examples of employee benefits that would be subject to taxation if the LIFT for Charities Act is not adopted include parking spots, provided meals, and transportation benefits. These benefits are critical to the mission of the organizations; for example, many Goodwill centers offer transportation to employees.Another additional impediment to non-profit organizations without the passage of the LIFT for Charities Act is compliance burdens and fees. These organizations traditionally have not been required to file returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Without the passage of this legislation, these organizations will spend millions collectively on IRS compliance, further diminishing the resources they are able to spend on serving communities. You can read the full text of the legislation here.Recent media reports have highlighted the difficulty this presents for charities and churches. The LIFT for Charities Act follows Walker's work introducing the Universal Charitable Giving Act, which establishes an universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction. Walker also released a video to announce the introduction of the bill. Watch it here and read the full script below: "Good afternoon. As another productive week in Washington comes to a close, I am happy to head back home to North Carolina for the weekend. This week, the House passed my GAO-IG Act to fight wasteful spending and promote accountability from the federal government. "But I am most excited because I just left the House chamber and I want to share some good news with you. I was privileged to introduce a new piece of legislation we are calling the LIFT for Charities Act. LIFT simply stands for Lessing Impediments From Taxes. "This bill will maintain that charities and churches that serve our community are not burdened with unnecessary taxes and strenuous compliance measures for offering benefits to their employees. "Here is why this is important: By supporting charities we can make our communities and our country a better place for Americans from all walks of life. Every dollar that a charity spends goes further than a government dollar. No surprise, right? "In fact it has been found that government spends roughly 70% of a tax dollar to get 30% of resources to the people who need it. Conversely, charities and churches spend only 30% of every dollar to get 70% of their resources to people who need their help the most. "The bottom line is this: every dollar we can save our charities and churches amounts to real change and opportunity in our community. A future paved. A story of redemption. Maybe a life saved. "By ensuring that employee benefits like parking spots, meals, and transportation costs are not taxed, we can help these organizations do what they do best. And that’s change lives. I was proud to introduce the LIFT for Charities Act today and will be working with all of my colleagues in Congress to garner its support. "As always, thank you and God bless."
07.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after the House passed H.Res. 990, supporting the officers and personnel who carry out the important mission of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a 244-35 vote:“Today, House Democrats made a public profession in our immigration debate: they are completely and irresponsibly absent. After weeks of radical and dangerous calls to abolish ICE, almost every House Democrat voted neither yes or no on supporting the ICE officers who risk their lives to combat violent criminals, drug cartels and human traffickers. It is crystal clear they only want to exploit our broken immigration system for political gain at the cost of American families, wanting no part of working towards a solution.” H.Res. 990 expresses the House of Representatives’ support for all United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers and personnel who carry out the important mission of ICE, denounces calls for the complete abolishment of ICE, and supports the efforts of all federal agencies, state law enforcement, and military personnel who bring law and order to our nation’s borders. 133 House Democrats chose not to vote yes or no, electing instead to vote "present." In Fiscal Year 2017, 518 human Trafficking Victims were rescued by ICE, and over 904 child exploitation victims were identified or rescued by ICE. In that same time frame, ICE seized 981,586 lbs. of narcotics, including 2,370 lbs. of fentanyl and 6,967 lbs. of heroin. Just one pound of fentanyl has more than 150,000 deadly doses. In Fiscal Year 2017, ICE made 4,818 gang arrests, including 796 MS-13 members.
07.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed his legislation, H.R. 5415, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government (GAO-IG) Act with unanimous bipartisan support:“When federal bureaucratic agencies become so large and unaccountable they ignore recommendations on how to improve and save taxpayer dollars, they are only serving themselves, not the people of North Carolina. Washington needs to serve the hard-working families of our nation, not their own interests. I am proud to lead this successful effort to make our government better, more transparent, and to protect misuse of taxpayer funds.”The GAO-IG Act would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. The bill is a House companion to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Read the full text of the GAO-IG Act here.These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations.As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations. In May, Walker addressed the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on the legislation preceding its committee approval. Watch Walker's remarks and see a full transcript here and below: "The Government Accountability Office and the inspectors general are the two best sources for recommendations to improve federal government operations. GOA and IG efforts help fight waste, fraud, and abuse, and promote effectiveness and effective executive agencies. GAO and IGs conduct audits and investigations, which often results in reports with recommendations directed to a specific agency. "As of May 16, 2018, GAO has issued 1,566 products with 4,827 open recommendations. "And since 2014, OIGs have issued over 8,900 reports with approximately 40,300 total recommendations. Now during the same time period, OIG has identified over 99 billion dollars in potential savings through their audits and investigations and associated recommendations. But those recommendations are only as valuable as the agency’s commitment to implement them. "The GAO-IG Act requires an agency to report on the recommendations from their OIG and GAO within the budget justification to Congress. The agency must also report on the implementation status of each recommendation, and why they may have not been implemented fully."This creates a process in which agencies must take stock of their open and unimplemented recommendations. It is my hope that the increased transparency will cause agencies to work toward closing these outstanding recommendations. "Congress can also use the new report to improve its oversight activities. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars."I urge my colleagues to support the bill."
07.05.2018	SANFORD, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored Doris Watson of Sanford as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for July 2018. The presentation was held at Lee County Industries (LCI) in Sanford. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Watson will celebrate her 40th anniversary as an Adult Developmental Vocational Program (ADVP) Instructor at LCI on July 11, 2018. LCI “provides rehabilitation and educational training to youth and adults with barriers to employment. The wide variety of training opportunities available attracts a broad range of individuals, including people with disabilities, those adapting from accidental injuries and others from low-income families.” Watson works with adults who have developmental disabilities and prepares them to live as independently as possible. She considers her work to be her ministry and life’s calling, and was inspired to enter the field when she realized how many people “need love outside of their own homes.” While she is celebrating 40 years, she plans to continue working until she knows it’s time to retire. "Doris is the heart of Lee County Industries," Mike Gilmore, Executive Director of LCI, said. "For 40 of its 50 years she has encouraged, mentored, and loved all in her care and in doing so has prepared hundreds for a better life." "When I first visited with the students and faculty of LCI, I knew I met a truly remarkable person in Doris," Walker said. "She exhibits what it means to see the goodness, truth and beauty in every single individual God creates. Doris has had an immeasurable impact on her community." Watson lives in Sanford with her husband, Willie. She has two children and five grandchildren. She was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in her honor.
06.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 6, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, in a 396-14 vote:"The opioid epidemic is the largest public health crisis in our country with one in four Americans being close to someone who is addicted to these drugs – myself included. After hearing from law enforcement, EMTs, addicts, recovery centers, state lawmakers and hospitals about the need for more resources during our opioid crisis tour in North Carolina, we are now answering back with the most expansive congressional effort in history. In 2016, nearly 2,000 North Carolinians had their opportunity-filled futures ended because of this problem, leaving countless family members grieving and hurt. These reforms will give hope to struggling families in North Carolina and let every person know they do not have to go through addiction alone, while stopping the flow of illicit drugs into our community."The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is a bipartisan bill that will help in our overall efforts to combat the opioid crisis by advancing treatment and recovery initiatives, improving prevention, protecting our communities, and bolstering our efforts to fight deadly illicit synthetic drugs like fentanyl. The legislation follows the passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act and the 21st Century Cures Act last Congress, and represents the most significant congressional effort against a single drug crisis in history.The reforms focus on treatment and recovery by improving and expanding access to treatment and recovery services and establishing comprehensive opioid recovery centers. It also helps prevent addictions by encouraging non-addictive opioid alternatives to treat pain and improving data to identify and help at-risk patients and families. Additionally, the legislation gives local law enforcement tools to get dangerous drugs out of communities and to stop the importation of illicit and synthetic drugs. In October 2017, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina. Many of the reforms in the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act adhered to specific feedback Walker received from different organizations and sectors during the tour.Read more about the Opioid Crisis Tour in a story in the Washington Examiner here.As the story notes, "since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, nationwide drug overdoses now kill more Americans than gun homicides and car crashes combined."You can learn more about the opioid epidemic and Walker's opioid crisis tour by watching the videos below: You can read the full text of the legislation here.
06.21.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, also called the "farm bill:""Though more reforms are needed, this farm bill provides critical certainty to our farmers and makes needed investments in broadband for our state’s rural communities. Moreover, this legislation represents one of the most positive reforms of our broken welfare system that has trapped millions in a vicious cycle of poverty. By promoting the dignity of work and using welfare funds to invest in job-training for work-capable adults, we can bring hope and opportunity to families who have not seen it for generations.”The farm bill would authorize federal agriculture, conservation, and nutrition programs under the Department of Agriculture until 2023, make critical reforms to encourage work for benefits, and provide access to job-training programs. Critically for North Carolina, the legislation makes investments and priorities in rural broadband to expand access.The farm bill also represents one of the largest positive welfare reforms to pass the House in some time. According to the House Agriculture Committee the legislation "provides that work capable adults (ages 18-59) work or participate in work training for 20 hours per week. Exempted populations include seniors, disabled, those caring for children under six, or those who are pregnant. No individual loses Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits unless they decline to work or accept free training to learn a skill."Currently, there are 769,300 able-bodied adults in North Carolina on SNAP. Studies find that 61 percent of those recipients are not working. These reforms would give 484,000 North Carolinians access to work or free job-training to close the skills gap and find work in one of the 6.7 million job openings across the country.Similar reforms have been implemented in Kansas and Maine with great success. Enrollees who returned to work more than doubled their incomes and their time on welfare was cut in half.You can read the full text of the legislation here.
06.21.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after the House failed to pass H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018 in a 193-231 vote:"I co-sponsored this legislation because I believe it would go a long way to solve decades of unfair and unlawful actions that have plagued our immigration system, while prioritizing the safety of North Carolina families. It was disheartening to see not a single Democrat vote to give peace of mind to DACA recipients, while implementing national E-Verify, strengthening our border, defunding dangerous sanctuary cities, preventing family separations under Department of Homeland Security custody and moving to a merit-based immigration system – all measures supported by a majority of the American people. It is possible to be compassionate and just, while adhering to the rule of law and securing our border to prevent unlawful human trafficking, drug smuggling and foreign threats." The Securing America's Future Act enhances enforcement of existing immigration law, includes important reforms to our legal immigration programs, secures the border, and provides a legislative solution for the current beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Walker is a co-sponsor of this legislation. In January, Walker led the Republican Study Committee in calling on a vote for the legislation in a joint statement calling it "the framework to strengthen border security, increase interior enforcement and resolve the DACA situation."

06.18.2018	DURHAM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Friday delivered the keynote address at the North Carolina Legislative Black Caucus Foundation’s 2018 Wainwright Annual Scholarship Banquet benefiting Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in North Carolina. Walker was the first Republican in the 32-year history of the banquet to be invited to speak. The banquet took place at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Durham.In the address, Walker discussed his background, why he ran for Congress, the importance of establishing strong relationships before enacting policies, and his focus of not just making an argument, but making a difference. "Anybody can make an argument, but to me the true heroes, the true leaders, they make a difference," Walker said. "Whether you’re conservative or whether you’re considered progressive, it’s got to come from your heart.""Republicans like to talk about welfare reform…but to have credibility, we have got to be talking more about criminal justice reform as well," Walker added. "If we truly believe that these are systemic problems with the family, then we need to address all the needs of the family."Walker was introduced by Chancellor Elwood Robinson of Winston-Salem State University, who noted that Walker comes from a "HBCU household" as Walker's wife Kelly has earned two degrees from Robinson's university.Watch the full introduction and speech by Walker here: The banquet was attended by almost 500 members and supporters of the NCLBCF, as well as students from HBCUs in North Carolina. Following Walker's speech, he was presented with this award "in appreciation for all [his] support to NC HBCUs."
06.13.2018	Pictured above from left to right: Rep. Walker, Tony Watlington, Jr., Jameia Booker, and Rep. Adams. WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and U.S. Representative Alma Adams (D-N.C.) welcomed their third class of Congressional Bipartisan Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Caucus interns to Washington, D.C. this week. The internship, launched in 2016, is aimed at increasing diversity and engagement on Capitol Hill through HBCUs.The lack of diversity among congressional staff has been a well-documented issue. A recent study found that African-Americans make up less than one percent of top Senate staffers, despite representing 13 percent of the U.S. population. Reps. Walker and Adams are taking action to change this course. The HBCU Bipartisan Congressional Internship program is the first of its kind, featuring two interns, who will each spend a four-week period in the office of both a Republican and a Democrat.The interns in the program will also have the opportunity to meet with key players on Capitol Hill, including Members of Congress and senior staff. They will also have to meet performance standards that ensure a quality, educational experience, including attending hearings and briefings, writing letters, completing projects, and writing an essay about their time and what they learned.Earlier this year, Vashti Hinton, a participant from the inaugural 2016 class, was the first to be hired as a full-time staff member on Capitol Hill. Hinton works for U.S. Representative Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.).“Congresswoman Adams and I started this initiative to increase diversity and HBCU engagement on Capitol Hill, while creating opportunities and valuable job-training for the students of our nation’s more than 100 HBCUs,” Walker said. “Working together for the betterment of our students, this internship program has yielded success, with one of the programs first participants, Vashti, gaining employment in a congressional office after graduating. I am thrilled to have Tony and Jameia spending time in our office and Adams’s office this summer, and look forward to continuing advocating on behalf of the HBCU community.”“This third class of HBCU interns is a testament to our commitment to fighting for equal opportunity and fixing the diversity problem on Capitol Hill,” Adams said. “HBCUs contribute more than $14 billion dollars annually to our economy and have provided pathways of opportunity for millions of Americans from varied backgrounds. These institutions are essential to workforce diversity, especially here in Washington. We should all be working to ensure that their students and their graduates have access to Capitol Hill. We will not produce policies that address the issues impacting all Americans if we don’t have diverse policy makers. This internship is a necessary step to ensuring Congress looks like the people it serves.”“Programs like this give me great hope for the future,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) said. “Tackling the challenges we face requires perspectives from the best and the brightest. I applaud the leadership of Congresswoman Adams and Congressman Walker and wish Tony and Jameia the best as they take part in this opportunity and represent their schools, as well as the HBCU community, on Capitol Hill.”“The voices of young people are vital to the work of the Congress and the success of our democracy,” Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said. “We have no greater responsibility than to create opportunities for young people to use their talent to affect positive change in the world. Congresswoman Adams and Congressman Walker’s leadership on their HBCU Internship initiative strengthens our shared commitment to building a better future for our children, and is to be commended.”This summer’s interns are Tony Watlington, Jr., a rising senior at NC A&T State University, and Jameia Booker, a rising senior at Johnson C. Smith University. Watlington is an economics major and a Student Government Association Senator. Booker is a criminology major and pre-law minor who is serving as student body president during the 2018-2019 school year. Both are interested in attending law school following graduation. The program will provide both students with a bipartisan opportunity to intern on Capitol Hill and to network with senior members of staff on both sides of the aisle; exposing HBCU students to federal advocacy careers and building a pipeline of qualified young professionals to increase diversity on Capitol Hill.
06.11.2018	GRAHAM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored Hank Williams of Graham as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for June 2018. The presentation was held at Walker's congressional office in Graham. Graham Mayor Jerry Peterman was also in attendance. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Williams is originally from Hickory, N.C. and received a degree in sociology from Lenior-Rhyne University. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1969, serving in Vietnam as a combat engineer. After a long military career, as well as work in the private sector, Williams began work as an employment consultant with the North Carolina Employment Security Commission and was soon after selected for the position of veterans supervisor, a role where he encourages businesses in five counties to hire veterans. Returning back from a trip, Williams stopped in the USO office at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport and noticed a basket of stars from an American Flag at the desk. He was inspired to use a similar method of showing appreciation to veterans. In his spare time, Williams takes retired U.S. flags that are no longer able to fly, and cuts the stars out, creating patches. He then writes messages for veterans on the back of the patch and hands them out to veterans that he comes across in the community. Mr. Williams is also the reason that every Tanger Outlet Center across the country has parking spots reserved for veterans. As Williams tells the story: "The idea behind this was that many Vietnam and Korean War Veterans were "aging out" and may not have the traditional handicap tag required for parking closer to the building. For over a year I heard nothing from their corporate headquarters and decided I would go to the top. I found out Steve Tanger's father was a Veteran so I wrote directly to him asking if he didn't think this would be a fitting way to honor his father. I really didn't know if I would receive an answer but less that two weeks or so later I received an email from Steve Tanger saying that he was looking into doing it in Mebane. Then he said he liked the idea so much he was putting in Veteran only parking in all 44 Tanger locations." Williams is a member of the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and volunteers at other service organizations. "Although I am receiving this award, this award belongs to all veterans and the stars say it the best," Williams said."That 'you are not forgotten.'" "Hank Williams spends every day of his life making others feel loved and cared for," Walker said. "His selfless service to his neighbors – especially our nation's veterans – is truly inspiring. Real heroes know the impact that a simple act of recognition can have on a person's life, and Hank takes that power and multiplies it in ways that makes a difference in hundreds of lives. We are proud to have him represent our community." Williams was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in his honor.
06.07.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 3, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act:"One thing I’ve learned in Washington is that politicians like unspent money to be held in bloated government accounts so they can use it later as a way to expand the size of government, hiding it from their constituents. Today, we say no more and that unspent government money should be returned to the taxpayers. This rescission package, a procedure used by Republican and Democratic administrations, represents the largest use of this tool to cut wasteful spending in history." This legislation rescinds nearly $15 billion of unobligated balances from previously appropriated and expired funding. According to the Republican Study Committee "the Impoundment Control Act [of 1974] allows the President to propose via a special message to Congress specific rescissions of budget authority that has not been obligated to Congress and establishes a 45-day window for the House and Senate to consider a bill based on the proposed rescissions in under expedited procedures, most notably removing the possibility of a Senate filibuster. The bill may consist only of language to rescind all or part of the budget authority included in the President’s special message." The vote on the rescission package, announced the afternoon of Wednesday, June 6th, followed reporting earlier that morning that Walker had requested a vote on the legislation from House Republican leadership. Republican Study Committee Chairman @RepMarkWalker: “We have not signed off on moving forward with a 'yes' vote on the minibus appropriations, until we have information on a more solid date for the rescissions package.” https://t.co/DeAY3BIQRl— Jennifer Shutt (@JenniferShutt) June 6, 2018 Last month, Walker penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal highlighting the rescissions package that President Donald Trump submitted to Congress in May, and why it is important to pass, calling it "the epilogue to March’s spending saga." "Mr. McConnell said Tuesday that he’d consider bringing the president’s initial package to the floor, since it doesn’t affect any of the omnibus spending," Walker wrote. "Still, it’s unclear why a Republican would fight to preserve the dysfunctional process that led to the disastrous omnibus. Voters continuously remind us that Republicans should be doing everything possible to change the broken process. The reality is that Republicans gave their word to the American people to rein in out-of-control spending. Apparently some Republicans prioritize promises to Democrats in backroom deals over promises to the American people. In any case, it is disingenuous to insinuate congressional Republicans or Mr. Trump are trying to pull a fast one with any rescissions package. A Democrat-controlled Congress created the expedited process for rescissions in 1974, which bypasses the filibuster by requiring a simple majority." The rescission package now heads to the Senate, where it can pass with a simple majority vote. You can read the full text of the legislation here.
05.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019:“As we enter a weekend of reverence and remembrance of our fallen heroes, we have the opportunity to dedicate ourselves to provide our servicemen and servicewomen with the tools they need to stay safe while keeping our nations secure and executing their missions. This defense bill gives our troops the largest pay raise in nine years, provides a path to newer and safer equipment to combat an alarming rise in accidents and fights sexual assault so all in our military can feel safe, confident and cared for. God bless our troops as they address global threats from aggressors like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, and thank you to all the heroes who came before them.” This legislation authorizes and prioritizes funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) and military activities and construction, and prescribes military personnel strengths for Fiscal Year 2019.

05.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday addressed the House Oversight and Government Reform on his legislation, H.R. 5415, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government (GAO-IG) Act. Following Walker's remarks, the committee approved the GAO-IG Act, paving the way for a vote on the House floor. This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. Walker introduced the GAO-IG Act in March.“Right now, North Carolina taxpayers are having their hard-earned money wasted by federal bureaucrats who have been told how to improve and become more efficient, but refuse to follow recommendations,” Walker said in March. “That is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.” The bill is a House companion to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations. As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations.Watch Walker's remarks and see a full transcript here and below: "The Government Accountability Office and the inspectors general are the two best sources for recommendations to improve federal government operations. GOA and IG efforts help fight waste, fraud, and abuse, and promote effectiveness and effective executive agencies. GAO and IGs conduct audits and investigations, which often results in reports with recommendations directed to a specific agency. "As of May 16, 2018, GAO has issued 1,566 products with 4,827 open recommendations. "And since 2014, OIGs have issued over 8,900 reports with approximately 40,300 total recommendations. Now during the same time period, OIG has identified over 99 billion dollars in potential savings through their audits and investigations and associated recommendations. But those recommendations are only as valuable as the agency’s commitment to implement them. "The GAO-IG Act requires an agency to report on the recommendations from their OIG and GAO within the budget justification to Congress. The agency must also report on the implementation status of each recommendation, and why they may have not been implemented fully."This creates a process in which agencies must take stock of their open and unimplemented recommendations. It is my hope that the increased transparency will cause agencies to work toward closing these outstanding recommendations. "Congress can also use the new report to improve its oversight activities. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars."I urge my colleagues to support the bill."
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act:“Local banks used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community, proudly thriving on Main Streets in our towns and serving as the source of capital for local businesses to start, expand, and grow. Unfortunately, heavy-handed and costly regulations in the Dodd-Frank legislation have caused many of these small banks to shutter or pass along financial burdens to consumers and job creators. Last year, the House proudly passed the Financial CHOICE Act to reverse course, but the Senate ultimately failed to pass it. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act includes many of those same reforms and focuses on freeing our local banks to help our communities thrive.” On June 8, 2017, the House passed H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017. This legislation would modify provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd Frank Act) and other laws governing regulation of the financial industry. The bill would change the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets under $10 billion (community banks) and for large banks with assets over $50 billion. The bill also would make changes to consumer mortgage and credit-reporting regulations and to the authorities of the agencies that regulate the financial industry. In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide. Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs. You can read the full text of the legislation here.
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 5682, the FIRST STEP Act, legislation that Walker co-sponsored:“America’s prison system routinely turns low level offenders into hardened, repeat offenders. The FIRST STEP Act takes important steps to reverse this trend by expanding education and job training opportunities for prisoners, offering them a much-needed hand up to once again become productive members of society. Justice is not the same as heavy-handedness. The American story is a history of second chances, that’s why we must always ensure that after debts are paid, the path to redemption is paved.” According to the House Judiciary Committee "the FIRST STEP Act implements a post-sentencing dynamic risk assessment system to determine an inmate’s risk of committing more crimes upon release from prison Under the legislation, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) would utilize effective recidivism reduction programs and provide incentives for inmates to participate in those programs. Ultimately, inmates could earn credits toward an alternative custody arrangement – such as a halfway house or home confinement – at the end of their prison sentence." The legislation also enhances prison security by requiring the Director of BOP to provide a secure storage area outside the secure perimeter for employees to store firearms or to allow for vehicle lock boxes for firearms. It also requires the Director to provide de-escalation training as part of the regular training requirements of correctional officers. Additionally, the legislation provides more employment opportunities for inmates by expanding the federal prison industries program and extends the compassionate elderly release provision from the Second Chance Act that allows the prisoner to request for his or her compassionate release if he or she meets the requirements set out in the law. In April, Walker penned an op-ed in The Hill Congressional Black Caucus Chairman and U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond (D-La.) highlighting the need for criminal justice reform by Congress and calling on congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle to help facilitate action. "We have the opportunity to restore families and help people find redemption instead of condemnation," they wrote. "Together, we are calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford this issue the national attention it deserves." Read the op-ed in its entirety here. You can read the full text of the legislation here.
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed S. 204, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017:“The government should not be able to prevent a terminally ill individual from seeking a potentially life-saving cure. President Trump requested this House-originated legislation in his State of the Union Address and now we are proud to send it to his desk for his signature. Every man, woman and child deserves the right to try." This legislation would amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt the provision of certain unapproved, investigational drugs to a terminally ill patient who has exhausted approved treatment options and is unable to participate in a clinical trial involving the drugs. The House sent this legislation to the Senate following a March 21, 2018 vote. According to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce "the Right to Try movement has swept across the nation, with 39 states passing laws that take a variety of approaches to help vulnerable patients." You can read the full text of the legislation here.
05.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement in support of President Trump’s announcement of the Protect Life Rule to Title X funding:“Americans overwhelmingly support a prohibition of taxpayer funding for abortion. I applaud President Trump for keeping this key promise to voters, strengthening the wall between government funding and abortion industry giants like Planned Parenthood and adding protections for victims of sexual assault and human trafficking. With not one penny cut from family planning services, we can protect the value of every human life and place the interest and health of women ahead of the abortion agenda.”
05.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 5674, the Department of Veterans Affairs Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (VA MISSION) Act:“North Carolina’s more than 700,000 veterans deserve better than to suffer for years on VA waiting lists or travel hours just to get the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. Extending the Choice Program that helps get our heroes faster care closer to home and expanding assistance options for their family caregivers will help us keep our promise to our veterans, from the Greatest Generation to the current generation. The VA MISSION Act is an important step in our office’s work to serve each of those who have given selflessly to our nation.”According to the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, the VA MISSION Act "would streamline the department’s duplicative community care programs into one cohesive program; create a non-partisan process for reviewing VA’s assets to ensure veterans can access the care they have earned and expand the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Post-9/11 Caregiver Program to all eras." The legislation, which has the support ofnearly 40 veterans service organizations, the VA, and the White House, would also extend the Veterans Choice Program, permitting veterans greater options to get faster care outside of the VA. Former North Carolina Senator Elizabeth Dole wrote an op-ed in The Hill supporting the VA MISSION Act. "We will help millions of America’s hidden heroes, like Diane, who manage medications, schedule doctor’s appointments and rehab sessions, and provide daily personal hygiene and physical therapy to their veterans at home," she wrote.You can read the full text of the legislation here.
05.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 5698, the Protect and Serve Act of 2018:“Every day across North Carolina, men and women who took a solemn oath to uphold the law put on their uniform and accept the dangerous work of defending our neighborhoods and keeping our families safe. They need to know they have the full support of our community, our prayers for safety and the full protection of the law. With the passage of the Protect and Serve Act, we make clear that we will not tolerate targeted harm on our law enforcement officers.”This legislation expands title 18 to allow for federal prosecution of individuals who knowingly assault a law enforcement officer causing serious bodily injury. This vote happens as the nation celebrates National Police Week. According to acommittee report from the House Committee on the Judiciary, attacks targeting police officers are at an all-time high, fueled by anti-police sentiment.

05.14.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored Crystal Black and Gene Blackmon of Greensboro as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for May 2018. The presentation was held at the Peeler Recreation Center, which was used an emergency shelter following the April 15th tornado and storm that hit parts of Guilford and Rockingham counties. Guilford County Sheriff BJ Barnes, Greensboro Mayor Nancy Vaughan, Greensboro Councilwoman Goldie Wells, and Greensboro Councilwoman Sharon Hightower were in attendance.Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Crystal serves as the Site Coordinator for Communities in Schools at Guilford County Schools. She teamed up with the East Greensboro Community Collective to assist tornado victims and has focused much of her energy over the last five years as an advocate and fundraiser for James B. Dudley High School. “I have a love for the East side of Greensboro and the people that live in the community,” Black said. “I am also an advocate for the underdog. What better way to serve than to have shown up on a Monday morning to just help people in need. I am honored to be recognized for giving but more so hope that it may inspire others to give back.” Gene is the owner and director of owner and director of Prestige Barber College. He has been a community leader and activist for many years. Along with Crystal, he worked with the East Greensboro Community Collective to assist tornado victims. Learn more about Gene from WFMY News 2 here. Both Crystal and Gene served as key volunteer leaders to serve East Greensboro following the April 15th storm. “Crystal and Gene served as critical leaders for our community in one of our biggest times of need,” Walker said. “As soon as the storm hit, they were on the ground, helping others get essential resources and help. Even as they were honored, they made it all about others, inviting a group of committed community servants to join them for recognition.” Crystal and Gene were presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
05.14.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Friday penned an op-ed in The News and Observer announcing that he has been "holding discussions with thought leaders, schools and former college athletes on potential legislative solutions" to the current problems that face the NCAA athletic system."The current student-athlete model prohibits 500,000 college athletes from having financial rights to use their name, while allowing an unrestrained, tax-exempt organization to monetize their talent to fill stadiums, sell memorabilia and sign multibillion dollar contracts," Walker wrote. "That gets at the heart of what is wrong with the way we are currently treating our college athletes. The system lacks accountability for the NCAA, schools, coaches and players, opening the door for corruption in what has grown to a $12 billion a year industry.""In the coming weeks, we will continue to engage in a national discussion on solutions and whether Congress needs to get involved," Walker added. "We owe it to our college athletes to build a better system that incentivizes them to finish school, rewards their achievements and gives them opportunity and hope for the future."Another story in The News and Observer noted that Walker "called on the NCAA to allow college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness, joining a growing chorus of influential people advocating for major change to the way colleges treat student-athletes and threatening legislation if the NCAA does not make changes quickly."Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:It's time to look at compensating college athletesThe News and ObserverBy: Rep. Mark Walker May 11, 2018Two weeks ago, 224 young men experienced the thrill of a lifetime as they heard their name pronounced over the speakers in front of 100,000 fans at the NFL Draft. That moment has to be one of the most rewarding of a football player’s career. After all the hard work, training, studying and sacrifice, he is now a football player in the National Football League – an achievement less than two percent of college athletes will ever reach.There are a number of obvious advantages for a college football player who has his name called on draft night – pride, fame, multi-million dollar contracts, a dream career. Unfortunately, what many don’t understand is because of the flawed NCAA system, that is also the moment that athlete finally has the full rights to his own name restored.Despite some recent movement from the NCAA on the issue, most schools continue to require athletes to sign waivers giving up their publicity rights. That means that when an athlete commits to a school he or she is asked to surrender all rights to use his or her name, image and likeness. Essentially this strips them of their identity and sovereignty over their public image.As with every other freedom, they don’t go away. They are just transferred to empower someone else. In this case, those publicity rights and the large wealth created by them are held tight by school athletic departments, sports conference board rooms and NCAA administrators.The current student-athlete model prohibits 500,000 college athletes from having financial rights to use their name, while allowing an unrestrained, tax-exempt organization to monetize their talent to fill stadiums, sell memorabilia and sign multibillion dollar contracts.That gets at the heart of what is wrong with the way we are currently treating our college athletes. The system lacks accountability for the NCAA, schools, coaches and players, opening the door for corruption in what has grown to a $12 billion a year industry.Recently, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who has been leading a commission investigating ways to alleviate misconduct in college basketball, said, “The levels of corruption and deception are now at a point that they threaten the very survival of the college game as we know it.”Even worse, the current model ensures a continuing cycle of poverty for many of the student-athletes, a large number of whom come from low-income communities and almost all of whom never play at a professional level. Only about half of Division I football and men's basketball players even leave school with a four-year degree.The NCAA has been given time to assuage these concerns, but has ultimately fallen short. While the organization and their affiliated college athletic departments are in large part staffed with honorable people who work hard to serve young players and uphold integrity, it’s time we examined whether or not more motivation is needed to improve the system for players, administrators, and fans alike.For the last several months, I have been holding discussions with thought leaders, schools and former college athletes on potential legislative solutions to this problem. I will continue those efforts and invite others to join. We need to have a conversation around this, not only to save the sports we love, but to truly care for the athletes who participate.Signing a scholarship with a university should not be a moratorium on an athlete’s ability to use his or her name and image, or to attain a livable wage for their talent. Instead of a model that devalues hard work and strips athletes of the rights to their own name, we need a system that encourages the dignity of work and upholds the value of personal initiative and freedom — foundations of the American idea.In the coming weeks, we will continue to engage in a national discussion on solutions and whether Congress needs to get involved.We owe it to our college athletes to build a better system that incentivizes them to finish school, rewards their achievements and gives them opportunity and hope for the future. Now is the time. As Secretary Rice said, the survival of college sports may very well depend on it.U.S. Rep.

05.09.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) penned an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal highlighting the rescissions package that President Donald Trump submitted to Congress on Tuesday, and why it is important to pass, calling it "the epilogue to March’s spending saga." "Mr. McConnell said Tuesday that he’d consider bringing the president’s initial package to the floor, since it doesn’t affect any of the omnibus spending," Walker wrote. "Still, it’s unclear why a Republican would fight to preserve the dysfunctional process that led to the disastrous omnibus. Voters continuously remind us that Republicans should be doing everything possible to change the broken process. The reality is that Republicans gave their word to the American people to rein in out-of-control spending. Apparently some Republicans prioritize promises to Democrats in backroom deals over promises to the American people. In any case, it is disingenuous to insinuate congressional Republicans or Mr. Trump are trying to pull a fast one with any rescissions package. A Democrat-controlled Congress created the expedited process for rescissions in 1974, which bypasses the filibuster by requiring a simple majority."Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below: Start Cutting Spending—and Don’t StopThe Wall Street Journal By: Reps. Mark Walker May 8, 2018 Washington is more broken even than the politicians are willing to admit. Case in point: When President Trump submitted his rescissions package Tuesday, its passage in the Senate was still in doubt. The rescissions package is the epilogue to March’s spending saga, when Mr. Trump threatened to veto the congressional omnibus and pledged never to sign such a bill again. Now after the omnibus increased annual discretionary spending by $137 billion, Mr. Trump has proposed to claw back $15.4 billion in waste. Rescissions aren’t merely a Republican political maneuver against Democrats. President Clinton used the process 166 times to save more than $3.5 billion. While effective, the most recent package sent by President Trump is especially innocuous, politically speaking, clawing back unneeded, unspent funds, some of which were appropriated as far back as 1993. But some powerful lawmakers have warned against rescission. One of the first was Mr. McConnell, who told Fox News that rescission would jeopardize future budget negotiations with Democrats: “You can’t make an agreement one month and say, ‘OK, we really didn’t mean it.’ ” Mr. McConnell said Tuesday that he’d consider bringing the president’s initial package to the floor, since it doesn’t affect any of the omnibus spending. Still, it’s unclear why a Republican would fight to preserve the dysfunctional process that led to the disastrous omnibus. Voters continuously remind us that Republicans should be doing everything possible to change the broken process. The reality is that Republicans gave their word to the American people to rein in out-of-control spending. Apparently some Republicans prioritize promises to Democrats in backroom deals over promises to the American people. In any case, it is disingenuous to insinuate congressional Republicans or Mr. Trump are trying to pull a fast one with any rescissions package. A Democrat-controlled Congress created the expedited process for rescissions in 1974, which bypasses the filibuster by requiring a simple majority. It is also worthwhile to reflect on how Congress arrived in this position in the first place. Last September, the House performed its constitutional duty and passed all the appropriations bills required to fund fully the federal government. We sent those bills to the Senate before the beginning of the fiscal year—and Mr. McConnell sat on them. This decision held vital national-security funding hostage, and teed up the backroom process that led to the 2,232-page omnibus, which passed less than two days after being made public. Loaded into the whole debate about rescissions is the notion that Congress has its hands tied. Nobody can accuse the Founding Fathers of being unclear on Congress’s power of the purse. In recent years, it has become commonplace for members to complain about legislative items and throw up their hands in frustration. If a law needs to be changed or spending levels need to be changed, Congress can do that at any time by its own prerogative. The package Mr. Trump sent yesterday is good, and his base should be encouraged in this moment of fiscal restraint. Hopefully, the package is the first of many. Now, Congress has to do its job.

05.09.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after President Donald Trump announced withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also called the Iran Nuclear Deal:"President Trump made the right decision in withdrawing from the Iran Nuclear Deal. Nobody should be surprised that the deal failed to rein in the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. At its core, the deal was destined to fail due to its inability to curb the Iranian Regime’s expansionist and destabilizing goals in the greater Middle East. The unsurprising revelations from Israeli intelligence only confirm the deal’s failure. Americans continue to back the President’s robust agenda to support our key allies in the region and contain the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps."
05.08.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) announced that President Donald J. Trump issued a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of North Carolina triggering the release of Federal funds to help people recover from a Tornado and Severe Storms that occurred April 15, 2018:“When a storm hit our community, we were tested. We answered with our full strength, working and seeing neighborhoods, organizations, churches and local officials together to recover, rebuild and be a resource to others. It was an honor to bring Vice President Pence to view first hand how our community stepped up bringing hope and unity in the face of hardship and devastation. When the Vice President was here, he promised the full support of the federal government, and with this declaration by FEMA, we have received it. Our efforts are not over, we remain committed to serving all of those impacted to our fullest ability.” The action by FEMA and President Trump follows a Vice President Mike Pence visit to the impacted areas of Greensboro, N.C. on April 20, 2018, as well as a North Carolina U.S. Congressional Delegation letter to FEMA Administrator Brock Long to support North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s request that the President declare a major disaster for the State of North Carolina, under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act. The declaration will allow those impacted by the storm to apply for federal assistance with FEMA. It can be read in full here. According to the FEMA Declaration Fact Sheet: Individuals in Guilford and Rockingham Counties can register with FEMA the following ways: • Apply online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov. • Constituents may call the registration phone number at 1-800-621-3362; those who have a speech disability or hearing loss and use TTY, should call 1-800-462-7585 directly; for those who use 711 or Video Relay Service (VRS), call 1-800-621-3362. Any constituent who has questions or is in need of assistance is encouraged to call Walker's office at 336-333-5005.
04.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday joined the North Carolina U.S. Congressional Delegation in writing to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long to support North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s request that the President declare a major disaster for the State of North Carolina, under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, as a result of severe weather that effected Guilford and Rockingham counties on April 15, 2018.In part, the letter reads: "Since the storms, state, county, and FEMA officials have undertaken preliminary damage assessments (PDA) for Individual Assistance (IA). The findings underscore the devastation that was brought upon these communities by the EF2 tornado. In Guilford County, the PDA found that 36 homes or businesses were destroyed, 180 homes suffered major damage, 289 homes incurred minor damage, and 316 properties were affectedFurther, three elementary schools in Guilford County will remain closed for the remainder of the school year due to damage inflicted on the buildings. In Rockingham County, the PDA found five homes or businesses destroyed, seven with major damages, 21 with minor damages, and 19 properties affected." "…To that end, we urge the President to approve this request for a major disaster declaration, consistent with the intended purposes of FEMA and the federal Stafford Act, in order to provide Individual Assistance as soon as possible to assist the citizens of these two counties." The full letter can read here and below: Dear Administrator Long, As Members of Congress representing the people of North Carolina, we write in support of Governor Roy Cooper’s request that the President declare of a major disaster for the State of North Carolina, under Section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief Act, as a result of severe weather that effected Guilford and Rockingham counties on April 15, 2018. Since the storms impacted the area state, county, and FEMA officials have undertaken preliminary damage assessments (PDA) for Individual Assistance (IA). The findings of these assessments underscore the devastation that was brought upon these communities by the EF2 tornado. In Guilford County the PDA found the 36 homes or businesses were destroyed, 180 homes suffered major damage, 289 homes have minor damage, and 316 properties affected. Further three elementary schools in Guilford County will remain closed for the remainder of the school year due to damage inflicted on the buildings. In Rockingham County the PDA found five homes or businesses destroyed, seven with major damages, 21 with minor damages, and 19 properties affected. While any family or business adversely affected by severe weather is a tragedy, the storm on April 15, 2018 hit areas with poverty rates over 3.5% above the national average. This will make recovering and putting people’s lives together even more difficult. Too that end, we urge the President to approve this request for a major disaster declaration, consistent with the intended purposes of FEMA and the federal Stafford Act, that will provide Individual Assistance as soon as possible to assist the citizens of these two counties. We would like to thank you for FEMA’s efforts in recent years as our state continues to recover from Hurricane Matthew, and look forward to working collaboratively with FEMA, state agencies, and county officials as we begin to rebuild from this most recent storm.
04.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday, on Tax Day, introduced the Ditto Act of 2018. This legislation would ensure the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains the same record-keeping standards as the department expects from the taxpayers by requiring them to keep preserved records for at least three years after obtaining the record. A preserved record is any record maintained by a person other than the federal government pursuant to a rule, guidance, or other directive from the IRS recommending or requiring that the person maintain records for a particular period of time."The bureaucratic failures of the IRS were on full display yesterday as they were unable to perform even a basic duty on their most critical day of the year," Walker said. "Another way the IRS is failing North Carolina taxpayers is with lack of accountability. Run for almost a decade by Commissioners who spent more time misleading Congress and attempting to bury scandals than they did serving Americans, the IRS has operated under a different set of rules than what they expect from taxpayers. The Ditto Act forces accountability on the IRS and ensures that they are working under the same rules as the people and businesses of North Carolina."Yesterday, the IRS payment website crashed as millions of returns were expected to come in, resulting in the IRS having to extend the filing deadline for taxpayers. The bill will now be referred to the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Similar legislation, the Ditto Act of 2016, was introduced by Walker in 2016 and passed the U.S. House of Representatives.The Greensboro News and Record called the Ditto Act their "favorite title for new legislation" in 2016.Read the full text of the Ditto Act of 2018 here.
04.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.), chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and U.S. Representative Cedric Richmond (D-La.) recently penned an op-ed in The Hill highlighting the need for criminal justice reform by Congress and calling on congressional leadership on both sides of the aisle to help facilitate action."Incarceration statistics paint a grim picture of the nightmare millions face: 2.7 million children under the age of 18 have an incarcerated parent; there are more jails than colleges in the United States; non-violent drug offenses account for almost half of the total population in federal prisons; and taxpayers spend more than $70 billion each year to incarcerate 1 in 100 American adults," Walker and Richmond write. "Even worse, these wasted dollars make us all less safe. We have the opportunity to restore families and help people find redemption instead of condemnation.""Together, we are calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford this issue the national attention it deserves," they added.Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:Congress Must Act to Fix Our Broken Criminal Justice SystemThe Hill By: Reps. Mark Walker and Cedric Richmond April 13, 2018Our criminal justice system is crumbling. Over the last 40 years, our domestic incarceration rate has quadrupled, creating a crisis of more than 2 million people behind bars in the United States today. Simultaneously, recidivism rates have grown or remained high across almost every identifiable demographic or cross section. And yet, crime rates have steadily fallen. This paradox exposes a simple fact: our criminal justice system is in desperate need of reform. What’s more, almost everyone in Congress knows it. Passing significant reforms to our criminal justice system could bring relief to families and communities in every state, district and territory. Over the past few weeks, at our respective retreats, members of Congress from both parties discussed our priorities. We believe criminal justice reform needs to be on the top of that list. Since arriving in Congress, we have seen increasing awareness, education, energy and interest in criminal justice reform, but, to date, we have not been able to enact necessary changes. Senators have formed working groups. The House Judiciary Committee passed strong, bipartisan legislation out of committee last year. But no tangible results. That has to change. Together, we are calling on congressional leadership – of both parties – to dedicate the resources and afford this issue the national attention it deserves. As Dr. King taught us, the time is always right to do what is right. While there will undoubtedly be policy disagreements and grandstanding from those vested in the status quo or more interested in their immediate political future than the welfare of their constituents, the reality is inescapable. Incarceration statistics paint a grim picture of the nightmare millions face: 2.7 million children under the age of 18 have an incarcerated parent; there are more jails than colleges in the United States; non-violent drug offenses account for almost half of the total population in federal prisons; and taxpayers spend more than $70 billion each year to incarcerate 1 in 100 American adults. Even worse, these wasted dollars make us all less safe. We have the opportunity to restore families and help people find redemption instead of condemnation. Like a house in decay from decades of neglect, our criminal justice system requires repair. We have tried small fixes, but our piecemeal approach has not been enough. While legislation will not solve all these problems, it could make a meaningful dent. Passing criminal justice reform legislation stands to make an immediate impact on millions of Americans – restoring families, rebuilding lives and revitalizing communities. Our conversations about criminal justice reform should reach beyond crime and punishment. We have to focus on restoration and rehabilitation. We have to rebuild the relationships between police and the communities they serve. Children should not bear the consequences of the actions of their mothers and fathers, nor should we leave them trapped in a cycle of crime and poverty. Moreover, crime should have a cost, but, once paid, society should help lay a path to success for those who have paid their debt. We have seen the rising opioid epidemic correctly identified as a public health crisis. Congress has the opportunity to respond differently now than it did to the crack epidemic that wrecked black communities in the ’80s and made our criminal justice system what it is today. Congress has a responsibility to take action when we see a threat to any of our communities. Our current criminal justice system is a threat to all communities because it shackles people to a life of struggle while making us all less safe. We must take a holistic approach to reform. From prevention to rehabilitation, Congress has the unique opportunity to address each aspect of our broken system. Teaching marketable job skills, treating mental health needs and substance abuse, providing educational opportunities, building social and team skills, and strengthening our halfway houses are all demonstrable ways of reducing recidivism and personal patterns of crime. Something as simple as helping inmates get a government ID card prior to release can have a positive impact on a person’s post-incarceration potential. There is a broad coalition, both on and off the Hill, supporting bipartisan action. Congress should act and we are ready to help lead the way. This is the right time to move the discussion on criminal justice reform forward and rebuild our broken system.Richmond represents the 2nd District of Louisiana, which includes parts of New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

04.13.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after it was announced by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer that the government of Argentina has finalized technical requirements to allow the export of U.S. pork to Argentina for the first time since 1992:"Helping our North Carolina farmers through trade means removing barriers, opening new markets and ensuring a level playing field. When we get government restrictions and bad policies out of the way, our premier North Carolina products can shine and our people can thrive. I applaud President Trump and the administration for working to open the Argentinian market to our pork producers."According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), "since the White House announced an agreement with Argentina last August, technical staff from the USDA and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) have been working with Argentina’s Ministry of Agro-Industry on new terms for market access that are practical, science-based and consistent with relevant international animal health standards. The finalization of these technical requirements means that U.S. exports of pork and natural swine casings can now resume."The U.S. exports nearly $6 billion worth of pork each year. North Carolina accounts for roughly 10 percent of America's pork exports and the pork industry employs more than 46,000 North Carolinians. Argentina represents a potential $10 million a year market for U.S. pork producers.
04.12.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after H.J.Res. 2, a Balanced Budget Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, failed to receive the two-thirds majority needed for passage on the U.S. House of Representatives floor in a 233-184 vote:“Part of the reason I ran for Congress was frustration with Washington’s inability to spend within its means and show fiscal leadership. That is why I made a pledge to the people of North Carolina to push for a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. Last year, I secured this important vote and kept my promise, before knowing that this Congress would go on to inscribe reckless trillion dollar deficits into law with rushed spending bills. That vote - along with the unfortunate outcome today - highlights Washington’s lack of willpower and courage to focus on future generations, rather than future ballots. I will remain committed to ensuring that the federal government lives within its means, just like every family in North Carolina." "The bill was brought to the floor under an agreement made between Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) in October," The Hill reported.Since then, Walker has been sounding the alarm on our nation's fiscal crisis and has been a leading voice for fiscal conservatism in Washington. "Fueled by Washington’s inability or indisposition to be fiscally responsible, our debt has mounted to dangerous levels, not because of a lack of tax revenue, but a lack of political willpower to contain the rapid growth of government," Walker wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Times last month. "It’s time to live within our means as a government — just like the families and individuals we were sent here to represent. As a collective goal for this legislative year, we want to ensure that an effective and enforceable Balanced Budget Amendment passes the House of Representatives."Walker has also penned articles on how a Balanced Budget Amendment is only one step to reining in federal spending, and he has been a vocal critic of the recently passed Consolidated Appropriations Act, also known as an "omnibus," which had a $1.3 trillion price tag. U.S. Representatives were only given roughly 17 hours to review the 2,232-page bill. In June of 2014, after winning the Republican primary for North Carolina's sixth congressional district, Walker signed a pledge to the people of North Carolina saying he would support a Balanced Budget Amendment to rein in the national debt.
04.12.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The McClatchy D.C. Bureau highlighted U.S. Representative Mark Walker's (R-N.C.) efforts to increase diversity and engagement on Capitol Hill through Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). As the article states: "[Vashti] Hinton, a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University graduate, recently landed a job in the office of Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the first full time hire from a unique three-year-old internship program created by Reps. Alma Adams, D-N.C., and Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., to help improve Congress’ poor showing when it comes to staff diversity." The article goes on to explain: "The internship helped Hinton escape a cycle that keeps many minority applicants from getting full time congressional staffing positions. Most offices require applicants to have prior experience through internships. "Many African American miss the internship experience because the positions rarely pay enough to allow them to save money and spend a summer in Washington. The Adams-Walker program does."Founded by Walker and U.S. Representative Alma Adams (D-N.C.), the HBCU Bi-Partisan Congressional Internship program is the first of its kind, featuring two interns, who spend a four-week period in the office of both a Republican (Walker) and a Democrat (Adams). The interns in the program also have the opportunity to meet with key players on Capitol Hill, including Members of Congress and senior staff. Read the article in its entirety here and below:One Small Step for Racial Diversity on Capitol HillMcClatchy D.C. Bureau By: William Douglas April 10, 2018Vashti Hinton is working in a place that some folks said would never hire her: Capitol Hill. “I had many people telling me that I wouldn’t be able to ever get a job here and it would be impossible because I wanted to wear my hair natural, I went to an HBCU, and I am a black woman.” Hinton, a North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University graduate, recently landed a job in the office of Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., the first full time hire from a unique three-year-old internship program created by Reps. Alma Adams, D-N.C., and Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., to help improve Congress’ poor showing when it comes to staff diversity. A 2015 study by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit think tank that focuses on minority issues, found that African Americans make up less than one percent of top Senate staff despite minorities representing 13 percent of the U.S. population. Since the Joint Center study’s release, the number of African American senior Senate staffers has grown from three to seven. The Adams-Walker program gives students from North Carolina’s historically black colleges and universities exposure to both political parties by having them split time working for Adams, a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, and Walker, chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. A lack of diversity among congressional officers is a problem, Adams and Walker say, because staffers — especially at the senior level — influence senators and House members and play pivotal roles in crafting legislation. “You may not understand my community if you don’t live there or you don’t interact there,” Adams said. “The people who go through our program, they are able to teach us a few things, to share information about their schools, about their communities and about the needs.” Diversity's progress in Congress remains slow. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., whose special election victory in December in a deep red Southern state was powered by black votes, hired the Senate’s only African American Democratic chief of staff, Dana Gresham. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., the Senate’s only African American Republican, also has a black chief of staff, Jennifer DeCasper. Brennen Britton, who is black, is Sen. Jerry Moran’s chief of staff. Courtney Temple, an African American woman, is legislative director for Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C. Darrell Jordan is communications director for Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. House Democrats and Republicans provided no data on minority hiring in their congressional offices. House Democrats are conducting a survey on minority hiring as part of a diversity initiative launched by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In December 2016, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., hired Capitol Hill veteran Jonathan Burks as his chief of staff, making him the first African American to hold the position. Burks hiring came nearly five months after Ryan posted a selfie with a room full of white Capitol Hill interns behind him. That photo, along with a picture earlier this month a mostly-white class of spring 2018 White House interns, crystallizes the diversity issue in Washington, according to Don Bell, director of the Joint Center’s Black Talent Initiative. “It speaks to the institutional problem that exists that senior staffers and elected officials themselves who are in charge of hiring and have the opportunity to create opportunities are not being thoughtful enough about how to make sure that they are recruiting qualified people of color from every walk of life,” said Bell, a former president of the Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus. Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., separately launched Democratic initiatives in the House and the Senate to boost diversity. But Congress isn’t subject to some of anti-discrimination and labor laws it has imposed upon the private sector, and there’s little urgency on Capitol Hill for that to change. “Part of that is just the fundamental structure on Capitol Hill — every office is essentially its own business,” Bell said. “When you don’t have centralized policies, practices or procedures then you end up with a situation where some offices are much more diverse than others, and many just aren’t because they haven’t been thinking about diversity and inclusion.” Meeks, a black caucus member, said Congress should “practice what it preaches” about diversity. He hired Hinton, 23, to be a legislative correspondent and staff assistant after learning about the Adams-Walker internship program. “The program was important because it had individuals from HBCUs and it opened doors to Democrats and Republicans, which meant, for me, that there was a likelihood that they would have a well-rounded exposure to how this place works on both sides of the aisle,” Meeks said. “That was important because the position we hired her in, she is really the person who comes into contact first with many of the constituents and others who walk into my office.” The internship helped Hinton escape a cycle that keeps many minority applicants from getting full time congressional staffing positions. Most offices require applicants to have prior experience through internships. Many African American miss the internship experience because the positions rarely pay enough to allow them to save money and spend a summer in Washington. The Adams-Walker program does. “The internship showed me that anything was possible…,” said Hinton, who earned her bachelor’s degree in political science from NC A&T last May. “Since most offices require you have some sort of internship experience, the internship provided me a foot in the door.” Now that she’s on Capitol Hill, Hinton wants to stay and move up. “I found that there is diversity on the Hill, especially in Democratic offices and the network of minority staffers has certainly helped me along the way,” she said. “Still, when it comes to diversity, Congress, like the rest of America has work to do.”
04.11.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) at the Department of Education released the results of the 2017 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the "Nation's Report Card":"The release of the 2017 ‘Nation’s Report Card’ shows the stark reality that we are failing to prepare our children to live prosperous lives and ultimately pushing the American Dream out of reach. This report is not an indictment on the teachers and administrators who work passionately to serve our students, but ultimately highlights the failures of a system of bureaucratic mandates and one-size-fits-all policies that prioritize meeting arbitrary standards rather than what is best for each student. "That is why I introduced the A-PLUS Act to empower parents, teachers and local administrators to better address the needs of students and schools in their communities. With government’s education approach for the last five decades falling well below even the most reasonable expectations, it’s time to choose a better path." According to the NCES, the NAEP is "the largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subject areas."From the last NAEP assessment in 2015, scores largely remained stagnant or declined with: Only 37 percent of 4th graders and 36 percent of 8th graders scoring proficient or above in reading. Only 40 percent of 4th graders and 34 percent of 8th graders scoring proficient or above in math. "The 2015 National Assessment of Education Progress represented the first time math and reading scores had declined or remained stagnant since the test was first administered in 1990," wrote Lindsey Burke, Will Skillman fellow in education policy at The Heritage Foundation. "Further declines and an overall stagnation in 2017 suggest a trend—namely, scores are going in the wrong direction." "Historically, federal education spending has been appropriated to close gaps, yet this spending — more than $2 trillion in inflation-adjusted spending at the federal level alone since 1965 — has utterly failed to achieve that goal," Burke added. "Increasing federal intervention over the past half-century, and the resulting burden of complying with federal programs, rules, and regulations, have created a parasitic relationship with federal education programs and states, and is straining the time and resources of local schools." To address these issues and inject flexibility into the federal education model, Walker introduced H.R. 719, the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act (A-PLUS) Act. The A-PLUS Act would empower parents, teachers and local administrators to better address the needs of students and schools in their communities. The community-focused approach of the A-PLUS Act prioritizes restoring state and local control of education by giving them the option to decline participation in the prescriptive and onerous requirements of federal education programs and focus that funding on solutions that meet the needs of their students and their neighborhoods. This legislation will help lessen the compliance burdens at schools, allowing them to focus on reducing administrative staff, hiring more teachers and focus on educating our next generation of leaders. Instead of teachers following strict guidelines and being forced to educate every student the same way, they will be free to be creative in addressing the unique talents and abilities of each child. All while keeping every dollar of their federal funding.The NAEP assessment is clear. Our education system is failing our students. Walker's A-PLUS Act can help flip the current top-down model and give students better access to a quality education.
04.11.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) announced he will not seek re-election: “The tides of Washington come and go, but family is forever. It is with this in mind that Speaker Ryan has decided to not seek re-election and invest the same time and energy he put into representing Wisconsin into his family. Paul’s character and integrity is respected among all members. With that said, he is still Speaker through January and we have plenty of work to do. As we look to the future we must also be diligent with the present working on the impending concerns of reining in Washington’s spending, balancing our budgets, providing second chances through criminal justice reform, and working to restore the hope and opportunity of the American Dream.”
04.05.2018	BURLINGTON, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored Alex Pardue, a junior at Walter Williams High School in Burlington, as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for April 2018. The presentation was held at the Alamance County YMCA in Burlington with Burlington Mayor Ian Baltutis and Alamance County YMCA CEO Walter Britt in attendance.Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. As a volunteer with the Alamance County YMCA, Pardue saw the YMCA as a popular spot for students after school. He also witnessed the food insecurity many students faced outside of school. Pardue collaborated with both ABSS and the YMCA to build a shelter at the Alamance County YMCA where meals could be provided to students through ABSS. Pardue helped raise $90,000 in donations to build the shelter. “Alex saw a need in our community and instead of convincing himself of why it couldn’t be done, he sprung to action, collaborating with others to find a solution that will result in 100,000 meals being provided to hungry students each year,” Walker said. “Heroism isn’t about age, it’s about a heart of service and a willingness to put yourself before others. Alex embodies this spirit and the idea that age and capacity do not exempt anyone from the call to make a difference.” “The YMCA is committed to strengthening our community through collaborations and partnerships, providing resources needed to achieve greater health and well-being for all,” Britt said. “Feeding hungry children is a great opportunity to assist in the strengthening of Alamance County. Alex’s commitment to this project has been integral in our cause and we are truly blessed by all of his efforts to serve others.” Congratulations @ABSSWeb Williams HS Junior Alex Pardue, awarded the #CommunityHero Award for the month of April by @RepMarkWalker. Alex is the first minor to receive the award #Burlington @WFMY pic.twitter.com/vcMdzpchGc — Laura Brache WFMY (@laura_brache) April 5, 2018 Pardue also spends time serving his community in other ways. He is the Junior Class President at Walter Williams High School, plays on the golf team, serves on the Superintendent’s Student Advisory Board, was recently elected Central District Chair for the NC Association of Student Councils, and has earned the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America. He lives in Burlington with his parents, Joe and Margaret Pardue, as well as his sister, Amelia. Pardue was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
03.27.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday introduced H.R. 5415, the Good Accounting Obligation in Government (GAO-IG) Act. This legislation would save taxpayer money and bring needed accountability to federal agencies by requiring them to report on the status of Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Office of Inspector General (IG) recommendations in their annual budget justification. The GAO-IG Act is a House companion bill to S.2276, introduced by U.S. Senator Todd Young (R-Ind.) and U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).These changes represent potential savings of at least $87 billion for taxpayers as agencies will be forced to improve based on IG and GAO recommendations or will be required to provide justification for not implementing the recommendations. As of 2016, there were more than 15,000 open and unimplemented federal agency recommendations from the IG and more than 8,000 open GAO federal agency recommendations.“Right now, North Carolina taxpayers are having their hard-earned money wasted by federal bureaucrats who have been told how to improve and become more efficient, but refuse to follow recommendations,” Walker said. “That is unacceptable. This bipartisan legislation will make government better, more accountable, and save taxpayer dollars.”“This bipartisan bill will help make our federal government more accountable and save taxpayer dollars - two things Hoosiers want,” said Senator Young. “Ensuring Congress has the information necessary to conduct effective oversight will lead to increased transparency for federal agencies and better service to taxpayers.” “I’m glad to partner with Senator Young on a bill that gives Congress a powerful tool to hold agencies accountable and make sure they are working on behalf of American families,” said Senator Warren. “This bipartisan bill will make our government more transparent and effective – and save taxpayers real money.”Read the full text of the GAO-IG Act here.
03.26.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) recently honored Greensboro’s Portia Shipman as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for March 2018. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.A video of the ceremony, which took place at the soon-to-open Purple Door House in Greensboro can be viewed here: Portia Shipman is the Founder and Executive Director of the Sherri Denese Jackson Foundation for the Prevention of Domestic Violence, Inc. After losing the life of her dear friend Sherri in 2006, Ms. Shipman created the organization on June 26, 2008 to help victims of domestic violence reclaim their lives by breaking free from domestic abuse and educating the community in hopes to save lives. Since then, the Sherri Denese Jackson Foundation has expanded its vision and goals. They have had hundreds of people participate in their programs and have reached thousands through public awareness campaigns, as well as through their website. For 9 years she has dedicated herself to saving the lives of women, one life at a time. Shipman also opened her home to a family seeking refuge from Hurricane Irma last year. “Facing hardship and the loss of a friend, Portia decided to make a difference and has since reached thousands,” Walker said. “Having spent years in ministry and offering counseling to survivors, I know how critical education and prevention of domestic abuse is. By letting women know they have options to break free of abuse and that a safe place can be found through her program, Portia is saving lives in our community.”Walker presented Shipman with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
03.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after voting against H.R. 1625, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, also called the "omnibus," which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in a 256-167 vote: "I could not support this bill. 17 hours to read 2,232 pages with a $1.3 trillion price tag is not a path for Republican success in November. Nor for our nation. "For several years, Republicans were justifiably critical of the Obama administration’s spending levels driving up the national debt. Even worse, was the intentional bleeding of our defense creating a new national security concern. Due to the intentional weakening by the previous administration, our military readiness is grossly lacking if called on to defend our country. "Yet, at the same time, I am troubled by the increasing deficits being created by our Republican majority. It is imperative that we curb Washington’s out-of-control spending addiction that has not been slowed under Republican rule. Since the 1980’s our mandatory spending has exploded from 30% of our budget to a startling 70%. We are leaving our children and grandchildren an insurmountable financial burden that is impossible to resolve. What will it take for Republican majorities to offer the reforms needed removing the shackles of a crippling debt? "Though there are some positives in the bill, it is a far cry from keeping with our promises to the voters who sent us here to lead. We have to do better."
03.21.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after voting in favor of H.R. 5247, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2018, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in a 267-149 vote:“Each year, many North Carolinians receive the heartbreaking news that they are facing a terminal illness and may only have limited time left with their families. Intrusive regulations and teams of bureaucrats should not prevent terminally ill individuals from seeking a cure. The President called for this policy change in his State of the Union Address, and now the House is giving patients hope and the ‘right to try.’”The "Right to Try" Act creates a new alternative pathway for patients who have exhausted other options to access investigational treatments which have passed basic safety trials but not yet earned approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

03.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today spoke in support of fiscal discipline as lawmakers work on finalizing the details of a $1.3 trillion spending bill. On Washington's spending: "Washington must be more fiscally responsible. It’s not only about elections, it’s about doing what’s best for the next generation." ..."It’s time to bend this bell curve, it can’t happen overnight, I get it, but we must show some true discipline. We have to be the adults in the room. We have funding requests by the billions every single week – Republicans and Democrats – but someone has to step up. Republicans have to step up to be able to bend this back." On the progress towards an omnibus deal: "Leadership is pulling this as far to the right as possible. They did a great job. Appropriators worked all night to hold the Hyde language, to make sure those pro-life provisions are not affected. The Senate had kind of backed up on that. We appreciate those guys doing that. It’s trending the right direction, but we need more." On entitlement reform: "A third of the budget is strictly entitlements. We have to take a look at that. And we have to bring a sharp pencil. Social Security won’t even be solvent in the next decade or so if we do not handle some of these items. ..."If we don’t deal with [Social Security], it will not exist in twelve years. I am 48. By the time I am 60 it will not exist. More importantly for my children and grandchildren, if we do not have something in place, what kind of legacy is that leaving?"

03.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday addressed the House Oversight and Government Reform on his legislation, H.R. 4809, the Guidance Out Of Darkness (GOOD) Act. Following Walker's remarks, the committee approved the GOOD Act, paving the way for a vote on the House floor. This legislation would increase government accountability and transparency, while lessening the burden on small businesses by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents online in an easy to find location. The bill is a House companion to S.2296, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). Watch Walker's remarks and see a full transcript below: "To circumvent responsibility and the legal rule-making process, previous Administrations had federal agencies issue "guidance" to serve as de facto regulations. Regulatory guidance is widely used by agencies. The guidance affects industry and taxpayers alike. But the precise extent of its use is unknown. "Professor Nicholas Parrillo, who testified before the Committee yesterday, explained, 'There is no comprehensive compilation of guidance, but everyone agrees its volume is oceanic.' "While the regulations themselves are often erroneous and harmful, the guidance documents are sporadically posted on agency websites, and the websites of component agencies and various offices. Some are not posted at all. This inconsistency burdens regulated entities, and particularly small businesses, who may not have the resources to hire compliance staff to seek out this information. "H.R. 4809 requires transparency and accountability in the regulatory process. The public deserves to have this information. They deserve to know how the agencies administering our laws interpret those laws and regulations. H.R. 4809, with the amendment in the nature of a substitute, requires agencies to post their guidance documents online, in one centralized location. "Agencies create these documents and expect the guidance to be followed. The agencies should therefore have no problem gathering and posting the documents as the bill requires. In fact, we know that many agencies already have a list – because they have provided it to us. The Committee has been reviewing information about thousands of pieces of agency guidance for several months. "At the Committee’s request, federal agencies provided information on more than 12,800 guidance documents issued over the past decade. And that is just a portion of federal guidance documents. That number is expected to increase as agencies continue to identify guidance and produce information to the Committee. "There are a handful of agencies that have been unable to produce a list of guidance documents. That is a red flag and a clear indication that, at some agencies, guidance documents are not tracked. "If an agency doesn’t bother to track the hundreds of guidance documents it issues, how can businesses and taxpayers possibly be expected to comply with them? The burden should be on the agencies to make guidance documents easy to find. "That’s all this bill does—Require agencies to post information they should already have in a centralized location. This is a small step agencies can take that would have significant benefits. Posting these documents in a central location will alleviate burdens on regulated entities and members of the public. It will shine light on this lesser-understood, yet impactful, sector of federal regulatory activity. "This legislation is common-sense reform that Members of both parties can support in the name of good governance and transparency. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and the amendment in the nature of a substitute. "I yield back."
03.14.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018 in a 417-10 vote:"Education is an essential rung on the ladder for opportunity and prosperity. That’s why it is critical that our children feel safe while learning, and that our communities and law enforcement officials are empowered with resources to keep our schools secure. By passing this legislation to train and assist schools in identifying and stopping threats, we will allow teachers, administrators and parents to focus on educating our next generation of leaders."The STOP School Violence Act implements anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence in coordination with law enforcement and administers training and technical assistance for students, school personnel, and law enforcement to identify signs of violence. The legislation also facilitates coordination between schools and local law enforcement to prevent threats to school safety. You can read the full text of the legislation here. The White House released the following statement upon passage of the STOP School Violence Act: "President Donald J. Trump applauds the House for passing H.R. 4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018, an important step towards keeping American students safe. This legislation helps protect our Nation’s youth and educators by authorizing State-based grants that will support evidence-based violence prevention programs. It is critical that we strengthen our laws in order to aid our law enforcement, address the needs of individuals struggling with serious mental illness, and develop proactive strategies for identifying and preventing violence in schools. This Administration is pleased with the progress we have made toward securing our schools over the last few weeks alone, and looks forward to working with the Senate to protect America’s students."
03.06.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy called for the appointment of a Special Counsel to investigate Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) abuse at the Department of Justice:"It is evident there are abuses going on in our FISA court and the surveillance of American citizens. Chairman Gowdy and Chairman Goodlatte are right to call for a special counsel to investigate potential violations of our essential Fourth Amendment protection. Oversight and review is needed to ensure the protection of Americans’ civil liberties and to stop disregard for our Constitution."Walker serves as a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.
03.06.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced legislation to rename a United States Postal Service Office in Greensboro, N.C. as the J. Howard Coble Post Office Building. The post office to be renamed is located at 1585 Yanceyville Street.The introduction of this bill comes just before what would have been Coble's 87th birthday on March 18th. "North Carolina was blessed to have the leadership of Howard Coble in Congress for thirty years, but we were even more blessed to call him a friend and mentor," Walker said. "During his time in Washington, Congressman Coble demonstrated that tone, approach, and a heart of service still matter in our political discourse. After being a staple of our community for decades, it is fitting that we have this permanent reminder of his service."John Howard Coble was born in Greensboro, Guilford County, N.C., on March 18, 1931. After graduating from high school, he briefly attended Appalachian State University before serving 5 years in the United States Coast Guard. After leaving active duty in 1956, he continued to serve in the United States Coast Guard Reserve from 1960-1982. Coble received a degree in History from Guildford College in 1958 and a J.D from University of North Carolina School of Law, Chapel Hill in 1962. Coble worked in the insurance industry, was assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, and was secretary of the North Carolina Department of Revenue. Coble served one term in the North Carolina House of Representatives in 1969 and again from 1979-1984. In 1984, Coble was elected to represent North Carolina’s 6th District in the U.S. House of Representatives. He would end up serving for 15 terms and 30 years, the longest period ever served by a North Carolina Republican. Coble served on the Judiciary Committee and chaired the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. During the advent of the internet in the 1990’s he worked to strengthen copyright and patent laws. In retirement, he refused to take his congressional pension – Coble believed in being fiscally responsible and thought his salary was sufficient enough compensation. Known for his kind and affable demeanor, Coble was respected by colleagues on both sides of the aisle. More importantly, he was beloved by the people of North Carolina’s 6th congressional district. Coble never forgot about the people he was serving back home – he participated in over 200 local Christmas parades and another 200 Eagle Scout ceremonies. Coble had a keen memory for names and faces and knew the high school mascots for schools from all over North Carolina. In 2013, citing his declining health, Coble announced he would not seek re-election to a 16th term. In January 2015, Coble concluded his 30 years of service in United States House of Representatives. In November 2015, Coble passed away from health issues related to his age, leaving behind a lifelong legacy of friendship, patriotism, and commitment to conservative principles. In November 2014, Walker was elected to replace Coble in representing North Carolina's 6th congressional district. Walker has noted, "when I landed in Washington for the first time in January, there’s no doubt that I had huge shoes to fill. During times back in the district, I would occasionally meet with Coble to receive his feedback. He would share many great stories and some of his favorite jokes."U.S. Representatives G.K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), George Holding (R-N.C.), Walter Jones (R-N.C.), David Price (D-N.C.), Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), and Ted Budd (R-N.C.) are orignial co-sponsors of the legislation.This legislation now heads the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, where Walker is a committee member.

02.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) on Tuesday hosted the "Second Annual HBCU Fly-in" to provide HBCU leaders, job creators, and policymakers with the opportunity to discuss innovative avenues for promoting educational achievement, bolstering cross-sector partnerships, and meeting the ever-shifting demands of the American workforce. The discussions included a bipartisan group of lawmakers, 70 Presidents and Chancellors of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and private sector leaders from Walmart, John Deere, Bank of America, Starbucks, McDonald's, Google, and Koch Industries. The daylong conference also featured a keynote address from Benjamin Watson, NFL player for the Baltimore Ravens and recent Bart Starr award winner."At a time when our nation has record high small business confidence and rising rates of young entrepreneurship, it is essential that we engage in a dynamic dialogue about how to prepare our next generation of leaders for the new American economy," Walker said. "By building bridges across communities and business sectors, and by forging relationships between private and public organizations, I believe we can work together for the betterment of our students. The 2018 HBCU Fly-In served as the nucleus for these and other important conversations. Senator Scott and I were humbled and excited at the participation and engagement."As reported by Inside Higher Ed:"HBCU leaders this week got a chance to reacquaint members of Congress and administration officials with their priorities at the Hill event organized by Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican, and Representative Mark Walker, a North Carolina Republican." ... "But Republican lawmakers and HBCU leaders argue year-round Pell Grants wouldn’t have been restored by Congress last year without those meetings. And Harry L. Williams, president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund, cites the relationships historically black colleges are building in Washington as much as any concrete policy developments." ... "At the event, Walker cited personal reasons for caring about the success of black colleges -- his wife attended one. His district also includes North Carolina A&T University, the nation's largest HBCU. Scott said he began organizing the meetings last year to address untapped potential in minority communities. Working with Republicans in Congress is also less toxic for college presidents than working with this White House. "The payoffs of working with Republicans at the federal level already are apparent, Williams said. Chief among those is restoration of year-round Pell, the top priority pushed by college presidents at last year’s event. "That was also a policy goal shared by a wide range of higher ed advocacy groups, particularly those that represent two-year colleges. But Williams said the change wouldn’t have come about were it not for relationships cultivated with Republicans like Walker and Scott." Watch reaction to the HBCU Fly-In from Phyllis Worthy Dawkins, President of Bennett College in Greensboro North Carolina and Lodriguez Murray, Vice President, Public Policy and Government Affairs for United Negro College Fund (UNCF): ABC News reported, "the HBCU Fly-In started last year as a way for the colleges and universities to meet GOP officials and find ways to work with the federal government. Instead of focusing solely on education policy and funding, GOP Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina said the HBCU presidents asked for connections to companies that would be willing to partner with the schools and employ their graduates."A full schedule of the conference can be found here and photos from the event can be found below: Keynote speaker and Baltimore Raven Tight End Benjamin Watson participates in the 2018 HBCU Fly-In.

02.27.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the passage of H.R.1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 (FOSTA):"Though I am proud of the success we have had in combatting human trafficking, we must do more to ensure that this moral injustice ends and that perpetrators see prosecution. For too long, sites like Backpage.com have facilitated the exploitation of young women and children for their own financial profit, and have done so using a loophole in a bill passed in 1934. This legislation will bring justice and accountability and promote our principle that all life is invaluable and worth protecting."RELATED: Walker's Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 Becomes LawThe Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 would: Amend Section 230 to allow State authorities to investigate and prosecute websites that facilitate sex trafficking using State criminal statutes that prohibit sex trafficking or sexual exploitation of children. Amend Section 230 to allow victims of sex trafficking and sexual exploitation of children to exercise civil remedies, such as the private right of action available to sex trafficking victims in the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. Amend 18 U.S.C. § 1591, the sex trafficking statute, to define “participation in a venture” in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit’s 2016 decision in Jane Doe vs. Backpage.com, LLC. Amend 18 U.S.C. § 1591 to clarify that it is unlawful for a provider of an interactive computer service to publish information provided by an information content provider, with reckless disregard that the information is in furtherance of a sex trafficking offense. The legislation can be read in full here.According to the office of U.S. Representative Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), "section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA) of 1996 has been wrongly interpreted to shield websites that participate in sex trafficking from any criminal liability. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has said that it is Congress’ role to clarify the intersection between Section 230 and sex trafficking laws. This legislation would provide that urgently needed clarification while safeguarding the freedom of the Internet." "As the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found in Backpage.com, LLC, vs. Loretta Lynch in 2016, “there is no doubt” that online advertisements that promote sex trafficking are “not afforded First Amendment protection.” This legislation would make clear that Congress never intended Section 230 to create a lawless internet where bad actors can engage in criminal activity online that they cannot engage in offline. This is already obvious to our State authorities: In 2013, 47 State Attorneys General called on Congress to amend the CDA to restore jurisdiction to State authorities who are tasked with protecting America’s children." The Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017 holds support from each of the following organizations: National District Attorneys Association; National Association of Police Organizations; Major Cities Chiefs Association; Fraternal Order of Police; National Organization for Victim Assistance; National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives (NAWLEE); WIFLE Foundation Inc.

02.23.2018	(Pictured above: Rosa Parks lies in honor in the United States Capitol Rotunda on October 1, 2005. Rev. Billy Graham will be only the fourth person to lie in honor on February 28, 2018) WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today presented a resolution by U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to authorize the remains of Rev. Billy Graham to "lie in honor" in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. The resolution was agreed to without objection during a pro forma session of the U.S. House and now heads to the U.S. Senate for consideration. A video of the process can be viewed here: Graham’s remains will be brought to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, February 28, where he will lie in honor in the Rotunda until Thursday, March 1. Members of the public are encouraged to pay their respects to Graham as he lies in honor.“Reverend Billy Graham was the premier example of how faith, hope and love can transcend political parties, backgrounds, cultures and affiliations,” Walker said. “Despite holding favor and serving as a spiritual advisor to presidents, kings and queens – and having a world renowned impact and legacy – Graham always remained grounded in humility. Even as he preached to stadiums filled with tens of thousands, you knew that Rev. Graham cared about you as an individual, your life and your future. Earning the titles ‘America’s Pastor’ and ‘North Carolina’s favorite son,’ a small-town pastor from North Carolina, who grew up on a dairy farm, preached the love and name of Jesus Christ. Never wavering, he changed the world – bringing thousands of lives to salvation and eternal life. For me, Rev. Graham will always be remembered for his focus on redemption and the idea that there is limitless hope, opportunity and freedom for every human life.”Though comments during the procedure are limited, Congressman Walker submitted comments for the Congressional Record. The comments can be viewed here.Congressional leaders can authorize distinguished Americans who have died to "lie in state" or "lie in honor" at the U.S. Capitol as an act of tribute. Traditionally, those that have lied in state are military officers or elected public officials. Eleven U.S. Presidents have lied in state. The most recent lie in state ceremony was in honor of Senator Daniel Ken Inouye (D-Hawaii) on December 20, 2012.Lying in honor is traditionally reserved for private citizens and has only been authorized for three individuals – Capitol Police officers Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Michael Gibson who were killed in the line of duty (lay in honor date: July 28, 1998) and civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks (lay in honor date: October 30-31, 2005).Graham will be only the fourth person to lie in honor at the U.S. Capitol. All North Carolinians who plan to visit Washington for the lay in honor ceremony are encouraged to reach out to Walker's office. The office is available to answer questions and assist North Carolinians with travel plans and arrangements. The office can be reached here.Graham was born on November 7, 1918 in Charlotte, N.C. and died on February 21, 2018. The Baptist Reverend grew up on a dairy farm near Charlotte and graduated from Florida Bible Institute (now Trinity College) in 1940 and Wheaton College in 1943. He served as an advisor to numerous leaders including twelve consecutive U.S. Presidents from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. In his 99-year life, he preached to more than 215 million people in over 185 countries. "Graham’s uncanny ability to address the hurts and aspirations of daily life may rank as his most enduring legacy," Grant Wacker, a Duke University professor emeritus of Christian history wrote in his 2014 book, America’s Pastor: Billy Graham and the Shaping of a Nation. "Nothing was more American than believing that things old and broken could become new and whole.”As a preview of the ceremony next week, please see the below photo from the lie in state ceremony for President Gerald Ford on December 20, 2006:

Poe and Buddy, Melissa Wright and Lexi, Eileen Shannon and Molly, Linda Martin and Jill, and Koda and Robin Williams.) GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) this week honored Lee County’s J.R. Poe and his therapy dog Buddy of NC Pet Partners as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for February 2018. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. A highlight video of the ceremony, which took place at Walker's Greensboro office can be viewed here: For more than 20 years Poe has been taking therapy dogs into nursing homes, hospitals, cancer centers, Veterans Affairs Medical Centers, churches, and prisons across North Carolina. He and Buddy have been a team since 2011, when Poe drove to Savannah, Ga. to meet the former show dog for the first time. From 1969 to 1971, Poe served as a medical corpsman during the Vietnam War, where he was awarded the Purple Heart. Following his service, he struggled with alcoholism and was briefly incarcerated. Poe has now been sober for almost 25 years and has dedicated his life to bringing joy and healing to others in need. He and Buddy, volunteering through NC Pet Partners, offer therapy to patients, prisoners, and residents, seeking to "improve the physical, emotional, and psychological lives" of those they serve. Poe and Buddy go everywhere together. In 2017, they visited 3,900 adults and 1,400 children, over more than 800 hours and driving 16,900 miles. "The rewards are so great when you lay down at night, to get ready to go to sleep," Poe said. "What have I done today to help somebody? What life have we touched? That's where the rewards are. It ain't the big things you do in life, it's the little gifts in life." "In service to our country, in perseverance, and in service to our community, J.R. Poe has shown what it truly means to be a hero," Walker said. "Every day he wakes up and immediately looks for ways to serve others, traveling all across the state to bring warmth, love, and hope to someone the moment they need it the most. J.R. and Buddy, working through NC Pet Partners are improving the lives of thousands of North Carolinians and we are extremely grateful for his efforts." Walker presented Poe with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. Buddy received a special leash from the U.S. Capitol in honor of his service.

02.14.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after U.S. Representative Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) announced a House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform investigation into the employment of White House staffer Rob Porter:“Any man who abuses a woman or exhibits abusive behavior should not be in public service. Having spent years in ministry and offering counseling to survivors, such abuse must be confronted – not protected by friends or people in power. I am proud of my good friend Trey Gowdy as he leads the effort to get answers.”
02.13.2018	(Pictured above, left to right: Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Walker, Watts, Lankford, Cole James) WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today, in honor of Black History Month, joined U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Heritage Foundation President Kay Cole James in co-hosting an event that honors former U.S. Representative J.C. Watts (R-Okla.) and Ambassador Sam Brownback for their role in the creation of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The program was sponsored by Insight America and included a tour and remarks from Vice President Mike Pence in the Oprah Winfrey Theater inside the museum. In 2003, Watts and Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) introduced the National Museum of African American History and Culture Act, a bill to establish the Museum within the Smithsonian Institution. Former Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Max Cleland (D-GA) authored the bill in the Senate. It passed Congress and was signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 16, 2003. Watts retired from Congress in 2002, while Brownback went on to be Governor of Kansas, and was recently confirmed as the State Department Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Freedom. The mission of the National Museum of African American History and Culture is to educate the public about American history through the African American lens and to educate the public about African-American history and culture. Since its opening in September 2016, millions have already visited the museum from all over the world. "This museum is a powerful and moving presentation that tells the American story of struggle, perseverance, and faith," Walker said. "It does an amazing job of acknowledging the hardships as well as the many contributions African-Americans have made to our nation and vividly captures some of our most pivotal moments in a way that moves your heart in incredible ways. We are well-served by the work of former Members of Congress J.C. Watts and Sam Brownback, as well as the numerous individuals who worked hard to make this compelling testimony a reality." “The National Museum of African American History and Culture is an incredible place that tells not only the African-American story but America’s story,” said Lankford. “I’m grateful for the leadership of former Members of Congress J.C. Watts and Sam Brownback, as well as Congressman John Lewis and former Senator Max Cleland, for establishing this museum that honors the contributions of African-Americans to the development of this country. It is important to remember our history and not forget because there is always something we can learn from the past as we look towards the future." "This is African American History Month, and it is deeply humbling for me to stand before you today in the midst of this great national monument to the struggles, the sacrifices, and the triumphs of so many American heroes -– the National Museum of African American History and Culture," Pence said in his speech. You can read the full transcript of Pence's remarks here. In 2016, Walker was one of the first to tour the museum before it became open to the public in September of that year. Walker also hosted Presidents and Chancellors from 89 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) at the museum and on Capitol Hill in an event called the HBCU Fly-In in February of 2017.
02.09.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released to following statement after voting against the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018:“Fully funding our military gives our servicemen and servicewomen the tools they need as they face threats abroad. However, this budget irresponsibly and unnecessarily escalates a serious threat at home. Fiscal discipline is not a principle of convenience and responsible governing requires making the tough choices and keeping your promises. Last year, I helped craft a budget that balances, includes more than 250 responsible spending reforms and controls the size of government, providing a strong fiscal foundation for generations to come. That is why the people of North Carolina sent me to Congress, not to throw more money towards our problems at the expense of our children and grandchildren.”The budget deal will: Extend discretionary spending to March 23, 2018, at current levels. Amend the Budget Control Act of 2011 (BCA) to raise the discretionary spending limits on defense and non-defense spending by a total of $296 billion over FY2018 and FY2019. Suspend the debt limit until March 1, 2019. Provide $434 million for the Department of Defense to repair facilities and replace equipment. Increase deficits by $320 billion over ten years.
02.01.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) tomorrow will introduced the SNAP Abuse and Fraud Prevention Act of 2018. This legislation will provide an improved, nationwide system to help states identify Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients who receive assistance in two or more states - known as "dual enrollment." "To make certain SNAP is serving whom it was intended, we have to eliminate fraud and abuse and focus on what works," Walker said. "Through responsible reforms, we can ensure every individual has the opportunity to improve their economic circumstances, escape the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential."SNAP is one of the largest components of the safety net in the U.S. at almost $71 billion in benefits per year. Rolls have exploded in recent years, growing 57 percent since 2008 to more than 44 million participants in 2016, while spending on the program has increased by 89 percent. Since 2001, enrollment in SNAP has grown by 155 percent and spending has increased by 299 percent. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) found more than $2 billion in SNAP benefits were paid in error in 2009. The SNAP Abuse and Fraud Prevention Act would target wrongful payments by fixing flaws in reporting systems. Currently, the Public Assistance Reporting and Information System (PARIS) is used to detect participants who are dually enrolled. PARIS only identifies a dually enrolled individual within a 3-month period and after the assistance is disbursed. This legislation implements the National Accuracy Clearinghouse (NAC) nationwide, a program proven to reduce improper payments that occur due to dual participation in SNAP following a 2014 pilot project. NAC would result in an estimated savings of $114 million per year and ensures SNAP benefits are properly disbursed, getting to whom it was intended to serve.Read the full text of the SNAP Abuse and Fraud Prevention Act here.
01.30.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following video in reaction to the 2018 State of the Union: Read the full transcript below: “Good evening. “Tonight, you’ve heard how we are working with the new Administration to deliver on our promises and build a safe, strong and proud America. After eight years of the weakest economic growth in a century, we are now answering back with the strongest legislative record in decades. “We have record low unemployment. Companies are bringing back jobs, as well as their revenue that has been kept overseas for far too long. “The number is still growing, but already, right now, more than three million Americans have received bonuses in the wake of this new tax reform. Not to mention the 90 percent of Americans starting to see more money in their paychecks just this week. “The excitement about our economic strength is not only with Republicans. Democrats and Independents are feeling more positive about the economy than anytime in the past decade. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has paved the way for prosperity and Americans, benefitting all of our communities. “This is what happens when Washington listens to the voters and focuses on policies that help everyone, not just a select few. “In 2016, voters sent a clear message by casting three million more votes for congressional Republicans than their Democratic counterparts. While we are keeping our promises, we cannot rest on any past accomplishments. There is energy from the left to resist and then resurrect failed policies that benefit only the well-connected in Washington. “While we continue to reap the benefits of less government intrusiveness, economic growth, and the progress in protecting life of all ages, it is imperative we keep pushing forward in 2018. “I get asked a good bit about the President’s behavior. It would be hypocritical of me to act as if I approve of some of the past actions. Yet, it is also undeniable that our country is soaring back at record levels. The President is blowing gaping holes in the political establishment allowing the legislative branch to seize this opportunity and pass items promised to the American people for decades. “Just as the President mentioned tonight, we must keep rebuilding our military and reinstate a peace through strength strategy. We should responsibly invest in our broken infrastructure. And we must insist on fair trade policies that prioritize American businesses. “But most importantly, we must keep promoting policies that bring prosperity to people in all of our communities and we must keep communicating our message of why less government overreach in our lives is always better. “We should not be satisfied with simply making an argument, but always, each of us, strive to make a difference. May God bless and may we have the courage to follow.”
01.25.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after hosting a roundtable on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) with DACA recipients and community leaders:"Tackling some of the biggest issues our community and our nation face require bringing people from different backgrounds and thought together for a productive discussion. As we seek to secure our borders, solve the illegal immigration crisis and find solutions that show compassion and fairness while upholding the rule of law, we will keep listening and engaging. Ultimately, we hope to deliver on a solution that will serve American citizens, keep our nation safe, and stop the humanitarian crisis at our border."Attendees at the roundtable included local DACA recipients, pastors, community leaders, and a member of The LIBRE Initiative.The Republican Study Committee, which Walker chairs, has issued their support for H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act, calling it the "framework to strengthen border security, increase interior enforcement and resolve the DACA situation."
01.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) released the following statement after the U.S. Senate passed the cloture vote, 81-18, on a three-week Continuing Resolution (CR) funding bill:“Today, my Democratic colleagues finally agreed to stop the political gamesmanship with our national security and reopen the government, accepting the same deal they were given Friday. It’s disappointing that thousands of families in North Carolina had to face uncertainty because of reckless tactics from Senator Schumer that yielded zero results. Moving forward, Congress needs to pass appropriations on time – as the House did this year – and we need to make sure we prioritize the needs of American families first." Following final passage of the bill in the Senate, the House will vote on the legislation and pending House passage the President will sign it into law to end the government shutdown.
01.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today sent a letter to Philip G. Kiko, the Chief Administrative Officer of the U.S. House of Representatives, refusing his salary for the duration of the government shutdown. “As long as 100,000 active-duty servicemen and servicewomen based in North Carolina are defending our freedom with no pay, the very least I can do is lead by example," Walker said. "Today, I wrote a letter to the Chief Administrative Officer of the House refusing my salary as well. Our heroes deserve better than this.” Read the full letter below. Dear Mr. Kiko, I have been informed that despite a lapse of appropriations and current government shutdown, Members of Congress will continue receiving their salary. Please withhold my pay until an appropriations agreement has taken effect. Sincerely, Mark Walker Member of Congress
01.19.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after House passage of H.R. 4712, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: “Today’s vote reaffirms the intrinsic value of all life. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is a common-sense bill that recognizes that all children born alive should be provided the same protections, regardless of circumstances of their birth. This bill makes it clear that the killing of a child who has been born alive is a clear act of murder.” Earlier today, Congressman Walker offered a greeting the 45th Annual March for Life: “The March for Life is a bittersweet event. On one hand, it commemorates a great atrocity on America’s conscience: abortion. On other hand, it is uplifting to see so many young people come out year after year in the bitter cold to fight for the rights of unborn children. On this 45th anniversary of the March for Life, the pro-life community should also be praised for their work the other 364 days of the year in helping all mothers and children.”
01.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today joined members of the Committee on House Administration in introducing H.R. 4822, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act (CAA Reform Act). This bipartisan legislation will increase accountability and transparency in the process for reporting sexual harassment and abuse in Congress. It will also hold members of Congress personally responsible for their actions, requiring the Office of Compliance (OOC) to report and publish online every six months information on awards and settlements, and forcing awards or settlements to be repaid by the member to United States Treasury account within 90 days.“Serving in Congress should be about public service, and that means holding yourself to a higher standard," Walker said. "No more hiding indiscretions or paying settlements with taxpayer dollars. With this bill, members of Congress will be held to account for their misbehavior, just as the people they represent.”This legislation is sponsored by Committee on House Administration Chairman Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), and is co-sponsored by Committee Ranking Member Robert Brady (D-Pa.), and the Members of the Committee on House Administration, Representatives Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), Adrian Smith (R-Neb.), Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), and Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Additionally, the bill is cosponsored by Representatives Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), Jackie Speier (D-Calif.), and Committee on Ethics Chairwoman Susan Brooks (R-Ind.) and Ranking Member Ted Deutch (D-Fla.). Walker is also a co-sponsor of Representative Ron DeSantis' (R-Fla.) Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act.The CAA Reform Act was written following multiple Committee on House Administration hearings on the matter.

01.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the passage of H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018 in a 402-0 vote:“After we delivered on our promise to cut taxes on hardworking families and businesses, we have seen a wave of wage increases, bonuses, and increased investment, along with record-breaking levels of economic growth. That is the power of the government ending harmful tax policies and promoting efforts that reward hard work and personal freedom. Today, we continued that progress by passing the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act, legislation that will help manufacturers in North Carolina continue to grow, hire, and invest in our state.”To learn more about this legislation, please read the information below or here in a release from January 15th. This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States. Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018. “[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)SEE RELATED: Local Business Praises Walker for His Work on the Passage of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act To learn more about the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, watch the video below which features Vern Hawkins, President of Crop Protection at Syngenta in Greensboro, N.C., explaining the economic impact these tariffs have on their business and the North Carolina economy. Looking at the MTB petitions that make up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, one thing is clear, North Carolina is a big winner. The legislations consists of 1,686 petitions – American manufacturers who need to purchase materials for production that are not available in the United States. Of those 333 petitions, 19.75%, are manufacturers in North Carolina, more than any other state. That represents a savings of $71 million in 2018, also the most in the nation. Examples of manufacturers in North Carolina’s 6th congressional district who will be impacted by this legislation are: Syngenta of Greensboro, N.C. | 47 petitions representing $13.7 million Glen Raven Inc. of Glen Raven, N.C. | 9 petitions representing $6.4 million Revlon Inc. of Oxford, N.C. | 4 petitions representing $1.9 million BGF Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C. | 2 petitions representing $445,900 These needless taxes, which do nothing to support the production of American products, drive up production costs and ultimately the final costs of the product being manufactured. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities. Manufacturing represents more than one-fifth of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of the state’s workforce.
01.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced the Guidance Out Of Darkness (GOOD) Act. This legislation would increase government accountability and transparency, while lessening the burden on small businesses by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents online in an easy to find location. The bill is a House companion to S.2296, introduced by U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). To circumvent responsibility and the legal rule-making process, the previous Administration had federal agencies issue "guidance" to serve as de facto regulations. "The Obama Administration made an art of evading public scrutiny by replacing formal rule-making with a stream of 'guidance,' 'bulletins' and 'statements of policy,'" The Wall Street Journal wrote. While the regulations themselves were often erroneous and harmful to businesses, they also created undue burden in compliance as the guidance took on many different forms – blog posts, memos, letters, and news releases. The GOOD Act would bring clarity to the process by forcing all federal agencies to publish guidance documents on their website."Our out-of-control regulatory system represents roughly $2 trillion in cost on the economy and American small businesses every single year," Walker said. "Worse yet, federal agencies are going around the rule-process to avoid accountability and oversight. If agencies expect the small businesses of North Carolina to comply with their burdensome rules, they should at a minimum make the information available and easily accessible."“In addition to facing onerous federal regulations, American businesses are also expected to follow regulatory guidance issued by agencies," Johnson said. "Yet, unlike the public rule-making process for regulations, federal agencies are not required to disseminate guidance broadly to the public for input, making it hard for businesses and industry groups to monitor and follow. This bill will lift the veil of secrecy by requiring federal agencies to post regulatory guidance documents in a centralized location on their websites. This common sense bill would provide much needed transparency to American businesses and consumers.”The GOOD Act has received praise from Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI). "Requiring vastly more disclosure, ensuring that federal agencies post all guidance documents online is a sensible and essential step to beginning to hold federal agencies accountable for their actions," Clyde Wane Crews, vice president for policy at CEI said.Read the full text of the GOOD Act here.
01.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) penned an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal outlining why Congress reviving earmarks would be a foolish decision. "Officially banned in 2011, earmarks give members of Congress the ability to direct federal spending toward specific projects, usually in their own districts," Walker wrote. "When earmarks were allowed and encouraged, bills passed on shady favors and chumminess rather than on their merits. This practice helped produce what we now call the swamp. It wasn’t so long ago that the GOP used a platform of banning earmarks and controlling spending to help ride a major political wave and take control of the House."Recent reports note that Congress is considering reviving earmarks. This week the House Committee on Rules will hold two hearings on the issue.Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:GOP Maps a Road to Nowhere in NovemberThe Wall Street Journal By Mark Walker January 15, 2018 Despite the constant media portrayal of disarray, 2017 was a productive year for the first unified Republican government in a decade. Not only did we pass a once-in-a-generation tax reform, we repealed ObamaCare’s most onerous and unpopular provision, the individual mandate. Democrats should be anxious about heading into midterm elections as Americans reap the benefits of tax reform and deregulation. If Republicans maintain our momentum, we can retain our majorities in the House and Senate. Yet I fear we may be giving Democrats a fighting chance by bringing back a practice that epitomizes swamp-style politics: earmarking. Officially banned in 2011, earmarks give members of Congress the ability to direct federal spending toward specific projects, usually in their own districts. Conservatives traditionally oppose such giveaways, but Speaker Paul Ryan said last week that the House will look into reviving the practice. He shouldn’t bow to the demands of members who claim earmarking is a legitimate part of Congress’s power of the purse. This bad idea is gaining traction partly because most House Republicans took their seats after the 2011 ban. They have little memory of past abuses like Alaska’s “Bridge to Nowhere.” They never had to endure the meetings where lobbyists pressured them to grovel before the Appropriations Committee for pork. The moniker “cardinals” for subcommittee chairmen is an anachronism; they no longer have unilateral powers to redirect billions in spending on a whim. When earmarks were allowed and encouraged, bills passed on shady favors and chumminess rather than on their merits. This practice helped produce what we now call the swamp. It wasn’t so long ago that the GOP used a platform of banning earmarks and controlling spending to help ride a major political wave and take control of the House. This message was a precursor to President Trump’s promise to “drain the swamp” and end a status quo that benefits Washington insiders over ordinary Americans. An earmark revival—even as the U.S. courts trillion-dollar deficits—would risk handing Democrats a tool to transform their “resistance” into a political force capable of achieving tea-party-style electoral victories. If Republicans bring back earmarks, you can bet that Democrats plant the blame of every subsequent earmark on Republicans. It’s only a matter of time before there is another politically catastrophic “Bridge to Nowhere.” Earmarks also lead to bad policy. I am willing to listen to reform proposals, but historically earmarks have opened the gates to out-of-control spending as members compete with one another to bring home the bacon. The price for every bill tends to rise as members hold their affirmative votes until money for their own pet projects are slipped into legislation. Earmarks for Medicare and Medicaid greased the legislative gears to pass ObamaCare, a bad policy that plagued American families with year after year of premium hikes. President Trump recently said he supports bringing back earmarks, apparently hoping it will make legislation easier to pass. But if the political backlash helps Democrats take the House, the legislative agenda will consist simply of impeaching Mr. Trump for whatever the latest controversy is. Democrats likely will abuse the power of Congress to ramp up the Russia investigation and subpoena anyone who ever drank Russian vodka. (For the record, I’d be safe.) Instead of looking to tried-and-failed methods of the past, Republicans should keep our focus on fulfilling the promises made by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to the American people. Reviving earmarks would threaten to bring our party’s momentum to a screeching halt.
01.15.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after H.R. 4318, the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018 was scheduled for a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives for Tuesday, January 16th:“This legislation will remove harmful and useless penalties that punish manufacturers for hiring and investing in our communities. We have worked hard to deliver on this reform that will lead to millions of dollars being reinvested in North Carolina as we continue to lead the nation in manufacturing and economic growth. It is my hope that my colleagues will move quickly to send this bipartisan bill to the President’s desk.” This bill is the result of efforts by Walker and Members of the House Ways and Means Committee in the 114th Congress on H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act – legislation that revived and reformed a process for American businesses to apply for a suspension of harmful tariffs on materials that are needed, but not made in the United States. Part of that process is for businesses to petition the independent, non-partisan International Trade Commission (ITC), and following review and rejection based on any request that would impact a U.S. producer, the ITC reports the petitions to Congress for consideration as legislation. The collection of those petitions is the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018. “[Walker] was the champion for this,” Leib Oehmig, President and Chief Operating Officer of Glen Raven Inc. in Glen Raven, N.C., said. (See Oehmig’s full testimony to Congress in a 2016 hearing here.)SEE RELATED: Local Business Praises Walker for His Work on the Passage of the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act To learn more about the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, watch the video below which features Vern Hawkins, President of Crop Protection at Syngenta in Greensboro, N.C., explaining the economic impact these tariffs have on their business and the North Carolina economy. Looking at the MTB petitions that make up the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill (MTB) Act of 2018, one thing is clear, North Carolina is a big winner. The legislation consists of 1,686 petitions – American manufacturers who need to purchase materials for production that are not available in the United States. Of those 333 petitions, 19.75%, are manufacturers in North Carolina, more than any other state. That represents a savings of $71 million in 2018, also the most in the nation. Examples of manufacturers in North Carolina’s 6th congressional district who will be impacted by this legislation are: Syngenta of Greensboro, N.C. | 47 petitions representing $13.7 million Glen Raven Inc. of Glen Raven, N.C. | 9 petitions representing $6.4 million Revlon Inc. of Oxford, N.C. | 4 petitions representing $1.9 million BGF Industries Inc. of Greensboro, N.C. | 2 petitions representing $445,900 These needless taxes, which do nothing to support the production of American products, drive up production costs and ultimately the final costs of the product being manufactured. This relief will help North Carolina’s manufacturers free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities. Manufacturing represents more than one-fifth of North Carolina’s total output and employs more than 10% of the state’s workforce.
01.06.2018	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today penned an op-ed for the Greensboro News and Record outlining what the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act means for the families and business of North Carolina. "As early as February, the Internal Revenue Service will make changes to your federal income tax withholdings, meaning in just weeks you will see more money in your pocket," Walker wrote. "This is great news for North Carolina families; however, it’s far bigger than just a pay raise. For many in our community, it’s a lifeline and a sign of hope for the future." Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below: Tax law provides hope for futureGreensboro News and Record By: Mark Walker January 6, 2018 Last month, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in Congress and was signed into law by President Trump. What does that mean for you and your family? Growth in your paycheck for the first time in decades. As early as February, the Internal Revenue Service will make changes to your federal income tax withholdings, meaning in just weeks you will see more money in your pocket. This is great news for North Carolina families; however, it’s far bigger than just a pay raise. For many in our community, it’s a lifeline and a sign of hope for the future. Under the status quo, 78 percent of full-time workers say they live paycheck to paycheck. I get it. Growing up in a lower-income family, we moved from one house rental to another as my parents worked to make ends meet. For two decades, my wife, Kelly, and I raised three children on a modest income. Though we were thankful for God’s blessings, we knew the stresses of tough financial decisions. Many others are struggling to an even greater extent, which is why families are at the heart of our tax plan. The doubling of the standard deduction is a move that adds $11,000 of untaxable income to North Carolina families’ take-home pay. We also expand the 529 education-savings program to include K-12 expenses, giving parents more flexibility to save and spend on their children’s education — an essential rung on the ladder to prosperity. Additionally, this tax overhaul means the Child Tax Credit is doubled to $2,000 to help parents with the cost of raising children. This historic tax reform will ease the cost of living for low- and middle-income families, allowing them to keep more of their money, save for the future and raise their children. For instance, it gives a typical family of four earning $73,000 a year a nearly 58 percent reduction in their tax bill. North Carolina has 600,000 children living in low-income, single-parent households. The tax law represents a nearly 73 percent tax reduction for their single mother or father struggling to get by, and it helps provide them with opportunities so they can meet their full God-given potential. More than just a boon to families in our community, I am confident this is the ticket to a healthy economy — not the languid, lethargic economy we have grown used to since the mid-2000s. As we look to attract business and economic growth to our ready workforce and fledgling megasites, I strongly believe this tax-reform bill, paired with reforms out of Raleigh, will make a strong case that our community is open for business and ready to grow. That means more jobs and more opportunity for upward mobility.
01.04.2018	GRAHAM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored Alamance County’s Mike Mitchell of the North Carolina State Highway Patrol as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for January 2018. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Trooper Mike Mitchell is a native of Alamance County and has been with the North Carolina State Highway Patrol (NCSHP) for seven years. In addition to his commendable public service with the NCSHP, he selflessly volunteers his time to coach youth basketball in the community. Trooper Mitchell has coached with the church-organized Upward Sports program and is also a coach for the varsity basketball team at the Walter Williams High School in Burlington, N.C. He was recently presented the Trooper D.R. Bowick Trooper of the Year Award from his peers at the NCSHP. “Trooper Mitchell optimizes what is means to be a NCSHP Trooper,” the NCSHP said. “His commitment to family, his work ethic, and community involvement through his church, local sports teams, and fundraising with the NCSHP basketball team are to be commended. This award given in memory of Trooper Bowick could not have been given to a more deserving recipient.”“Both in his career and through volunteering his time, Trooper Mike Mitchell has shown remarkable service to North Carolina,” Walker said. “Keeping our community safe and investing in the next generation are two of the most important callings one can have. We thank Trooper Mitchell for his dedicated service and for the role model that he is to the youth he coaches.” Walker presented Trooper Mitchell with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of his service at the NCSHP office in Graham.

12.21.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today announced that he has nominated 13 North Carolina High School students for appointment to one of the United States' service academies —the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the U.S. Naval Academy—for the Class of 2022. The Sixth District’s Service Academy Nomination Board (pictured below), appointed by Walker, conducted interviews with each of the applicants and made recommendations based on their qualifications. “It’s my honor to recommend each of these students from North Carolina to our nation’s prestigious service academies," Walker said. "Each of these young men and women are exceptional and have a heart of service and love of country. I know they will make our community and our state proud as they represent us in the U.S. Service Academy application process.” Next, the students will seek to meet the admission requirements of their service academy, where the academy will make the final decision on admission in the early months of 2018.

12.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today voted in favor of the Conference Report to Accompany of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – keeping an important promise to overhaul our broken tax code and deliver on tax relief to the families and businesses of North Carolina. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed the U.S. House of Representatives with a 227-203 vote."Here is what this historic vote means: At the beginning of next year, the hardworking families of North Carolina will finally see more money in their pockets," Walker said. “With this critical promise kept, we can proclaim that “the worker deserves his wages,” and that middle income families – not the government – are best equipped to make their own financial decisions. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act helps us turn on the engines of economic growth in our communities, stop the government from overtaxing North Carolinians to prop up failed economic policies, and frees people from Obamacare’s erroneous individual mandate tax that punishes lower and middle income families for not buying health insurance they don’t want or cannot afford." The legislation is expected to be taken up and approved by the Senate on the evening of Tuesday, December 19th, and then sent to the President's desk to be signed into law.RELATED: Walker Delivers on Promise to Reform the Tax Code, Supports the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act The Conference Report to Accompany of H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, can be read in full here, and a policy summary of the bill can be read here. According to the House Ways and Means Committee, "with this bill, the typical family of four earning the median family income of $73,000 will receive a tax cut of $2,059."The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will: Lower individual taxes and set the rates at 0%, 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37% so people can keep more of their hard-earned money. Significantly increase the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes – from $6,500 and $13,000 under current law to $12,000 and $24,000 for individuals and married couples, respectively. Expand the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $2,000 for single filers and married couples to help parents with the cost of raising children. Eliminate Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty tax – providing families with much-needed relief and flexibility to buy the health care that’s right for them if they choose. This was an issue championed by Walker. 79 percent of those paying the Obamacare tax penalty make less than $50,000 a year. Lower the corporate tax rate to 21% (beginning Jan. 1, 2018) – down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world – the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation’s history. For small businesses, offer a first-ever 20% tax deduction that applies to the first $315,000 of joint income earned by all businesses organized as S corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships. For Main Street job creators with income above this level, the bill generally provides a deduction for up to 20% on business profits – reducing their effective marginal tax rate to no more than 29.6%. Modernize our international tax system so America’s global businesses will no longer be held back by an outdated “worldwide” tax system that results in double taxation for many of our nation’s job creators. and Make it easier for American businesses to bring home foreign earnings to invest in growing jobs and paychecks in our local communities. Recently, Walker gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to speak in support of the legislation. You can watch the video here and above and read the transcript below: "Thank you Mr. Speaker. Today is not just about tax reform. Today is also about what we fundamentally believe as a nation. Today, we say working class families, not the government, are best equipped to make financial decisions. Did we hear anything from our Democrat friends for nearly eight years about lowering taxes on lower and middle income? We did not. "For the first time since 1986, we are going to overhaul our broken tax code. Here is what that means for families in North Carolina: Middle income families will see more than a $2,300 increase in their take home pay. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act means more than 30,000 new jobs in North Carolina. "I am encouraged that our Senate colleagues have also decided to include the Obamacare individual mandate repeal, and would urge our House conference to consider it as well. "Last, I would like to thank Chairman Brady. There is no greater servant in the United States House. Thank you to his work and to his team. "Today, we keep our promise. It’s time to move forward. "I yield back."
12.15.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Wade Harvey (pictured left) and Mike Lapeirre (pictured right) as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for December 2017.Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in their community. Inspired by the annual Wreaths Across America ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, Wade Harvey and Mike Lapeirre worked to organize a similar event in the Greensboro area. The two fathers hoped to use the ceremony to educate their own children about freedom and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Wade and Mike contacted Wreaths Across America and selected Forest Lawn Cemetery in Greensboro. With help from friends, family, and volunteers from the community, the pair have laid 1,100 wreaths in the veteran’s section of the cemetery every December since 2013.“During this season, it is vital to remember the servicemen and servicewomen who have sacrificed so that we may know the blessings of freedom,” Walker said. “Seeing an opportunity to make a difference in our community, Wade and Mike took action and organized a powerful ceremony to show gratitude to our veterans. Because of their efforts, generations of heroes now know that we are thankful for their service and that their sacrifice will not be forgotten.” Walker presented Wade and Mike with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of their service. This year’s honor ceremony will be held at Forest Lawn Cemetery on Saturday, December 16th at 11:00 a.m. You can learn more about Wade and Mike and the Wreaths Across Greensboro ceremony here.
12.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today gave the opening statement for a Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hearing on "Oversight of the Bureau of Prisons and Inmate Reentry." Walker has made criminal justice reform a legislative priority, calling for Congress to act swiftly on the issue, and forging coalitions across the aisle, including with the Congressional Black Caucus. “Families are the building blocks of communities,” Walker said at the hearing. “It is hard to imagine anything more disruptive to a family than losing a parent or spouse to incarceration." “Redemption has always been an American ideal,” Walker added. “We need former prisoners to integrate back into society, restore stability to their families, and contribute to their communities." Following Walker's opening statement, U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) praised Walker for his work on criminal justice reform. “Congressman Walker, I want to applaud you for what you said and what you do in this area,” Cummings said. “You said some very important words. You said whatever we do with regard to these folks, it has to be real and it has to be effective." You can watch Walker's remarks above and read the full transcript below:"Families are the building blocks of communities. It is hard to imagine anything more disruptive to a family than losing a parent or spouse to incarceration. To have a parent removed from your life and sent to prison must be an overwhelmingly difficult experience for both the inmate and the family. "I can still remember as a young child, being the son of a pastor who was also a prison chaplain, still sitting on the bunks of those inmates, in many cases hearing the sad stories. "Now, make no mistake, I firmly believe that when people break the law there must be consequences, and incarceration is often times the appropriate consequence. However, the Justice System and the Bureau of Prisons also have a responsibility to help rehabilitate that person and help that inmate have a successful reentry back into our communities. This makes sense from both a public safety perspective and one out of compassion for our fellow citizens. Because what is clear is that virtually all of the inmates in federal prison are going back to return to their communities and their families. "When they are released, the question should be asked, will they be better, or will they be worse? You see, redemption has always been an American ideal. We need former prisoners to integrate back into society, restore stability to their families, and contribute to their communities. "Inmate release preparation and programming is essential to developing and restoring hope. Hope that they will never return to prison. Hope that they will find a job. Hope that they will be able to support their family. Hope that they will build a good life after prison. For that reason, rehabilitation and reentry efforts must be real and they must be effective. "Three weeks ago, I spoke in Winston-Salem, North Carolina at a wonderful nonprofit organization, the Winston-Salem Prison Ministry, doing a great job. But, the Bureau of Prisons must also make successful inmate rehabilitation and reentry a priority. "The Bureau must also evaluate its programs and reentry decisions so that their effectiveness can be measured based on evidence of success. We have got to figure out what reentry and rehabilitation strategies work best. "Does release to a halfway house improve an inmates’ chances at successful reentry? Are some Halfway houses more effective than others at assisting inmates to succeed? Would placing more inmates directly into home confinement reduce recidivism? Do certain education or life skills programs tend to lead to a more successful inmate reentry? "These are all questions I look forward to discussing today. I believe that evidence based assessments are essential to determine what programs work well at reducing recidivism and what programs simply do not work well. "I am grateful for all the witnesses here today. I appreciate your expertise. Reducing recidivism and improving inmate reentry services is a challenge, but it is one we must all be committed to achieving."
12.11.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – Kevin Hazel and John Sorjonen, plant managers of the Procter & Gamble manufacturing facilities in Greensboro, on Sunday penned a piece for theGreensboro News and Record highlighting the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the efforts of tax reform by U.S. Representative Mark Walker and the United States Congress will have on Greensboro's economy.As Hazel and Sorjonen write, "a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro."Read the op-ed in its entirety here and below:Congress is in the midst of moving a tax bill that is essential to the United States’ economic future. Allow us an opportunity to introduce some facts on why it is so important to our company, our workers and our community. Procter & Gamble sells consumer products in more than 180 countries and territories. We have 25 manufacturing sites located in 19 U.S. states and territories, as well as nearly 90 manufacturing sites in foreign countries, where we manufacture products close to the consumers we serve worldwide. Here in Greensboro, we proudly employ nearly 1,200 people between two manufacturing facilities. Within North Carolina, P&G purchases about $995 million of products and services from more than 495 suppliers. At P&G, we believe tax reform is crucial for both our company and our country. Why? The U.S. tax system puts American companies at a competitive disadvantage in the global marketplace. P&G has been a global company for more than 100 of our 180 years. In fact, one in five of P&G’s U.S.-based jobs support our international business, in areas such as manufacturing, marketing, innovation and supply chain management. So, when P&G succeeds in international markets, it means we succeed here at home, too. However, the U.S. corporate tax rate is among the highest in the developed world at 35 percent. The current global average for developed countries is about 24 percent, and countries are lowering their rates further, creating a downward trend. This makes it harder for P&G and other U.S.-headquartered businesses — small and large — to compete with peer companies headquartered overseas. It also reduces the competitiveness of the U.S. economy as a place to do business and create jobs. The Congress is currently considering legislation that would lower the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Congress is also considering legislation that would move the U.S. tax code from a worldwide corporate income tax system to what is known as a territorial tax system. This would help American companies, including P&G, compete on a level playing field. Unlike P&G, our competitors headquartered outside the United States — who already operate under a territorial system — do not pay additional tax to their home countries when they sell products outside their home countries. Because 60 percent of P&G’s sales are global, the current U.S. tax code puts us at a competitive disadvantage. Other American companies are in a similar position. As members of Congress debate whether or not to pass tax reform in the coming weeks, it is important to remember that economic growth and jobs in our community depend on having a competitive U.S. tax system. The details will matter, but a tax system with a 20 percent corporate tax rate and a modern territorial tax system will boost economic growth here at home and level the playing field for U.S. businesses and workers — including P&G’s U.S. employees here in Greensboro.
12.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today co-sponsored the Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act. This legislation would eliminate the congressional "hush fund," require public disclosures of sexual harassment claims from members of Congress and staff, and prohibit taxpayer dollars from being used to pay future sexual harassment or sexual assault claims. “This is a moral injustice,” Walker said. “The existence of a secret hush fund that uses taxpayer money to settle sexual misconduct from members of Congress highlights exactly why people don’t trust Washington. We need to eliminate this abhorrent process immediately and create a system where members of Congress are held to the same standard as the people they represent."Since 1997, the Office of Compliance has paid out more than $17 million in taxpayer funds to settle claims, including sexual harassment claims, on behalf of members of Congress and congressional staff. The settlements are kept private, and the names of the members of Congress and/or staffers are kept secret. This bill would change that.The Congressional Accountability and Hush Fund Elimination Act will: Require disclosure within 30 calendar days of all settlement payments funded by taxpayers, the reason for the payment and the nature of the allegation, and the member of Congress or congressional staffer implicated in the matter. Prohibit the future use of taxpayer dollars to pay sexual harassment and sexual assault claims against members of Congress and staff. Prohibit members of Congress from using office budgets to camouflage payments. Require members of Congress and staff that have ever been named in a sexual harassment or sexual assault settlement paid for by taxpayers reimburse the U.S. Treasury with interest. Any individual who received an award may make public statements about the claims notwithstanding the terms of a nondisclosure agreement and nondisclosure agreements cannot be made a condition of any future settlements.

11.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted to reform the federal tax code and provide tax relief for lower and middle income families by supporting H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – which passed the U.S. House of Representatives with a 227-205 vote."For decades, working families in North Carolina have faced stagnant wages and a broken, complicated tax code that harms the growth of our economy and our communities," Walker said. "Today, we kept an important promise to the voters in delivering an overhaul of our broken tax code and bringing tax relief to millions of lower and middle income families. The hardworking families of our state need and deserve these tax cuts.” Walker also released the following video with information about how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will impact the families and small businesses of North Carolina and North Carolina's 6th congressional district. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, can be read in full here, and a policy summary of the bill can be read here. RELATED: From The Washington Post's Fact Checker: "Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families" The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans to Zero, 12%, 25%, and 35% so people can keep more of the money they earn throughout their lives, and continues to maintain 39.6% for high-income Americans. Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes – from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Eliminates special-interest deductions that increase rates and complicate Americans’ taxes – so an individual or family can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Takes action to support more American families by: Establishing a new Family Credit – which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 to help parents with the cost of raising children, and providing a credit of $300 for each parent and non-child dependent to help all families with their everyday expenses. Preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support. Preserves the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves. Streamlines higher education benefits to help families save for and better afford college tuition and other education expenses. Continues the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization. Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and maintains the home mortgage interest deduction for newly purchased homes up to $500,000 – providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners. Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local property taxes up to $10,000. Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts so Americans can continue to save for their future. Lowers the corporate tax rate to 20% – down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world – the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation’s history.

11.13.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Sunday honored Greensboro's Andrew and Anna Hopper as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for November 2017 at Mercy Hill Church's Regional Campus. Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. SEE RELATED: WALKER: "The Adoption Tax Credit is Pro-Life and Pro-Family" Andrew Hopper serves as the lead pastor for Mercy Hill Church in Greensboro, a church launched in 2012 and has since been one of the fastest growing churches in the nation. Andrew attended North Greenville University in order to play football and hone his ability to preach and lead. In school he was also given the biggest blessing of his life in meeting and marrying a Godly woman. Andrew and Anna were married in 2005. They now have four children. The Hopper family is still in a long, detailed, and expensive process of adopting their fourth child. “Adopting a child is one of the most selfless, generous acts a family can pursue," Walker said. "Every year, loving families in America welcome thousands of children into their homes and into their lives to provide them with endearment and opportunity. Families like the Hoppers show the positive impact adoption can make in our community, our country and our world, and highlight the need to remove barriers and encourage adoptions through our policies.”"Adoption is at the heart of the Gospel," Andrew and Anna Hopper said. "Every Christian must wrestle not with whether or not to be involved with vulnerable children, but only how and to what extent. For us, we've known that meant adoption for a long time.” November is National Adoption Month. The Hoppers were presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. Recently, after efforts by Rep. Walker, the adoption tax credit was preserved in the House tax reform bill, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Read more here.
11.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced H.R. 4262, the Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act. This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation. In 2015, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP. The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future. However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home."Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country,”Walker said. “Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them. The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces and empower them with a more secure financial future.” This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback on policy proposals. According to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 181,985 North Carolina veterans received disability compensation in fiscal year 2016. You can read the full text of the Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act here.
11.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady (R-Texas) addedan amendment to H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to preserve the adoption tax credit:“Simplifying our broken tax code means ending carveouts for Washington’s well-connected, but middle-income families looking to adopt – and often save – a precious young life simply does not fit that mold. The adoption tax credit is pro-life and pro-family. I commend Chairman Brady for saving this important provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.” Walker was the first member of Congress to call for the readdition of the adoption tax credit in a tweet on November 3rd. Tax Bill is strong but needs to include adoption tax credit. Providing a home for a child that is unwanted or special needs is pro-life! — Rep. Mark Walker (@RepMarkWalker) November 3, 2017 The amendment from Brady comes on the recognition of World Adoption Day.
11.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement after the release of the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act," the House Republican tax reform plan:“It is imperative that we deliver on our promise to reform our broken tax code, and I look forward to helping ensure Congress keeps its word to the people of North Carolina. This tax reform bill reaches past the lowest common denominator and towards a consensus around pro-worker and pro-family conservative ideas. Washington will fight this reform, desiring to keep the carveout-laden status quo, but conservatives will prevail and produce a final bill focused on prosperity and growth for all in our community.”H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, can be read in full here, and a policy summary of the bill can be read here. With this bill, a typical middle-income family of four, earning $59,000 a year (the median household income), will receive a $1,182 tax cut. RELATED: From The Washington Post's Fact Checker: "Senate Democrats falsely claim GOP tax plan will raise taxes for most working-class families" According to the House Ways and Means Committee, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will: Lowers individual tax rates for low- and middle-income Americans to Zero, 12%, 25%, and 35% so people can keep more of the money they earn throughout their lives, and continues to maintain 39.6% for high-income Americans. Significantly increases the standard deduction to protect roughly double the amount of what you earn each year from taxes – from $6,350 to $12,000 for individuals and $12,700 to $24,000 for married couples. Eliminates special-interest deductions that increase rates and complicate Americans’ taxes – so an individual or family can file their taxes on a form as simple as a postcard. Takes action to support more American families by: Establishing a new Family Credit – which includes expanding the Child Tax Credit from $1,000 to $1,600 to help parents with the cost of raising children, and providing a credit of $300 for each parent and non-child dependent to help all families with their everyday expenses. Preserving the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit to help families care for their children and older dependents such as a disabled grandparent who may need additional support. Preserves the Earned Income Tax Credit to provide important tax relief for low-income Americans working to build better lives for themselves. Streamlines higher education benefits to help families save for and better afford college tuition and other education expenses. Continues the deduction for charitable contributions so people can continue to donate to their local church, charity, or community organization. Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages and maintains the home mortgage interest deduction for newly purchased homes up to $500,000 – providing tax relief to current and aspiring homeowners. Continues to allow people to write off the cost of state and local property taxes up to $10,000. Retains popular retirement savings options such as 401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts so Americans can continue to save for their future. Lowers the corporate tax rate to 20% – down from 35%, which today is the highest in the industrialized world – the largest reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate in our nation’s history.
10.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after President Trump announced he intends to designate Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy David Kautter as Acting Commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service: “It’s a failure of government that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen will be able to serve his full tenure after consistently abusing the public trust, lying to Congress, and obstructing investigations. I can only hope that as he leaves the IRS building, his head is not held high and that he will be remembered as empowering the agency’s extensive actions of political abuse. Dishonorable bureaucrats like Koskinen highlight another reason tax reform is critical and urgent – to defang an agency that has been used as a political weapon. “I look forward working with the Administration and meeting with Mr. Kautter as soon as possible to discuss his plans to fix the IRS.”
10.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement in response to the Trump administration's announcement that they will declare the opioid crisis a national public health emergency:“I am thankful the President has taken this important step in empowering federal agencies to refocus their efforts towards combatting the opioid crisis. Congress has passed laws that provide resources to confront this epidemic, but as we learned last week in our Opioid Crisis Tour throughout North Carolina, more action is clearly needed. We will remain committed to working with local law enforcement, first responders, and local government to stop the overwhelming hardship this is causing to the families of our community.”According to Roll Call, "the declaration would direct all federal agencies to make the crisis their number one priority. It would include awareness and prevention programs and allow the federal government to work with states to redistribute already-available grants that support substance abuse efforts." Last week, Walker hosted a two-day, seven-stop opioid crisis tour across North Carolina to better understand the full scope of the opioid epidemic and to get a firsthand account of the realities, burdens, and struggles of opioid addiction in North Carolina. Read more about the Opioid Crisis Tour in a story in the Washington Examiner here. As the story notes, "since 1999, opioid-related deaths in North Carolina have increased by 800 percent, nationwide drug overdoses now kill more Americans than gun homicides and car crashes combined." In 2016, more than two million Americans had an addiction to prescription or illicit opioids. Since 2000, over 300,000 Americans have died from overdoses involving opioids.You can learn more about the opioid epidemic and Walker's Opioid Crisis Tour by watching the videos below:
10.13.2017	ROXBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Tuesday honored Person County's Lacy Winstead as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for October 2017 at Roxboro Community School.Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them.Lacy Winstead is a native of Roxboro, N.C. and is retired from careers in both agriculture and real estate. He was part of an original group of citizens who saw the need for public school choice in Person County and was very instrumental in the building of Roxboro Community School. The school serves both middle and high school students, and is located in a historic building that once served as a cotton mill. “When I first met Lacy Winstead last year, I was impressed that a everyday citizen would be willing to sacrifice so much time and effort to not only preserve an important historic building, but create a unique space in the community for students from all walks of life to learn and grow,” Walker said. “It took vision and perseverance to complete the building and make this charter school a reality, and Mr. Winstead has left a legacy that will impact many generations for years to come.” Winstead was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
10.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement in response to the administration's announcement that they plan to stop issuing unconstitutional payments under the Obamacare cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program:“President Trump made the right call in deeming these payments unlawful. Under no circumstance should Congress attempt to expand Obamacare by cutting a check for President Obama’s bailout of insurance companies. Instead, Congress must fulfill the promise to repeal and replace Obamacare with high-quality, patient-centered health care.”The CSR payments were illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.According to The New York Times: "Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration."In August, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decisionWalker said that "we cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies.""Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers," Walker added. "The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise.”
10.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) introduced a bill that would incentivize charitable giving for low and middle income earning individuals and families.The Universal Charitable Giving Act establishes an universal charitable deduction for individuals and married couples who do not itemize, in addition to the standard deduction. This would be an above-the-line deduction up to one-third of the standard deduction – about $2,100 for individuals and $4,200 for married couples. As reported by The Hill: "Walker’s bill would allow taxpayers who take the standard deduction to also deduct their charitable contributions up to an amount equal to one-third of the standard deduction. The standard deduction for married couples under current law is $12,700 and would be increased to $24,000 under the GOP’s framework."To better explain the importance of the Universal Charitable Giving Act, what it does, and how it helps charities, Walker released a video (above) featuring the Baptist Children's Home of North Carolina. In the video, J. Keith Henry, Chief Operating Officer for Baptist Children's Homes of North Carolina explains that upwards of 65 percent of their budget comes from charitable donations, and that any policy that discourages giving to charity could have a harmful impact on their services. A key aspect of the recently released GOP Tax Reform Framework from the White House and Congress is to double the standard deduction so that lower and middle income families keep more of their paycheck and have more income that is not taxed. Under the current tax system around 70 percent of tax filers claim the standard deduction. Estimates have shown, under the new GOP Tax Reform Framework, that number would rise to 95 percent. With current law, only taxpayers who itemize their deductions can deduct charitable donations to qualifying organizations. As a potential unintended consequence of the tax plan, the doubling of the standard deduction will lower the number of itemizers and likely decrease charitable giving incentives for many taxpayers. The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving for low and middle income taxpayers. It would not only help individuals and families who would likely stop itemizing their deductions under the new tax plan, but would also encourage taxpayers who already claim the standard deduction to give the charities and causes they believe in. This bill is focused on helping charities, and the lower and middle class. In fiscal year 2017, roughly 71% of the tax expenditures for charitable giving will be claimed by taxpayers who earn $200,000 a year or more. By broadening the base of people who can deduct charitable donations, this bill aims to empower lower and middle income earners to direct funds willingly to socially productive organizations they wish to support. You can read the full text of the legislation here. The bill has already garnered attention of prominent organizations such as the Alliance for Charitable Reform, Charitable Giving Coalition and the Independent Sector."The Charitable Giving Coalition (CGC) applauds Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC-6) for standing up for America’s charitable organizations and the communities they serve," Jason Lee, chair of the Charitable Giving Coalition said. "Congressman Walker’s bill expands good tax policy, providing an incentive to more Americans to invest in their communities through charitable giving. A non-itemizer deduction will become even more critical within the larger tax reform framework currently under consideration." On Wednesday evening, Walker gave a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives to introduce the bill. You can watch the video here and above, and read the transcript here: "Today, I rise to announce the introduction of the Universal Charitable Giving Act. "Many Americans believe that people – not the government – offer the best solutions to solve the ailments that face our society. Strong families, strong churches, strong communities. These are the foundation of our nation, and by supporting charities we can make our communities and our country a better place for Americans from all walks of life. "Giving to charity is crucial for economic prosperity, happiness, and the success of our people. But for too long, only the most wealthy have been incentivized to give to the causes they believe in. "The Universal Charitable Giving Act incentivizes charitable giving for low and middle income taxpayers. It would allow everyone to deduct charitable giving, regardless of itemizing status. "With tax reform, our aim is to increase take home pay for middle America. And with my bill, our goal is to increase support for all charities. I urge my colleagues to support the great work of our faith-based and charitable organizations by supporting this bill."
10.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representative passed H.Con.Res. 71, the Establishing the congressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2018 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2019 through 2027, in a 219-206 vote:"20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion. Let’s put it this way: each American's share of the national debt is $62,000. From the retiree in Greensboro who has already done so much to serve the country to the newborn child in Burlington with so much potential, $62,000. In fact, it’s more than the median American family brings home in an entire year. "Is it not a moral injustice to leave this level of debt to the next generation? We’ve been making this argument in the House for years. Today, it’s time to make a difference." Walker voted in favor of the legislation, which would balance the budget over 10 years and offers strong conservative reforms that put the government on path to fiscal responsibility. The budget also paves the way for tax reform by prompting the creation of a budget reconciliation package that can serve as a legislative vehicle for changes in the tax code.Just before the vote, the House voted on the "Securing America’s Future Economy" Fiscal Year 2018 Budget of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), which Walker chairs. The RSC budget: Balances by 2023 Provides A Responsible Fiscal Path Strengthens National Security Fully Repeals and Replaces Obamacare Makes Social Security Solvent Saves Medicare Rescues Disability Insurance Reforms the Tax Code Creates an Environment for Economic Growth and Jobs Empowers People to Ensure Opportunity, Upward Mobility, and Self-Sufficiency Restores Constitutionalism, Limits and Reforms Government, and Fixes the Budget Process That vote failed 139-281. However, in a testament to Walker's conservative leadership in the House, this was the highest vote total for any RSC budget since President Obama took office. You can learn more about Walker's RSC Budget here. Prior to the vote on the RSC budget, Walker spoke on the House floor about the budget, our national debt, and the implications for future generations. You can watch the speech above, and read the full transcript below:"Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Thank you, Chairman. "20.2 trillion. Our national debt is more than $20.2 trillion. Let’s put it this way: each American’s share of the national debt is $62,000. From the retiree in North Carolina who has already done so much to serve the country to the newborn child in New York with so much potential, $62,000. In fact, it’s more than the median American family brings home in an entire year. "Our debt continues to mount even as federal reserves reach record highs. This leads to an undeniable conclusion, even from Captain Obvious: the federal government has a spending problem. The growing federal government has significant negative consequences for the country and its people. The large federal debt reduces investments, productivity and wages while federal interventions in the economy reduce the incentive to work, resulting in a shrinking labor market. The debt can have dangerous implications for national security. "Implications for our national security recently causing a bipartisan leading nation security official to say: "Our long term debt is the single greatest threat to our national security." "Most fundamentally, when the federal government is too big and too intrusive it interferes with our unalienable rights – to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Eleven months ago the American people voted to give Republicans unified control of government now it is time to follow through and implement the policy agenda the Congress and the President were elected on. As the calendar moves into fall the grade of the 115th Congress will be delivered on whether we can reform our inefficient tax code. "This process starts with the budget. Along with repealing Obamacare and securing our border, the Republican Study Committee budget allows us to fulfill these promises and more. This fiscal year 2018 RSC budget ensures strong national security, a robust economic growth, equal opportunity for all, a sustainable social safety net, and a retune to constitutionally limited government, all with the goal of securing America's future economy. "Instead of a future of high debt and low growth, the RSC budget proposed a positive blueprint for success and opportunity. Our budget focuses on pro-growth and pro-family policies that will boost America’s economy and provide a strong fiscal foundation for generations to come. "Mr. Chairman in closing I would like to thank my friend Mr. McClintock for his leadership of this RSC Budget Task Force, as well as all of the members, all of the members of the Republican Study Committee who participated in this effort. With this budget we have accomplished our goals of detailing the variety of bold policy solutions as well as help to influence the balance budget offered by my friend Chairwoman Black, to include meaningful, enforceable reconciliation targets as the RSC budget does. "So, with that, we can begin the central task of implementing these policies into law. My fellow members, when will our debt matter? Next year? The year after? In six years, we are projected to spend more than $650 billion on interest alone on our debt. What will it take for our friends on the Left to stop hijacking the American dream for our children and grandchildren? "Is it not a moral injustice to leave this level of debt to the next generation? "Mr. Speaker, we’ve been making this argument in the House for years. Today, it’s time to make a difference. I yield back the balance of my time."
10.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representative passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, in a 237-189 vote:"Every person has the unalienable right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This bill marks an important step in protecting these rights for the most vulnerable among us – the unborn. I urge Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to not let this important, life-saving bill get thrown on the pile of more than 270 House-passed bills that await Senate passage." The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would protect unborn children by preventing abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, at which time scientific evidence suggests the child can feel pain. The legislation includes exceptions for extreme circumstances such as rape, incest, and situations where the life of the mother is seriously threatened. The United States is one of just seven countries in the world that permit abortions after 20 weeks – including human rights violators such as China and North Korea. According to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, around 10,000 abortions take place at or after 20 weeks every year.Just before the vote, Walker spoke on the House floor about his support of the bill. You can watch the video above and read the transcript here: "As a former minister, and as an American, even as a human being, I believe that every boy and girl is conceived with God-given potential, and unique talents and abilities. Abilities they will use to serve others and make a difference. "Let me put it this way. "I know a young man named Luke. Luke’s mother was in for a surprise when at only 24 weeks into her pregnancy, her baby boy decided it was time to meet the world. To make a long story short, Luke worked through complications with his family, and he serves in our district office in North Carolina. "Every life is an opportunity. Every life is precious. A little earlier, we were challenged by the accusation that Republicans are only concerned about budgets. It goes out the window when it comes to this issue. "You know what? You're right. We don't put a price on life. We cherish it. "I am a proud cosponsor of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and encourage my colleagues to support it."
09.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) returned to the U.S. Capitol for the first time since he was injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice on June 14, 2017:"When my friend and teammate Steve Scalise took a bullet on that baseball field in June, he also took on the weight of a nation where divisiveness is being projected at a feverish pitch. In his return to the Capitol today, he has shown how strength, faith, and unity can lift us through difficult times. Let us take this moment to dedicate our focus on policies and not make attacks personal as we work hard to deliver for the people. We are glad to have you back, Steve.

09.23.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after seven students from North Carolina were named among 62 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) 2017 HBCU All-Stars by the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities:"As an advocate for HBCUs and their students, and being married to an HBCU graduate who has found great success in her career in part because of her strong education, I want to congratulate each and every one of the 2017 HBCU All-Stars. The seven students from North Carolina – Tasja, William, Denzel, Brandon, Shani, Terrell, and Keonia – have excelled in the classroom and represented their schools, our community, our state, and our country with distinction. I wish them all the best as they continue their education."According to the White House: "HBCU All-Stars are undergraduate, graduate, and professional students recognized for their outstanding accomplishments. The All-Stars are appointed for one year to serve as ambassadors of the White House Initiative on HBCUs. The All-Stars provide outreach opportunities and communications to their fellow students about the value of education and the Initiative as a networking resource. Selected from a wide-range of applicants, the All-Stars came highly recommended from HBCU administrators and proved impressive beyond their resumes, transcripts and thorough applications." The students 2017 HBCU All-Stars from North Carolina schools are listed below:Tasja Estiverne of Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina William Gibson of Winston-Salem State University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Denzel Goodlin of North Carolina Central University in Durham, North Carolina Brandon Long of North Carolina A&T University in Greensboro, North Carolina Shani McMichael of Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina Terrell Richardson of Livingston College in Salisbury, North Carolina Keonia Rodgers of North Carolina A&T University, Greensboro, North Carolina In February, Walker joined U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) in hosting an engaging and productive discussion with Presidents and Chancellors from 89 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in an event called the HBCU Fly-In.

09.14.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced a bill to fight terrorism and force the United Nations to define "international terrorism."The Define It To Fight would withhold ten percent of United States funding to the United Nations (U.N.) until the intergovernmental organization adopts a definition for "international terrorism." Instead, those funds would be directed to the U.S. Treasury for the purpose of reducing the national debt – which now stands at more than $20 trillion. Walker introduced the legislation following a speech on the U.S. House of Representatives floor commemorating the 16th anniversary of President George W. Bush's September 14th speech on the rubble of the fallen World Trade Center where he proclaimed, "I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you, and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon." The speech also noted the 16th anniversary of the House's 2001 vote for an Authorization for Use of Military Force to combat international terrorism. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which created the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to become the lead U.N. agent in the war on terror. Since then, the CTC has failed to name a single terrorist, terrorist organization or state-sponsor of terrorism. The three U.S.-identified state sponsors of terror – Iran, Syria and Sudan – have submitted reports to the CTC about their compliance with Resolution 1373. In the absence of any U.N. definition of terrorism, all three states have readily proclaimed that they are engaged in a vigorous campaign to combat terrorism despite clear and irrefutable evidence to the contrary. The United States is the largest contributor to the U.N., providing about $3.3 billion a year to finance U.N. activities and financing 22 percent of their budget.The full text of the resolution can be read here. Walker's speech can be viewed above, and a full transcript is available here:"Sixteen years ago today, atop a pile of rubble that three days before stood tall as the World Trade Center, President Bush proclaimed to a hurting nation 'I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you.' "With bullhorn in hand and an arm wrapped around a firefighter, he added: 'The people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon!' "That same day, Congress passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force to combat international terrorism. Today, that fight still continues, yet the international community has refused to define terrorism. "How are we, and other nations, to fight a war against something that we cannot even define? "Today, I am introducing the “Define It To Fight It” Act – a bill that withholds ten percent of our contributions to the United Nations until they define international terrorism – the very thing that they are supposed to be fighting. "To fulfill President Bush’s promise, we must name our enemy, and then we must make sure they hear us loud and clear. Not just for our lifetime but for generations to come."
09.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today presented a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan offering 19 policy solutions to gain conservative support for a package to raise the debt ceiling. The changes could be incorporated into the current deal before Congress or the package to raise the debt ceiling in December 2017 in order to gain conservative votes. In the letter, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) Steering Committee also announced its opposition to the deal reached yesterday on the debt limit. “Republicans campaigned on changing the status quo, and Americans elected us based on that message,” said Walker. “These proposed reforms present a way forward to make right on the promise and pass bills that reflect that Republicans control Congress and the White House.” The letter is the result of a month-long process of gathering ideas from the 155+ members of the RSC. Throughout the past several months several of these policy ideas were shared at the member and staff level with Congressional Leadership. Policy proposals in the letter include include measures to address America’s $20 trillion debt that already passed the full House of Representatives such as Medicaid work requirements or a repeal of Obamacare. It also includes measures to make right on the President’s promise to “drain the swamp.” The full text of the letter can be read here.
09.08.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after learning of a Duke Life Flight crash in eastern North Carolina:“My wife Kelly and I are deeply saddened to hear of the tragic Duke Life Flight helicopter crash. Being married to a flight trauma nurse, these specialists are a gifted class of people who instinctively put others first in time of critical need. Our heart goes out to the families who have lost loved ones in this horrible accident."
09.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the House-passed disaster relief funding for Hurricane Harvey recovery efforts:"Congress has a duty to act responsibly while showing compassion and lending a helping hand to those in need. Today, the House voted promptly to help the people of Texas continue recovery in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, but did so without any foresight into how to prepare for predictable disasters in the future. This $7.85 billion in aid, and all future aid, needs to be offset and voted on cleanly – not filled with special interests favors and political games that delays people from getting the help they need."In the near future, Congress should expect multiple additional request in response to Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and other natural disasters. While this initial funding for Hurricane Harvey relief was urgently needed to continue life-saving operations in Texas, this process should not be a blueprint for addressing and preparing for other aid bills.
09.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today joined Harris Faulkner of Fox News to discuss a reported deal between Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to combine Hurricane Harvey emergency aid funding with an increase in the debt limit and a continuing resolution spending bill. You can watch Walker's interview above and read excerpts from the interview below:FAULKNER: I understand that you have breaking news now on the Hurricane Harvey aid package. What is it, sir? WALKER: Yes, we are just hearing that part of the Hurricane Harvey relief package, as it comes out of the Senate, will include or have tied to it, raising the debt ceiling, as well as a continuing resolution. For many of us that are arriving today, coming from a different homes throughout the country, this is a little unsettling and even more frustrating.FAULKNER: Why is it happening?WALKER: Well, we believe that that without knowing for sure, this looks like or appears this is a backroom deal between Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer. Just a few months ago we were asked to swallow a new spending bill. I was at a dinner one evening where Democrats basically said, "hey, we got everything we wanted." For Republicans, we have to be willing to hold the line when it comes to the out-of-control spending. Right now, there's $145,000 dollars of debt per household. If not now, then when? What will it be next year? The year after? It's very frustrating, Harris. FAULKNER: Well, I can hear it in your voice. I know you're squeezed between meetings, because you just got that news and in a few minutes we're gonna go into a meeting with House Speaker Paul Ryan. I want to talk to you a little bit first of all about the news you just delivered on Harvey. There is one package that will go forth that I understand as clean. This will be the second chunk of money correct?WALKER: That is correct. FAULKNER: And now you consider that not to be clean. Is this the bipartisan you had in mind?WALKER: No, listen, I lived in Houston for a couple of years, 25 years ago. My heart goes out to them as a former pastor. I have many pastor friends. But we shouldn't use this tragedy – to be able to make sure that we're taking care of people – tied with other things that conservatives and Republicans, as in general, have been pushing back again for nearly an entire year. When Steve Mnuchin came and met with the Republican Study Committee, we pushed back four months ago, when asked to just look the other way on a clean debt ceiling. You know we're grateful that in Texas the flood waters continue to recede, but here in the swamp, it looks like they continue to rise.
08.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement in response to the administration's announcement that they plan to continue issuing unconstitutional payments under the Obamacare cost-sharing reduction (CSR) program:"We cannot dig our hands into a hole $20 trillion deep to bail out insurance companies. Even worse, we will be adding insult to injury by masking the failures of Obamacare at the expense of hardworking taxpayers. The people of North Carolina are already paying enough because of Obamacare’s pitfalls. Instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the Senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. Their constituents are tired of their inability to fulfill their promise."The CSR payments are illegal because Congress, who holds the constitutional power of the purse, never authorized the payments. They are the center of a 2014 lawsuit where House Republicans sued the Obama administration on the constitutionality of the payments directly to insurance companies, practically serving as a bail out. A Federal District Court judge agreed and ordered the payments had to be halted.According to The New York Times: "Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled. 'Such an appropriation cannot be inferred,' the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration."In April, the Trump administration announced it would temporarily continue CSR payments. Following that decision Walker said that "The Constitution provides that ‘No money may be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.’ "Congress has made no appropriation for Obamacare cost sharing reduction payments,"Walker added. "Therefore, we believe making these payments without congressional approval is both clearly illegal and unconstitutional, as the district court held in House v. Price."

ASHEBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today issued the following statement in announcing Fibertex Personal Care has chosen to invest $327 million and create 145 new jobs in Asheboro with the opening of its first American site:"Fibertex calling Asheboro home is a huge step in the right direction for jobs and economic growth in our community. The 6th Congressional District holds all three promising North Carolina megasites – boasting a strong workforce fueled by great people and significant growth opportunities for both businesses and employees. There is a reason North Carolina is consistently ranked as a top state in the country for business. As Congress looks to enact bold, pro-growth tax reform, I look forward to helping North Carolina lead the way for 21st century economic growth."You can read more about the investment and Fibertex here.
08.02.2017	RANDLEMAN, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Tuesday honored Randolph County's Larry Wagner as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for August 2017 at Victory Junction camp in Randleman, N.C.Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Larry Wagner has been the volunteer Archery Instructor at Victory Junction Camp since 2005. Victory Junction is a camp that enriches the lives of children with chronic medical conditions and serious illnesses by providing life-changing camp experiences. When Mr. Wagner began volunteering at Victory Junction, he found a place that included three of his passions: archery, kids, and volunteering. Over the past twelve years, Mr. Wagner has built the archery program that has inspired countless children to participate in the sport of archery, and he has developed special bows to accommodate children in wheelchairs. His creativity is a model for other camps, even as far away as Australia. One of Mr. Wagner’s former campers, Kyla, now shoots for her school’s archery team and has placed 3rd in Special Olympics. "It is my privilege to honor a man who has given so much and been a source of hope and joy for so many children and families," Walker said. "Larry Wagner has the unique ability to help children reach their full potential in a sport that many would think impossible for them to achieve. He sees opportunity where others see limitations. It is individuals like Larry—the “unsung heroes” of our community—who should inspire us all to invest more in the lives of others." Wagner was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.The above image shows Walker and Wagner together at the presentation. The images below are also from Victory Junction with the bottom image showing (from left to right): Walker, Victory Junction Chief Development Officer Mark Schumaker, Wagner, and Victory Junction President and CEO Chad Coltrane.
07.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored caregiving expert Scott Silknitter as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for July 2017. Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Scott Silknitter is on a mission to provide caregiving information and resources to individuals around the world. His knowledge and passion for this issue stem from caring for his father through a 25-year fight with Parkinson’s and Dementia, and has developed into a company that creates products and programs for families dealing with long-term care needs. Scott is also an author, speaker, and cancer survivor. He recently finished a program that saw over 2,000 caregiving books distributed to families in need through Senior Resources of Guilford. "It was my privilege to join Scott Silknitter for one if his Caregiving 101 discussions last month," Walker said. "I was impressed with his compassion for others, and his willingness to help people through what he learned in caring for his own father during difficult times. Because of Scott’s contributions, many individuals now have the information and resources they need as they care for family members with unique, long-term needs.” Silknitter was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during his families visit to Washington, D.C. The presentation, held in Walker's Washington office, had the attendance of Silknitter's wife Darlene, and his two children, Tommy and Kathryn. They were also given a tour of the Capitol.
07.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-Okla.) led and effort to send a letter to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking him to reaffirm that no religious tests will ever be required to run for office or serve in government positions. The letter is in response to “questions asked during a recent Senate Budget Committee Hearing about an executive branch nominee’s adherence to the Christian faith, suggesting that such beliefs disqualified the nominee from service.” The video of that exchange can be seen here and above, where U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) criticizes Russ Vought, nominee to serve as Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget, for his Christian beliefs. The letter, which cites legal authority in Article VI of the United States Constitution, is signed by U.S. Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Representative Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.), Chair of the House Republican Conference, and U.S. Representative Gregg Harper (R-Miss.), Chairman of the Committee on House Administration.The letter states, in part:"While there is continuous debate about the scope and meaning of the religion clauses in the First Amendment, the text of Article VI has been clear: no religious test shall ever (emphasis added) be required as a qualification to any public office or public trust under the United States.""The free exercise of religion means the ability to practice your faith without fear of punishment by the government. The government violates that right if it determines which faith or non-faith practices are valid or which aspects of a particular faith are legitimate. As such, we urge you to make clear in your forthcoming guidance that the scope and meaning of Article VI has not changed: no religious test will ever be required to serve in the government of the United States." The full text of the letter and list of 64 signers can be found here.You can learn more about the letter in the USA Today story "Republicans ask Jeff Sessions to reaffirm no religious tests for government posts" here and learn more about the exchange between Sanders and Vought in The Atlantic story "Bernie Sanders's Religious Test for Christians in Public Office" here.
06.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today gave a speech on the House floor during debate of H.R. 3004, Kate's Law, to voice his support of the legislation as well as H.R. 3003, the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act. Both pieces of legislation passed the House of Representatives this evening.“Two years ago this weekend, Kate’s life was ended when she was gunned down by a five-time deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior felony convictions," Walker said. "Kate’s law will stiffen penalties helping to stop these preventable tragedies.""Both pieces of legislation serve the basic functions of our government by keeping people of our state and country safe from those who wish to do us harm," Walker added. The No Sanctuary For Criminals Act strengthens the law to combat dangerous policies that shield unlawful and criminal immigrants from federal immigration enforcement. Kate's Law enhances the penalties for deported felons who return to the United States. You can watch the full speech here and above, and read the full transcript below:Thank you Chairman Goodlatte. We appreciate your boldness in protecting the citizens of America with great legislation. When the father of Kate Steinle, Jim, testified before Congress he said: “Everywhere Kate went throughout the world, she shined the light of a good citizen from the United States of America. Unfortunately, due to unjointed laws and basic incompetence of the government, the United States has suffered a self-inflicted wound in the murder of our daughter by the hand of a person that should never been on the streets in this country.” Well today, we can resolve that. Two years ago this weekend, Kate’s life was ended when she was gunned down by a five-time deported criminal illegal alien with seven prior felony convictions. Kate’s law will stiffen penalties helping to stop these preventable tragedies. Additionally, the House will pass the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act as well. You just heard will Democrats participate? Well, 80% of Americans support ending sanctuary cities, and no citizen should be in danger because politicians think they are above the law. So, will democrats participate? Will the listen to their constituents? 80% of Americans feel good about this law. Both pieces of legislation serve the basic functions of our government by keeping people of our state and country safe from those who wish to do us harm. Mr. Speaker, I yield back.
06.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) this week joined U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) and 56 of his colleagues in sending a letter to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asking her to recuse herself from the "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry" Executive Order case due to her demonstrated bias against President Donald Trump. The letter was sent following the Supreme Court decision to hear International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump in October.The letter states, in part: “As an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, you are required to recuse yourself in cases in which your “impartiality might reasonably be questioned,” and where you have “a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit rested its decision in International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump on President Trump's campaign statements. The case places the personal credibility of President Trump directly at issue. Given your repeated public criticism of both candidates and President Trump, the statue is triggered and your recusal in Trump v. International Refugee Assistance Project is required by law. "Your public criticism of Donald Trump during the campaign included statements such as, "I can't imagine what this place would be–I can't imagine what the country would be–with Donald Trump as our president." You referred to Donald Trump as "a faker." When asked about the possibility of Donald Trump winning the presidency, you responded, "I don't want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs." "Additionally, friendly media outlets harshly criticized your conduct. For example, the editorial board of The New York Times found it "baffling that Justice Ginsburg would choose to...call her own commitment to impartiality into question," and wondered whether, in a case involving Mr. Trump, if anyone could "now argue with a straight face that Justice Ginsburg's only guide would be the law." "You are bound by law to recuse yourself from participation in this case. There is no doubt that your impartiality can be reasonably questioned; indeed, it would be unreasonable not to question your impartiality. Failure to recuse yourself from any such case would violate the law and undermine the credibility of the Supreme Court of the United States.”You can read the full letter here.
06.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted to reform the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) to better serve our veterans, to hold those responsible for the misconduct accountable, and to protect whistleblowers with S. 1094 - the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act – which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 368 to 55.“From the beaches of Normandy to the foothills of North Carolina, our veterans have valiantly served our nation and our community," Walker said. "They deserve better than to die on secret VA waiting lists, anticipating the care they were promised when they put their country before themselves. The Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will reform the VA to better serve our heroes and hold federal bureaucrats accountable for their unacceptable failures in caring for our nation’s veterans. As this bill goes to the President’s desk, another important promise is kept.”This legislation, having already passed the Senate, now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law. In 2014, the country was horrified as news reports came out of the Phoenix VA – and then others across the country – detailing veterans dying on secret VA waiting lists. Records were hidden, cover ups occurred, and federal employees put themselves over the lives of veterans. This was unacceptable and we can't let it happen again. The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will allow us to change course and bring accountability and better care to the VA – the care our heroes deserve. There are more than 750,000 veterans living in North Carolina, making up about ten percent of the adult population. Guilford County has the fourth highest veteran population in the state with more than 32,000. Constituents of North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District generally use one of three local VA medical centers in Durham, Fayetteville, or Salisbury.The Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act is supported by the following veterans organizations:The American Legion “This legislation, as currently written, will provide the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs the authorities to improve accountability and raise employee performance and morale. We are impressed by the speed by which Congress acted to move this critical legislation forward to the President’s desk in a bipartisan manner. We look forward to this bill becoming law.” –Charles E. Schmidt, National CommanderConcerned Veterans for America “For years a toxic culture has plagued the Department of Veterans Affairs, but the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act will be a meaningful step toward turning the troubled department around. Finally, Secretary Shulkin will be empowered with the authority to quickly remove those who under-perform, neglect patients, or even engage in criminal activity. We believe this historic piece of legislation will help usher in a new era of integrity and accountability at the department entrusted with caring for our heroes. We thank Chairman Roe, Senator Rubio, and concerned citizens across the country who pushed relentlessly to generate support from both sides of the aisle and make this reform a reality.” –Dan Caldwell, Policy DirectorIraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America “Given that the scandal in Phoenix alerted the country to the outrageous state of the VA health care system nearly three years ago, this change is long overdue. IAVA applauds the leadership of Majority Leader McCarthy and Chairman Roe to hold a House vote on the Senate-passed bill that will empower the VA to remove bad-acting employees. IAVA and our members have fought relentlessly to give the VA Secretary the tools needed to address workforce accountability and save veterans’ lives, and we are extremely pleased that final passage into law is within reach.” –IAVA Founder and CEO Paul RieckhoffParalyzed Veterans of America “No other large healthcare system rivals VA's competence to deliver specialized services at a national level, such as spinal cord injury and disease and polytrauma care, or synthesizes access to healthcare, benefits, support, and peer mentorship better than VA. But what VA needs most right now is the one 'ability' it presently lacks and can no longer be taken for granted — accountability. Whether that means better protecting whistleblowers, shortening the reprimand process, or recouping ill-gotten bonuses and relocation expenses, achieving a state of being answerable to the public, the Congress, and most importantly, veterans, will be dictated by the worst behavior the VA Secretary has to tolerate. This bill will be a major step toward having to tolerate such behavior no more." –Sherman Gillums, Executive DirectorVeterans of Foreign Wars “The VFW wants Secretary Shulkin to have the authority to manage his people in a manner expected of all senior executives, public or private. The VFW wants the secretary to weed out the nonperformers and those whose personal conduct brings doubt and dishonor upon thousands of dedicated employees. And the VFW wants this bill passed into law, because maintaining the status quo doesn’t work for those who have borne the battle.” –VFW National Commander Brian DuffyVietnam Veterans of America “Vietnam Veterans of America has been advocating strongly for much greater accountability from VA management since our founding in 1978. We have done so in public statements and countless testimonies on Capitol Hill. This statute is a real milestone in that journey; a journey that at times seemed to be a very lonely effort. We are gratified to see this day.” –John Rowan, VVA National President
06.12.2017	YANCEYVILLE, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Caswell County’s Rhonda Griffin as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for June, 2017. Each month, Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Rhonda Griffin has worked in public libraries for over 25 years, and has been the Library Director in Caswell County since 2010. She has proactively searched for ways to increase library resources and programs that directly benefit the community, with a special emphasis on the needs of young people. She’s worked hard to provide outdoor learning spaces with current technology, and has provided a teen space within the confines of a small library so that teens have a place to read, computers to use, and the opportunity to spend time in a safe, nurturing environment. Griffin also supervises Juvenile Crime Prevention Council Programs. “Rhonda has made a difference for the young people of Caswell County," Caswell County Manager Bryan Miller said. "In addition to taking the initiative to find much needed resources, she provides stability for many young children and teenagers. She gives them hope and encouragement that they can succeed and get into college and she also started a tutoring program to assist children in need.” "We thank Rhonda Griffin for her tireless service to the people of Caswell County," Walker said. "I’m inspired by her willingness to go the extra mile to make sure that our young people have everything they need for success. Her impact on the community is evident and will be seen for many years to come.” Griffin was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
06.08.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted to end taxpayer bailouts of financial institutions by supporting H.R. 10, the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017 – which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 233 to 186. “When I talk to the people of North Carolina, a common sentiment I hear is the American Dream is fading," Walker said. "This concern becomes reality driving on Front St. in Burlington or Steele St. in Sanford, observing the vanished local banks that used to serve as the epicenter of growth for our community. Burdening regulations have diminished the backbone of our local economy and the true cost can only be measured in small businesses not started, workers not hired and dreams not filled. With our vote on the Financial CHOICE Act, we can start to reverse course and upend the country’s historically slow economic recovery, while placing the stiffest penalties in history on Wall Street abuse.” In 2010 (the year the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law), North Carolina's 6th District's housed nine community banks including CommunityOne Bank in Asheboro, NewBridge Bank in Greensboro, and Mid-Carolina Bank in Burlington. Today, that number is only two as Dodd-Frank regulations have forced closures and mergers across North Carolina. In fact, community banks are closing at a national rate of one per day. Meanwhile, the five largest banks in the country have grown their domestic assets by more than 40 percent during the same time. Instead of fixing the causes at the center of the 2008 financial crisis, the 2,300-plus page Dodd-Frank bill codified into law “too big to fail” and taxpayer-funded bailouts. And instead of being tough on Wall Street, it put many local banks out of business because they did not have the resources to navigate the expansive and costly regulations. The effect has been seen in communities nationwide. Dodd-Frank has also been noted as a major cause of our ongoing economic recovery – which is the slowest and weakest in 70 years. The Financial CHOICE Act reins in Dodd-Frank and gives local banks and small businesses an opportunity for success. The bill would protect taxpayers from paying for more Wall Street bailouts, forcing failing banks and financial institutions to go through bankruptcy like any other company. The Financial CHOICE Act also holds Wall Street accountable by imposing the toughest penalties for financial fraud in history. Additionally, the bill cuts the deficit by $33.6 billion over 10 years. Small, community banks account for 54 percent of small business loans across the country. Small businesses make up 64 percent of net new private sector jobs. By empowering community banks, the Financial CHOICE Act will help grow jobs and the economy in North Carolina.
06.01.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Ted Budd (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and two other members of the North Carolina congressional delegation sent a letter urging the Chairman of the Internal Trade Commission (ITC) to consider the North Carolina manufacturing jobs at stake before making a ruling in a patent infringement dispute between Diebold-Nixdorf, an American manufacturer of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs), and Hyosung, a Korean ATM maker. Budd and Walker released the following statement after sending the letter to the United States International Trade Commission Chairman Rhonda K. Schmidtlein: “What this letter is about is whether or not a foreign company will be able to use legal gymnastics in order to hurt a U.S. company that employs more than 150 people in Greensboro,” said Budd. “What I’ve tried to underline for the International Trade Commission is that if they rule in favor of the foreign company, it would have a major negative impact on an American company’s ability to compete. That, in turn, would jeopardize manufacturing jobs in our state. Free trade means everyone has to play by the rules, not twist the law into a pretzel to gain a competitive advantage.” “The government cannot get involved in picking winners and losers in our economy – especially when those decisions hurt our small businesses in North Carolina,” said Walker.“Preventing Diebold from selling and manufacturing their products in the United States would be devastating to the North Carolinians who depend on the company for jobs and economic growth.”
06.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) last week introduced the Bettering Resources In Guarding from Human Trafficking (BRIGHT) Act. This legislation establishes minimum sentences for those convicted of Federal human trafficking crimes. The bill introduction was made during Combating Trafficking and Child Protection Week in Congress.The BRIGHT Act comes after Congressman Walker’s successful efforts to combat human trafficking through H.R. 460, Human Trafficking Detection Act, which passed the House last year and was signed into law as part of S. 178, Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. It also follows feedback from meetings in North Carolina’s 6th District with law enforcement agencies and organizations working to fight human trafficking. Walker originally introduced the BRIGHT Act during the 114th Congress.“Human trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time,” Walker said. “ It destroys, enslaves and exploits human life. This abhorrent crime needs to be treated with the seriousness it deserves.”“I am grateful for the progress we have made to combat human trafficking locally and nationally – but it’s not enough,” Walker added. “Life is invaluable and we must do all we can to protect it at every stage.”This bill is part of an effort of overall sentencing reform to ensure that crimes are treated with the seriousness they deserve. For some, this means reducing proposed sentences. For others, like human trafficking, it means treating them as the serious crimes that they are.You can read the full text of the legislation here.

05.18.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) this week honored Greensboro’s Jodi Lorenzo-Shibley as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for March, 2017. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Jodi Lorenzo-Schibley is the Chief Executive Director and Executive Director of Sanctuary House, which houses a psychiatric rehabilitation program for adults with mental illness. She has been with Sanctuary House since its inception. Under her able leadership, it has become a place that serves more than 70 individuals a day through a variety of programming options. Additionally, Jodi is also very involved in the community. She serves on many boards and committees that focus on mental health and economic development. You can learn more about Jodi here in an article in the Triad Business Journal honoring her as one of the "40 Leaders Under Forty" The recognition did not deter her mission though. Jodi's nominator writes, "for her it wasn’t about a recognition personally, but rather to facilitate greater communication surrounding mental health. She has been able to leverage this prestigious award to continue to raise community awareness. Additionally, this accolade for Sanctuary House increased opportunities for funding and building greater credibility for the nonprofit." “Jodi is an inspiring example of how one person can change many lives," Walker said. "She is a tireless advocate for the needs of individuals with mental illness, and is an important voice for some of the most vulnerable in North Carolina. She plays an important role in our community, and is facilitating much-needed conversations about mental health.” Jodi was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
05.12.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today announced a week-long event to show appreciation for law enforcement officers in North Carolina for the celebration of National Police Week.

05.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted to repeal and replace Obamacare by supporting H.R. 1628 , the American Health Care Act (AHCA) – which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 217 to 213.“For too long, North Carolinians have anxiously opened envelopes to find that their health insurance has been cancelled or they have watched their premiums skyrocket because of Obamacare," Walker said. "For long enough, families have sat around kitchen tables, struggling to decide between paying for health insurance they cannot afford to use or a tax penalty they cannot escape. These cries for relief from Obamacare could not be ignored." “It’s time that voters who have poured to the polls for the last several elections – rewarding Republicans with historic majorities – were heard," Walker added. "It’s time the less fortunate and those who struggle with pre-existing health conditions were given legitimate options, not a one-size-fits-all mandate. It’s time to fix the broken government policies that have crippled our health-care system for decades. It’s finally time we keep our promise to repeal Obamacare and provide relief. Today, we took the first big step to keeping that promise.”Walker's support for the AHCA follows weeks of negotiations between the House ofRepresentatives and the White House that resulted in constructive amendments being added.The Wall Street Journal said the AHCA "would be the most consequential GOP social-policy reform since the welfare overhaul of 1996… it starts to correct many of the government created dysfunctions that have bedeviled U.S. health care for decades."National Review noted “the bill as it stands would abolish Obamacare’s fines on people without health insurance, reduce taxes and spending, reform Medicaid by moving it closer to federalist principles, and open the door to deregulation in states that choose to pursue it.” The AHCA repeals Obamacare taxes and provides nearly $1 trillion in tax relief for families. It repeals many of Obamacare’s mandates that have increased premiums and cost. The legislation also protects life by defunding Planned Parenthood and ensuring that taxpayer dollars don’t go to funding abortions. Instead, it redirects the money to community health centers that offer more comprehensive services.The legislation will now move to the Senate, where under rules for a reconciliation legislation, the vote total required to file cloture is a simple majority rather than thetraditional 60-vote threshold. Prior to voting for the AHCA, the House passed H.R. 2192 , "To amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non-application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of Congress and congressional staff," with the support of Walker. Walker is a co-sponsor of H.R. 2192, which would eliminate the ability for members of Congress and staff to be exempt from the AHCA.
05.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted in favor of H.R. 2192 , "To amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate the non-application of certain State waiver provisions to Members of Congress and congressional staff." This bill passed the House of Representatives unanimously and would eliminate the ability for members of Congress and staff to be exempt from the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Walker is a co-sponosor of H.R. 2191. The legislation, introduced by U.S. Representative Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), can be read here. “This is common sense,” Walker said. “We’re going to make sure that members of Congress are under the same rules as our constituents. Washington cannot exempt itself from the laws it expects the people of North Carolina to follow."
05.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement in response to the passage of the fiscal year 2017 omnibus spending bill: “Today, I voted against the $1.1 trillion-plus omnibus spending bill. Even with unified Republican government, Congress is failing to get our federal spending under control. “This omnibus spending bill is not without a few redeeming characteristics. Conservatives are relieved Congress refused to appropriate funds for the Obamacare cost-sharing reduction program and hope the administration will not violate the rule of law and the Constitution by respecting Congress’s decision to deny funding it. Conservatives are also reassured that increases to defense spending are not paired with dollar-for-dollar increases to non-defense discretionary spending. We temper our enthusiasm, however, with the recognition that these issues shouldn’t be in question with unified Republican government. “We, however, must not ignore the pattern of behavior. For nearly twenty years, the federal government has failed to pass a budget resolution and twelve appropriations bills. Budget and appropriations deadlines are, at best, regularly missed or, at worst, ignored. Unfortunately, this omnibus spending bill is pay dirt for progressive priorities – maintaining Obama-era levels of federal spending, funding Planned Parenthood and Obamacare and bailing out Puerto Rico's Medicaid program. This is what happens in a last-minute scramble to push through a 1,749-page spending bill that was produced behind closed doors. “When voters chose unified Republican government in November, they didn't bargain for Republicans ushering through an omnibus bill that keeps Obama-era spending priorities alive. Instead, Republicans should start governing like the conservative majority party the American people elected them to be. We can and must do better for fiscal year 2018.”
05.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and U.S. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) led the effort in a letter sent to Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint. The letter expresses gratitude to DeMint saying, "For the last two decades you have served faithfully as a leading advocate for America at its best.

05.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) last week reached out to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to ask for their support in maintaining the federal Pell Grant program, and to help establish year-round access to Pell Grants. In a letter, Walker and Scott wrote, “The Pell Grant is a vital resource for expanding access and affordability to higher education for some of America’s most vulnerable and non-traditional students. In AY2013-2014, roughly 83% of Pell Grant recipients came from a household earning $30,000 or less annually…. Access to Pell Grants is particularly important to students attending Historically Black Colleges (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSI’s). Around 70% of students attending an HBCU in 2017 will do so using a Pell Grant…”You can read the full letter here.
04.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today co-sponsored legislation that would eliminate the ability for members of Congress and staff to be exempt from the American Health Care Act (AHCA).“This is common sense,” Walker said. “We’re going to make sure that members of Congress are under the same rules as our constituents. Washington cannot exempt itself from the laws it expects the people of North Carolina to follow." On Wednesday, it was reported that a new amendment to the AHCA "exempts members of Congress and their staff" from health care changes. The legislation, introduced by U.S. Representative Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), can be read here. According to a release from McSally, "to comply with procedural requirements, Rep. McSally’s simple, two-page bill would repeal the section exempting members of Congress and congressional staff from these waivers if American Health Care Act becomes law. Rep. McSally has worked closely with Republican leadership who committed that this bill will be voted on in conjunction with the AHCA."
04.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement upon the Senate's 54-45 vote to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the United States Supreme Court:“As a candidate, Donald Trump promised to nominate a justice in the mold of the great Antonin Scalia. It is clear he kept that promise. Through this long process, Neil Gorsuch has shown humility, grace, and a steadfast commitment to constitutional principles. I am hopeful that these traits will guide Gorsuch’s time on the court and that he will be a consistent voice for limited government. "His confirmation is not a victory for a political party, but a victory for our nation and the rule of law.”
03.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today praised President Trump's Energy Independence Executive Order that reverses many of the most expensive and burdensome regulations on American jobs and energy production."North Carolinians are facing increases in their energy bills and their groceries because of an out-of-control regulatory system that disregards any unintended consequences their rule-making has on low and middle-income families," Walker said. "I want to protect America's natural treasures for generations to come; however, that doesn’t mean disregarding common sense and facts. I applaud President Trump for striking these burdensome rules and supporting an all-of-the-above energy approach that promotes innovation." "It is our responsibility to promote policies that deliver clean air and water, alongside strong economic growth and job creation," Walker added.The executive order directs the Environmental Protection Agency to suspend, revise, or rescind four actions related to the Clean Power Plan that would stifle the American energy industry. According to NERA Economic Consulting, the Obama Administration’s Clean Power Plan could cost up to $39 billion a year and increase electricity prices in 41 States by at least ten percent. It also lifts the ban on federal leasing for coal production, and takes away job-killing restrictions on the production of oil, natural gas, clean coal, and shale energy.
03.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today introduced a resolution to establish a Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. H.Res. 219, Establishing a Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs would utilize existing U.S. House of Representatives funds to establish a select committee. The committee members, appointed by the Speaker of the House, would be tasked with investigating all unresolved matters related to any United States personnel unaccounted for from conflicts ranging from World War II to the War on Terror. Currently, there are more than 75,000 unaccounted for Americans from these conflicts. The video above briefly highlights the story of C.R. "Bud" Shepherd of Graham, North Carolina. Shepherd enlisted in the U.S. Army on his 18th birthday in 1943. During World War II, Shepherd was an Air Corpsman, Sergeant, and tail gunner on a B-17 in the 751st Squadron. After German fire brought down his plane, Shepherd was captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in Stalag Luft 1 in Barth on November 30, 1944. He was freed on May 1, 1945. Since then, Shepherd came home to Graham and has dedicated his life to honoring men and women who served our country through his REAch Wounded Veterans Program. In the video, Shepherd, speaking about POWs, said "these guys should not be forgotten. They’re the ones who created our freedoms."As noted in the video, not all of our heroes were as blessed as Mr. Shepherd. That is why Walker introduced H.Res. 219 today."We are all proud of Bud Shepherd, his heroism and his continued service to our nation and those who fought to protect it," Walker said. "While we celebrate the return of our servicemen and servicewomen, we must also take the time to remember our heroes who are still unaccounted for. We can only begin to fathom the questions and unthinkable anguish that their families still face. As Mr. Shepherd said, these men and women fought to secure our freedoms, and we cannot let them be forgotten.""I am proud to introduce this resolution to create a Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs," Walker added. "These families have sacrificed a great deal for us. This small act can go lengths in honoring our POWs and MIAs and to provide their families closure." The full text of the resolution can be found here.
03.16.2017	GRAHAM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today honored George White, a World War II veteran from Haw River, N.C. Members of Walker's staff presented White a flag flown above the U.S. Capitol Building in his honor. The small ceremony with White’s family and friends was held at Walker's district office in Graham. White just celebrated his 100th birthday. “We have so much to thank our Greatest Generation for,” Walker said. “They answered the call of duty to protect our nation and our freedoms and then they came home and help build the great nation we live in today. As we look onward to preserve our inherited prosperity and liberty for future generations, it is also important to take time to remember the past and the great men and women who got us here.”“George White is a hometown representation of those ideals,” Walker added. “Though only a small token of our appreciation for his service and sacrifice, we were proud to present him an American flag flown over the Capitol. The same flag he fought honorably to protect.” George Henry White was born on February 2, 1917 in Manhattan, N.Y. In 1934, he graduated from St. Patrick’s Catholic School in Catskill, N.Y. Not long after, he joined the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). While with the CCC he performed recreation and landscaping work projects including planting trees, constructing playgrounds, and forming the beaches of lakes at campgrounds. On May 30, 1941, after a couple of years of courtship, White married Lillian Margaret Johansen at the St. Joseph's Church of the Palisades in West New York, N.J. Not long after, the United States would enter World War II. White was drafted into the United States Army on September 24, 1942 and completed his basic training at Fort Dix. With his prior knowledge of vehicles, he worked as a Coast Auxiliary Corps mechanic. In March 1943, George arrived overseas in Africa and from there went to Italy, which was part of the European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign. White was honorably discharged from the United States Army on August 11, 1945 and sent a Western Union telegram to Lillian that read: “Roll out the barrel coming home will arrive Thursday. Love, George.” He received the following awards/medals: Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with single bronze star, World War II Victory Medal, Honorable Service Lapel Button WWII, Sharpshooter Badge and Machine Gun Bar, & Marksman Badge and Rifle Bar. After the war, George and Lillian moved to Palenville, N.Y. to raise their two children and the additional five children they would eventually have. In the 1970’s they would move to the warmer temperatures of Florida, but travel to New York to visit family. Then in the 1980’s, one last move, George and Lillian settled in Haw River, North Carolina, still able to travel to New York and Florida. In addition to their seven children, they have 17 grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.
03.13.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today released the following statement in response to the reported KKK rally planned for May in Randolph County:“I despise bringing any awareness to such despicable behavior; however, such hate needs to be rebuked. The KKK rally planned for May in Randolph County is a reminder of the hateful ideologies that exists within a minuscule group. “The Scriptures state 'anyone who hates a brother or sister is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness. They do not know where they are going, because the darkness has blinded them.’ This darkness is saturated in ignorance, denying that God has created every man, woman, boy and girl uniquely with exceptional skills and talent. “The rally may be constitutional, but this group's message and legacy are an affront to our core value that all people are created equal. I would hope the people of North Carolina reject this behavior not with violence, but with actions that represent genuine love for all in our community.”
03.10.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) this week honored Chatham County’s Mary Dickerson as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for March, 2017. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Mary Dickerson has been involved with Chatham County 4-H for many years, and has selflessly given her time to serve as a club volunteer leader, advisory council member, and equine educational contest coach. 4-H is an organization that teaches club members life skills through meetings and educational competitions. Ms. Dickerson has been a positive role model and inspiration to countless youth as they learn important skills such as decision-making, problem solving, communication, and teamwork.“Mary has helped instill confidence in young people, encouraged them to step out of their comfort area to pursue new adventures, and has helped turn young people into true leaders for our community,” Extension Agent Ginger Cunningham said. “Mary Dickerson is an excellent example of how one person can make a difference in the lives of young people,” Walker said. “She’s been willing to step in and donate her time, talent and treasure to teach important values and skills. Most of all, Chatham County 4-H participants know that they have a true friend in Mary, and I’m grateful for the positive role model she has been to so many.” Ms. Dickerson was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. She is pictured above on the left.
03.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) and Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) hosted an engaging and productive discussion with Presidents and Chancellors from 89 Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) on Tuesday in an event called the HBCU Fly-In. Despite some reported disappointment with the level of discussion at an event the previous day hosted at the White House, the HBCU Fly-In left Presidents and Chancellors impressed and encouraged. The attendees also noted being uplifted by the wide Republican support for year-round Pell Grants. "I was very impressed with Representative Walker and Senator Scott,” Aaron Thompson, Interim President of Kentucky State University told The State Journal following the event. “The genuineness they were bringing to the table made me feel like they were going to do something to benefit these valuable institutions. They were much more than willing to visit.” Inside Higher Ed reported: "Dillard University President Walter Kimbrough in a Medium post said the Oval Office trip scuttled other plans to meet with the heads of several federal agencies in addition to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. That meant 'there was very little listening to HBCU presidents,' he said." "That was a common refrain among presidents in attendance at the HBCU “Fly-In” hosted by Walker and Scott." "But Kimbrough spent Tuesday on Capitol Hill, speaking in depth with congressional leaders," the New Republic reported. "'[Tuesday] actually was really good,' Kimbrough told me after huddling with lawmakers at the Library of Congress. He praised the daylong HBCU summit—hosted by Senator Tim Scott and Representative Mark Walker, both Republicans—where House Speaker Paul Ryan voiced support for expanding Pell Grants." “The HBCU Fly-In offered a significant opportunity for HBCU leaders to engage in constructive dialogue with federal policymakers and the corporate world about the crucial issues our institutions and students face," Marsha V. Krotseng, Ed.D., President of Bluefield State College said in a statement. "My thanks to Congressman Mark Walker and Senator Tim Scott for this historic convening of HBCU presidents and for opening doors that we hope will lead to productive and lasting partnerships. I was proud to be a participant in initiating these important conversations." "The HBCU Fly-In gave me a wonderful opportunity to connect with the HBCU Bipartisan Congressional Caucus and the Republican Study Committee and provide valuable insight into issues facing HBCU law schools," Chancellor John Pierre from Southern University Law Center said in a statement. "I had an opportunity to provide congressional leaders with information as to why HBCU law schools are invaluable assets in ensuring that the American Bar Association (ABA) achieves one of its most important goals; diversifying the legal profession." “I have always valued the importance of HBCUs. With more than 100 HBCUs across the nation – and eleven here in North Carolina, they are an integral part of our higher education system,” Walker said. “On a more personal note, my wife, Kelly, is a graduate of Winston-Salem State University and has found success as a nurse practitioner, which she attributes in part to the strong education she received. I believe it is as important as ever to have Republicans engage with HBCUs. On Tuesday we made big strides to bring bipartisan support to HBCUs and create an open dialogue to address issues they face. I look forward to continuing to work together for the betterment of our students. This is not the first step, but it certainly is not the last.” A full list of the attendees and the schools they represent can be found here. A full list of the schedule, speakers and panelists, which includes Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), Rep. Bradley Byrne (R-Ala.), Rep.

02.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today joined Elizabeth Prann from America's News Headquarters on Fox News to discuss his Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) speech, Republican party outreach, Obamacare replacement, and the 2017 conservative agenda. You can watch Walker's interview above and read excerpts from the interview below:On his CPAC speech: “Part of our message is to make sure that we’re our message to new communities. It’s very easy to talk to our base, but our discipline, our calling, is to talk about individual liberty and opportunity with all of our communities.”On Obamacare replacement: “We want to make sure though, as we move forward that we are not creating a fourth column of long-term entitlements, that is incumbent on the middle class to pay for.” “We want to make sure we are providing individual options for everyone’s health care and allow them to make the choices instead of federal mandates.”On expanding the Republican Party and support for conservative policies: “In any other aspect of life – whether it’s ministry, business, or politics – you start with the investments in relationships. You build trust. And sometimes you have to do that before you introduce policy for people to understand that you do have the very concerns at their heart in your best interest. If we start with that, I believe we have a chance to make some more successes.”On opportunities ahead: “This is our time to lead, but we must deliver for the American people.”
02.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today gave a speech at the American Conservative Union's Conservative Political Action Conference where he talked about the opportunities that lie ahead for the Republican Party and our nation. He also challenged the audience to listen to people with opposing views, and to work hard to share the conservative message of economic prosperity and upward mobility with new communities. "Make time for those who disagree with you. It’s easy to preach to the choir, but we must take our message to new places, to new neighborhoods and new communities. Learn to listen," Walker said. "Hold your leaders accountable, but remember your fellow man is not your enemy. Whether democrat, muslim, minorities, or those who identify with the LGBTQ community, why? Because every American deserves the opportunity to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Even those that are unborn." "Here is the great thing. We have the truth," Walker added. "Over the last several decades, the progressive movement has failed our society, giving us the opportunity to serve and to lead. Rise above. Lead with class and character. And passionately run to those who have suffered under the over-bearing and abusive arm of the federal government."Walker also encouraged the attendees to focus on the right tone when engaging in politics. "The best policy in the world, if no one hears it, if no one sees it, if it never reaches our audience, than it’s worthless and it’s futile," he said. "Effective conservatism starts with the right policy, but to be successful in the long-term, it must have the right approach and the right voice. Tone matters. Love the people."You can watch Walker's remarks above and read them in full below:"Well good afternoon, since it’s after 12:00 now. Thank you to CPAC’s Chairman Matt Schlapp, certainly Mercedes, the board of directors, and most of all to all you attendees, now in your third full day. Thank you for coming from all parts of the country. "It is an honor to be with you today and I am privileged to serve as the Republican Study Committee Chairman. "I rely simply not on my long history of political pedigrees, but rather on my own real life experiences as a pastor. As well as my time in business and finance. I lead from what I have learned as a husband, a father, a son, and a brother. You see, I have only been serving in Congress a little more than 25 months, but it’s the experience that I encountered in working with people from all walks of life, that drive my work here in Washington or in my home state of North Carolina. "As a pastor for nearly 17 years, I was blessed to work with students and families. Yet, over that time, I have witnessed the spiraling fiscal and social conditions that have negatively impacted so many people. "As a minister, I saw first hand leading students and millennials into forsaken neighborhoods. Places like Cleveland, New York, and Baltimore. I still remember asking the leader of a non-profit group from a group we were working with there in Cleveland. And I asked him what is it that our team of 60 or 70 people, what is it that we can bring to you? I remember his answer very distinctly and very specifically. He said ‘please bring hope.’ "You see President Obama talked much about hope and how he wanted to fundamentally change the future of our country. The facts are this, this brand of change didn’t make us stronger, in fact we are weaker because of failed promises with our economy, our education, our healthcare, our military and defense. "In fact, in North Carolina, homeownership among our minority communities are down for 9 years in a row. But like many of you, I see a different kind of hope in the numbers. "With a Donald Trump and Mike Pence administration, we are fast-tracking the process to a better America. "But it wasn’t just what happened this past November in our presidential election. It’s a movement that has been brewing for the last several years. "Listen to these numbers. We had 3 million more people voting for Republicans than we did Democrats this past Congress. That’s a good thing. "But think about it from a historical concept. In 1913, the House of Representatives went from 394 to 435. Not since that time, until the last two Congresses have we ever elected 240 Republicans in back-to-back. And you know, I think it is time to give credit where credit is due. People like Nancy Pelosi. Now, I don’t want to make Nancy Pelosi the complete scape goat here, but I do believe that it is fitting to give her a round of applause for her help in this process is it not? Thank you Nancy! "But her is the truth, this growing hope, didn’t begin in Congress. The winds that have begun to unfurl the sails of this great nation, started in our grassroots level. People like you, in our towns, our factories, our places of worship, our ball fields, with families and hard-working Americans who simply said we’ve had enough. "Many of you are part of this change. You have worked your butts off to change the course of our future and here is the proof. In 2009, there were 28 Democratic governors, anybody want to take a guess at how many now? 16. In all, Democrats have lost over 1,000 seats across our nation. They now control only 31 of the 98 state legislatures. That’s to your hard work. "Why is that? I think the answer is pretty simple. Big government policies have not yielded economic opportunity and upward mobility. Instead, they have trapped two generations in a growing dependency on government. I believe that God created every man and woman and boy and girl with special skills, a uniqueness, great abilities. Government has created systems that doesn’t help people flourish, but literally diminishes and alters the very best for their lives. "The time for good policies for a great America is now. It is with urgency that our unified Republican government deliver on promises. Promised to repeal and replace Obamacare with patient-centered healthcare choices, not additional entitlements. We must deliver on tax reform that creates new life blood into our economy. We must beat back the power-grabbing regulations and we must protect our religious liberties no matter the cost. "Some of you may remember the tornadoes that did great destructive damage to Moore, Oklahoma some 5 or 6 years ago. I can remember the joint simulcast between NBC and CBS News that evening. And as the news came on, Brian Williams said this, ‘If you are waiting on the federal government you may be waiting a while, but the Baptist men are already here. These religious institutions and non-profits need protection. They are the ones doing the work, they are the ones holding the hand of the addicted. They are the ones rescuing the trafficked. We must continue to fight for the religious liberties. "Well, we have talked about the what, we have discussed the why, allow me to close today with the how. And this may not be the most red-meat speech that you have heard but it is very important. Listen to me today. The best policy in the world, if no one hears it, if no one sees it, if it never reaches our audience, than it’s worthless and it’s futile. "Effective conservatism starts with the right policy, but to be successful in the long-term, it must have the right approach and the right voice. Tone matters. Love the people. Let’s be honest, it took a few years for our nation’s words to match our actions – that all men are created equal. But your generation, you see without discrimination and without prejudice. "Make time for those who disagree with you. It’s easy to preach to the choir, but we must take our message to new places, to new neighborhoods and new communities. Learn to listen. There is real pain and real fear out there. Hold your leaders accountable, but remember your fellow man is not your enemy. Whether democrat, muslim, minorities, or those who identify with the LGBTQ community, why? Because every American deserves the opportunity to pursue life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Even those that are unborn. "Here is the great thing. We have the truth. Over the last several decades, the progressive movement has failed our society, giving us the opportunity to serve and to lead. "Rise above. Lead with class and character. And passionately run to those who have suffered under the over-bearing and abusive arm of the federal government. Along the way, you will have to preserve, because there will be adversity. There will be sacrifice. It will cost you something. Many of your peers may sit back and sneer and mock that you are even in the political arena. However, you are there heroes because you are serving without fame or fortune. "Arthur Ashe said it this way, ’True heroism is remarkably sober. Very undramatic, it is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve all others at whatever the cost.’ "My friends, do more than make an argument, make a difference. May God provide the path, and may we have the courage to follow. God bless and thank you very much."

02.15.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Rockingham County’s 1SG(R) David Bray as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for February, 2017. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Bray is the Senior Army Instructor at Morehead High School in Eden, NC. He retired from the U.S. Army after 20 years of service, and has been a JROTC instructor for ten years. He is also a Youth Minister at Word of Life Tabernacle Church. Of special note is that Bray’s students contacted Congressman Walker and nominated him for this award. “I have multiple older siblings who were also cadets in this program," student Destiny Fish said. "I have witnessed firsthand how caring and selfless Bray truly is. He impacted each of our lives in a different way. I truly believe that each and every one of his students would say he deserves this honor!” “Bray is a prime example of living a life of service to others, whether it was serving in our nation’s military or shaping today’s young people to become citizens of character, purpose, and honor,” Walker said. “I extend my thanks to him for his many years of service to the community of Eden and beyond." Bray was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. Below is an image showing Bray with some of his students:
02.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) on Wednesday, February 8th, announced that he – with U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) – would be hosting a daylong conference with Presidents and Chancellors of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) at the Library of Congress on Tuesday, February 28th. Following is a summary of news coverage: Greensboro News and Record: A new champion for HBCUs? "In her place, a new champion seems to have emerged: Rep. Mark Walker, the Greensboro Republican." "Walker appears to be doing more than talking the talk here. His wife, Kelly, got her nursing degree from Winston-Salem State, the HBCU in Winston-Salem. Walker was on the A&T campus for its 100th birthday bash last spring. He joined the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus, which now has 58 members from both parties and both houses. And he and Adams last summer started a new internship program where their two congressional offices share interns from HBCUs in their districts." "Some heavy hitters have confirmed for Walker's Feb. 28 event. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina is the co-host along with Walker. Sen. Marco Rubio and House Speaker Paul Ryan are going. So is Rep. Bradley Byrne, the former Alabama community college system leader and co-chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus; and Johnny Taylor, the Thurgood Marshall Foundation president." ABC News: GOP Lawmakers to Meet With Leaders of Black Colleges "Republicans are planning to meet with leaders of historically black colleges and universities in the nation's capital to discuss ways to help the schools survive in challenging times. "The meeting, spearheaded by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, will bring leaders from the nation's 100-plus HBCUs to the Library of Congress on Feb. 28 to meet with Republican officials and supporters and discuss ways for the colleges and universities to work with the federal government and corporations."
01.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) led a letter to President Trump encouraging him to remove Commissioner of Internal Revenue John Koskinen. The letter, which cites legal authority in 26 U.S.C. § 7803, is signed by U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), Chairman of the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee, U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), Chairman of the House Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, and 49 other House conservatives."The privileged and well-connected should not get to live and work by another standard, Walker said. "There is overwhelming evidence IRS Commissioner John Koskinen failed in performing his duties and misled Congress. The American people deserve accountability in government. That starts with removing Koskinen from his post and we hope President Trump will move to dismiss him expediently." The full text of the letter and the full list of 53 signers can be seen here and below: January 30, 2017 Dear President Trump, The consideration of the impeachment of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen in the House in late 2016 was a clear indication that Congress and the American people have no confidence in Commissioner Koskinen or his ability to discharge his duties. The IRS, through its targeting of citizens for their political beliefs, has forfeited the trust of a free people. The IRS has admitted to improperly targeting conservative groups, delaying applications for tax-exempt status from 2010-2012, with at least 75 groups selected for extra scrutiny. Moreover, in August 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the IRS had yet to demonstrate that officials have definitively ceased targeting conservative groups. The ruling came at the heels of evidence that two targeted conservative groups continued to have delayed applications for tax-exempt status pending at the IRS. Congressional investigations, hearings, and actions have shown that Commissioner Koskinen misled Congress, obstructed investigations into the IRS, and failed to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Commissioner Koskinen’s willful deception and obstructionism has only further eroded any remaining confidence. Pursuant to 26 U.S.C. § 7803, you have the authority to remove Commissioner Koskinen. We encourage you to dismiss him in the most expedient manner practicable. Such an action would restore the credibility of our Federal tax authority and the faith the American people have in their Constitutional rights to free speech and association. Sincerely, Rep. Mark Walker (NC-06) Rep. Jason Chaffetz (UT-03) Rep. Ted Budd (NC-13) Rep. Bradley Byrne (AL-01) Rep. Paul Gosar (AZ-04) Rep. Mike Rogers (AL-03) Rep. Steve King (IA-04) Rep.

Mark Walker, R-N.C., will make the ask.”THE HILL: RSC chairman urges Trump to dismiss IRS chief“Republican Study Committee Chairman Mark Walker (R-N.C.) is circulating a letter to his colleagues urging President Trump to fire IRS Commissioner John Koskinen. “‘Such an action would restore the credibility of our Federal tax authority and the faith the American people have in their Constitutional rights to free speech and association,’ the letter states.”
01.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today requested that an American flag be flown over the United States Capitol Building to honor the thousands of 2017 March for Life participants. “The declaration that gave birth to our nation proclaimed God granted us with three unalienable rights, the first and most important of which is life," Walker said. "Without life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are unattainable. To the thousands of pro-life Americans marching and standing for the defenseless, thank you. You are a voice for the voiceless. You are not in this fight alone, and your impact is felt in our hometowns, in Washington, and around the world.” The certification of this flag reads: "This is to certify that the accompanying flag was flown over the United States Capitol on January 27, 2017. At the request of the Honorable Mark Walker, Member of Congress, this flag was flown in honor of the March for Life 2017 participants. Thank you for being a voice for the voiceless." Above is a picture of the flag flying above the Capitol in honor of the March for Life.
01.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) yesterday introduced the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act (A-PLUS), a bill that would empower parents, teachers and local administrators to better address the needs of students and schools in their communities. "This week, we celebrate national school choice and the boundless potential of every American child," Walker said. "We also recognize North Carolina – and the many other states – who have championed education reforms that are unlocking abundant opportunities for our children." “Innovation starts in our communities, not in Washington," Walker added. "A-PLUS will restore local control and empower parents and teachers to help ensure each child has access to a quality education and the possibility to achieve their dreams.” A-PLUS aims to restore state and local control of education by giving them the option to decline participation in the prescriptive and onerous requirements of federal education programs and focus that funding on solutions that meet their community needs. The bill also allows states to consolidate funding for any or all programs that are authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). You can read the full text of the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success Act (A-PLUS) here. The introduction of this legislation follows Walker's efforts in the 114th Congress with a similar amendment to H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. The amendment was narrowly rejected by a vote of 195-235 in July of 2015.
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today gave the keynote address at the launch event for The Heritage Foundation's Center for Education Policy. He also announced that later today he will be re-introducing the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) Act. Education should not be a partisan issue." Walker said. "I can’t think of any other issue that is greater than education and our children when it comes to bipartisanship." "As you approach this building from the northwest, coming from Union Station, you notice a not-so-subtle banner that continues to hang from the roof," Walker added. "It reads ‘FREEDOM. OPPORTUNITY. PROSPERITY.’ But if you think about it, it is really consequential in that order as well. Because without freedom there is no opportunity. Without opportunity there is no prosperity. And without prosperity the American Dream begins to dissipate to a place where it becomes obsolete. Without a quality education, none of these liberties are attainable."Walker also announced the re-introduction of the A-PLUS Act. "[A-PLUS] restores education decision making to state and local leaders who are better positioned to make those informed decisions about the needs of their schools in their communities." Walker said. "The reason I am excited about this is that I think we are really close to going across the threshold and making this a reality."This announcement follows Walker's efforts in the 114th Congress to return control of education back to states and local communities with the introduction of the A-PLUS amendment to H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. The amendment was narrowly rejected by a vote of 195-235 in July of 2015.You can learn more about the event and the Center for Education Policy here. You can watch Walker's remarks above and read them in full below:"Thank you James and thank you Heritage Foundation for having me here today to celebrate the opening of the Center for Education Policy, something that is very needed in our generation and certainly in our political times. The opening of this center affirms once again, the Heritage Foundation’s commitment to better education for our children, an issue intimately linked to the future of our nation. "As you approach this building from the northwest, coming from Union Station, you notice a not-so-subtle banner that continues to hang from the roof. It reads ‘FREEDOM. OPPORTUNITY. PROSPERITY.’ But if you think about it it is really consequential in that order as well. Because without freedom there is no opportunity. Without opportunity there is no prosperity. And with prosperity the American Dream begins to dissipate to a place where it becomes obsolete. Without a quality education, none of these liberties are attainable. "Well that then raises the question, maybe the ultimate question, is who is better equipped to provide for education in the future? Specifically in the arena of our children. Bureaucrats, or decision makers in Washington, or is it the states, the parents and the local communities. As conservatives we know that children succeed when parents and teachers are empowered, not the bureaucracies or the politicians. "Education should not be a partisan issue. Let me say that again. Education should not be a partisan issue. In fact, interestingly enough, we hear much talk in Washington, D.C. of always looking for something that is generated out of a bipartisan heart. I can’t think of any other issue that is greater than education and our children when it comes to bipartisanship. You know I was sad even this past weekend, we were reviewing some of the things and the Saturday marches. "Some of the marches and I won’t get into all the specific signs, I decided to look up the official website of the women’s march and what is was all about. There was eight initiatives. One on ending violence, reproductive rights, LGBTQIA right, worker’s rights, civil rights, disability rights, immigrant rights, environmental justice. Well there is a gross injustice in that platform. Nowhere is education even ever mentioned. And I thought about that, how sad of an opportunity for people, obviously with different perspectives, to march on such a historic weekend, yet not even have the gravitas or inclusion to be able to talk about education or the importance of where it is. That is something I was very troubled about. It is one of the most important American issues. But as we know, the current system has been failing our children for some time. "I was doing just a smidgen of research. I was looking at specially and I have a chart here, of where the Department of Education spends all their dollars. It’s amazing. Nearly $72 billion, to be exact $71,699,000,000, department management $598 million, the Institute for Education Sciences $618 million, citizenship education $245 million, the list goes on and on. Yet, we have seen after decades, there is no improvement, no measured improvement when it comes to the education of our children. So why is A-PLUS Act important? "I’ll tell you why. It empowers the states and communities to make the education decisions. To put it this way there is four major points. One, it restores education decision making to state and local leaders who are better positioned to make those informed decisions about the needs of their schools in their communities. Number two, it allows states to consolidate funding for any or all programs that are authorized under ESEA. Three, it reduces bureaucracy and increases transparency of student outcomes by redirecting accountability to parents and taxpayers, not Washington bureaucrats as we stated. And number four, it reduces federal intervention in education, to be more consistent with Washington’s ten percent share in financing, with the tenants of federalism. "This is my second term that we are starting. Last time that we brought this, I had to grow up a bit as you have to do sometimes in this town, as far as when it comes to holding the line on not compromising your values and principles. I remember working very hard to even get this to the floor, to get it passed the Rules Committee. We were told that there was no way you were going to garner such a piece of legislation, maybe 120 or 130 votes max. We were very excited, our staff worked very hard, partnered with Heritage a year ago, a little over a year ago. About why this particular piece of legislation is important. Well we plowed through, we got it to the floor. Despite even some of our Republican friends’ opposition and we garnered 195 votes. "The reason I am excited about this is that I think we are really close to going across the threshold and making this a reality. The A-PLUS Act, returning the power of these decisions of education for our children to our parents and to the hands…and many of you probably can think back as far as a pro-involvement or special teacher, to be able to have the ability to redirect those funds to specific programs that are working. In our local communities and school boards, I think this is the way to go. It is certainly pure federalism at it’s finest point. And we are happy to launch this and I am happy to announce today that we will be dropping this bill (A-PLUS Act)."
01.18.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) honored Gene Brown as the 6th District Community Hero of the Month for January 2017. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Gene Grown is the President and Executive Director of Community Housing Solutions in Greensboro. This non-profit organization repairs homes for low-income homeowners who can’t physically or financially afford to do so themselves. With a volunteer force of over 800 individuals, Community Housing Solutions has changed lives and saved many families from homelessness. These repair projects restore hope and dignity for families in need in Guilford County. Most recently, the organization has joined with Cone Health and the National Center for Healthy Housing to bring assistance to seniors in need with home repair and home-based health care. “Gene is an example of someone who has brought considerable talent, vision, and passion to an identified need in our community," Walker said. "I’m inspired by his innovative work and the way he empowers those in need.” Brown was presented with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol.
01.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today voted for a budget resolution that would pave the way for Obamacare’s repeal. S. Con Res. 3, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2017, passed the House on Friday afternoon."For six years, Republicans have promised to provide relief to the millions of people and small businesses that are hurting under Obamacare. Passing this budget resolution is the first step in keeping that promise to the American people," Walker said. “Even at the standard of it’s own name, the Affordable Care Act has been a disaster. North Carolinians have faced premium increases of more than 40 percent. Our state has only one insurer offering Obamacare plans in all 100 counties." "This is about fixing our broken health care system and making quality coverage accessible and affordable for everyone. We will repeal Obamacare and put patients and doctors, not Washington bureaucrats, back in charge of health care decisions," Walker added. "The bill was not perfect and did nothing to control runaway spending, proving we must remained committed to fiscal responsibility and a balanced budget for fiscal year 2018." This legislation was passed by the Senate early Thursday morning. The resolution prompts the creation of a budget reconciliation package that can serve as a legislative vehicle for the repeal of Obamacare.
01.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Robert Pittenger (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Ted Budd (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Virginia Foxx (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative George Holding (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), U.S. Representative Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), and U.S. Representative David Rouzer (R-N.C.) sent a letter to the Acting Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services urging him to reject Governor Roy Cooper’s (D-N.C.) illegal proposal to expand Medicaid coverage under Obamacare. The letter reads:“On January 4, 2017, newly elected North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper announced his intention to expand Medicaid coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by submitting a plan to the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services (CMS). Such actions would be a violation of multiple North Carolina laws as well as the North Carolina Constitution.”“No Governor of North Carolina has the legal authority to submit a Medicaid expansion plan to CMS. Such actions would commit the state to approximately $600 million in new spending each year. It is unfortunate that one of Mr. Cooper’s first actions as Governor is to directly go against the same state law and Constitution he swore to uphold. It is for these reasons that we urge CMS to reject Governor Cooper’s proposal.” The letter also details the specific laws the proposed action would violate. It be read in its entirety here.
01.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressional Prayer Caucus co-chairman Senator James Lankford (R-OK) and former Rep. Randy Forbes (R-VA) today announced that Rep. Mark Walker (R-NC) will serve as the new House co-chair of the Caucus. Walker will assume the leadership role previously held by Forbes, who founded the Caucus in 2005 to protect the right of individuals to pray and practice their faith freely. You can read more about the Caucus here. "Our nation was founded on the solid conviction that all men were endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, yet across America, faith has come under attack,” said Forbes. “Freedom of conscience is part of who we are as a nation, and we must preserve this fundamental freedom in our nation. That's why I founded the Prayer Caucus. Today, the strength and size of the Caucus is a testament to the importance of protecting and preserving our nation's Judeo-Christian heritage. I look forward to not only seeing the Caucus grow, but to continue its work to preserve the presence of religion, faith, and morality in the marketplace of ideas." “I am extremely grateful for Rep. Randy Forbes and his leadership of the Congressional Prayer Caucus over the last decade,” said Lankford. “America is stronger because of his commitment to creating this Caucus, and being a consistent champion for religious freedom. Our nation is a diverse country that values the freedom to have faith or have no faith at all. It is vitally important that Congress respects these values in public policy, as well as culture. The Congressional Prayer Caucus has worked successfully to advocate for and protect values that are fundamental to the fabric of our nation, and I’m honored to have Rep. Mark Walker serve as co-chairman.” "I am honored to serve as Co-chair of the Congressional Prayer Caucus with my good friend Senator Lankford,” said Walker. “Prayer is a source of strength and hope for so many Americans – a source we must recognize and protect. Though politics can be divisive at times, prayer should be a uniting force for Congress and for our nation. I look forward to serving the caucus and fighting to protect one of the foundations of our First Amendment.” In January 2015, Lankford became the first senator to join the Caucus since its founding in 2005, making the Caucus bicameral. Lankford first joined the Caucus after his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010. Before 2010, Senator Lankford served in full-time ministry for 22 years. Most recently, he was the Director of Student Ministry at the Baptist Convention of Oklahoma and Director of the Falls Creek Youth Camp, the largest youth camp in the United States. The Congressional Prayer Caucus recognizes the vital role that prayer by individuals of all faiths has played in uniting Americans as a people, and in making us a more generous, more cooperative, and more forgiving people than we might otherwise have been. The Congressional Prayer Caucus has also served to successfully promote efforts that protect the free exercise of religion for all Americans, no matter what faith tradition they observe. During the 114th Congress, the Congressional Prayer Caucus maintained a bipartisan, bicameral group of more than 90 Members, and the Caucus has experienced many successes since its founding in 2005. The Caucus advocated for a change in military regulations governing religious expression; passed legislation reaffirming 'In God We Trust' as our national motto; defended the practice of legislative prayer; and advocated for the reversal of the policy at Walter Reed Medical Center that prohibited individuals from using or distributing religious items during visits to the hospital. The Caucus has also defended the right of religious student groups to operate on secular campuses according to their faith; urged the Administration to protect religious hiring rights; supported legislation to ensure that all child welfare service providers have the equal opportunity to serve children and families; and worked to ensure that our national motto and Pledge of Allegiance were included in the US Capitol Visitor Center. In 2017, the Caucus will continue advocating for the free exercise of religion for people of all faiths.
01.07.2017	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today joined Fox News to discuss the Republican Study Committee's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The bill, the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017 (AHCRA), is sponsored by U.S. Representative Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) and was introduced in the House on Wednesday. “This narrative that is coming from our Democrat friends that we have not had any kind of repeal and replace is simply false,” Walker said. “Do we want to provide Americans the choice to make their own decisions regarding their health care or do we want bureaucracies and bureaucrats in DC to decide that? We are not going to be yanking the rug out from Americans. Our goal is to put together a plan that we actually read before we pass. That’s important and it takes some time.”“It’s very important that we fulfill our promise to the American people,” Walker added. “We have got to earn back trust and credibility, and that comes with a full repeal of Obamacare.” You can watch the full interview above.
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement after the passage of H.Res. 11- Objecting to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 as an obstacle to Israeli-Palestinian peace: "Last month, the Obama Administration exhibited the same political courage that has for eight years made the world a more dangerous place. It is shameful that we abandoned our ally and emboldened the Palestinians, passively letting an anti-Israeli resolution pass the U.N. Security Council. We cannot continue to denigrate our Israeli friends and the only true democracy in the Middle East." "Passing this measure is a good start, but more will have to be done to repair our relationship with Israel and reclaim America's place as a trusted world leader."
01.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-N.C.) today spoke at a press conference to introduce the Republican Study Committee's plan to repeal and replace Obamacare. The bill, the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017 (AHCRA), is sponsored by U.S. Representative Phil Roe (R-Tenn.) and was introduced today in the House. "The most impressive, and the most popular alternative health care legislation, both in the 113th and the 114th Congress, is Dr. Phil Roe’s American Health Care Reform Act," Walker said. "Dr. Phil Roe is uniquely qualified to lead our efforts to restore sanity to health care, and change the focus of our system away from bureaucratic mandates to compassionate care for patients by trusted doctors – paid for in a responsible way."Walker also spoke on the broken promises and damages Obamacare has caused."Can we imagine or can we think of another piece of legislation that has failed more on its promises than Obamacare?," Walker asked. "Millions of people who were promised on multiple occasions they would never lose their insurance, have lower premiums, and could keep their trusted physicians and doctors.""According to Gallup, nearly 80 percent of all Americans want to change the law significantly or repeal it entirely," he added. Walker also said spoke as to how he would lead the Republican Study Committee in the 115th Congress."Our goal in the RSC (Republican Study Committee) is to be proactive and to fulfill the promises that we have made to the American people," Walker said. "This is round one of a fifteen scheduled round fight. Basically, as the conservative caucus in the House, our job is to bat lead-off." A two-page summary of the American Health Care Reform Act of 2017 can be found here and above. Watch Rep. Walker's remarks here or read them in full below:"Good afternoon and thank you for coming out today. As Americans, we pride ourselves in the freedom we have to make our own decisions. Obamacare, for all the talk of collapsing markets and soaring premiums, it has stripped individuals across this country of the most important decision that we may ever face, and that is the decisions regarding our own health care. You see this is another area in our lives, where bureaucrats have tried to convince the American people that the federal government knows better how to run our lives. Can we imagine or can we think of another piece of legislation that has failed more on its promises than Obamacare?"Millions, yes millions, of people have been kicked off their coverage. Millions of people who were promised on multiple occasions they would never lose their insurance, have lower premiums, and could keep their trusted physicians and doctors."A couple of statistics today as we get started today that I want us to remember: Close to 75 percent of state run co-ops have completely collapsed. Now, what does this mean? Over 800,000 people were forced to find new coverage in a very difficult time. According to Gallup, nearly 80 percent of all Americans want to change the law significantly or repeal it entirely. As we saw recently, that 80 percent now includes a Democratic Governor and a former Democratic President who have heard the countless horror stories of small businesses and individuals alike. "Just earlier today, President Obama shows up for the first time since lobbying the Iranian debacle in efforts to provide another arena that is equally as bad. Our goal in the RSC (Republican Study Committee) is to be proactive and to fulfill the promises that we have made to the American people. We look forward to working with leadership and this Administration in finding solutions that provide opportunities for all of our communities. This is round one of a fifteen scheduled round fight. Basically, as the conservative caucus in the House, our job is to bat lead-off."Now the most impressive, and the most popular alternative health care legislation, both in the 113th and the 114th Congress, is Dr. Phil Roe’s American Health Care Reform Act. Who better to start this process than a physician, who ran a successful medical practice career, who employed hundreds of medical professionals, and met and dealt and provided health care to thousands of patients. Dr. Phil Roe is uniquely qualified to lead our efforts to restore sanity to health care, and change the focus of our system away from bureaucratic mandates to compassionate care for patients by trusted doctors – paid for in a responsible way. Dr. Roe."
01.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today penned an op-ed in FoxNews.com, laying out a conservative vision for the 115th Congress and the Republican Study Committee. "Congress will repeal ObamaCare, deliver on authentic tax reform, secure our borders, and protect religious liberty," Walker wrote. "Moreover, conservatives will hold the line against proposals that expand government, limit individual freedom and threaten our national security.""The stakes are high and the decisions we make, the policy we create, and the votes we take should lead to better law that positively impacts all communities," he continued. Walker also expressed the need for conservative to reintroduce their voice and their ideas. "The worn-out language and rhetoric may be attractive language to our base, but the oft-repeated talking points of individual liberty and personal prosperity falls short in reaching many of our communities. We can do better," Walker wrote. "Conservatives need to reintroduce our voice, vision, policies, rationale, and principles to all people and communities," he added. Read Rep. Walker's op-ed in its entirety here and below: We Can Still Save What Has Been Broken By Big Government. Here’s How.FoxNews.com By: Rep. Mark Walker January 4, 2017 The Republican Study Committee (RSC) has been the foundation of conservative policy in Congress for more than four decades. The RSC’s dedication to enacting conservative principles in policy should be unwavering and I am honored to follow strong leaders including Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Dr. Tom Price and other previous chairmen. There is overwhelming evidence to support a hopeful and optimistic outlook for the 115th Congress. Through a rare opportunity enabled by unified government we can pursue impactful and effective conservative policy. Congress will repeal ObamaCare, deliver on authentic tax reform, secure our borders, and protect religious liberty. Moreover, conservatives will hold the line against proposals that expand government, limit individual freedom and threaten our national security. The stakes are high and the decisions we make, the policy we create, and the votes we take should lead to better law that positively impacts all communities. Yet, we must also ask the question -- is knowing the right policy alone enough? I believe the day has arrived when preaching to the choir is no longer adequate -- that’s the easy road. The worn-out language and rhetoric may be attractive language to our base, but the oft-repeated talking points of individual liberty and personal prosperity falls short in reaching many of our communities. We can do better. For too long some conservatives have stubbornly refused to modify the approach and voice in promoting and advocating a conservative message and agenda. We have invested poorly in community relationships with a blind eye to the suffering thinking that a better program or a pandering policy would be the solution, even as we know that no government program, however well intentioned, can provide for the authentic needs of our neighbors. I am growing more convinced that policy alone is insufficient without the right approach and the right voice. The American people are demanding ”effective conservatism” and I am certain that all three – the right policy, the right approach, and the right voice can be accomplished. “Hear us again for the first time!” Conservatives need to reintroduce our voice, vision, policies, rationale, and principles to all people and communities. Doing this does not require the Republican Party to be a Big Tent party with a purpose only to include more ideas that trample the principles and standards that conservatives adhere to, but this mission is about having an opportunity to better explain why we believe in the things we believe. Through the power of persuasion and winning the debate, conservatives will put points on the board that result in clear wins for the American People. As RSC chairman, my hope is to lay out clear and measurable objectives with contemporary messaging that communicates our principles of opportunity, liberty, and security. I don’t assume that we’re the first to share such a vision but the American People have afforded us this momentum and we must act with urgency – not out of political gain or posturing but rather out of the belief that good policy with the right approach can change America for the better. Why is the RSC the key to Effective Conservatism? The RSC consists of conservative members in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives represents the People, and accountability of Representatives to the American People must be strictly enforced by voters, or the will of the people will be ignored. I believe members of the RSC were elected to represent conservatism. Together, conservatives can make a difference and change the misguided policies and laws that have broken the family, stifled entrepreneurship, and veered away from the Constitution. Liberty. Opportunity. Security. I understand there are huge challenges ahead. Some would question whether it is even possible to be conservative and effective in Congress. But I have confidence and faith in the Republican Study Committee and the men and women who make up the largest caucus in all of Congress. We will work to rediscover the path to Effective Conservatism and the vision of our Founding Fathers. We will listen to the American People and implement their ideas into our solutions. It is not too late to save what has been broken by big government. It is not too late to reestablish a constitutionally limited government that is efficient and productive. It is not too late to be heard again for the first time.

12.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement after the Obama Administration refused to veto an anti-Israeli resolution in the United Nations (U.N.) Security Council: "Today, the Obama Administration exhibited the same political courage that has for eight years made the world a more dangerous place. The same Administration that last week called shame on those not moved by the struggle in Syria, has now emboldened the Palestinians and passively let an anti-Israeli bill pass the U.N. Security Council. We cannot continue to denigrate our strongest ally and the only true democracy in the Middle East." "January 20th will be a new day to right the wrongs of this Administration. For the sake of peace and security in the world, we must begin to lead from the front, and not from behind."

12.15.2016	WENTWORTH, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) presented Mr. Harry Lawson, a World War II veteran from Eden, N.C., a flag flown above the U.S. Capitol Building in his honor. The small ceremony of Lawson’s family and friends was held Friday, December 9th at the Rockingham County Economic Development Center in Wentworth. “Our veterans put their lives on the line to protect our God given right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” Walker said. “In 1943, at the young age of 18, Harry Lawson enlisted in the U.S. Army during one of the darkest chapters in world history. This flag, which he fought honorably to protect, is just a small token of our appreciation for his service and sacrifice,” Walker added. Harry Lawson enlisted June 23, 1943 in Roanoke, Virginia. He began his service with Battery D 5th Anti-Aircraft Training Battalion out of Fort Eustis, Virginia. He was reassigned to the 102nd Infantry Regiment in Operation in Hawaii. He was honorably discharged as an Army Corporal February 1946. Lawson returned to Eden, NC, and worked for Tri City Ford and Duke Power. He married Betty Carter in 1950. They have four children, eight grandchildren, and eleven great-grandchildren. You can read more about Mr. Lawson here and see pictures from the event below.
12.15.2016	WENTWORTH, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) last week recognized Mr. William “Bill” Moody of Eden as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for December 2016. “Our office takes great pride in recognizing members of our community who go above and beyond the call of duty to serve others,” Walker said. “For over a decade, Bill Moody has pledged his time to provide a joyful Christmas for emotionally, physically and mentally challenged children all across North Carolina. In light of the season, I’m honored to present Bill with this small token of our appreciation for his many hours dedicated to giving children the gift of joy, hope and laughter,” Walker added. “When I started around ten years ago as Santa Claus, I quickly discovered I had been given a unique gift to the least understood children in society,” Moody said. “I have never taken a single penny from any appearance as Santa Claus. I have been blessed with a look and the personality to make children happy and it isn’t right to profit from it. God has been good to me and I need to return His blessings to those I meet,” Moody added. Moody has played the role of Santa Claus for over a decade. He primarily works through the Friendship Ministry at Osborne Baptist Church in Eden, NC, which is an organization for emotionally, physically and mentally challenged people, and the Family Support Network of Greater Forsyth County. Moody makes appearances for companies and charges a fee that is entirely directed toward charities, such as the Toys-for-Tots program. Walker presented Moody a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol Building in his honor at a small ceremony this morning in the Rockingham County Board of Commissioners’ Chambers.
12.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Friday, an article in The News & Observer highlighted U.S. Representative Mark Walker's (NC-06) opposition to the Continuing Resolution – which passed the House on Thursday – and highlighted what it signals as he steps in to lead the Republican Study Committee (RSC). "Walker’s opposition this week signals he’ll lead the RSC next year in pushing back against last-minute legislation often loaded with spending and provisions designed to solicit broad support from lawmakers," the article reads. "Walker’s statement Thursday called on Republicans to consider their approach to passing budgets as much as they consider their policy positions and spending priorities." The article continued: “'This bill is a far cry from how our government should be funded and what priorities should be appropriated...In the next Congress, we have to dedicate ourselves to being proactive, rather than reactive,' he said."Read the article in its entirety here.
12.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Senator Mike Lee (UT) today penned an op-ed for National Review Online, calling for Republicans in Congress to utilize the budget reconcilation process to repeal Obamacare, using last years reconcilation bill as the blue print. "We sent a bill to President Obama’s desk that would have repealed much of the law, and was promptly — and unsurprisingly — vetoed. But this exercise was not, by any measure, a fruitless effort," Walker and Lee wrote. "That bill, H.R. 3762, established the minimum standards against which any future Obamacare repeal bills would be measured. Walker and Lee continued: "It zeroed out Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates, scrapped the taxes, revived health savings accounts, and rolled back the Medicaid expansion and subsidies. Majorities in the House and Senate are on record voting for all of these items. We can do it again." This op-ed follows a similar effort by Walker and Lee in 2015, calling for a stronger reconcilation bill that worked to "repeal as much of Obamacare as possible." Read Rep. Walker and Sen. Mike Lee's op-ed in its entirety here and below: Repealing Obamacare: Let’s Get This DoneNational Review Online By: Rep. Mark Walker and Sen. Mike Lee December 9, 2016 Since 2010 everyone in the Republican party has agreed that Obamacare must be repealed. Most Republican members of Congress — ourselves included — were elected, and reelected, on the promise that we would take any opportunity possible to end this partisan, ham-handed, and unconstitutional law. When Republicans attained control of both the House and Senate in 2015, we saw an opportunity to lay the foundation for full repeal under a possible future Republican president. To that end, we penned an article in National Review calling for Congress to send President Obama a bill repealing Obamacare. “It is more important than ever for Republicans in Congress to honor the promises we have made to the American people,” we wrote. “We can do this, before the end of the year, through a procedure known as ‘budget reconciliation.’” House and Senate Republicans followed through on this promise. We sent a bill to President Obama’s desk that would have repealed much of the law, and was promptly — and unsurprisingly — vetoed. But this exercise was not, by any measure, a fruitless effort. That bill, H.R. 3762, established the minimum standards against which any future Obamacare repeal bills would be measured. It zeroed out Obamacare’s individual and employer mandates, scrapped the taxes, revived health savings accounts, and rolled back the Medicaid expansion and subsidies. Majorities in the House and Senate are on record voting for all of these items. We can do it again. But there is no denying that any new reconciliation repeal bill in the next Congress will have a different outcome. This time, when the House and Senate send such a bill to the White House, the incoming president has said he will sign it. That is why it is so important that we get this repeal bill right. And the bare minimum simply is not enough this time. A minimum effort could end up hurting many Americans. Specifically, the law’s many insurance mandates drive up health costs and force individuals to violate their deeply held religious convictions. When government bureaucrats and politicians decide that every insurance policy must cover free doctor visits and abortifacients, Americans who don’t need those options end up paying more for products they don’t want. That’s great for the insurance companies, but not for taxpayers or consumers. Some have argued that insurance regulations fall outside the scope of what Senate rules allow in a reconciliation bill. But since taxpayers are on the hook for billions in health insurance premiums every year, we should not give up on tackling the insurance regulations that inflate those premiums. But deleting Obamacare from federal statute will be only the first step in reforming federal health-care policy. Republicans cannot wash their hands of the consequences of the Democrats’ failed health-care experiment. We have a responsibility to fix the broken government policies that have crippled our health-care system for decades. This means providing a transition, for however many years, for the market to recover and be able to serve individuals and businesses with more affordable, accessible health coverage. This means implementing the best of the many free-market repair proposals that Republicans have been developing for the past six years. People need options, not heavy-handed government mandates. The details of a replacement plan do not have to be finalized now. But overall, it must honor medicine’s founding principle: primum non nocere — first, do no harm. Congress and the Trump administration can’t afford to fumble the repeal of Obamacare. We can’t afford to just squeak by with the bare minimum, while preserving many of Obamacare’s most burdensome and intrusive provisions. The American people have entrusted Republicans with a historic opportunity. They gave us the House, the Senate, a majority of governor’s seats, and the White House. Now we must honor the trust they have put in us by repealing and replacing Obamacare with health-care policies that lower costs, improve quality, and increase access for all Americans.
12.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement after voting against the Continuing Resolution: "Though this outcome was preferable to a larger, long-term spending bill, it is my sincere hope that our final vote of 2016 is not indicative of how we will operate in 2017. This bill is a far cry from how our government should be funded and what priorities should be appropriated. "The approach is just as important as the policy. In the next Congress, we have to dedicate ourselves to being proactive, rather than reactive. It should be our aim to set clear objectives early and achieve defined successes. "The American people have entrusted us to change Washington. It is unacceptable for us not to deliver on the trust the voters have invested in us."
12.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement after voting to impeach IRS Commissioner John Koskinen: "Since October of 2015, I have been on the record supporting articles of impeachment for commissioner Koskinen. There is overwhelming evidence that he failed in performing his duties and misled Congress. "I supported the measure because the American people deserve accountability in government. The privileged and well-connected should not get to live and work by another standard; Koskinen's deceit deserves consequence."
12.05.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement congratulating U.S. Representative Mark Meadows (NC-11) on being elected as the new Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus: "Congratulations to my friend and colleague from North Carolina Mark Meadows, the newly elected Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. "As Republicans have been entrusted with a historic opportunity, I look forward to working with Mark and fellow conservatives to deliver real governmental reform and economic opportunity for the people of North Carolina."
11.29.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement after the announcement that President-elect Trump will nominate U.S. Representative Tom Price (GA-06) to serve at Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS): "Congratulations to my great friend and former Chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Congressman Tom Price. As an orthopedic surgeon and leader in crafting conservative healthcare solutions, he will be an exceptional HHS Secretary. "Three years ago, I visited Washington for the first time in over a decade, months away from the 2014 primary election and facing long odds. Only one individual was gracious enough to find time to meet with me – Dr. Tom Price. "His kindness and desire for conservative change will serve him well as Secretary and I look forward to working with him as we aim to repeal Obamacare, create a patient-first healthcare environment, and deliver on the promises we have made to the people we represent."
11.17.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today was elected by his colleagues to serve as Chairman of the Republican Study Committee (RSC) for the 115th Congress. He released the following statement regarding his re-election: "There has never been a better time for a bold conservative vision for America. Looking at the election results, it is clear the American people want to reclaim constitutional principles and reinvigorate our economy. It is unacceptable for us not to deliver on the faith the voters have invested in us. I am honored by the confidence of my colleagues and will work to lead the Republican Study Committee towards effective conservatism – in a manner reflective of its distinguished legacy.” The Republican Study Committee has served as the conservative caucus of House Republicans and a leading influencer on the Right since its original founding in 1973. It exists to bring like-minded House members together to promote a strong, principled legislative agenda that will limit government, strengthen our national defense, boost America’s economy, preserve traditional values and balance our budget.

11.04.2016	BURLINGTON, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement on the vandalism of the Alamance County GOP Headquarters in Burlington, N.C.: "This marks the second crime of this nature in my district within a month. First the firebombing at the Orange County GOP and then similar graffiti profanity again here at the Alamance GOP offices. One of life's greatest opportunities is to bring healing when you've been treated unfairly or wronged. "These words of hate create an opportunity for us to serve one another, be hands and feet for this community, and to do so with grateful hearts. We are incredibly blessed to live in a country where we may live and work in accordance to our peacefully held beliefs without fear of encountering violence. "This should motivate every single North Carolinian to go to the polls as a way to secure that very freedom. I have every confidence that the Alamance County GOP will continue to stand strong for the cause of liberty and move forward with forgiveness towards those who have committed this act."
11.03.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today honored the Greensboro Fire Department’s Task Force Six as the as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for November 2016. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. In October, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety's Division of Emergency Management deployed 35 individuals of the Greensboro Fire Department’s Task Force Six to assist in Hurricane Matthew recovery efforts. This included the Greensboro Fire Department’s Swift Water Rescue Team. “The teams helped in a number of ways from helping get 911 communication back up and running in some communities to rescuing people from their homes,” WGHP Fox 8 reported. “[They have] helped in a number of storms along the east coast, performed 75 evacuations from homes and assisted in the rescue of people trapped in their vehicles.” “When our state needed it the most, these heroes sprung into action and represented our community with distinction,” Walker said. “It was my privilege to honor their selfless and life-saving efforts to help the people of North Carolina recover from the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew.” Walker presented the firefighters a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during an event this morning at Greensboro Fire Station 05 on Westover Terrace.

11.03.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today presented Mr. Frank Fulcher a United States flag flown over the U.S. Capitol Building. Fulcher, 97, is a World War II veteran. “One of the greatest honors and privileges I have as a Congressman is being able to recognize our nation’s heroes,” Walker said. “As soon as he could enlist, Frank Fulcher answered our nation’s call to duty during World War II. Even today at the young age of 97, Mr. Fulcher punches in early at his job at Tar Heel Lift Trucks, where he is known for his work ethic and productivity. We thank Mr. Fulcher for his service to our nation and for the example he sets for us and our future generations.” Born in Stuart, Virginia in 1919, Fulcher served in the United States Air Force from May 1941 to March 1946. He was stationed during World War II in the Philippines. When he was 87 years old, Fulcher began working for Tar Heel Lift Trucks, Inc. in Greensboro as an outside salesman. He continues to work for the company ten years later. Fulcher is married to Betty Fulcher and lives in Forsyth County. The couple has two children, two stepchildren and two grandchildren.
10.28.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today issued the following statement on the FBI reopening its investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server: "This is more important than just emails. This is our national security. This is our safety. And Hillary Clinton thought her privacy and convenience was more important than the safety of the American people. "The extremely careless mishandling and transmitting of top security information by Secretary Clinton proves that she believes the law doesn't apply to her or that she's not competent to serve in any official capacity. "We cannot let these offenses go unpunished. No one is above the law. While long overdue, I am glad the FBI has chosen to do the right thing." Congressman Walker sits on the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In a hearing on July 7th, Walker questioned FBI Director James Comey on the handling of the investigation.
10.10.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) jointly honored Phil Bowers and the Troxler family of Alamance County as the 6th District Community Heroes of the Month for October 2016. Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and making a difference in their community. This is the first jointly presented Community Hero of the Month Award for the 6th District. Phil Bowers is the Founder and Executive Director of Sustainable Alamance, a nonprofit organization that takes a unique approach to defining and creating sustainable communities. The goal of Bowers and his organization is to use bold and innovative methods to connect former offenders facing employment discrimination. "I was touched by the personal stories of these men," Bowers said. "They were ready but just needed help getting access to resources." The program has had great success not only providing the mentoring structure and opportunity to develop key interpersonal, life, and work skills, but placing participants with local employers that will provide job opportunities. That is where the Troxler family comes in, filling the second half of the equation. The Troxler brothers, Jesse and Jeremy, along with their father Rockie, have been working in tandem with Mr. Bowers for over five years. The Troxlers own a local metal works business, Piedmont Metals, and hire individuals from the Sustainable Alamance program who seek to reenter the workforce. Throughout this program partnership, the Troxlers have seen growth for both those employed from the Sustainable Alamance program and for their own business. Bowers and the Troxlers hope they can serve as an example to the community, by offering second chances and by showing that you can create partnerships with people from different backgrounds. "We found that there's a tremendous value in the individual, even if they have some skeletons in the closet," Jesse Troxler said. Bowers hopes people can see that "there is no throw away person. Everybody matters." “I am so honored to present our first joint Community Hero of the Month Award to two incredibly deserving groups,” Walker said. “Mr. Bowers and the Troxler family have forged a visionary and key partnership in our community. This is more than providing an opportunity to people who many would turn away. This remarkable partnership is a conscious choice to invest in someone’s life and give them a second chance. I look forward to hearing even more success stories as they continue to change lives.” Walker presented Bowers and Troxler with certificates and flags flown over the U.S. Capitol during a ceremony at the 6th District Congressional Office in Graham.
09.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) recently introduced H.R. 6089, the Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act of 2016. This bill allows disabled veterans to contribute to their Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) account, using their disability compensation. Last year, Congress gave our servicemen and servicewomen a new way to save for retirement by allowing them to contribute money to a TSP. The TSPs act similar to a 401k, deferring taxes and helping members of the military build a nest egg for the future. However, under current law our service members are not able to contribute to their retirement once they transition back to civilian life. This makes saving for the future difficult, especially for the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, 40% of whom are disabled when they come home. "Our disabled veterans may leave the military, but they never leave service to our country. Their sacrifice and many of their injuries stay with them," Walker said. "The Financial Independence for Disabled Veterans Act will allow our heroes to be better equipped to make the transition back to civilian life. "By allowing disabled veterans to keep contributing to their TSP after they leave the Armed Forces will help them gain more financial independence," Walker added. This retirement provision was based on recommendations from the Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission (MCRMC). It also comes following Walker hosting multiple roundtables with veterans in the community and getting feedback.

09.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following statement after the NCAA announced they would pull all championship tournaments for the 2016-2017 academic year out of North Carolina because of a law that reaffirmed the longstanding definition of Title VII and IX’s protections related to “sex”:"The NCAA relocating championships is disappointing and perplexing. Greensboro and the State of North Carolina have a distinguished record of hosting NCAA events, providing a safe, respectful and inclusive environment for athletes and fans."We will not be intimidated by elitists who are attempting to extort and embarrass North Carolina for defending its citizens. If the NCAA wants to refuse to hold the tournament in the state with one of the richest collegiate sports histories and the fastest growing economy in the nation, that is their decision. For us, the privacy, safety and dignity of our women and children do not have a price tag."The NCAA has chosen Vermont and Connecticut over North Carolina – perhaps unsurprising given Mark Emmert’s background. The NCAA should care more for their student athletes and fans than they do about political posturing."
09.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today introduced the Bettering Resources In Guarding from Human Trafficking (BRIGHT) Act. This legislation establishes minimum sentences for those convicted of Federal human trafficking crimes. The BRIGHT Act comes after Congressman Walker’s successful efforts to combat human trafficking through H.R. 460, Human Trafficking Detection Act, which passed the House last year and was signed into law as part of S. 178, Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. It also follows feedback from meetings in North Carolina’s 6th District with law enforcement agencies and organizations working to fight human trafficking. “Human trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time,” Walker said. “ It destroys, enslaves, and exploits human life. This abhorrent crime needs to be treated with the seriousness it deserves.” “I am grateful for the progress we have made to combat human trafficking locally and nationally - but it’s not enough,” Walker added. “Life is invaluable and we must do all we can to protect it at every stage.” This is bill is part of an effort of overall sentencing reform to ensure that crimes are treated with the seriousness they deserve. For some, this means reducing proposed sentences. For others, like human trafficking, it means treating them as the serious crimes that they are. You can read the full text of the legislation here.
09.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today announced that he will pursue the Chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee (RSC) in the 115th Congress. The support for his candidacy is already strong and broad-based, including notable members like Reps. Kevin Brady, the Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, and Virginia Foxx, the dean of the North Carolina Republican delegation. Founded by notable conservatives in 1973, the RSC is a voluntary committee within Congress that provides legislative analysis and advocacy tools to its members. Past Chairman include Gov. Mike Pence, former Reps. David McIntosh and Sue Myrick, and current Reps. Jim Jordan, Tom Price, and Jeb Hensarling. For over 30 years, the RSC has promoted “a strong principled legislative agenda that will limit government, strengthen national defense, boost America’s economy, preserve traditional values and balance the budget,” according to its statement of purpose. “’Put your feet in the right place, then stand firm,” Walker said. “That is an Abraham Lincoln quote that summarizes the role of RSC within the House of Representatives. I am honored by the support we have received and humbled by the opportunity to lead." “From day one, we have always tried to focus on people, building genuine relationships and bridging traditional political and cultural divides,” Walker added. “Those efforts are bearing fruit locally, as we are engaged in communities and on issues that break conservative stereotypes. They are also bearing fruit in Washington, as we have earned the respect to lead national policy conversations.” Congressman Walker published a letter to North Carolina’s 6th District on Medium today to announce the run.You can also learn more about the Republican Study Committee and CongressmanWalker’s efforts in a story posted in The Daily Signal here.
09.02.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today honored Rick Morton of Greensboro as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for September 2016.Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in their community.Mr. Morton works at Heads Up Barber and Beauty in Greensboro, but behind the barber chair, he has been providing free haircuts and so much more to our community’s young people for the past 2 years through his organization, “Heads up For Our Youth.”Inspired by a friend who volunteered at a local middle school, Mr. Morton decided to donate his time and talents by providing haircuts to well deserving youth in the community. He quickly saw how this simple gesture could make young people feel more confident, and in turn, do better in school.If there is one thing Rick wants people to know about the work that the organization does, it’s that it’s bigger than one person. He credits the talented team of barbers he works with who are consistently planning events and showing up to serve youth and help them thrive. The program provides transportation, a haircut, lunch, and lessons on grooming and presenting themselves professionally, at no cost to the youth. The organization has now expanded to three different initiatives, offering a financial literacy course and a basketball clinic as well. “I am honored to have the opportunity to recognize Rick Morton as a leader in our community and a positive role model for our youth,” Walker said. “He is the perfect example of how someone can provide a simple service to a young person and actually change the trajectory of their life. Because of Mr. Morton’s willingness to use his time to help others, these youth are not only better poised to succeed at school, but also better poised to succeed in all of life’s ventures.”Walker presented Morton with a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during a visit to Heads Up Barber and Beauty.
08.19.2016	GRAHAM, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today spoke at a press conference in response to the Department of Justice dropping the appeal of U.S. District Judge Thomas Shcroeder’s dismissal of the lawsuit against the Alamance County Sheriff’s Department, effectively ending the legal battle. The following is an excerpt of the statements made by Congressman Walker: “As this Administration has done time and time again, they attacked someone who refused to enforce their political agenda. This time it was different though. When you attack our community, we fight back. And here, we not only fought, but we won. “The Department of Justice came in and froze money, blocked necessary grants, and caused funds that needed to be spent on Alamance County and the protection of the people to be spent on defending this needless lawsuit. This money should have been spent investing in jobs or building schools and providing better education and opportunity to our students. Instead it went to defending our community from political attacks, placing the deputies and the citizens of Alamance County at risk in the process. “I am proud of the work my office did to force the Justice Department to free up frozen Alamance County funds and right some of the wrongs that occurred here. It is my hope now that Sheriff Johnson and his department can move forward and continue protecting the citizens of Alamance County.” Sheriff Terry Johnson also spoke of Congressman Walker’s support saying, “This man…he stood up for this agency in Washington, D.C. to get federal drug asset forfeiture money released to us. $351,000 that we needed tremendously to buy equipment to protect our citizens in this county. "He understands the importance of law enforcement," Johnson added. You can see Sheriff Johnson’s and Congressman Walker’s response in the video above and here, as well as images from the press conference below.
07.24.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) is excited to announce that North Carolina’s 6th District will be participating in the Congressional App Challenge, an app competition for U.S. high school students. The Challenge submission period will run from July 18, 2016 through November 2, 2016. The competition is open to all students who meet the eligibility requirements, regardless of coding experience. We strongly encourage students of all skill levels to participate, to learn how to create their own apps. Winners will be selected by panels of judges, drawn from the local community, and honored by their Member of Congress. Their apps will be featured on a display in the U.S. Capitol building and on the Congressional App Challenge website. The CAC was created because Congress recognized that STEM and computer-based skills are essential for economic growth and innovation, and that the U.S. has been falling behind on these fronts. By some estimates, the U.S. may be short by many as a million programmers by 2020. These are high-paying, in-demand jobs. To maintain American competitiveness, it’s crucial that the United States invests in our youth now, and helps them acquire these valuable skills. The CAC encourages students to pursue those skills and recognizes them for their efforts. Recognizing the racial, gendered, and other disparities in the tech sector, the CAC also focuses on inclusivity and making the Challenge as accessible as possible to people from all backgrounds. Deliberate efforts will be made to include students from all backgrounds, including those traditionally underrepresented in tech. The Internet Education Foundation will be serving as the operational “sponsor” of the CAC. For further information about the Congressional App Challenge, please visit www.CongressionalAppChallenge.us.Students can also learn more on the participation flyer here.
07.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an event last week, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Representative Alma Adams (NC-12) announced the creation of a bi-partisan internship program aimed at increasing diversity and engagement on Capitol Hill through Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU). The lack of diversity the Hill has been a well-documented issue. A recent study found that African-Americans make up less than one percent of top Senate staffers, despite representing 13 percent of the U.S. population. Reps. Walker and Adams are taking action to change this course. The HBCU Bi-Partisan Congressional Internship program is the first of its kind, featuring two interns, who will each spend a four-week period in the office of both a Republican and a Democrat. The interns in the program will also have the opportunity to meet with key players on Capitol Hill, including Members of Congress and senior staff. They will also have to meet performance standards that ensure a quality, educational experience, including attending hearings and briefings, writing letters, completing projects, and writing an essay about their time and what they learned. “For too long Republicans have talked about minority outreach without taking any meaningful action. This internship program will open doors by providing HBCU students the chance to learn about Congress, and how political issues are viewed by each side of the aisle,” Walker said. “To solve the issues that our nation faces, we need perspectives from all walks of life. With the HBCU Bi-Partisan Congressional Internship program, we hope to start a precedent on Capitol Hill that leads to increased opportunity and legislative engagement from the African-American community.” Vashti Hinton of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and Quanetta King of Johnson C. Smith University were selected as the first two students to be a part of the internship. “It was nice to see so many people come out to support this program, I have very high hopes for its success. I am honored to be one of the first to help lift it off the ground,” Hinton said. “I hope that this internship will begin to redefine the future of HBCU students on Capitol Hill, and also hopefully encourage more diversity when it comes to staffers on the Hill in the future.” “We are delighted to have one of our top student leaders participate in the first-ever HBCU Caucus internship program. The opportunity presented to Vashti, will allow her to apply the theories of political thought presented in the classroom, to the real world scenarios presented in both congressional offices and vice versa,” said Dr. Melody Pierce, Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs at NC A&T in Greensboro, N.C.. “We commend Congressman Mark Walker and North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University alumna, Congresswoman Alma Adams for not only being committed to the idea of diversity, but also development of the structure necessary to achieve it. This is a true example of how bipartisanship effectively supports the next generation of great minds.” “As the daughter of two HBCU graduates, it is with pride that I bring my HBCU legacy to Capitol Hill. During my experience working, I've had the opportunity to learn how Congress works and the ins and outs of how our laws are made,” King stated. “By attending meetings with staffers and networking with Hill staffers, I've met a lot of amazing people, who've all been willing to share what they know. I'm grateful to be afforded this educational opportunity that few people receive.” "The Bipartisan HBCU Internship Program is an excellent opportunity for top Political Science students, such as JCSU's Quanetta King, to experience the political process up close and personal,” said Kimberlee Archie, the Student Employment & Internship Coordinator at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, NC. “To live and work in our nation's Capitol and see the inner workings of Congress, not only from the Democratic side, but also the Republican side, is the type of professional development and exposure students need to prepare for their journey post graduation." You can learn more about the students who are taking part in the internship program and see more pictures from the event below: Vashti Hinton Vashti Hinton is a junior Political Science student at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University. She was born in Baltimore, MD and raised in Greensboro, NC. She commits most her time to advocating for equality and justice, as well as supporting her family. She hopes to someday become an attorney and work for a non-profit or become a legal advisor. Quanetta King Quanetta King is a junior at Johnson C. Smith University. She is from Fayetteville North Carolina. Her goal is to graduate with a B.S. in Political Science with a minor in Pre-Law.

07.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today introduced a bill that forces HHS to stop illegally giving money intended for American taxpayers to well-connected insurance companies.The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act would require the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to pay the $3.5 billion it has taken from taxpayers back to the U.S. Treasury or face a 50 percent cut in its operating budget. To mitigate the high costs of Obamacare's mandates, the bill created three programs, one of which was the Transitional Reinsurance Program. The three-year reinsurance program required the HHS to collect $25 billion from insurers. Of this, the law mandated that HHS send $5 billion directly to the U.S. Treasury to pay down Obamacare's costs on the American people: $2 billion in 2014, $2 billion in 2015, and $1 billion in 2016. The other $20 billion was to be paid back to insurers for covering patients in the exchanges. Despite $4 billion already being due, the Treasury has only received $500 million. Instead, the money required by law to be paid to the Treasury alone is now being sent to well­-connected insurance companies. “In Washington, this kind of lawlessness gets overlooked too much. Federal bureaucrats are not above the laws they force upon the American people,” Walker said. “My bill is simple: I want HHS to follow the law it helped write.” “This should not be a partisan idea: the government should follow the law and prioritize the people it serves over big insurance companies,” Walker added. Representative Walker also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner to explain why he introduced the bill. The Taxpayers Before Insurers Act is supported by American for Tax Reform and Citizens Against Government Waste. In a letter to Walker, Grover Norquist, the President of Americans for Tax Reform said “The $3.5 billion in Obamacare reinsurance corporate welfare payments are merely the latest effort by the administration to ignore the law to the benefit of monied special interests.” ###
07.14.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Betty Hilliard of Guilford County as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for July 2016. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. In her own words, Betty Hilliard has been blessed with a career that allowed her to retire early, and she’s been using her time to selflessly care for others. She volunteers hours of her time to serve her community helping out at many organizations in the Greensboro area:The Barnabas Network Betty spends about ten hours a month volunteering at The Barnabas Network, which helps provide furniture to struggling families as they transition out of homelessness, abusive situations, or the loss of a home. She was formerly a board member and is on a committee for establishing a retail store.Ten Thousand Villages Betty is filling in as the manager of Ten Thousand Villages in Greensboro where she volunteers for more than 50 hours a month. Ten Thousand Villages is a fair trade retailer that sells items that are made largely by women in developing nations. The sale of these items help these women provide food, shelter and educational opportunities for their families.StepUp Greensboro Betty volunteers about 20 hours a month at StepUp Greensboro, which works to create opportunities through jobs and life-skills training. There she assists with the Job Readiness Training Week and helps people prepare for job interviews. “This program gives so many that first chance to ‘Step Up’ their lives, to change to improve their situations, to be able to provide for their families and in many instances to begin to pay it forward for others,” Hilliard said. “It enables individuals to begin to value themselves and to transform into productive, happy, and fulfilled people.” First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro Betty also volunteers in many ways through her church. At First Presbyterian Church in Greensboro, she volunteers in the kitchen, serving meals as a Team leader. She also works with “Circle of Friends” to provide meals for bereaved families and delivers “Mobile Meals.” “The way Betty restlessly serves our community is inspirational. It was amazing to discover all of the organizations she works with and all of the lives she has touched.” Walker said. “I am thrilled we can honor her selfless work and celebrate how she has used her life to be an example for how we are all called to help our neighbors.” Walker presented Hilliard a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during a visit to The Barnabas Network. ###
07.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06), a member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, today questioned Director James Comey on the FBI’s investigation into Secretary Hillary Clinton’s mishandling of classified information and the decision to not suggest a prosecution. Below is the video of the exchange, followed by a rush transcript: WALKER: Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank you Director Comey for being here. There are few things that people in this town agree upon on both sides of the aisle and one of them is your reputation. I am reminded of the passage in James, swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath. I’m a little disappointed in some of the things I have heard from my colleagues about some of the attacks on your character and your integrity. I haven’t heard those and I hope that you have not experienced that. I also struggle with the change of heart, that we are hearing today because I have a list of elected officials who have questioned your investigation and even attacked it, in fact, former President Clinton said this is a game. In fact, just last Friday, Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz said Secretary Clinton was not the “target of this investigation or whatever you want to call it.” My question to you is, do you feel like this has been a Republican witch hunt? This hearing? COMEY: No, I said from the beginning, I understand people’s questions and interest and I am a huge fan of transparency. I think that is what makes our democracy great. WALKER: I think that goes at one of the reasons of why you are so respected. To me this hearing is about understanding and disseminating the facts. How you saw them, and how the American public sees them, and specifically where there was wrongdoing admitted under your investigation, where there was obviously breaking the law, but where there was also some cover-ups. Did Congress ask you to pursue this investigation? COMEY: No, it was a referral from the Inspector General of the Intelligence community. WALKER: So, it wasn’t Republicans either was it? COMEY: No. WALKER: How did you go about collecting the evidence? COMEY: We used the tools that we normally use in a criminal investigation. WALKER: Did you do you receive a congressional referral for all the information that you collected? COMEY: Not to my knowledge. WALKER: Well then, one of the things that I’m struggling with or I would like to know specifically is: Under oath, Ms. Clinton made these three comments that we now know are untrue during the Benghazi hearing. Number one: she has turned over all of her work-related emails. Number two: telling the Committee that her attorneys went through every single email. And then finally, and probably the one that continues to stick the most, there was, and I quote, “Nothing marked classified, on my emails.” Now earlier, when the Chairman questioned you about this, you said something about needing a congressional referral or recommendation. My question is something of this magnitude, can you help me understand why it didn’t rise to your investigation, or someone bringing that to your knowledge as far as saying this is a problem. Here she is again, Secretary Clinton lying under oath, specifically about our investigation. COMEY: We out of respect for the legislative branch being a separate branch, we do not commence investigation that focus on activities before Congress, without Congress asking us to get involved. That’s a long-standing practice of the Department of Justice and the FBI. So we don’t watch on TV and say we ought to investigate Joe Smith said this in front of the Committee. It requires the Committee to say we think we have an issue here, would you all take a look at it? WALKER: But with all due respect, if you have Secretary Clinton, who is under oath speaking about your very investigation, and you have talked about your wonderful staff and I certainly have a reason to deny that, why wouldn’t that rise to the level of suspicion, that here she is saying this under oath. I mean, lying under oath is a crime, is it not? COMEY: Yes. WALKER: And what is the penalty on that? Is that considered perjury? COMEY: Perjury, it’s a felony, I forget the exact, it’s potentially years in prison. WALKER: But, I don’t understand, would you help me understand why somebody wouldn’t have tipped you all off that she is talking about the very specific case, under oath, that you are investigating. COMEY: Well there is a difference between us being aware of testimony and us opening a criminal investigation to potential perjury. Again, it’s not this case in particular, but all cases. We don’t do that without a Committee saying we think there was an issue given in testimony to this separate branch of government. WALKER: You also mentioned earlier, and it’s been quoted several times, that no reasonable prosecutor would move forward with some of the facts. Is there any room at all that someone would differ a little bit on the opinion? I know that former United States Attorney General Michael Mukasey said, “would the illegal server disqualify her from ever holding any federal office?” So there are some people of high esteem that may differ, obviously not to the exact facts but can you make any room? You said no reasonable person, do you understand why the American people, or would you stand why other people may say that she has stepped across the line or broke enough law here, that you would come to a different conclusion? COMEY: Sure, I respect different opinions, my only point is, and I said earlier, I smile because those folks are my friends, I have worked with them for a long time. None of those guys, I believe in my position, knowing what I know, would think about it differently. But I also respect that they have a different view from the outside. ###
06.03.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – On Thursday, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored James McClary of Guilford County as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for June 2016. Each month, Congressman Walker honors a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in their community. Mr. McClary is the manager of a local Starbucks. He is a perfect example of how an ordinary person can be an extraordinary hero. James grew up with a grandmother who was the "candy lady" in their local neighborhood. When people were in need, she did not hesitate to give and she never expected anything in return. Although his grandmother has passed away, her motto that “giving is a blessing" is what drives him to reach his goal to help as many people as possible. He works with schools, churches and charities in the community to organize a number of drives throughout the year. From school supply drives, to winter coat collections, to Christmas toy fundraisers, he makes sure that kids and families don't have to make the choice of going without. His passion to reach people in need has even blessed a mother who had to leave her job to take care of her hospitalized son and young mothers who can't afford to buy basic necessities for their new child. He also organized a water drive to donate to families in Flint, Michigan this past year. “I am honored to award Mr. McClary with our June Community Hero Award for his passion to mobilize his own community to serve others,” Walker said. “I admire his selfless work and inspiring those around him to better their community. He never tires of lending a helping hand, whether to one person or 100 families, never expecting anything in return. No need is ever too small or far away to fill. He truly is a hero in our community.” ###
06.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) on Tuesday announced the successful appointments of seven students whom he nominated to the United States service academies earlier this year. Rep. Walker congratulated them at a reception in their honor. “These talented students are leaders inside and outside of the classroom. I am proud of what they have accomplished and how they have represented our community,” Walker said. “Each of them has displayed exceptional character and I wish them all the best as they embark on this next step.” The following nominees have accepted their appointments to service academies: U.S. Air Force Academy Ben Isley (Reidsville, N.C.) - Rockingham County High School Mary Luking (Reidsville, N.C.) - Rockingham County High School William Ragland (Oxford, N.C.) - J.F.

06.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today released the following statement, following the Department of Justice and the Department of Education failure to respond to a Congressional letter questioning the legality and implementation of the Obama Administration’s directive on public school bathrooms: “Their failure to respond to a letter that was signed by 79 Members of Congress is concerning. It shows once again that President Obama uses the federal bureaucracy to enforce his political agenda, with total disregard for the law. The directive on public school bathrooms has created much uncertainty for teachers, parents, and schools and getting answers to these questions are pivotal in keeping our schools and our communities safe.” On May 23rd, Congressman Walker joined 78 other Members of Congress in sending a letter to Department of Justice and Department of Education seeking clarification regarding their May 13th directive on public school bathrooms. The Congressman requested a reply by May 30th and has still yet to receive a response. The Department of Justice’s May 4th letter to North Carolina demanded a response by close of business on May 9th, providing North Carolina only three business days to reply. Congressman Walker’s letter provided significantly more time for a response.
05.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06), spoke at a press conference with Senator Mike Lee, Representative Jeb Hensarling and Representative Dave Brat as he introduced H.R. 5319, the Article I Regulatory Budget Act. “Over time, Congress has chosen, instead of engaging in hard work and putting your shoulder to the grind, to relinquish more of its lawmaking power to the federal agencies,” Walker said. “Now, this has become a way for lawmakers inundate and be a little bit less accountable and avoid the accountability to not get into the crux and make the difficult choices in votes. The result has been this: an out of control regulatory framework that has approximately $2 trillion dollars in cost on the economy and American small businesses every single year.” “This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be, this wasn’t the way it was designed. And it’s time to come to an end,” Walker added. “It’s time for Congress to reassert its constitutional rule making authority and bring accountability back to the process. That’s why today, we are here to introduce Article I Regulatory Budget. Again, this is a big day.” “It would effectively limit the cost regulations and expansion of the regulatory state. It would require Congress to set the regulatory burden budget for each federal agency,” Walker explained. “This is a first step for putting Congress back in charge of the federal regulatory state.” Watch the speech above and read the full transcript below: “I am from North Carolina, and it’s good to be here. As you might know, North Carolina has been in the news a little bit lately. We’re not running from that, and we’re proud of our governor who is working hard. “This is a big day. It may not grab every headline today, but this is establishing a precedent, a new way, really the old way for just bringing back great leadership. Certainly with Senator Lee and Congressman Hensarling. I appreciate both of your hard work on this, you’ve been great examples especially for some of the newer members that are coming in, that you can be, let me use this term, effectively conservative. Think about it again, that we can be effectively conservative and certainly that is something that we are striving to do. “I was talking to Senator Lee as we were getting ready to start and I said, ‘you know the amazing thing about this is this is non-partisan.’ Think about this, this isn’t tilted to one side or the other, this is non-partisan when it comes to returning the power to the people. “It is a privilege to be here, it always is to be at the Kirby Center. Thank you for such good work, you guys do a great job at hosting and bringing people in to encourage this and certainly share and get the word out. “This group came together under a similar idea. A group that I am very proud to be part of. Simply this, the Federal government as you’ve heard already, and I will reiterate has become unaccountable to the people that it serves. And really the crux of it is the diluted power of Congress. The people’s members that are sitting here is whose power has been diluted. “Over time, Congress has chosen: instead of to engage in hard work and put your shoulder to the grind and engage, it’s relinquished more of its lawmaking power to the federal agencies. “I serve on the House Oversight, I was here for three weeks when I realized there was a major issue when a presidential appointee by President Obama, Inspector General, is reaching out to our Republican led committee because for three years the EPA won’t respond to his letters. “There’s a little bit of an issue here. Now, this has become a way for lawmakers to inundate, and be a little bit less accountable, and avoid the accountability to not get into the crux and make the difficult choices in votes. The result has been this: an out of control regulatory framework that has approximately $2 trillion dollars in cost on the economy and American small businesses every single year. “For example, in 2014 the people’s elected representatives passed more than 3,000 pages of new laws while federal bureaucracies issue more than 80,000 pages of regulations. About 24 times as much. We’ve seen it even with this Administration, with this President, we went from 68,000 pages of IRS tax code to now over 75,000 pages tax code regulations. All without a single vote ever being cast, interestingly. “This isn’t the way it’s supposed to be, this wasn’t the way it was designed. And it’s time to come to an end. “That’s why I love working with these guys who are willing to step out and say it’s time to be accountable. It’s time for Congress to reassert its constitutional rule making authority and bring accountability back to the process. “We see it all the time, the overreach. In fact, it was two weeks ago, this Thursday we saw the President say he talked about how we were going to operate our bathrooms. “We immediately jumped on that. I was glad that 78 of my colleagues joined me with a letter to the President asking specifically how he planned to enforce this. Putting our teachers on the front lines of issues that were never designed to do so. “That’s why today, we are here to introduce Article I Regulatory Budget. Again, this is a big day. “It would effectively limit the cost regulations and expansion of the regulatory state. It would require Congress to set the regulatory burden budget for each federal agency. I’ll say that again. It requires Congress to set a regulatory burden budget for each federal agency. “I know there’s going to be some people in these agencies that aren’t thrilled to hear that; but nevertheless, it’s coming. “This is a first step for putting Congress back in charge of the federal regulatory state. “I want to continue to thank my colleagues. I am excited about this. This morning I’m in the middle of a Committee on Homeland Security markup, I will have to transition out. But these are the kinds of battles that we need to be engaging with. There’s a chance here to really change the course of how this place is governed. “Is it going to be easy, probably not? But the Members, these gentleman, and others, who are willing to fight, pick up the cause, continue to support them. We appreciate their courage. God bless you it’s always a privilege to be with you. Thank you very much.”
05.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) on Friday lead 78 Members of Congress in sending a letter to the Department of Education and the Department of Justice requesting more information on how they intend to enforce the directive issued on public school bathrooms by the Obama administration. The letter also requests answers on what authority they have to issue and enforce the new order. “Clarify specifically all actions that the ED and DOJ, jointly or separately, will take against or regarding a teacher, school administrator, educator, school contractor, or person volunteering at a school who does not comply with this guidance,” the letter states. “Delineate the statutory authority under which ED and DOJ issued this guidance.” “The Obama administration’s edict redefining long-standing definitions in Title IX is another clear overreach of the federal government. The federal government has no business making these decisions, much less, to threaten stripping federal funds from schools for not following their politically motivated orders,” Walker said. “It is the responsibility of our schools and teachers to create a safe and effective learning environment for every student and this action makes that goal unattainable. “We need to have answers on how, and on what standing, the Administration plans on enforcing this order. Getting those answers is critical in protecting our teachers, our students, and our families.” Read the letter in its entirety here and below: May 18, 2016 The Honorable Loretta Lynch Attorney General United States Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20530 The Honorable John King Secretary of Education United States Department of Education 400 Maryland Ave, SW Washington, DC 20202 Dear Attorney General Lynch and Secretary King, On May 13, 2016, the United States Department of Education (“ED”) and Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released significant guidance regarding the ED and DOJ’s interpretation of Title IX’s prohibition of sex discrimination in educational programs and activities operated by recipients of Federal financial aid. This guidance expands the ED and DOJ’s interpretations of sex discrimination to include not only an individual’s biological sex, but also an individual’s internal sense of gender. Specifically, the guidance states that: “As a condition of receiving Federal funds, a school agrees that it will not exclude, separate, deny benefits to, or otherwise treat differently on the basis of sex any person in its educational programs or activities unless expressly authorized to do so under Title IX or its implementing regulations. The Departments treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of Title IX and its implementing regulations. This means that a school must not treat a transgender student differently from the way it treats other students of the same gender identity.” Considering this guidance, please: Clarify specifically all actions that the ED and DOJ, jointly or separately, will take against or regarding a teacher, school administrator, educator, school contractor, or person volunteering at a school who does not comply with this guidance; Detail whether the ED and DOJ will recognize or accommodate rights of conscience and privacy in an individual’s or institution’s non-compliance with this guidance; List all actions that the ED and DOJ, jointly or separately, will take against or regarding a school, school district, or state in which a teacher, school administrator, educator, school contractor, or person volunteering at a school does not comply with this guidance; Detail all actions that a school, teacher, school contractor, and person volunteering must take to be in compliance with this guidance; Confirm whether ED and DOJ consider this guidance to be legally binding and whether ED and DOJ will report this guidance to Congress; Delineate the statutory authority under which ED and DOJ issued this guidance; Explain why schools must disregard the privacy, “discomfort,” and emotional strain imposed on other students during use of bathroom, showering, and changing facilities and overnight accommodations as these schools comply with this guidance; and Explain to what extent teachers, guidance counselors, school administrators, and parents and guardians of students were consulted regarding the implementation and effect of this guidance. We expect a reply by May 30, 2016, and we look forward to your response. Sincerely, Representative Mark Walker Representative Jeff Duncan Representative Paul Gosar Representative Gary Palmer Representative Joe Pitts Representative Richard Hudson Representative Jim Bridenstine Representative Doug Collins Representative Gregg Harper Representative Buddy Carter Representative Stephen Fincher Representative Trent Kelly Representative Brian Babin Representative Dave Brat Representative Steve Chabot Representative Kevin Cramer Representative Bill Huizenga Representative Barry Loudermilk Representative David Rouzer Representative Luke Messer Representative John Ratcliffe Representative Markwayne Mullin Representative Robert Pittenger Representative Vicky Hartzler Representative Daniel Webster Representative Doug Lamalfa Representative Bill Flores Representative Mark Meadows Representative Scott DesJarlais Representative Mike Rogers Representative Bill Posey Representative Jody Hice Representative Jason Chaffetz Representative Mia Love Representative Andy Barr Representative Trey Gowdy Representative Darin LaHood Representative Randy Neugebauer Representative Evan Jenkins Representative Lamar Smith Representative Peter Roskam Representative Kristi Noem Representative Adrian Smith Representative Mick Mulvaney Representative George Holding Representative John Fleming Representative Jeb Hensarling Representative Thomas Massie Representative Steve King Representative Pete Olson Representative Glenn Grothman Representative Sam Johnson Representative Steve Pearce Representative Mike Conway Representative Mike Bost Representative Randy Weber Representative Andy Harris Representative Bob Gibbs Representative Bruce Westerman Representative Walter Jones Representative Marlin Stutzman Representative Austin Scott Representative Trent Franks Representative John Moolenaar Representative Randy Hultgren Representative Rob Bishop Representative Ralph Abraham Representative Diane Black Representative John Duncan Representative Keith Rothfus Representative Rick Crawford Representative Jackie Walorski Representative Cynthia Lummis Representative Jason Smith Representative Mike Kelly Representative Chris Stewart Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers Representative Jim Jordan Representative Tim Huelskamp
05.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – On Wednesday, May 18th, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) attended the bill signing of H.R. 4923, the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act, a bill he was instrumental in helping pass. “One of my top priorities while serving North Carolina’s Sixth district is to increase jobs and improve the economy so small businesses in North Carolina can thrive. That’s why I am pleased to announce that Congress has passed this jobs-focused bill which provides much needed tax-relief to our local manufacturers and small businesses.” Walker said. “This bill will also allow our manufacturers and small businesses to free up their resources, hire more employees and grow overall business in our local communities. I look forward to the President signing this bill into law and am thankful for the opportunity to lead in the effort.” C.G. “Lieb” Oehmig IV, President and COO of Glen Raven, Inc. of Burlington, N.C. also released the following statement following the passage of the bill: “On behalf of every member of our Glen Raven family, I want to thank Congressman Walker for his leadership regarding MTB (Miscellaneous Tariff Bill). He demonstrated a willingness and patience to understand our position on the issue and how the lack of an MTB has impacted our business over the last four years.”
05.18.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announces changes to his communications staff, effective May 16, 2016. Jack Minor has been named Communications Director and will be based in both the Greensboro and Washington, D.C. offices. Minor succeeds Kyle Hall, who remains on staff as a part-time Field Representative and was appointed to the North Carolina General Assembly last year. “We are excited to have Jack join the team,” Walker said. “It is a top priority that my office is in constant communication with the people of North Carolina’s Sixth District and I look forward to the skills Jack will add to this great team of hard-working individuals,” Walker added. Prior to joining the Walker staff, Minor worked for the Ted Cruz presidential campaign, Rep. Dave Brat, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Heritage Action for America. He is a graduate of Elon University and a native of Catawba County, North Carolina.
05.09.2016	GREENSBORO, NC– U.S. Rep. Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following statement in response to Governor Pat McCrory’s request for declaratory judgment action and the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) letter to North Carolina alleging violations of federal law. “Gender identity is not included in the definition of sex discrimination as it relates to The Civil Rights Act, Title VII and Title IX,” said Walker. He continued, “the Obama administration cannot unilaterally rewrite federal statute or reverse engineer Congressional intent. With this letter, the DOJ has strayed well beyond their authority by trying to coerce North Carolina into compliance with DOJ’s preferred version of the law, and not the actual text. “Any confirmation or expansion of discrimination law should come from federal or state legislatures, and not by Executive Order. The North Carolina General Assembly was within its legal and constitutional rights in passing HB2, which clearly complies with all current federal requirements.”
04.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) introduced legislation Wednesday to ensure the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) maintains the same record-keeping standards as the department expects from the taxpayers. The bill received approval this morning from the House Oversight & Government Reform Committee. “The bridge of distrust between government and the American people is growing longer each day. Our government, especially the IRS, seems to operate under a different set of rules than what they expect from the American people,” Walker said. “The IRS expects citizens to maintain tax records ‘just in case’ they ever need it, yet the department isn’t required to uphold the same standard. The Ditto Act makes the IRS operate under the same set of rules that it requires of taxpayers,” Walker added. Under current law, the IRS requests taxpayers to maintain certain records or tax information for a minimum of three years in the event the department requests it. The Ditto Act (H.R. 4921) mandates that when the Internal Revenue Service requests records from a taxpayer, the department must maintain those records for at least three years. Further, the bill requires the IRS to maintain all additional records generated in relation to that produced record. The bill now moves to the House floor.
04.12.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. –U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and former U.S. Representative J.C. Watts met Monday with charitable, civic, and faith-based organizations in the Piedmont-Triad. The purpose of their visit was to discuss the issues surrounding poverty (hunger, homelessness, food deserts, etc.) and how to tackle such issues. “Greensboro and High Point are consistently ranked as one of the most impoverished areas in the nation,” Walker said. “One approach to dealing with poverty has always been to grow the size of government and create safety nets. My fear is that safety nets sometimes turn into spider webs by keeping people in a vicious cycle of poverty. J.C. Watts and I share a similar philosophy about dealing with these issues – a people-up approach rather than government-down. I look forward to continuing my work with Rep. Watts and our area’s charitable and civic organizations to ensure that we are helping those most in need,” Walker added. “Government seems to always measure success and compassion by how many people are on social programs. Congressman Walker and I believe that the best way to measure success and compassion is by how few people are on social programs,” Watts said. “We spend a $1 trillion a year on poverty programs, but we have a deeper poverty problem today than we did in 1965. During my visit to North Carolina, I’ve been impressed by the community and faith leaders who are taking charge to alleviate poverty and I applaud Congressman Walker for his work on this issue at home and in Washington,” Watts added. J.C. Watts served Oklahoma’s 4th District in the U.S. House from 1995-2003. From 1999-2003, Watts served as the Chairman of the House Republican Conference, the fourth-ranking position in the majority party. Watts is a graduate of the University of Oklahoma where he was an All-American quarterback for the Oklahoma Sooners. From 1981-86, Watts started for Ottawa and Toronto in the Canadian Football League. During the morning, Walker and Watts met with over 75 pastors and faith leaders in Greensboro to discuss the church’s role in the fight against poverty. In the afternoon, Walker and Watts toured Backpack Beginnings, a local nonprofit dedicated to providing children in need with nutritious food, comfort items or certain basic necessities through the use of backpacks and other efficient means. Walker and Watts ended the day meeting with Project Re-Entry at the Welfare Reform Liaison Project in Greensboro. Project Re-Entry assists former offenders returning to the community after serving prison sentences. Their objective is to help former offenders avoid the potential pitfalls associated with life after incarceration.
04.08.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed companion legislation to a bill introduced by U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) to combat government waste, fraud and abuse. The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1640) had previously passed unanimously in the U.S. House in June 2015. “Accountability is a fundamental aspect of a citizen-ruled government and something that our constituents expect their representatives to uphold,” Walker said. “I’m pleased that the Senate has stood with the House by passing the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act with strong bipartisan support. This bill continues to demonstrate my commitment to holding Washington accountable, cutting wasteful government spending, and ensuring our children are left with opportunity, not excessive debt,” Walker added. Since 2006, the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration have been working towards completing a consolidated headquarters. However, as with many other federal projects, the consolidation has run up against cost overruns and construction delays – at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. This bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, to investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property needs of the project. The bill now moves to the House for a final vote before heading to the President’s desk.
04.05.2016	BURLINGTON, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Richard and Jennifer Kaffenberger of Alamance County as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for April 2016. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Mr. and Mrs. Kaffenberger are teachers at Turrentine Middle School in Burlington. In 2011, the Kaffenbergers lost their son, Harry, from prescription drug misuse when he was 17 years old. Harry had taken his grandmother’s pain medication, as it was prescribed to her, and his body could not absorb it. Since this tragedy, the Kaffenbergers have dedicated their time and energy to educating others – especially parents and teens – about the dangers of prescription drug misuse. Their main message to youth is to avoid taking prescriptions not prescribed to them. To parents, they teach them to have conversations with their children about the dangers of prescription drugs just as they would teach them about illegal drugs, guns, or other dangerous items. In addition, the Kaffenbergers educate the public about prescription drug drop-off locations and encourage others to lock drugs away or dispose of them safely. “A hero is someone who tries to make a difference in people’s lives. For someone to pick that scab of heartache again and again just because it might help someone else – that’s a hero,” Walker said. “I can’t imagine experiencing the pain that Richard and Jennifer Kaffenberger felt when they lost their young son, Harry. Instead of keeping the darkest moment of their lives in the past, Richard and Jennifer are educating and engaging the community to avoid similar fates. I cannot thank Richard and Jennifer enough for what they are doing to save lives,” Walker added. Walker presented the Kaffenbergers a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during an event at Turrentine Middle School.
03.29.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announced today that Varun Nair and Ali Chaudhry are the winners of the 2016 Congressional App Challenge. The Early College at Guilford juniors’ application, CollegeNav, was selected from submissions received across the Sixth Congressional District. “It is always and honor and a privilege to highlight the extraordinary talents of our district’s young people to the national stage,” said Walker. “I was deeply impressed with Varun’s and Ali’s CollegeNav app and its usefulness for aspiring college students across the nation. In fact, I look forward to using this app as my family shops for the perfect colleges. I congratulate Varun and Ali and wish them much success in the future,” Walker added. Established by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this competition engages students from across the nation to encourage creativity and STEM education. It allows students the opportunity to compete with other students from their own Congressional district by creating and exhibiting their software application for mobile or computer devices on a platform of their choice. Varun Nair and Ali Chaudhry are juniors at the Early College at Guilford in Greensboro. Their application, CollegeNav, allows users to navigate college campuses by providing a database of campus infrastructure. It allows users to find friends on the same campus and learn more about specific buildings on a college campus. Nair’s and Chaudhry’s app will be featured on the U.S. House of Representative’s website (house.gov) and displayed in a U.S. Capitol exhibit.
03.28.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has reversed its abrupt decision to defer Equitable Sharing payments to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. The DOJ’s reversal comes after months of questioning from Walker’s office. In an email to Walker this morning, the DOJ stated, “Because of your office’s interest in this issue, we wanted to let you know…that the Department of Justice is pleased to announce that, effective immediately, the department is resuming equitable sharing payments to state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.” “This is a huge win, not just for North Carolina, but for law enforcement agencies across the country,” Walker stated. “I am proud of our staff for diligently pursuing these measures, but I am more elated that this reversal will allow sheriffs and law enforcement professionals in the Sixth District to better serve and protect the people of North Carolina,” Walker added. “The release of federal forfeiture funds back to local law enforcement by the Department of Justice is welcome news,” said Guilford County Sheriff B.J. Barnes. “Many law enforcement agencies, including the Guilford County Sheriff’s Office, count on these funds to buy equipment to allow them to continue our fight against the influx of drugs into our community. My thanks to Congressman Mark Walker and the other congressmen and senators who took a leadership role in making this outcome a reality,” Barnes added. “Several months ago, the DOJ abruptly decided to cease the Asset Forfeiture Program. This decision greatly impacted the Sheriff’s Office’s budget and our ability to fight against crime,” said Sheriff Sam Page. “The first phone call I made was to my congressman. Not only did Congressman Walker listen to our concerns, but he quickly responded. I’m excited that the DOJ has decided to reinstate this program so that my department and all law enforcement agencies across the nation can now better protect our citizens,” added Page. “The restoration of the Equitable Sharing Funds will serve as a boost to the morale of law enforcement professionals nationwide,” said Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson. “These monies were used by my agency in the past to purchase much needed equipment for the safety of our officers and the citizens of our communities. I am very thankful to God that we did not lose any officers because of the lack of safety equipment during the suspension of the Equitable Sharing Program. I would like to thank Congressman Mark Walker and all other elected officials for their efforts in restoring these funds for state, local and tribal law enforcement,” Johnson added.
03.21.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announced today that his congressional office returned over $55,000 of its allocated budget for 2015 to the taxpayers, continuing Congressman Howard Coble’s legacy of conservative office budgeting. "When I was elected to Congress in 2014, I made a pledge to reduce the size and scope of the federal government, while providing the quality service our constituents expect and deserve. I have tried to follow through on this pledge by not only supporting fiscally-responsible legislation, but also by implementing responsible budgeting for our own office," said Walker. "To quote Howard Coble: 'It's easy for someone to call themselves a fiscal conservative, but it's much more difficult to actually live up to that standard'." In his last two years in office, Coble returned $21,285.32 and $32,041.14 respectively. Walker returned $55,571.36 of the $1.242 million appropriated for his 2015 office budget. Over the last three decades, Representatives from the Sixth District have returned $1,859,901.43. Walker continued, “Hardworking American families and businesses are expected to budget and live within their means, and so should our government.” Since taking office, Rep. Walker has pursued cost-cutting efficiencies to stretch taxpayer resources. Walker operates two offices in North Carolina and one in Washington with a total of 13 full-time and 2 part-time staff members. In the counties without permanent office locations, Walker operates 11 mobile offices through partnerships with local governments.
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement following President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland: “President Obama has consistently ignored the American people by circumventing their elected representatives and implementing his agenda through unelected bureaucrats and executive orders. This Supreme Court vacancy has the potential to dramatically alter the court and reinforce President Obama’s failed agenda. While he does have every Constitutional right to nominate a candidate to the U.S. Supreme Court, it is just as important to realize that the Senate has a right to confirm or not confirm. The American people elected Republican majorities in Congress to restore our falling nation and govern from the bottom-up, not the government-down. We stand again at a time of great deliberation as we select our new Commander-in-Chief. I implore the Senate to stand their ground, give the voters a voice in this process, and allow the new President the opportunity to nominate a successor.”
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement following the passing of Representative Ralph Johnson (58th District) and former Senator Earline Parmon: “We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of State Representative Ralph Johnson and former State Senator Earline Parmon. Rep. Johnson served parts of Greensboro in the North Carolina House with honor and distinction for over a term. Senator Parmon served Forsyth County in the State House and State Senate for many years before assuming a role with Congresswoman Alma Adams. Both leaders were dedicated to improving Guilford County through such initiatives as eliminating food deserts and promoting quality education. Our thoughts and prayers are with their family and friends during this difficult time.”
03.07.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today hosted superintendents from across the 6th District to discuss federal education issues and the federal government’s impact on our local public school classrooms. “Our children deserve a quality education to one day compete in our new global economy,” said Walker. “I believe our classroom teachers, and ultimately parents, know how to best educate our students and not the federal bureaucrats in Washington cubicles, which is why I introduced the A-PLUS Act to restore local education authority. I look forward to continuing our partnerships with our local superintendents as we craft policies to best meet the needs for our local districts,” Walker added. Participants in today’s discussion were Dr. Travis Reeves, Surry County Schools, Dr. Rodney Shotwell, Rockingham County Schools, Dr. Greg Little, Mount Airy City Schools, and Ms. Nora Carr, Guilford County Schools. Topics discussed included Title I funding, child nutrition, and teacher shortages. Walker introduced H.R. 3421 A-PLUS Act (Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success) in July 2015. If passed, this legislation would give states maximum flexibility by allowing them to opt-out of federal mandates and programs while maintaining federal funding. “I appreciate the opportunity to discuss public education issues with Congressman Walker. Public education is a cornerstone of the American democracy and demands the full attention of federal and state officials. Our students deserve a great education that meets their personal needs and objectives,” said Dr. Travis Reeves, Superintendent of Surry County Schools. “The roundtable conversation was an excellent opportunity organized by Congressman Walker. This was a wonderful occasion to talk and share our concerns as a region. It was a productive conversation, and we truly appreciated the opportunity to discuss Title I funding, child nutrition, teacher shortages and the rural-urban divide. We look forward to a continuing the conversation. Anytime we can bring people together to talk about what is best for our students is a success for all involved,” said Dr. Rodney Shotwell, Superintendent of Rockingham County Schools. “It is no secret that investing in public education is one of the most important and impactful ways to shape a better future for our children and communities. GCS is committed to providing the best opportunities and advantages for our students. I know that by working together, we can reach even greater levels of excellence,” said Nora Carr, Interim Superintendent of Guilford County Schools. “I am so appreciative of Congressman Walker and his staff taking the time to discuss how we can improve our public schools. It will take all of us working together for our children to reach their full potential,” said Dr. Greg Little, Superintendent of Mount Airy City Schools.
03.01.2016	HIGH POINT, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored High Point’s Dr. Ben Williams and Mr. Raymond McAllister as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for March 2016. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Dr. Ben Williams and Mr. Raymond McAllister are active members of the High Point community and have a decades-long friendship. McAllister moved to High Point in 1958 after serving in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. He’s a retired parole officer and has served on numerous boards and commissions, most recently as Chairman of the Salvation Army Board. Williams has been a practicing dentist in High Point for over forty years. He moved to High Point in 1973 after earning his DDS from Howard University. After witnessing emergency room dental procedures and lack of payment from low income patients, McAllister and Williams joined efforts to launch a clinic to provide dental care for low income families. Through a partnership with the United Way, the clinic is anticipated to launch in July 2016. “When searching for our district’s Community Heroes, we seek those who are not necessarily on the front page of the newspaper or in search of adulation, but are genuinely making a difference in our communities,” said Walker. “Dr. Ben Williams and Mr. Raymond McAllister have been cornerstones of the High Point community for decades. When they saw a need to provide dental care for low income families, they sought the partnerships and funding needed to provide such services. I applaud them for their outstanding work in our community and I’m delighted to name them our March Community Heroes,” Walker added. Walker presented Williams and McAllister certificates and flags flown over the U.S. Capitol during an event at High Point University.
02.26.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) has been named the vice-chairman of the House Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. Walker will serve with Subcommittee Chairman Dan Donovan (NY-11). “I’m deeply honored to be selected to serve as the Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee vice-chair,” Walker said. “I look forward to working with Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mike McCaul and Subcommittee Chairman Donovan to help conduct rigorous oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and craft policies that will protect American citizens from potential threats,” Walker added. The Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Subcommittee oversees the Department of Homeland Security’s mission to enhance and sustain our National capabilities to prepare for, protect against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate terrorist attacks and other emergencies. The Subcommittee ensures that emergency responders have the vital resources necessary in order to accomplish their goals. In addition, the Subcommittee oversees the homeland security grant programs administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ensure these vital funds are distributed to those areas at greatest risk of attack.
02.08.2016	GREENSBORO, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) recently introduced a resolution to establish a Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs. He unveiled the legislation at an event this morning at Caldwell Academy in Greensboro. Rep. Walker released the following statement concerning the bill’s introduction: “Three years ago, I organized an event that honored our local veterans. I met with four WWII veterans and I was moved by all of their stories, but especially the story of my friend, Bill Beavers. Mr. Beavers was shot down on a bombing run over Germany and suffered greatly after being captured by the Germans and held as a Prisoner of War “I was moved by his emotion that still exists in sharing his story seven decades later. I think about it often and it has inspired me to take action in making sure that we are doing everything possible for our POWs and MIAs, as well as their families.” Rep. Walker introduced H.Res. 590, Establishing a Select Committee on POW and MIA Affairs, on January 25, 2016. If passed, H.Res. 590 would utilize existing U.S. House of Representatives funds to establish a select committee. The committee members, appointed by the Speaker, would be tasked with investigating all unresolved matters related to any United States personnel unaccounted for from conflicts ranging from World War II to the War on Terror. H.Res. 590 has the support of veteran organization Rolling Thunder and is co-sponsored by U.S. Representative Jeff Miller (FL-01), Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.
02.03.2016	Thank you and good morning. What a privilege it is to be here. As stated, I am from the great state of North Carolina, “The Old North State.” This is an exciting week for us, we are in Super Bowl 50. I don't know if there is anyone from Colorado here today, I met a few…you guys seem to be a little higher than us most of the time, but… (laughter). I have been asked to speak a little bit on the social issues— which, admittedly, covers a lot of ground. There are hot-topics and really in some cases, very emotional issues. But today, my hope is not just to discuss these social issues, but to talk about “the what, the how, and the why” of the social values and the traditional values that are the foundation, that I believe, of this country. First, I’d like to outline the highlights of what I believe our focus should be regarding these issues. Secondly, I’d like to look into maybe how we should effectively communicate and implement these strategies. And finally, I’d like to leave you with an appeal. An appeal of why these issues are important to the future fabric of our nation. Fighting for these values is a noble purpose…it is a purpose of hope. And historically, men and women throughout the history of our country have been called to stand up for these principles by which we believe. You see, for the last few decades, our culture has been inundated, and continues to be inundated by the undoing of our communities— the taking of unborn lives, the growing population of hungry children, restrictive education opportunities…and really, the list goes on and on. Some people may want to argue about the intentionality, of the LGBA, and all of the social programs that came out of the 1960’s. Whether you want to argue whatever side…whether it was intentional to do damage or it wasn’t, the truth is, the test results are in. After 50 years, we know the answers now. And we cannot deny that the federal government has hijacked the American Dream and the family has been decimated. We see this in our communities. You are gathered here today… Heritage Foundation exists today, because of the concern for the potential of the catastrophic future that is destined for our children and for generations to come…and you guys are willing to step up and help fight the fight. So, let’s look at that “what,” that “how,” and that “why.” In advancing our conservative course, what is the best strategy or the best approach? You know, during a presidential campaign, we hear much about The American Dream. In fact, in nearly every town hall, in everything that is used it is a part of the cliche in the speech. But the American Dream is social at its very nature. It begins with life. Common sense tells us any organization, any business, a flower, most important…life is the beginning of any opportunity. It is our most foundational right. If we will not fight for the most basic human rights, then what else are we trusted to fight for? This may be the greatest human rights issue of our day. And if we truly believe in such noble things like freedom and opportunity, then we mush push forward, hand-in-heart, to eliminate every tax-payer dollar that goes into Planned Parenthood. There is no other freedom-robbing, opportunity-destroying, and life-killer that is more intentional than Planned Parenthood. And I know those are strong words, and I understand that. But I remember just a few months ago, in the House Oversight Committee which I am privileged to serve on to hold some of the agencies responsible. And sitting just eight to ten feet in front of me, was Cecile Richards, the director of Planned Parenthood. And when it came to my time of questioning, I asked her this, “Ms. Richards, are you concerned or does it bother you that there are more African American babies aborted in New York State than there are born?” And as you would expect, her answer was ambiguous and she acted like this was the first time she had ever heard of that. But, obviously she doesn’t agree with us, when it comes to life and the inherent freedoms for the individual. You see, our freedom to live and work in accordance to what we believe has been placed in the crosshairs by an administration that mocks those who dare cling to their guns and Bible. Speaking of religious freedom, it is an essential element of the core of this country. Americans, past and present, have sacrificed much to preserve it. Those of us in Washington, I’m talking about Members of Congress, should be willing to do the same. Life, religious liberty…the American Dream has a very clear point of growth…the community. And the building block of the community is the family. The family, which is the very starting point for education! Now, as a pastor for nearly two decades, we can spend the rest of our time in Q&A talking about the breakdown of the family. But let’s be very clear, no one knows better about educating their children than the family, than the parents. So that’s why, as you heard earlier, I was proud to lead the efforts on the A+ Act, even though we were told this was a futile effort…we’re going to get there, and I think it is going to be sooner rather than later. Until we focus on these values…like life, community, religious liberty, education, and the family…the American people will continue to hunger for hope. And how do I know this? Because I’ve lived it. Over the years, we’ve taken dozens of groups into places like Cleveland, New York City, and Baltimore. I remember specifically in working with the Neo360 Organization out of Cleveland, and as we began to prepare to take nearly 60 people in there to work in sports camps and even refurbish an elementary school in the heart of Cleveland, I remember discussing with the folks… “what is it that we can bring? What is it that we can do to make a difference?” And I shall never forget the response; “Just bring us hope.” Now how sad is that…that we have major cities in our country that are looking and desperate for hope? And listen, I’m not going to paint a rosy picture this morning…that all it will take is a little bit of tweaking here or a little bit there. We have drifted away from the very founding documents by which our country was created. Nearly 400 years ago, 395 years ago, The Mayflower Compact stated this, “In the Northern parts of Virginia, in the presence of God, and one another, we covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body…” They had hope in their faith, their families, and their community. Standing firm on their faith, these documents were written to systematically protect their most precious values, given to them by the hand of God. The truth is, the folks in this room, you know these issues…whether it’s the battle of Roe vs. Wade, the failed war on poverty, educational failures…but it is rare that we are gaining ground. Only in small pockets. So, if we transition from the “what” to the “how,” I would have to ask the question, “are we satisfied with continuing to take our message, in my vernacular, they use the term ‘preaching to the choir?’” We have to look beyond that! So, how do we take it to our communities? How do we get it to alter the course that is leading us down a treacherous path? I am convinced that there is a path. And there is a “how.” But it is going to take surgical-like precision to be able to pull this off. There are two approaches, I believe…and this is the crux of what I want to talk to you about today. Two approaches, one vertical and one horizontal. The vertical approach is the “what” or the “how” we can direct to our political leaders, to this current administration, to political organizations that wish to do us harm. Whether that message is coming from Washington DC, or whether it is coming from college campuses. Recently we have heard a lot about the term “anger.” They tell conservatives that we cannot be angry any more. You just have to be “OK” with everything. It’s that tolerance mentality. Let me tell you folks today, in my opinion, it’s OK to be angry. It’s OK to talk about what needs to be done. The majority of our classrooms are being indoctrinated left and right, from kindergarten through post-graduate work with this progressive secularism. Instead of teaching our children to view the world through the eyes of truth, we are teaching them things like more political correctness, more tolerance is OK. I’m upset about that. I hope that you are, as well. I’m angry about that! Listen, Martin Luther King said that he preaches better when he is angry. The great American author from the twentieth century, Keith Miller, once said, listen… “there never was a social change in America without angry people at heart.” Patrick Henry, the great words, “give me liberty or give me death!” He wasn’t negotiating at that point! Now, in September, one of the times where I was really amazed here in Washington…being here 13 months, my colleague, Trent Franks, introduced what is called the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. And as I watched that being introduced into the House…the most human rights bill imaginable…that if a baby is to survive an abortion […] that our health care officials would fight to sustain its life. And as I sat there and watched 177 Members of Congress vote against that, I knew then, that it was going to take some intentionally. And sometimes to even be angry about this. Especially when it comes to our most basic human rights. As our liberties erode, it is sometimes that emotion that motivates us to be able to stand and fight. Anger is a very powerful fuel when it is focused in the right direction. Now, in high school I was able to play some football, played quarterback at a smaller school…and I remember tearing out of that tunnel there…you were just ready to go. Whatever it took, you were getting out there and you were charging, it usually lasted for about two or three plays. As the quarterback, when you get hit in the earhole by the defensive tackle, you realize that as angry and as emotional as you are…you better have a game plan to succeed. And that’s the point that I’m making, it’s not just the vertical approach…that it is OK to hold the leaders accountable, but the true success that I believe, comes from that horizontal approach. How do we succeed in sharing these social values to these communities. I think there are three quick answers, or three ways to do this, and then I’ll move towards my closing remarks. But let me talk about the first one. Be discerning. In life, it takes discernment. The last that you probably want to hear from a politician is about discernment. You know, in Washington, sometimes we are not very discerning where we put our servers…whether it is in the bathroom […] or on personal property. Be discerning. Sharing truth in a harsh or wrong context, horizontally, with our friends, our families or our coworkers, can actually do more damage. I ask the question, what is our ultimate goal in being able to communicate? Is it to make progress? Well, let me give you a real life example, alright? There are a lot of men, a lot of guys in the room. Real life example here: your wife comes home and she’s rocking this new hair cut or new hair color, OK? Alright? And you’re getting ready to be asked that proverbial question, now, if you haven't already noticed, you are already in trouble as it is. But, when she asks you, “how do you like my hair?” You have a choice to make. You may be thinking that her hair would look better on a unicorn somewhere, but in that moment, you are using discernment to decide when and how you present the truth of those facts. Now, there’s a little silliness, but there is an important point here. Discernment is crucial to having long-term success in communicating our message, laterally, in that horizontal way I am talking about. Not only is it important to be discerning, but you also want to be compassionate. I think this is important. People who are informed at the level that you are can be two dimensional. We can hold those leaders accountable, those who are making these decisions, but at the same time, we have the ability to horizontally share that compassion. At the heart of that compassion, is this… if I truly care for my fellow man, there’s a patience, a compassion, that I am willing to exhibit because I hope for that opportunity to share those truths, those social values that have made us great. This compassion is crucial to successfully communicating why life matters, why education matters. Sometimes in taking that same rage, anger, emotion horizontally, can instead to damage. You know that old adage that people don’t care how much you know until you show how much you care? It’s true! This past Saturday evening, I officiated a wedding due to years of building relationships, in my community there in High Point, North Carolina. And a lot of times, we use that common passage…not from “TWO Corinthians,” but from “one” Corinthians, right there in chapter thirteen. It makes you wonder if you’d get Article I and Article II mixed up Was that okay to say here? Okay, but it talks a lot about [how] you can really change the world, you can give your body to be burned, you can speak with tongues of men and angels, you can accomplish so much; but if you don’t have the compassion, most of you know what it says – it profits you nothing. So we’re trying to share and we’re trying to communicate. This is very important. I love the visual that the writer of Corinthians, Paul, gives us there when he says it’s like clanking brass. Now, speaking a little bit of that musical background, these clanking symbols they can be a nice add in an orchestra or they can be totally destructive. See, for a while I thought that meant that that instrument was worthless. It’s not that it’s worthless, but if it’s the loudest instrument, sometimes it can be damaging. So, I thought about this. This is something that I want to take with us. It’s okay to be a loud voice, as long as you’re doing more than just making noise. Let me say that again. We see this sometimes in politics. It’s okay to be a loud voice, as long as you’re doing more than just making noise. I have a great friendship with Mike Lee. Mike Lee is a wonderful mentor, and is doing great work for you and this country. Let me tell you that right now. The reason I like Mike Lee, it’s not just that he’s a conservative; he’s an effective conservative. That’s what I mean – it’s okay to be a loud voice, but do more than just make noise. I think that’s important when it comes to this line of thinking as far as being compassionate. You have to see the need. The young lady who’s facing the toughest decision in her life. My wife Kelly is a family nurse practitioner and worked several years—still flies in the helicopter—works in a level one trauma center and has so many encounters, to see society, to see the brokenness, to see the hurt. Do we look at it from just the political perspective or can we be genuine enough to build that relationship, to be able to share the compassion to be able to share what is important to us—hope. H-O-P-E. One of the very first things I did when I got elected, I launched the Hope commission. Healthcare, opportunity, poverty and education. It’s okay for republicans to talk about those issues. One idea, I went to the different communities—in fact, I’m not afraid to tell you, it is made up of 16 members and is led by a Democrat who endorsed me—an African American pastor with 4,000 members in his church. We have to talk about these issues. Why wouldn’t we want to? We have the truth on our side. To be able to share what is important. To be able to go into these communities. One of the greatest privileges that I have is to go into some of these places and they have never heard of individual liberty, they’ve never heard about hope and opportunity. The only thing they’ve heard is how they should grow up and be dependent on a federal government for every need: Physically, financially, emotionally and even spiritually. That’s the opportunity that we have when we are compassionate. And finally the third one: Not only be discerning and be compassionate, but be engaged. You’re here today because you have already taken up the mantle to be engaged. You’re doing everything that you can to make a difference. Sometimes that even means learning a different language. It wasn’t too long ago when we were in Japan visiting some different military installations and we went out to a restaurant and—as you get to talking sometimes—well the chef is doing all this crazy stuff on the grill and all of a sudden, I realize that there is something that is getting ready to land on my plate that has two eyes and is looking at me. It’s called Abalone, which is a Japanese snail. Now while some of you may enjoy that, but if I could have spoken the language, I would have said “give that to the man sitting to my left,” but I couldn’t do that. Now, that’s a little silliness there to make my point that it is important that we don’t just talk at people, but that we talk with people—to learn to understand the language—and sometimes that takes patience and sacrifice—but most importantly we have to engage to get that point. I walked away from a ministry career, took no salary for a year to run for office and share these foundational truths that I believe can make a difference. WE have to continue to talk about these issues. But we only win back to hearts by being discerning, showing compassion and staying engaged. Don’t look past people. I’ve done that, I’m guilty of that. A friend of mine by the name of Tom texts me every morning with a short devotional thought. But there was a time when I looked past him and he called me out on it one day. We were doing some ministry things and he was my assistant as we were coaching little league basketball. And just in my radar of life; he was a good guy but I really didn’t take the time to know him. A couple of years later, our paths crossed again and he told me—he was honest with me—he said, Mark, you looked past me. I had to think about that, and I had to say Tom, you’re right, I did. And you know why, he wasn’t within my sphere of where I was headed and God used that to convict my heart and make sure that people that intersect our lives—that we don’t look past them but instead we use it as an opportunity to share our values. The moral foundation of this country is undeniable because our rights are not derivative from man. As you believe, they come from Almighty God. And here’s what I’ve come to realize and this is my closing challenge to you today: what is the cost? I was talking with a few members a few months ago and it began to dawn on me that this doesn’t get resolved, that the solutions that we are looking for is not going to be more money, its not going to be another piece of legislation. It may require a lifetime commitment. I had to think about that. Am I willing to spend the rest of my life to make a difference—rather than to just to make noise—to communities and people who don’t hear the message that we do? The fertile soil is not Washington, it’s your families, it’s your neighborhood. And if the wind is going to unfurl the sails of this great nation once again, it must be led through our local citizens, our homes, our towns, our churches, and not from this overreaching arm of the federal government. But I am convinced that if we discover just a fraction of that indomitable spirit, our great nation can once again sail majestically. The time is now, may god provide the path and may we have the courage to follow. God Bless you. Thank you very much.
02.03.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) delivered a keynote address this morning at the Heritage Action Conservative Policy Summit. Rep. Walker was one of only two U.S. House members – the other being Speaker Paul Ryan – to deliver a keynote address at the conference. His address focused on the American civil society. The following excerpts are from Rep. Walker’s speech today: “Our federal government has hijacked the American Dream and the family has been decimated. The American Dream is ‘social’ at its very nature and I firmly believe that it begins with the most foundational right of life. Yet, if we truly believe in such noble things as life, freedom, and opportunity, then we must push forward, heart-in-hand, to eliminate every taxpayer dollar from funding Planned Parenthood. There is no other life-killer, freedom-killer, or opportunity-killer that is more intentional than Planned Parenthood. Until we refocus on the values of life, community, religious liberty, education and the family, the American people will still be hungry for hope. I am convinced that we can refocus on these values, but we must use surgical-like precision to successfully weave the social values back into our society. Discernment, compassion, and engagement are about building relationships with those who don’t see the world the way that we do. Writing a check or passing new legislation is a very small part. In fact, the fertile soil is not in Washington; rather, it’s with your families, your neighborhoods, your communities and your churches. It must be led through our local citizens, our homes, our towns, and our churches and not from the overreaching arm of a freedom-devouring government. A video of Rep. Walker’s speech will be available on his official YouTube channel later today: @RepMarkWalker. A transcript will be available on his website: walker.house.gov. Rep. Mark Walker is currently serving his first term in the U.S. House and represents North Carolina’s 6th Congressional District. In the current 114th Congress, Rep. Walker serves on the House Committees on Oversight and Government Reform, Homeland Security, and Administration. He is the first freshman House member to pass a bill, The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015, which was signed into law as the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. Prior to being elected in 2014, Rep. Walker served as the Pastor of Worship & Music at Lawndale Baptist Church in Greensboro. He and his wife, Kelly, a flight trauma nurse, reside in Greensboro with their three children.
02.01.2016	ARARAT, N.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Surry County’s Brent Simpson and Homeplace Recreational Park as the Sixth District Community Heroes of the Month for February 2016. Rep. Walker presented Mr. Simpson and Mr. Rudy Key, owner of Homeplace Recreational Park, certificates and flags flown over the U.S. Capitol during an event at the park. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Brent Simpson, along with his late neighbor Paul Key, launched Handicamp. This summer camp provides children and adults with mental and developmental disabilities a weekend of relaxation and outdoor recreation. Simpson continues to organize the camp, raise donations, and provide fun and educational activities thirty years since the camp’s inception. Homeplace Recreational Park has hosted the summer camp each of the past thirty years. “When choosing our monthly Community Hero, I seek individuals who aren’t necessarily on the front page of the paper, but are behind-the-scenes making a difference in our community,” said Walker. “Brent Simpson and Homeplace Recreational Park – as well as the late Paul Key –displayed extraordinary acts of service to Surry County when they launched Handicamp. Their thirty years of service and dedication to our mentally and physically disabled communities is commendable and I’m honored to present them this recognition,” Walker added. More information about Handicamp can be found on Homeplace Recreational Park’s website: www.homeplacepark.com/handicamp.
01.29.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) is scheduled to deliver a keynote address at the Heritage Action Conservative Policy Summit on Wednesday, February 3rd. Rep. Walker is one of only two U.S. House members – the other being Speaker Paul Ryan – slated to deliver a keynote address at the conference. His address will focus on the American civil society. “Building a strong civil society is about more than government policies,” said Walker. “As conservatives, we believe society is deeply personal – driven by people and relationships. I am honored to share my thoughts at the Heritage Action Conservative Policy Summit on how we can advance a conservative civil society while expanding our audience in this new era. Ending intergenerational poverty, reversing the erosion of the family, empowering families on education and health care and valuing all stages of life – these essential issues demand compassion, devotion and intentionality from conservatives,” Walker added. Rep. Walker has been asked to join Speaker Paul Ryan, Senator Joni Ernst (IA) and Senator Ben Sasse (NE) in discussing positions on leadership, economy, defense and social issues. Heritage Action will livestream the event on their website at heritageaction.com. C-SPAN will also broadcast live coverage. Rep. Walker’s address is scheduled to begin at approximately 10:00 AM EST on Wednesday, February 3rd.
01.14.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announced today that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has agreed to release asset forfeiture funds to the Alamance County Sheriff’s Department. The funds had been withheld from the department due to ongoing litigation by the DOJ beginning December 2012. Less than two weeks after Rep. Walker confronted Asst. Attorney General Peter Kadzik during a House Oversight & Government Reform Committee hearing, the DOJ relinquished its position. “Following the court’s rulings in favor of the Alamance County Sheriff’s Department, our office has been working with Sheriff Johnson for months to urge the Justice Department to release the county’s overdue funds,” Walker said. “Law enforcement, regionally and nationally, have been put through a great deal of stress by this administration and I’m delighted to be afforded the opportunity to stand up for these men and women that serve with distinction. More importantly, I’m pleased that Sheriff Johnson and his department can move forward and continue protecting the citizens of Alamance County,” Walker added. The county is expected to receive approximately $350,000 according to the Alamance County attorney. Rep. Walker and Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson will hold a joint press conference at the Alamance County Sheriff’s Department on Friday, January 15 at 3:00PM to further discuss this matter. Watch Rep. Walker’s questioning of the Asst. Attorney General.

01.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following statement following President Obamaâ€™s veto of The Restoring Americansâ€™ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, a bill that repealed the Affordable Care Act and defunded Planned Parenthood: â€œIâ€™m disappointed that President Obama insists on maintaining the status quo and defending a law that the American people never asked for, never wanted, and never intended would have such drastic consequences. His veto today demonstrates that he is unwilling to work with the peopleâ€™s Congress to find common ground and that he is oblivious to the many flaws of the Affordable Care Act. We must continue to hold President Obama and his Administration accountable for a law that continues to place a severe burden on the hardworking families and businesses of North Carolinaâ€™s 6th District.â€
01.07.2016	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) is accepting applications from high school students residing in the 6th Congressional District to participate in the Congressional App Challenge. Established by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this competition engages students from across the nation to encourage creativity and STEM education. It allows students the opportunity to compete with other students from their own Congressional district by creating and exhibiting their software application for mobile or computer devices on a platform of their choice. Students may compete as individuals or in teams of up to four. Students entering the competition must submit their appâ€™s source code online by midnight on January 15, 2016 EST. They must also provide a video demo explaining their app and what they learned through this competition process. The apps will be judged by a panel of local judges who work in academia, software, and business. The winning studentâ€™s or teamâ€™s app from North Carolinaâ€™s 6th Congressional District will be featured on the U.S. House of Representativeâ€™s website (house.gov) and displayed in a U.S. Capitol exhibit. For additional details and submission instructions, visit https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/congressional-app-challenge-nc-02-rep-walker/. For questions regarding the 6th Districtâ€™s Congressional App Challenge, please contact Rudy Olivo in Rep. Walkerâ€™s Greensboro office at 336-333-5005.
01.06.2016	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today voted on a budget reconciliation package that repeals Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood. This vote comes after months of pressure from Rep. Walker for a repeal vote through the budget reconciliation process and marks the first time both chambers of Congress approve an Obamacare repeal measure. â€œFive years ago, the Democrats pushed Obamacare onto the backs of hardworking families and businesses through the budget reconciliation process without a single Republican vote,â€ Walker said. â€œIâ€™m proud that we have stood firm and honored our commitments to do whatever possible to repeal Obamacare. Itâ€™s time for President Obama to explain to the American people â€“ for the first time ever in his presidency â€“ why we deserve his cost increases and poor quality of care,â€ Walker added. â€œRepresentative Mark Walker took a lot of heat but fought strong for Obamacare repeal,â€ stated Dan Holler, Vice President of Communications and Government Relations for Heritage Action. Since passage of Obamacare in 2009, Republicans pledged to fully repeal Obamacare. However in November, despite repeated warnings and appeals by Rep. Walker and his colleagues, the U.S. House passed a reconciliation package that only repealed 6 of Obamacareâ€™s 419 sections, or 1.4% of the law. In December, the Senate passed their version of the budget package (52-47) that cut five times more funding and repealed six times more of Obamacareâ€™s taxes. The Restoring Americansâ€™ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act that passed today maintains the repeals made by the Senate and is estimated to reduce the federal deficit by $516 billion (according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office). In addition, this bill restricts Medicaid funding for abortion providers affiliated with Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The bill passed today 240-181 and will be the first time President Obama has been forced to either sign or veto such legislation, reigniting the health care reform debate.
01.04.2016	WENTWORTH, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Rockingham Countyâ€™s Janet Rakestraw as the Sixth District Community Hero of the Month for January 2016. Rep. Walker presented Ms. Rakestraw a certificate and a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol during an event Monday morning at Wentworth Town Hall. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Janet Rakestraw currently volunteers for World Changers of Rockingham County. This organization uses student volunteers to repair or rehabilitate low-income housing. With the assistance of host churches, Ms. Rakestraw coordinates the logistics for the Rockingham County program by providing housing and meals for the youth participants. This summer, over 189 youth from all over the nation are signed up to serve in Rockingham County. Ms. Rakestraw previously served as a public school teacher and guidance counselor for 18 years. She was instrumental in starting the Prom Promise Breakfast at Rockingham County High School and also helped initiate alternatives to long-term suspension. In addition, she was part of a team that worked with local colleges to start programs where high school students can earn college credit. â€œJanet Rakestraw is an example of the difference one person can make over a lifetime of community service,â€ said Walker. â€œShe impacted the lives of countless young people through the initiatives she pioneered as a school guidance counselor, and she continues to make a difference by facilitating summer youth projects that challenge our youth to grow, learn, and serve others. It is my honor to name her as this monthâ€™s Community Hero,â€ Walker added. More information about World Changers of Rockingham County can be found on their Facebook page.
12.18.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) voted today against the omnibus spending bill in the House. This 2,000+ page bill spends over $1 trillion over the next nine months and continues to waste taxpayersâ€™ money on bloated, wasteful and ineffective priorities. â€œThe omnibus continues to violate the American peopleâ€™s trust by continuing Washingtonâ€™s habits of increased debt and dysfunction,â€ said Walker. â€œAs President Obama enters his final year in office, this vote may have been our last opportunity to stand against the Obama regime in regards to stopping the funding of his promised â€˜transformation.â€™ My constituents sent me to Washington on the pledge of reviving our economy and reducing the government. This omnibus does not fit that pledge,â€ Walker added. The omnibus spends $1.149 trillion over the next nine months. It fails to divert federal dollars from Planned Parenthood to other womenâ€™s health care facilities, defund President Obamaâ€™s de facto amnesty, curb harmful regulations, or repeal Obamacare. Although the bill does advance some meaningful Republican priorities â€“ such as strengthening the Visa Waiver Program, prohibiting new funding for Obamacare, and blocking EPA overreach â€“ its good intentions only serve as Washington talking points that virtually ignore the threats our nation faces from enemies abroad and President Obamaâ€™s ideology at home. The bill passed the House today 314-112.
12.09.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today supported The Treatment of Certain Payments in Eugenics Compensation Act through the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, of which he is a member. This bipartisan legislation protects federal benefits for compensated eugenics victims. â€œWe will never be able to justify North Carolinaâ€™s sterilization program, nor will we be able to delete this page of our stateâ€™s history. However, we can acknowledge these injustices and make restitutions,â€ Walker said. â€œI applaud Senator Tillis for leading this effort in North Carolina and in Washington. This bill should serve as a reminder that every life is precious and I look forward to seeing its passage in the House,â€ Walker added. State-run eugenics and compulsory sterilization laws victimized more than 60,000 Americans in 33 states from the 1920s to the 1970s. State governments often targeted specific groups for sterilization, including unmarried women, African-Americans, and children from poor families Victims were often sterilized without their consent or knowledge. In 2013, North Carolina became the first state to pass legislation creating a fund to compensate living victims of the stateâ€™s sterilization program. North Carolina victims were awarded their first compensation payment of approximately $20,000 each in 2014. The second eugenics compensation payments of an additional $15,000 were awarded last month. The Treatment of Certain Payments in Eugenics Compensation Act was originally introduced in the Senate by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Tom Carper (D-DE). This legislation will help assist living eugenics victims receiving compensation payments by excluding their payments from being used in determining eligibility for, or the amount of, federal public benefits such as Medicaid, Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, Supplemental Security Income, and SSI-Disabled. Without this legislation, many eugenics victims who receive compensation payments could see their federal benefits reduced or even have their eligibility eliminated. The bill passed the Senate last week with unanimous support and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. It now heads to the House floor.
12.08.2015	Repealing Obamacare is one of the most unifying and politically advantageous issues for Republicans. We have won historic Congressional majorities based on how terrible the law is for small businesses and families. The law is doing irreparable harm to our nationâ€™s healthcare system and economic future. Republicans have made our case to the American people (convincingly, as a consistent majority of Americans oppose the law) and we have promised to do everything possible to repeal as much as possible of Obamacare. But the House missed its chance. As passed through budget reconciliation, our version of Obamacare repeal only addressed 6 of 419 sections of the law â€“ or 1.4%. As the â€œmore conservative bodyâ€, our constituents and the American people deserved more than this hollow effort. We ducked the tough issues â€“ mostly because House Leadership claimed we couldnâ€™t do more because of the Senateâ€™s â€œByrd Rule.â€ Senator Mike Lee and I have been working on repeal through reconciliation for months and those excuses were never convincing. Medicaid expansion, additional taxes and billions in spending were ignored in the House version and (inexcusably) left intact. Last week, the Senate proved House Leadershipâ€™s assertions incorrect and decided to make good on Republican promises of repealing Obamacare and establishing meaningful health care reform. The Senate bill actually had teeth â€“ it wasnâ€™t designed to make the Chamber of Commerce happy. I commend the Senate for stepping up and passing a reconciliation bill that truly repeals the infrastructure of Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood, instead of simply rubberstamping the Houseâ€™s inadequate attempt at repeal. Now itâ€™s time for the House to act quickly. Letâ€™s get the Senate version to the floor and to the Presidentâ€™s desk. We can force a national debate on the Presidentâ€™s namesake law and itâ€™s a debate we know we can win. Published in The Hill
12.07.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Wanda Curley as the North Carolina Sixth Congressional District Community Hero of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Greensboroâ€™s Wanda Curley, an Autism Resource Specialist with the Autism Society of North Carolina, was selected as the December Community Hero of the Month. â€œWhether it is hosting support groups, educating the public, or lending her expertise to parents of children with autism, Wanda Curley is a prime example of what it means to truly make a difference in our community,â€ Walker said. â€œIâ€™m inspired by her dedication to empowering and educating families who are part of the autism community,â€ Walker added. Curly is the parent of an adult child with autism. She began working with the Autism Society of North Carolina as a local leader in Guilford County. Her role now includes direct support to families and professionals across the region. The organization has 18 Autism Resource Specialists â€“ all parents of children with autism â€“ who provide these services and more.
12.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement following President Obamaâ€™s Oval Office Address on Sunday, December 6, 2015: "President Obama owes the American people a clear strategy in dealing with ISIS and the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism. Like many others, I listened intently to hopefully hear a decisive plan, but only heard that we will continue to stay the course and hope for better days. Radical Islamic extremists have a plan and the entire world is aware of it. The unwillingness to adopt a comprehensive strategy by President Obama is another prime example of his Administrationâ€™s failed foreign policy."
12.04.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following statement in response to the passage of a budget reconciliation bill in the U.S. Senate yesterday evening, which repealed significantly more of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) than the reconciliation bill passed by the U.S. House in October. â€œI commend the Senate for stepping up and passing a reconciliation bill that truly repeals the infrastructure of Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood, instead of simply rubberstamping the Houseâ€™s inadequate attempt at repeal,â€ Walker said. Since passage of Obamacare in 2009, Republicans pledged to fully repeal Obamacare. Further, in order to pass the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Resolution, House Leadership promised that the resolutionâ€™s passage would arm Congress with the tool of budget reconciliation â€“ a process capable of bypassing the filibuster â€“ for the express purpose of repealing Obamacare. However, despite repeated warnings and appeals by Rep. Walker and his colleagues, the U.S. House passed a reconciliation package that fell terribly short of the promise Republicans made to the American people. The House version only repealed 6 of Obamacareâ€™s 419 sections, or 1.4% of the law, and left major sections of the law intact. House Leadershipâ€™s attempts to blame the Senateâ€™s â€œByrd Ruleâ€ for their unwillingness to take tough votes and really push for full repeal were exposed with yesterdayâ€™s vote in the Senate. The Senate bill cuts five times more funding and repeals six times more of Obamacareâ€™s taxes that are crippling small businesses and hindering our economy. The Senate reconciliation package passed 52-47. â€œAs the â€˜more conservative body,â€™ our constituents and the American people deserved more than the hollow repeal bill from the House. The Senate proved House Leadershipâ€™s assumptions incorrect and decided to make good on our promises of repealing Obamacare and establishing meaningful health care reform. I will continue to lead on this issue and call on the House to take up and pass the Senate version as soon as practical,â€ Walker added.
11.23.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) has introduced the Define It to Fight It Act, a bill that withholds ten percent of United States funding to the United Nations until the intergovernmental organization adopts a definition for â€œinternational terrorism.â€ â€œSince the 9/11 attacks, the United Nations should have been leading a global response to the increasing threat of terrorism, but they fail to even provide a simple definition to the term â€˜international terrorism,â€™â€ Walker said. â€œIn the wake of yet another terrorist attack in Paris, the world still waits on the U.N. to lead and present a clear understanding of what theyâ€™re fighting. The American taxpayers should not be the largest bankroller for an organization that fails to define what weâ€™re up against,â€ Walker added. The U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 on September 28, 2001, which created the Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC) to become the lead U.N. agent in the war on terror. Since then, the CTC has failed to name a single terrorist, terrorist organization or state-sponsor of terrorism. The three U.S.-identified state sponsors of terror â€“ Iran, Syria and Sudan â€“ have submitted reports to the CTC about their compliance with Resolution 1373. In the absence of any U.N. definition of terrorism, all three states have readily proclaimed that they are engaged in a vigorous campaign to combat terrorism despite clear and irrefutable evidence to the contrary. In 2015, the U.S. contributed over $650 million to the U.N. budget â€“ over 22% of their budget â€“ making the U.S. the largest contributor. The Define It to Fight It Act (H.R. 4123) introduced by Rep. Walker last week withholds ten percent of U.S. contributions to the U.N. each year until a definition of â€œinternational terrorismâ€ is adopted. Contributions withheld go directly to the U.S. Treasury for debt reduction.
11.19.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) voted today on the passage of American SAFE Act (H.R. 4038), a bill that prevents the admission of Syrian or Iraqi refugees without prior unanimous security clearance from top U.S. security officials. â€œThe terrorist attacks in Paris demonstrate that the safety of America is at-risk unless we take action,â€ Walker said. â€œAs someone who has worked in Belgian refugee camps, I understand the need to be compassionate towards individuals seeking asylum, but we simply cannot do so by placing our own national security on the backburner and without clearing these individuals first. I implore President Obama to take off the blindfold and earplugs, sign this bill and protect American citizens,â€ Walker added. Under current law, the President has the authority to set the ceiling for the number of refugees that can be admitted to the United States during a fiscal year. For Fiscal Year 2016, President Obama has set the overall refugee ceiling at 85,000 and announced that of that, 10,000 would be Syrians. Any refugee being admitted to the United States must go through a background check, including biographic name checks and fingerprint checks. The information is vetted against a broad array of law enforcement and community databases. However, despite the background check, top national security officials have testified before Congress that the government does not have the resources to fully vet refugees, especially in countries where we lack a law enforcement presence and the countryâ€™s government is in shambles. Government agencies have admitted an inability to even screen for passed criminal activity among refugees from Syria and Iraq. The American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act of 2015 prevents admission to the United States any Syrian and Iraqi refugee until top security officials â€“ the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the FBI, and the Director of National Intelligence â€“ unanimously certify that the individual does not represent a security threat. Under this legislation, the FBI has a direct role in validating the background checks are thorough enough to keep dangerous individuals out of the country. Further, it requires Members of Congress to receive notifications of admission and requires the Homeland Security Inspector General to independently assess the refugee approvals. Rep. Walker is a cosponsor of this legislation. The bill passed today with a veto-proof majority â€“ 289-137 â€“ with 47 Democrats joining 242 Republicans in support.
11.17.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) has called for a Special Order on the U.S. House floor on November 18 for Peopleâ€™s Night II. This is an effort to highlight Rep. Walkerâ€™s and conservative lawmakersâ€™ demands for government accountability and transparency. This hour will focus on the Senate Majority Leaderâ€™s inaction on over 300 pieces of legislation passed by the House. â€œThe American people elected Republican majorities in the House and Senate to cleanup Washington and to fight President Obamaâ€™s liberal agenda,â€ Walker said. â€œItâ€™s time for Mitch McConnell to act on the 300 pieces of legislation passed by the House,â€ Walker added. Peopleâ€™s Night II will begin at approximately 7:00pm on Wednesday, November 18. Participants include: Representatives Walker, Black (TN-6), Flores (TX-17), Jordan (OH-4), and Miller (FL-1).
11.17.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ This afternoon, the ten Republican members of North Carolina's U.S. House of Representatives delegation released the following statement in response to Friday's terrorist attacks in Paris and Governor Pat McCrory's request that the Obama Administration cease sending Syrian refugees to North Carolina. The joint statement was issued by Congresswoman Renee Ellmers (NC-2), Congressman Walter Jones (NC-3), Congresswoman Virginia Foxx (NC-5), Congressman Mark Walker (NC-6), Congressman David Rouzer (NC-7), Congressman Richard Hudson (NC-8), Congressman Robert Pittenger (NC-9), Congressman Patrick McHenry (NC-10), Congressman Mark Meadows (NC-11), and Congressman George Holding (NC-13). â€œLast Friday we were horrified to watch the terrorist attacks unfold in Paris. To see innocent lives taken by a group of radical Islamic terrorists was sickening and our prayers go out to all those impacted by this unspeakable tragedy.â€œIn the days since, we have been deeply troubled to learn one of the terrorists who committed this atrocity may have come to Europe posing as a Syrian refugee. With the massive influx of Syrian refugees to Europe, this was always a threat and, regrettably, now itâ€™s been realized.â€œGiven this development we have serious concerns about the ongoing resettlement of Syrian refugees to the communities we represent across North Carolina. As a delegation, we join with Governor McCrory in calling for the Obama Administration to immediately cease sending Syrian refugees to our state. We believe this is a common sense step and applaud Governor McCrory for his leadership on the issue. â€œThe Paris attacks highlighted that ISIL is not contained and still poses a grave threat to Western Democracies. Blocking the flow of Syrian refugees until we can better understand and address security risks they may pose is a necessary step to protect our state and homeland.â€
11.16.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement concerning Syrian and Iraqi refugees in the United States: â€œThe terrorist attacks in Paris demonstrate that the safety of America is at risk unless we take action. While I understand the need to be compassionate towards individuals seeking asylum in the United States, we simply cannot place our national security on the backburner by accepting unidentified Syrian and Iraqi refugees into the United States, especially given our past and present immigration issues. We must show American strength against ISIS and radical Islamic terrorism. At a time when many radical Islamic extremists are pursuing any manner to penetrate our homeland, we need to be ever vigilant to protect our citizens from any potential outside threats.â€
11.11.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Clarence â€œBudâ€ Shepherd as the North Carolina Sixth Congressional District Community Hero of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Bud Shepherd, a World War II veteran and former P.O.W., was selected as the November 2015 recipient. Bud Shepherd is the president of Resources Exchange Association (REA), a nonprofit that accepts donations of surplus inventory from corporate America and redistributes that product to thousands of nonprofit organizations and people in need. All proceeds are used to support REAch, a national program that Shepherd created to provide gifts of tool boxes to wounded veterans. â€œBud Shepherd never stopped serving our country when he returned home from the battlefields of Europe seventy years ago,â€ Walker said. â€œIt is absolutely clear that Bud puts service above self through his work with the Resources Exchange Association and the REAch the Wounded Warrior Program. Bud has dedicated his life to honoring our brave men and women, and I am beyond thrilled to recognize him as our November 2015 Community Hero of the Month,â€ Walker added. Shepherd enlisted in the U.S. Army on his 18th birthday in 1943. During World War II, Shepherd was an Air Corpsman, Sergeant, and tail gunner in the 751st Squadron. After German fire brought down his plane, Shepherd was captured by the Nazis and imprisoned in Stalag Luft 1 in Barth on November 30, 1944. He was freed on May 1, 1945. Shepherd turns 90 years old this month and resides in Graham, N.C.
11.09.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ Congressman Mark Walker announces his schedule in the Sixth Congressional District for the week of November 9-13. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 9 11:00am-12:00pm Tour: United Technologies Mebane, NC 27302 1:30-3:00pm Meeting: Duke University Medical Center Durham, NC 27710 4:00-5:00pm Town Hall: Coffee and Conversation Filament Coffee 108 W.

11.04.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement concerning the passing of former U.S. Representative Howard Coble: â€œWe are deeply saddened to learn of Congressman Howard Cobleâ€™s passing today, but we are at peace knowing he is in a better place. Our community was blessed to have had his leadership in Washington for thirty years, but we were even more blessed to call him a friend and mentor. During his time in Washington, Congressman Coble demonstrated that tone and approach still matter in politics. His statesmanship qualities allowed Howard to have friends on both sides of the aisle, which helped him advocate effectively for the needs and concerns of his constituents. When I landed in Washington for the first time in January, thereâ€™s no doubt that I had huge shoes to fill. During times back in the Sixth District, I would occasionally meet with Howard to receive his feedback. He would share many great stories and some of his favorite jokes. He represented North Carolina with humility, honor, and always a little humor. Howard was one of a kind. He was a gentleman and one of the most sincere and kindest people Iâ€™ve ever known. Our community not only lost â€˜Our Congressmanâ€™ today, but one of our heroes.â€
10.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announced today that after years of being deprived of federal law enforcement funds due to ongoing litigation, the U.S. Department of Justice has lifted the embargo on the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant to the Alamance County Sheriffâ€™s Department. Congressman Walker contacted the U.S. Department of Justice to correct the problem to allow the North Carolina Crime Commission, the body responsible for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant, to disburse the funds. â€œAfter depriving the Alamance County Sheriffâ€™s Department for six years, Iâ€™m pleased that the Justice Department has responded to inquiries from my office and Senator Burrâ€™s office to lift the freeze on this grant to the Sheriffâ€™s Department,â€ Walker said. The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) instigated an action against Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson alleging that Sheriff Johnson violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. On August 7, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied the claims of the United States, entered judgment for Sheriff Johnson, and dismissed the United Statesâ€™ complaint with prejudice. The DOJ subsequently appealed this ruling. Even with the ruling, the DOJ suspended the Alamance County Sheriffâ€™s Office Byrne Justice Assistance Grant. The decision withheld the funding needed for the Sheriffâ€™s Department to purchase tasers for its deputies, thereby placing the deputies and the citizens of Alamance County at risk. â€œWe are continuing to look into the behavior of the DOJ and I will remain committed to ensuring the Sheriffâ€™s Department receives the tools it needs to protect the people of Alamance County,â€ Walker added.
10.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement regarding the election today of U.S. Representative Paul Ryan (WI-01) as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives: â€œIn selecting a Speaker, we need a leader who is undoubtedly conservative, ready to tackle the problems plaguing our government and our nation, and willing to challenge President Obamaâ€™s liberal agenda. Our caucus needs a leader who can turn the page, build coalitions, and effectively articulate the Republican Partyâ€™s message of hope and opportunity. I am optimistic that Speaker Paul Ryan can be that kind of leader, but only time will tell. As I promised during the 2014 campaign, I plan to hold House leadership accountable, no matter who is Speaker. My conservative principles and the best interests of the Sixth District come first.â€
10.28.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today voted against the federal budget agreement reached by President Barack Obama, Speaker John Boehner, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell due to serious objections with the dealâ€™s process and its fiscal implications. â€œThis budget deal is the definition of business as usual politics,â€ said Walker. â€œThis â€˜behind closed doorsâ€™ agreement fails to rein in Washingtonâ€™s spending habits and continues to volunteer our future generations to write the check for our fiscal irresponsibility. Instead of passing this irresponsible budget deal, we should be taking this opportunity to fix our broken system,â€ Walker added. The Bipartisan Act of 2015, H.R. 1314, continues irresponsible federal spending habits by increasing the debt ceiling by $1.5 trillion, busting through budget control caps and increasing federal expenditures by $85 billion. The dealâ€™s purported savings will not occur until 2025, the last year of the budget window, and will likely fail to materialize. The deal pushes Medicare costs onto seniors through a loan funded by an increase in Part B premiums, fails to defund Planned Parenthood, exploits the Strategic Petroleum Reserve by authorizing the sale of 58 million barrels of oil, and undermines farmers by lowering the rate of return for issuers of crop insurance. The deal passed the House today 266-167.
10.23.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) voted against the budget reconciliation package presented to the House this afternoon due to his objections that it fails to fulfill promises to repeal Obamacare, including its abortion mandate. â€œObamacare is a train wreck and my constituents expect me to do everything in my power to fully repeal it â€“ however, this bill fell short,â€ Walker said. â€œWhile this package included provisions to defund Planned Parenthood, I take issue with the fact that Obamacareâ€™s abortion mandates stay in-tact under this bill. I thought it was important to reject this bill and demand one that fully repeals Obamacare and defunds Planned Parenthood,â€ Walker added. The budget reconciliation package bill considered by the House today repealed only six of Obamacareâ€™s 419 sections. Repealing only 1.4% of Obamacare would not give small business owners and families the relief Republicans have promised since the law was forced onto the American people. This bill also included a provision defunding Planned Parenthood. Rep. Walker has been clear regarding his desire to defund Planned Parenthood, following an investigation into potential criminal activity exposed by recent videos that capture Planned Parenthood employees haggling over the sale of human organs. Rep. Walker voted against a government funding bill in September that permitted continued funding for Planned Parenthood and remains committed to that goal. Rep. Walker supported Rep. Cynthia Lummisâ€™ (WY-At-Large) amendment to the bill, which would have fully repealed Obamacare and defunded Planned Parenthood.
10.22.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today responded to President Obamaâ€™s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a bill that would provide for the pay and readiness of our troops and the foundation of our national security. â€œPresident Obamaâ€™s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act risks the livelihood of our service members and our countryâ€™s national security,â€ said Walker. â€œIn this unprecedented veto, President Obama has used the pay and readiness of our military for political leverage in promoting his domestic agenda,â€ added Walker. The National Defense Authorization Act vetoed today by President Obama protected our servicemen and women by authorizing upgrades for weapons systems used in Afghanistan and Iraq. It included missile defense provisions, nuclear weapon upgrades, and funding for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ironically, President Obama vetoed this legislation on the same day he met with Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan to discuss nuclear security and counterterrorism. Finally, this bill set authorized defense spending at $612 billion, which matches the Presidentâ€™s budget request. In addition, the NDAA would provide a 1.3% pay raise for troops, revamped and expanded military retirement benefits, provided housing allowances for troops, and removed red tape from the Department of Defenseâ€™s acquisition process. The NDAA has passed each year for 53 years, with only four vetoes during that period, which were due to objections with Department of Defense policies. The current version vetoed by President Obama passed the House and Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support: 71-25 in the Senate, with 25 Democrats voting yes; and 270-156 in the House, with 37 Democrats voting yes.
10.21.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today introduced the Nursing Home Accountability Act, a bill aimed at protecting seniors by linking the quality ratings of nursing homes to their eligibility for federally-insured loans. â€œOur seniors deserve the upmost respect and care,â€ Walker said. â€œNursing homes and senior care facilities that fail to provide quality care should be ineligible for taxpayer-insured loans. The Nursing Home Accountability Act links ratings with federal loan eligibility to ensure our parents and loved ones are protected,â€ Walker added. Currently, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s (HUD) Section 232 Program provides federal loan insurance for loans covering the needs of nursing homes and other senior care facilities. However, while HUD requires Section 232 applicants to submit their latest quality ratings (5-Star Rating) from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the quality rating is not a deciding factor. This has allowed nursing homes that provide routinely poor care to receive repeated taxpayer-insured loans. The Nursing Home Accountability Act links CMSâ€™ quality ratings to loan eligibility to ensure federally-backed loans go to nursing homes with a demonstrated commitment to quality care for their residents. This bill determines a nursing home ineligible for future Section 232 loans if the facility receives a CMS Five-Star Quality Rating of two or less for thirty consecutive months. A nursing home can return to eligibility status if the facility maintains a rating of three stars or more for thirty months.
10.20.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and Congressman Marsha Blackburn (TN-07) today introduced the Preventing Government Printing Overreach Act. This legislation aims to protect private sector jobs by preventing the Government Publishing Office (GPO) from printing government security credentials. â€œThe government is too big, costs too much, and canâ€™t compete. In too many cases, itâ€™s simply behind the times,â€ Walker said. â€œItâ€™s time for Washington to spend tax dollars wisely and own up when the private sector can do it better. Using the competitive private sector to perform some of the federal governmentâ€™s basic tasks â€“ like printing â€“ is simply being good stewards for the taxpayers,â€ Walker added. â€œJust as we see in agency after agency, the federal government is once again trying to cut free enterprise out of the government contract process,â€ Blackburn said. â€œThis is their key to hiring more people, paying more benefits and spending more of the taxpayer dollars. The federal government has never been and will not become a model of efficiency with this type action,â€ Blackburn added. The Government Publishing Office (GPO) was established in 1861 and American private businesses have printed security credentials for the federal government for years. These credentials have continually been secure and effective. Now, in an effort to maintain its relevance in an increasingly paperless world, GPO is trying to claim sole authority to print security credentials for the government.
10.14.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) hosted a Human Trafficking Roundtable on Tuesday, October 13 in Greensboro, the second of its kind in 2015. Participants in the discussion included various community and state leaders representing law enforcement, social services, and non-profit organizations. â€œMy first piece of legislation signed into law centered on this issue, but we must continue sending the message that these injustices will not be tolerated,â€ Walker said. â€œMy goal for these roundtable discussions is to build awareness, and turn that awareness into action. We have to continue educating the public, targeting the traffickers, and supporting victims,â€ Walker added. Earlier this year, Rep. Walker introduced H.R. 460, The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015, which acts to effectively train and inform Homeland Security personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims. The language of the bill was added into S.178, The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015, and signed by President Obama on May 29, 2015. Rep. Walker hosted the first Human Trafficking Roundtable on April 1, 2015 in Greensboro. Participants in the second roundtable included: Rachel Parker, AHT Program Manager at World Relief High Point; Courtney Dunkerton, Executive Director of Alamance for Freedom; Det. Steve Dickerson, Winston-Salem Police Department; Det. Bryan Petty, Burlington Police Department; Det. Brian Williamson, Greensboro Police Department; Rockingham County Sheriff Sam Page; Bryan Burnette and Brent Perley, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson.
10.09.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ Congressman Mark Walker announces his schedule in the Sixth Congressional District for the week of October 12-16.

10.06.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ The U.S. Department of Justice investigated action against Alamance County Sheriff Terry Johnson alleging that he engaged in discriminatory law enforcement activities. On August 7, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina denied the claims of the United States and dismissed its complaint. The Department of Justice has now appealed this ruling. In response, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement: â€œI am disappointed that the Department of Justice is seeking to continue this difficult chapter for the people of Alamance County and the Alamance County Sheriffâ€™s Department. Through its use of sue-and-settle polices to intimidate entities that do not comply with the presidentâ€™s political goals, President Obama and the Obama Administration have politicized the Department of Justice. As a member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, I have continued to witness as the Obama Administration and the Justice Department overstep its boundaries. We have seen the DOJâ€™s mishandling of Fast and Furious; its refusal to enforce laws that are inconsistent with President Obamaâ€™s beliefs; and DOJâ€™s failure to provide the information needed to fulfill Congressâ€™ constitutionally-provided oversight mandate. As we move into the final days of the Obama Administration, these cases should remind Congress and the American people of the necessity of reigning in this Administrationsâ€™ lawlessness.â€
10.05.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Kristy and Don Milholin as the North Carolina Sixth Congressional District Community Heroes of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker awards a constituent, business, or organization in his district for displaying extraordinary acts of service and for making a difference in the lives around them. Kristy and Don Milholin from the Out of the Garden Project were selected as the October 2015 recipients. â€œThe Out of the Garden Project does amazing work to provide fresh meals to children who might otherwise go hungry,â€ Walker said. â€œWith over nineteen Fresh Mobile Markets across Guilford County, Don and Kristy are leaders in the effort to curb childhood hunger. I applaud them for their vision and their dedication to our community,â€ Walker added. Don and Kristy Milholin started the Out of the Garden Project from their kitchen table in August 2009 and it has since become the largest organization of its kind in the Piedmont Triad. They currently operate nineteen Fresh Mobile Markets in Guilford County food deserts to assist nearly 1,000 families with food. In addition, they spearhead other charitable causes including Operation Backpack, which provides backpacks to over 1,000 students in nearly 50 Guilford County schools. More information about the Out of the Garden Project can be found on their website: www.outofthegardenproject.org.
10.01.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) announces changes to his communications staff, effective October 1, 2015. Kyle Hall has been named Communications Director and will be based in the Greensboro office. Hall succeeds Kate Disbrow, who remains on staff as a part-time Communications Advisor. Kami Mueller joins the staff as a Communications Advisor. â€œWe are excited to make these key staff additions,â€ Walker said. â€œIâ€™m confident that these experienced individuals will be an asset to our office by allowing us to effectively communicate with the people of North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth District and enhance our officeâ€™s constituent services,â€ Walker added. Hall joined Rep. Walkerâ€™s staff in January 2015 as a Field Representative. Prior to joining the Walker staff, he worked for N.C. Senator Neal Hunt (District 15-Wake County) and Americans for Prosperity in North Carolina. He is a graduate of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a native of Stokes County, North Carolina. Mueller is joining Rep. Walkerâ€™s staff as a Communications Advisor. She is the former Director of Communications for Lt. Governor Dan Forest. Prior to her role with Lt. Governor Forest, she served as the Director of Communications for Vote4Marriage NC, North Carolinaâ€™s coalition to protect marriage. In her new role with the Walker staff, Mueller will be based out of North Carolina. Disbrow started when Rep. Walker assumed office in January 2015 as Communications Director in the Washington, DC office. Disbrow has over seven years of experience working for other members of Congress, trade associations and organizations in Washington, DC and remains as a part-time Communications Advisor for Rep. Walker.
09.30.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) voted against a Senate version of a federal government spending bill today, citing multiple objections to the policies the bill continues, including Obamacare, President Obamaâ€™s de facto amnesty, and Planned Parenthoodâ€™s taxpayer funding. â€œOn multiple occasions, I have stated my objections to directing tax dollars to Planned Parenthood, the continuation of Obamacare, and President Obamaâ€™s de facto amnesty,â€ Walker said. â€œThe Senateâ€™s version of the Continuing Resolution maintains business as usual policies that my constituents sent me to Washington to fight against. We need to lead with a bold conservative agenda, hold this administration accountable, get the Senate to finally engage in the budget process, and maintain our integrity,â€ Walker added. The Senate version of the Continuing Resolution provides funding for federal agencies from October 1, 2015 to December 11, 2015 (71 days). This spending measure will (1) fund Planned Parenthood; (2) spends $2.706 billion above the 2016 fiscal year cap for non-defense spending; (3) funds Obamaâ€™s executive amnesty; (4) funds Obamacare; and (5) allows President Obama to lift Iran sanctions. The bill passed 277-151.
09.25.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ John Boehner, Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, announced his resignation today effective October 30, 2015. Speaker Boehner will be resigning his Speakership and seat in Congress as the elected Representative of Ohioâ€™s Eight District. In response, Congressman Mark Walker released the following statement: â€œToday, I believe Speaker Boehner made the right decision for our nation and for our party. I thank him for his service, dedication, selflessness and clear love of country. In the last four years, since Republicans took the House, Speaker Boehner has been on the front lines fighting a President who wants to â€˜fundamentally changeâ€™ our country. â€œDuring last yearâ€™s campaign, I promised to hold House leadership accountable and to stand up whenever my conservative principles or the best interests of the Sixth District demanded. In my first eight months, I have repeatedly done that while the frustration among my conservative colleagues and me was reaching a boiling point. The Speaker obviously felt the growing discontentment and has removed himself as an impediment. â€œBut we must look forward, as the issues facing our country are too great to focus on the past. We need to elect a Republican leadership team that is ready to compete with President Obamaâ€™s liberal agenda AND with a Senate that continually refuses to act on the strong, conservative legislation passed by the House â€“ well over two hundred bills at this point.â€
09.21.2015	EDEN, NC â€“ Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) met with Eden and Rockingham County officials this afternoon to discuss the closure of the MillerCoors plant, as a follow-up to discussions he had with federal representatives from the company last week in Washington. MillerCoors has announced that their Eden facility will close September 2016. The plant currently employs more than 500 employees. â€œThe MillerCoors closure is hard news for Eden and Rockingham County,â€ said Walker. â€œAlthough we cannot change the circumstances around this plantâ€™s closure, we can begin the dialogue of how we can fill the void in this community. My office will continue to be involved with state and local officials as we move forward,â€ Walker added. Those who attended this meeting include Eden Mayor Wayne Tuggle, Eden Mayor Pro Tempore Jim Burnette, Jan Critz, Director of Economic Development for Rockingham County, Mike Doughtery, Director of Economic Development for the City of Eden, Eden City Manager Brad Corcoran, officials with the North Carolina Department of Commerce, and representatives from MillerCoors.
09.18.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) voted for the passage of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 (H.R. 3134) earlier today. â€œAmericans have watched the videos detailing Planned Parenthoodâ€™s inhumane abortion practices in complete disbelief and horror,â€ said Walker, â€œThis bill is the start of a much-needed investigation to determine whether or not taxpayer dollars are subsidizing criminal activity.â€ â€œI believe that any organization that profits from harvesting parts of babies must be divested of all taxpayer dollars and I will oppose any measure that funds Planned Parenthood,â€ Walker added. Introduced by U.S. Representative Diane Black (TN-06) and cosponsored by Rep. Walker, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015 places a one-year moratorium on all federal funding directed to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. as the organizationâ€™s activities are investigated. During the moratorium, the use of any mandatory or discretionary funds by Planned Parenthood, its affiliates, or any associated clinics are prohibited.
09.09.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) joined over 25 of his colleagues in a letter calling for Planned Parenthood Federation of America to be defunded in any upcoming appropriations bill. â€œNorth Carolinians have viewed the latest videos of Planned Parenthood in horror as employees are seen haggling over the cost of baby body parts and resuscitating a life only to snuff it out again,â€ said Walker. â€œAfter hearing from hundreds of constituents, one of my top priorities upon returning to Washington was to join my conservative colleagues in this fight.â€ 54% of Americans oppose any taxpayer funding for family planning services performed by organizations that provide abortions. Meanwhile, despite posting $127 million in excess revenue in 2013, federal tax dollars subsidize Planned Parenthoodâ€™s facilities and staff. Planned Parenthood performed over 327,653 abortions last year alone â€“ or one every 97 seconds. Rep. Walker continues to be a champion for the unborn and has joined his colleagues in also calling for investigations into potential criminal activities at Planned Parenthood. Since the first video was release by the Center for Medical Progress, at least 5 states have moved defund Planned Parenthood in their jurisdiction and 13 have launched investigations.
09.02.2015	GRAHAM, NCâ€” U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Grahamâ€™s Larry Conte as North Carolina Sixth Congressional Districtâ€™s Community Hero of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker is awarding a â€œCommunity Hero of the Monthâ€ to recognize extraordinary acts of service and generosity by individuals, businesses or organizations in in the 6th District that are compelled to make a difference in the lives around them and better their community. Conte has been an Educator for over 20 years. He has served in Alamance County at B.E. Jordan Elementary, South Graham Elementary, and is currently the Principal of Harvey Newlin Elementary. Conte is known for the energy and selfless service that he brings to his students. Pamela Thompson, Chair of Alamance Burlington School System, notes that â€œLarry Conte literally defines hope and encouragement. He is always lifting people up. A child that attends Harvey Newlin could have a family that is financially struggling, but that same child under the guidance of Conte believes they are rich because of their value to mankind. He is the ultimate encourager, and inspires children to become mighty warriors for themselves, their families, and their world.â€ Congressman Walker added â€œAs this school year begins, I canâ€™t think of a better time to present Septemberâ€™s Community Hero award to an individual who has inspired thousands of young people to work hard, dream big dreams, and be a positive influence to those around them. Larry Conte is an example of the difference one person can make when they approach a calling with passion, dedication, and selfless service. â€

08.03.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored High Pointâ€™s Gretta Bush as North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District's Community Hero of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker is awarding a â€œCommunity Hero of the Monthâ€ to recognize extraordinary acts of service and generosity by individuals, businesses or organizations in North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth Congressional District that are compelled to make a difference in the lives around them and better their community. (Click for High Resolution Photos) â€œA most rewarding aspect of serving the people of the Six District is meeting individuals who are giving back without the fanfare and credit that they deserve. One such individual is Gretta Bush,â€ said Rep. Walker. Gretta Bush is currently the President and Chairman of the Board of the High Point Community Against Violence (HPCAV). HPCAV was formed in 1997 to reduce violent crimes in High Point and to keep our citizens safe from violent offenders. Ms. Bush is very active on a daily basis with High Point Police Department and other local agencies to help individuals with offenses stay focused on a positive outcome. She is also a charter member of the Focused Deterrence Program, which has become a national model for fighting crime in 5 areas: Violent Offenders, Drug Market Initiatives, Gangs, Juveniles, and Domestic Violence. Learn more about HPCAV at their website: www.hpcav.com. Walker added, â€œThe most impressive attribute of Gretta is that she combines the unique skill set of being approachable while maintaining authority in a very difficult arena. Gretta truly cares about the young people with whom she interacts. Her compassion, courage and conviction is changing lives and, in turn, making her community a better place to live." Bush has spent her career leading and helping others and her work with HPCAV caps a lifelong passion for community service. She has additionally worked at the High Point Parks and Recreation Department.
07.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today supported House passage of the VA Accountability Act (H.R. 1994) which helps change the negligent and deceptive culture within the VA. The bill makes it easier for the VA Secretary to fire insubordinate employees and enhances whistleblower protections. â€œWe have an obligation â€“ a moral duty â€“ to take care of the brave men and women who have served and fought so bravely on our behalf. Itâ€™s been well over a year since the embarrassingly substandard treatment our veterans were receiving came to light, but the sad truth is the culture within the VA is still broken,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œI am proud to support this measure to make it easier for the VA to change its fragmented practices. Serving our veterans will remain a top priority, and I will continue to fight to modernize the VA and force the VA to confront the fundamental flaws and outdated bureaucracy that are deep within the department. I call on our President to follow suit, hold his administration accountable and stop protecting policies that are failing to meet our veteransâ€™ needs. We need to uphold our commitment to themâ€” we owe them the best.â€ Veterans wait-listed for a month or longer has increased by 50 percent since the scandal broke and only two, low-level employees have been fired. It has been over 18 months since a dedicated Inspector General was in place at the VA, and the President has offered no guidance to the American people, or our veterans, as to when we will see corrective action. Rep. Walker has actively sought solutions to uphold our commitment to Americaâ€™s service men and women and ensure they receive the first-class service and care they deserve. Next week, Rep. Walker will host the first in a series of veteransâ€™ roundtables to meet directly with veterans in the Sixth District and understand exactly what problems they have faced in dealing with the VA. He is a proud co-sponsor of the Reducing Barriers for Veterans Education Act of 2015 and the Military Spouse Job Continuity Act of 2015. ###
07.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) supported the House passage of H.R. 427, Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, also known as the REINS Act. This bill curbs unnecessary regulations from unaccountable agencies. â€œWe have witnessed the overreaching arm of the federal government in our daily lives. The REINS Act would cease Washingtonâ€™s top-down approach so we can create jobs and opportunities for all Americans. A healthy, prosperous economy is created by fostering freedom for our entrepreneurs, job creators, and innovators â€“ not increased regulations and red tape.â€ In a recent survey, constituents of the Sixth District identified less federal regulation and intrusion as the second greatest priority Congress should address. During the first six years of the Obama Administration, federal regulators have added an average of 81 new major regulations per year. One major regulation annually impacts the economy by $100 million or more and causes major price increases for industry and consumer. Americaâ€™s federal regulatory burden adds up to $15,000 per American household, nearly 30% of average household incomes. The REINS Act will curb the often ill-considered, costly, and unnecessary regulations forced on the American public and that stifle job innovation; it will restore legislative authority to Congress preventing excessive new regulation. This bill requires agencies to submit major regulations to Congress for approval to ensure that accountability falls on the elected representatives in Congress instead of unelected, unaccountable agency officials.
07.28.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“In a press conference yesterday, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06), Chairman Chaffetz and 18 other members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee demanded the President remove Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen from office. Rep. Walkerâ€™s Remarks The time has arrived for IRS Commissioner Koskinen to go. You have heard the data and the statistics today but even if you look at it from a more practical standpoint, private citizens would not be allowed to behave in such a manner. It would cost them their job. Whatever percent is intentional vs. incompetence is no longer a factor. The time has arrived â€“ he must depart. At some point, we must ask a greater question is this not a failure, another failure, on the Administrationâ€™s part to appoint people who cannot and have not done the job? The American people want something very important. We talk much about awareness, but they want action. Today, I am proud to be part of the House Oversight Committee that is demanding action, that is demanding IRS commissioner Koskinen be removed. Rep. Walker also released an audio statement on the IRS targeting investigation following the press conference. In a letter to President Obama, the Committee outlined the findings, thus far, of its investigation into the IRS targeting scandal. The letter explains and provides evidence of the violations on the part of the IRS and Commissioner Koskinen in properly complying with both a congressional subpoena and its own internal preservation order. The Committee also released a video on the IRS targeting investigation. ###
07.27.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker, Chairman Chaffetz and 18 other members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee demanded the President remove Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Commissioner John Koskinen from office. (Click for full resolution) Congressman Mark Walker issued the following statement: IRS Commissioner Koskinen has directly obstructed Congressional investigations into the IRSâ€™ targeting of Americans based on their political beliefs. Specifically, he has: (1) failed to testify truthfully, (2) failed to comply with a Congressional subpoena, and (3) failed to preserve or produce up to 24,000 emails relevant to the investigation. No one is above the laws of the country. Yet, too often the American people see two sets of rules being applied -- one for the everyday citizen and another for government officials. If Koskinen was the average citizen, he would face immediate legal trouble for his actions. There cannot be a double standard between regular citizens and the well-connected. Therefore, the President must remove Koskinen immediately for dereliction of duty and breach of public trust. In a letter to President Obama, the Committee outlined the findings, thus far, of its investigation into the IRS targeting scandal. The letter explains and provides evidence of the violations on the part of the IRS and Commissioner Koskinen in properly complying with both a congressional subpoena and its own internal preservation order.
07.22.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) delivers remarks on the House floor to voice his continued outrage at the two undercover videos of Planned Parenthood negotiating prices for the organs of unborn children. Remarks as prepared for delivery: Tonight, I join my colleagues in speaking out about the barbaric and heinous actions we all witnessed in an undercover video where Planned Parenthood was caught selling body parts of aborted children. In 2013, Planned Parenthood performed 327,653 abortions and received over a half-billion dollars in taxpayer funding. Ironically, this was same time that President Obama became the only sitting President to ever address this organization. It was at this address that the President made the decision to invoke Godâ€™s blessings on these hideous activities. The mask is coming off of an organization that barters the very parts of a baby in a manner that most Americans find appalling. It is deeply disturbing that Planned Parenthood abortion clinics not only profit from the intentional destruction of unborn children but today, a new video shows them haggling over the price of childrenâ€™s organs. So many of us are here are parents â€“ we have watched in awe at ultrasound images of our children--we've seen their little hearts beat and marveled at God's creation. How can we stand idly by and not speak out for these lives? I have taken immediate action by joining several of my colleagues in a letter speaking out against Planned Parenthood's evil and depraved actions and fully support congressional investigation into the organization. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of Congresswoman Blackâ€™s bill, the Title X Abortion Provider Act â€“ we must stop these organizations from receiving a single taxpayer dollar through the Title X Program. I urge the Senate to act quickly to pass the House's legislation that assures no taxpayer dollars are used for abortions â€”H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2015. May God give us continued courage to seek justice, love mercy and speak out for those who canâ€™t speak for themselves.
07.15.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walkerâ€™s (NC-06) today voted against the House passage of H.R. 3038, the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, Part II, which extends federal highway programs through December 2015. â€œOur infrastructure is both vital to our nationâ€™s economy and dangerously neglected,â€ said Walker. â€œWe need to pass a long-term highway bill that addresses the insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund, makes needed reforms to streamline project approval and reduce construction costs, and provides certainty to local planning and development initiatives. Unfortunately, for the second time in my first 6 months in office, the House is kicking the can down the road and not addressing tough issues. I warned against this when voting in favor of an extension just two months ago. â€œThis bill also raised revenue for continued spending through a combination of revenue extensions, tax increases and fee shifts. Thatâ€™s right, the House violated its own rules yesterday by passing a tax increase. While I support the underlying goal of sustaining our road and bridges, I could not accept a proposal that takes 10 years to generate the funds that will be spent in 6 months and has no accompanying reforms.â€
07.14.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) delivers remarks on the House floor in response to the Administrationâ€™s announcement of the P5+1 nuclear agreement with Iran. Remarks as prepared for delivery: The Presidentâ€™s foreign policy has been disastrous for more than six years. If youâ€™re keeping score at home, feel free to add another error in the box score labeled - The Failed Obama Doctrine. President Obamaâ€™s insistence on force-feeding a deal with Iran is troubling. The unrelenting attempt to boost his legacy has created a gross lack of discernment. The President and his State Department have left a trail of detrimental decisions with deteriorating relationships throughout the world. How can we forget the Presidentâ€™s â€œBlurred Red Linesâ€ in demanding that Syriaâ€™s Assad end his Human Rights violations? After the President drew his line in the sand, Assad responded with the bombing of hospitals and the use of chemical weapons against his own people. The President has failed to show any initiative or strategy and has consistently been shown leading from behind. Meanwhile â€“ of all people â€“ Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin was the one that intervened in this international crisis. Speaking of Putin, the Presidentâ€™s posture with Putin has been pitiful. Of course, it was President Obama who mocked Presidential candidate, Mitt Romneyâ€™s â€œ1980â€™sâ€ concern of Russia being a threat. Maybe President Obama needs to revisit Ronald Reaganâ€™s foreign policy of the 1980â€™s. Wasnâ€™t it Vice-President Joe Biden that claimed the Presidentâ€™s work in Iraq would be one of the greatest achievements of this administration? While the President has been focused with his radical promise to close Guantanamo Bay; meanwhile, the rest of the world is on fire. After Syria, Russia, Benghazi, Iraqâ€¦Yet, here we are on the precipice of a potential deal with Iran - the worldâ€™s leader in state sponsored terrorism! All the while weâ€™ve given the cold shoulder to Israel â€“ our greatest ally in the Middle East for generations. The great majority of Americans had hoped that our President would find the strength to increase the sanctions on Iran rather than create a path for more nuclear capability. As a member of Congress, I will stand against any Iranian agreement that doesnâ€™t completely strip Iran of all nuclear capability. And while weâ€™re at it, Mr. Presidentâ€¦ maybe itâ€™s time to stop ignoring the imprisonment of Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, Bob Levinson and Amir Hekmati â€“ our four Americans in Iran â€“ both the House and the Senate have shown compassion and strength, demanding these Americans return home to their families. I agree with the President when he exclaimed, â€œWe should always do everything in our power to bring these Americans home safe.â€ Mr. President, itâ€™s time honor the commitment you have made to these to these men, these families, and to all Americans. I close with the words of the Prime Minister of Israel, in agreeing that, â€œthis is a bad mistake of historic proportion.â€ Thank you Mr. Speaker, I yield back. ###
07.08.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) championed to truly restore local control of education and give states the greatest flexibility by fighting for the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) amendment to be included in H.R. 5 the Student Success Act. The A-PLUS amendment would have allowed states to completely opt-out of federal mandates and programs while retaining federal funding. Rep. Walker also voted in support of the House passage of the overall bill and released the following statement: â€œWhen bureaucrats micromanage our schools, teachers and school administrators do not have the flexibility necessary to ensure a quality education for all students. I am glad that we acted to change Washingtonâ€™s top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to education. Unfortunately, we lost the opportunity to give states the greatest flexibility by not including the APLUS amendment in the Student Success Act. APLUS is a simple, common-sense policy change that would have fully freed states from the 80+ programs imposed by NCLB and strengthened the broader legislationâ€™s goal of removing the federal government from our classrooms. We need to ensure each child has access to a quality education and the opportunity to achieve their dreams. I believe government is more efficient and more accountable when itâ€™s managed on the local level and will continue to fight put parents, teachers and school leaders back in the driverâ€™s seat of our childrenâ€™s education.â€ The Student Success Act (H.R. 5) reauthorizes and reforms the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which was last reauthorized in 2002 as No Child Left Behind (NCLB). NCLB further expanded the scope of the federal government in our schools, and the Student Success Act makes important strides in reducing the federal footprint in our education. The Student Success Act reforms and repeals many of the failed education policies such as eliminating the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) mandates and consolidates over 60 ineffective and duplicative federal programs. ###
07.08.2015	How We Can Stop The Expansion of the Federal Government Into Our Classrooms Innovation starts locally â€“ not in Washington. Yet, over the past few years, we have witnessed the unprecedented expansion of the federal government into our classrooms. Decades of regulations, mandates and rules have been piling up on our educators, but failing to improve our studentsâ€™ education. Congress is set to reconsider, and potentially reauthorize, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). This law outlines federal programs for K-12 education and was last reauthorized in 2002 as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), which further expanded Washingtonâ€™s intrusion in our schools by creating new federal mandates. No Child Left Behind also expired in 2007. This means the Obama administration has been able to operate without certain limitations and has strong-armed states into complying with its liberal education agenda. Thankfully, we have the opportunity to get Uncle Sam out of the business of micromanaging our schools from the top-down and return control to our local families, educators and officials. This week in the House, my colleagues and I are revisiting the way Washington approaches our K-12 federal education policy with consideration of H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. This bill repeals and reforms many failed education policies like the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) mandate, but I challenge that we can do even better for our children and future generations. Conservatives have the largest majority in Congress that we have had in years, and we have a real opportunity to stand against Washingtonâ€™s culture of bureaucracy and make a difference in our federal approach to education â€” letâ€™s ensure we truly return education decisions back to the local-level. We all agree that local communities â€” and ultimately parents â€” are best equipped to meet the unique needs of each student. Accordingly, they should be able to decide how best to utilize federal funding. This is why I introduced the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) amendment to the Student Success Act with Rep. Ron DeSantis (FL-06). The A-PLUS amendment would give states maximum flexibility by allowing them to opt-out of federal mandates and programs while retaining federal funding. We can strengthen the Student Success Actâ€™s goal of removing the federal government from our classrooms with this simple, common sense policy change. States and taxpayers should be able to keep their dollars, opt-out of federal education programs without repercussion and focus on the needs of their students and communities. Greater flexibility will yield greater accountability. A-PLUS would truly restore local control of education. The status quo is failing our children and we need to ensure each child has access to a quality education and the opportunity to achieve their dreams. Increasing local control of education and empowering parents and children through school choice initiatives is how we break these patterns and foster innovation in our school systems. A-PLUS would restore state and local control of education and put parents, teachers and school leaders back in the driverâ€™s seat.
07.01.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) honored Greensboroâ€™s Leah and Brandon Totel as North Carolina's Sixth Congressional District's Community Hero of the Month. Each month, Rep. Walker is awarding a â€œCommunity Hero of the Monthâ€ to recognize extraordinary acts of service and generosity by individuals, businesses or organizations in North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth Congressional District that are compelled to make a difference in the lives around them and better their community. The Totels have provided a loving home to abused and disabled children and have been advocates for others in the community to become foster parents. â€œIt is an honor to award such generous hearts and pillars of our community. I am amazed at people like Leah and Brandon who open their hearts and homes to the less fortunate, the abused, and disabled. They have restored hope and helped repair the shattered lives of children in need of a loving home. I am grateful for the Totelâ€™s undying patience and care. It is an honor to recognize the Totels for their selfless sacrifice and name them our Community Hero for July," said Rep. Mark Walker. The Totelâ€™s Story accounted by Leah Totel: Several years ago, when Brandon and I began the journey of fostering, we had two biological children. Now we have three biological children and one on the way. We have had the great privilege of caring for six foster children during this time who have ranged in ages from three days old to eighteen years old and their stay with us has ranged from several days to 15 months. We have loved and cared for children who have been neglected, abused and cast aside. Some of them were born with disabilities while others were born healthy and were disabled by the ones who were meant to love and protect them. Each time we have become completely attached, and thatâ€™s the point. It is our goal to love these children with every fiber of our being, and each time we have been blessed beyond measure. We certainly do not possess the ability to provide this love or care on our own. It is the love of Christ that compels us to this task. All of our children, whether they are biological or grafted into our family, are a gift from God. Each of our precious gifts demands sacrifices of our time, our sleep, our love and our protection; and they are a constant reminder of the sacrifice Christ made for us. It is a great honor to demonstrate His love towards children. The Mentor Network, our fostering agency, will begin new foster parent classes after Labor Day.

07.01.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Representative Alma Adams (NC-12) toured the FedEx Ground hub in Kernersville, North Carolina yesterday. The joint visit included a tour of their recently expanded facilities and a meeting with FedEx employees. â€œThe FedEx Ground facility in Kernersville is having a positive impact on our community and economy, and I appreciate the local investments FedEx is making in the sixth district,â€ said Rep. Walker. He added, â€œI know Rep. Adams and I both value the time we have to visit directly with the hard-working people here in North Carolina so we can best represent them in Washington. Todayâ€™s meeting was encouraging as we discussed legislative work we have accomplished in the first six months and also identified shared goals to better serve our community â€“ including working towards a long-term highway bill to improve our local infrastructure.â€ â€œNorth Carolinaâ€™s 12th Congressional District has a 13.8 percent unemployment rate which is double the State and national averages,â€ said Congresswoman Adams. â€œIâ€™m glad to see the FedEx Ground Hub in Kernersville employing more than 730 North Carolinians. Todayâ€™s visit with Congressman Walker allowed us to meet with FedEx executives and staff to learn more about the operation. What we learned at FedEx will help us in Congress as we seek bipartisan solutions to the unemployment crisis; and as we work to protect and improve local infrastructure and help our businesses thrive.â€ FedEx Ground, a subsidiary of FedEx Corp., is one of the leading providers of small-package ground shipping. Through a network of more than 71,000 employees, 560 distribution hubs and local pickup-and-delivery stations, and 42,000 motorized vehicles, the company transports 6.9 million packages a day to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada. In North Carolina, FedEx Ground employs 2,650 people and contracts with nearly 300 independent businesses that employ another 1,500 people. FedEx Ground operates 14 facilities and leases more than 1.5 million square feet across North Carolina. The Kernersville hub employs over 700 people, spans over 580,000 square feet and is shared by both the 6th and 12th Congressional District of North Carolina. The company reported annual revenue of nearly $13 billion in fiscal year 2015. ###
06.26.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges. â€œToday, the Supreme Court in Obergefell v. Hodges made a decision to overrule our democratic process and our foundational individual freedoms. Marriage issues have been given to the states under the 10th amendment and the democratic process. Thus, this decision should have been left to the peopleâ€”not by unelected judges in Washington. America was founded on the idea of freedom â€“ people should be free to believe and live according to those beliefs. My job is to represent all people regardless of faith, gender, race or any other distinction. I will continue to do so by ensuring that the government does not penalize people, schools, non-profits or other organizations for what they believe. May God provide the path and may we have the courage to follow.â€ ###
06.25.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courtâ€™s King v. Burwell ruling to uphold the federal exchange subsidies. â€œI was disheartened by the Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling on Obamacare. I disagree with the decision and will work to resolve the mess created by this top-down, unnatural approach to health careâ€” letâ€™s empower patients with choice, not burden them with mandates from Washington,â€ said Rep. Walker. He continued, â€œThe Affordable Care Act is brokenâ€”it has done nothing to make health care more affordable, and I have heard time and time again about how this law is hurting my constituents: Harold in Oak Ridge: â€œI'm paying at least triple of what I was a couple of years ago. And on top of that it is so expensive to go see the doctor that when I am sick I just wait and get over it without going because $50 is a lot of money to spend. At the end of the day the ACA has literally made medical care unaffordable for me.â€ Sean in Mount Airy: â€œLast September, I got an increase with my BCBSNC stand-alone policy from $1200 to $2100 monthly!...My prescriptions have doubled. Specialty doctor co pays went up and the insurance will only pay a portion of the bill because a portion has to go to the deductible which doubled. So I have a stack of medical bills to pay that I didn't have last year.â€ William in Stokesdale: â€œMy medical premium has gone up $200 a month since the ACA was started.â€ â€œIt is my responsibility to do whatever I can to protect North Carolinians from the harmful effects of the Presidentâ€™s health care law. I implore President Obama to put aside this flawed law and work with Congress to achieve real reforms that lower costs and actually delivers on the promise â€“ if you like your health care plan, you can keep it,â€ said Rep. Walker. Rep. Walker has voted three times to repeal the Affordable Care Act in full â€“ once as a stand-alone vote and twice through the budget resolutions passed. At the same time, Rep. Walker has voted to repeal the medical device tax, 30-hour work week definition and the Independent Payment Advisory Board in the ACA and acted to limit the negative impact on veterans and emergency responders by exempting them from the employer mandate threshold. ###
06.23.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) to combat government waste, fraud and abuse passed the House of Representatives unanimously by voice vote. The DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015 (H.R. 1640) is the second bill Rep. Walker has passed this Congressâ€”his first bill, the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015, was signed into law last month by the President in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. On average, less than 4% of bills introduced in Congress become law. The project to consolidate the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s headquarters has been horribly mismanaged and has skyrocketed past its cost and completion estimates. H.R. 1640 will increase oversight and provide improved management and better transparency to the American people. Rep. Walker is committed to holding Washington accountable and cutting wasteful government spending to ensure future generations are left with opportunityâ€”not excessive debt. The following are Rep. Walkerâ€™s prepared remarks: Mr. Speaker, since 2006, the Department of Homeland Security and the General Services Administration have been working towards completing a consolidated headquarters on the historic St. Elizabethâ€™s campus in Washington D.C. However, as with many other federal projects, the consolidation has run up against cost overruns and construction delays â€“ at times estimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind schedule. Earlier this year, I visited the site to see firsthand the progress being made and the immense challenges that lie ahead. I remain concerned that taxpayer dollars will be put at risk without better management. This bill, H.R. 1640 the DHS Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015 would require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, to investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property needs of the project. While we were encouraged by the updated DHS St. Elizabethâ€™s plan, published earlier this year, we still believe that increased oversight of the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the efficient use of our constituentsâ€™ tax dollars. Mr. Speaker, accountability is a fundamental aspect of a citizen ruled government and something that our constituents expect their representatives to uphold. H.R. 1640 does just this and I look forward to the bipartisan support this legislation will receive. ###
06.17.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Congressman Mark Walker (NC-06) has joined Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz in demanding for the immediate removal of Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director Katherine Archuleta following a hearing investigating the catastrophic data breach at the agency. â€œFrom the deplorable treatment of our veterans at the VA to the deliberate targeting of individuals and businesses by both the IRS and the Department of Justice in Operation Choke Point, there is a clear pattern â€“ the Presidentâ€™s administration has run errant under his leadership, and it needs to stop. How many more failures do we need to see before the President starts to hold his administration accountable for its actions?,â€ said Rep. Walker. He continued, â€œAmericans deserve better. The President needs to act. This cyber-attack is the most catastrophic of our nationâ€™s history. Our hearing clearly revealed that Director Archuleta failed to carry out her responsibilities and I call for her immediate removal. I will continue to demand this administration to be accountable for the American people.â€ In a hearing on Tuesday, Walker and members of the committee discovered that Archuleta made a conscious decision to ignore the agencyâ€™s Inspector Generalâ€™s warnings and failed to carry out the responsibility of encrypting Social Security numbers and other sensitive data. OPM will have to notify millions of Americans that their information has been compromised. Even more, the data could date as far back as 1985. On Monday, Rep. Walker hosted Peopleâ€™s Night, an hour-long discussion in which he and his colleagues discussed several initiatives they are working to improve government accountability for the American people. Click here for more information on Peopleâ€™s Night. The full hour is also available to watch on the Congressmanâ€™s YouTube channel.
06.16.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Last night, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) convened the first-ever Peopleâ€™s Night on government accountability. Peopleâ€™s Night is a series Rep. Walker is leading of hour-long sessions on the U.S. House of Representatives floor for Members of Congress to address the frustrations and concerns he and his colleagues hear from constituents. Joining Walker on the House floor was Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03), Representative Richard Hudson (NC-08), Representative Ron DeSantis (FL-06), Representative Dave Brat (VA-07), Representative Ken Buck (CO-04), Representative Mark Meadows (NC-11), Representative Mick Mulvaney (SC-05) and Representative John Ratcliffe (TX-04). Remarks as prepared for delivery: Tonight is a night about accountability, about taking responsibility. Many of my colleagues that will speak here tonight were sent by districts of people who wanted to hold this government accountable â€“ both fiscally and socially. On June 15, 1775, 240 years ago today, George Washington accepted the position as Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. Washington was serving in the Second Continental Congress as a delegate from Virginia when his peers voted unanimously to hand him the reins of the entire revolutionary army. About 100 paces from where I standing, standing in the Capitolâ€™s Rotunda is the history of how America was birthed into existence. It is displayed through the most glorious art work. Of all these paintings in the Rotunda, I am most intrigued by John Trumbellâ€™s work of Washington submitting his resignation in 1783, after completing his assignment, through struggles and severe setbacks, more than eight years after accepting the position. While some of these paintings depict those of conquests or discoveries, this particular work captures the great character of Washington. Congress had granted Washington the powers equivalent to a dictator. Yet, the humility and the wisdom of Washington understood that for a Republic to survive, it must be held accountable by the people. His resignation that day, stated this, â€œI resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with diffidence; a diffidence (lack of self confidence) in my abilities to accomplish so arduous a task; which however was superseded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause, the support of the supreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven. Washington had resolved that a citizen-ruled government, though different than others, had a chance to be somethingâ€”something exceptional. 240 years ago today, Washington laid the cornerstone of freedom through accountability to the people with a unique blessing from the Divine Power of Heaven. Thatâ€™s why we have assembled tonight. To talk about what Washingtonâ€™s vision was â€“ a citizen ruled government that would hold the federal government and this administration accountable.

Additional Key Videos: Chaffetz: Whoâ€™s money is it? No, itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s the peopleâ€™s money. See, every time we decide to spend money in Congress, what we are really deciding is â€“ should we pull money out of somebodyâ€™s pocketâ€”out of your walletâ€”take it over here and hand it somebody else. Now, thereâ€™s some worthwhile causes to do that. Right? There are some worthwhile things to do-- the protection of our nation, for our armed services. I buy that. I get that but we are spending far too much money on too many things. Hudson: Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have endured traumatic experiences on the battlefield and should not have to continue to fight to receive proper care when they return home. Make no mistake there are many good and dedicated people at VA medical facilities all over the country who do a tremendous job every day for our veterans. In fact, many of the folks working at VA facilities are veterans themselves. The problem is the bureaucracy has gotten so massive and so out of control the resources are wasted and the quality of care delivered to veterans has decreased. This culture of unaccountability has led to long wait times, 10,000 disability claims still in backlog and millions of our tax dollars wastedâ€¦Mr. Speaker, I know we will continue our efforts to reshape the culture at the VA but itâ€™s high time this Administration takes responsibility and joins those of us that want to give veterans a choice. ###
06.12.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today supported House passage of Title I of H.R. 1314, the Trade Act of 2015, which authorizes Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). TPA, commonly referred to as fast-track, is a process to negotiate and review trade agreements but is not a trade agreement. â€œThe American people deserve a voice in trade agreements. TPA ensures Congress and the American people are no longer on the sidelines as the President negotiates on his own,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œJust as importantâ€”America can no longer sit on the sidelines in todayâ€™s global economy. To move our stagnant economy forward, we need to open new markets for American goods,â€ he added. Over 96% of American made goods are sold outside of the U.S., and the U.S. is currently negotiating trade agreements that could represent nearly a billion new consumers of American-made goods. 1.2 million jobs in North Carolina and over 38 million jobs across the country rely on trade. From 2004 to 2013, trade-related jobs grew nearly 4 times faster than total state employment in North Carolina. TPA positions America in the best stance to negotiate these agreements while adding new standards on the President to improve accountability. Rep. Walker added, â€œPresident Obama has a history of executive overreach and Congress needs TPA to add oversight and transparency for the American people.â€ TPA requires the President to regularly consult with Congress and includes numerous transparency standards that allow Congress and the American people to understand any free-trade agreement. Additionally, it prohibits him from changing any law without Congress. Without TPA, the President has the authority to negotiate any deal he wants without Congress â€“ that is why so many Americans are frustrated with the amount of secrecy currently surrounding the Trans-Pacific Partnership. With TPA, the President must abide to 150 conditions set by Congressâ€”if he fails to meet these objectives, Congress can revoke TPA.
06.12.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement after the Houseâ€™s failed passage of Trade Adjustment Assistance. â€œTodayâ€™s vote on TAA clearly demonstrates President Obamaâ€™s failed leadership. Congressional Democrats could not muster enough votes to move his trade adjustment assistance program forward, illustrating that labor-unions still control the Democratic Party,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œTrade Adjustment Assistance is fiscally irresponsible governance. Even its supporters recognize that itâ€™s ineffective, and I am proud to vote against this waste of taxpayer dollars.â€ In a 2012 study prepared for the Department of Labor, TAA participants showed no measurable increase in employment potential or wages earned after completing the federally subsidized job training. In fact, in the four year period following lay-offs for the two groups, the participants saw a negative impact on overall income and benefits estimated at $26,837. ###
06.02.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement after numerous health insurance providers announced they are seeking substantial rate increases on Affordable Care Act plans. The stateâ€™s largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of N.C., requested an average 26 percent increase for individual plans. â€œContrary to its name, the Affordable Care Act continues to force healthcare premiums higher and hurt the pockets of hardworking Americans. New premium disclosures in North Carolina, and around the country, confirm that Obamacare will increase costs and make it tougher for families to make ends meet. I call on the President and his Democratic friends to put aside their devotion to this flawed legislation and consider common-sense, market-based alternatives and reforms that put the patient first.â€ ###
05.19.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Representative Mark Meadows (NC-11) released the following statement after the House passed S.178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which includes Rep. Walkerâ€™s first bill, the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460). Rep. Meadows introduced similar legislation in the 113th session of Congress. â€œHuman trafficking is one of the greatest injustices of our time, and it is happening in our own backyard. Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and non-profit groupsâ€”such as North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth Districtâ€™s Alamance for Freedom and World Relief High Point â€“ are on the front lines of this battle, and they are pleading for our help. In Congress, we hear your pleas and we hear the voices of those trapped in this evil of modern-day slavery. I am proud of the actions of Congress today, taking this vital step to save these precious individuals from years of abuse and sending these important bills to the Presidentâ€™s desk to finally become law,â€ said Congressman Walker. â€œI commend the House for passing this critical piece of legislation which will go a long way in helping stop human trafficking. We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to eradicate modern day slavery, and this bill is an important step. Iâ€™m grateful to Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC) for his leadership on this incredibly important issue,â€ Congressman Meadows said. The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460) is the first bill introduced by Rep. Walker. The Human Trafficking Detection Act works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims and passed unanimously in the House in January. Rep. Walkerâ€™s legislation was included as an amendment offered by Senator Dean Heller (R-Nev.) in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178). The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act includes nine additional human trafficking bills passed by the House in January. ###
04.28.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ With Reverend Odell Cleveland and Debbie Tuggle serving as co-chairs, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) has launched the Healthcare, Opportunity, Poverty and Education (H.O.P.E.) Commission â€“ a non-partisan, volunteer board comprised of non-profit and community leaders aimed at applying their expertise and knowledge to issues that face the underserved and underprivileged in the 6th District and surrounding areas. â€œWhile we have organizations across the districtâ€“ like Greensboro Urban Ministries â€“ helping our neighbors in need every day, our communityâ€™s hunger and poverty problem has worsened.â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œI promised to use this office to bring people together, to bridge traditional political and cultural divides and make a positive difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Putting words into action, I have launched the H.O.P.E. Commission, to convene educators, physicians, ministers, non-profits and other community leaders to develop community-based solutions that not only support our neighbors most in need but also promote opportunity for them to prosper and rise out of their circumstances.â€ Rev. Cleveland added, â€œI am honored to chair the bipartisan 6th Congressional District H.O.P.E. Commission. I am extremely pleased that Congressman Walker is providing the opportunity for dedicated individuals to come together and address the common concerns he and I began discussing this past September. Our shared faith connects across traditional divides as we focus on those that Matthew called â€˜the least of these.â€™ His commitment and leadership in addressing some of the most pressing issues related to the well-being of his constituents is commendable.â€ Members of the commission will meet quarterly with the mission of bringing hope to our communities by improving access to health services, expanding opportunity for the disadvantaged, helping people rise out of poverty and promoting educational outcomes and achievement. The commission includes four working groups, respectively working on the initiatives of healthcare, opportunity, poverty and education. ###
04.22.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (R-NC) issued the following statement after Senate passage of S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act which incorporates language of his own bill, H.R. 460, the Human Trafficking Detection Act. â€œHuman trafficking targets the youngest, the most vulnerable and the most helpless in our society. It is happening in our own backyard and this insidious modern-day slavery cannot be ignored â€“ North Carolina is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œWe took an oath promising to protect the people of this great country, and I am convinced that part of this high calling is protecting those who are victims of human trafficking. Through legislative action and increased awareness, we can work to free our fellow humans from the bondage of slavery, bring perpetrators to justice and provide hope to victims. I look forward to voting for final passage and getting this vital legislation to the Presidentâ€™s desk to sign.â€ The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460) is the first bill introduced by Rep. Walker, and he is the first member of 114th freshman class to pass a bill in the House. The Human Trafficking Detection Act works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims and passed unanimously in the House in January. This legislation was included as an amendment offered by Senator Dean Heller (R-Nev.) in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178). Earlier this month, Rep. Walker hosted a roundtable with the NC Council for Women, bringing together victim advocates and law enforcement to identify initiatives and solutions to end trafficking within the 6th District of North Carolina.
04.21.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) has joined as the lead Republican cosponsor in the House for the Police Creating Accountability by Making Effective Recording Available (Police CAMERA) Act of 2015, a bipartisan, bicameral bill that would use existing funding to start a pilot grant program to assist state and local law enforcement agencies with purchasing or leasing body-worn cameras (BWCs). â€œI have the utmost respect for our law enforcement but unfortunately recent events have severely damaged public trust between our officers and the people they serve. Even today in Randolph County, we can see how body-worn cameras can assist police in preserving evidence, and a preliminary study has already shown that this use of technology reduced the number of complaints against police and incidents of excessive force,â€ said Rep. Walker. He added, â€œThe Police CAMERA Act is a tangible way to address recent incidents that have caused friction and protests around police violence.â€ The Police CAMERA Act of 2015 creates a pilot grant program through the Department of Justice to assist local and state law enforcement in purchasing body-worn cameras. Additionally, it requires an impact-study be conducted after two years, focusing on the programâ€™s effectiveness in improving law enforcement accountability while protecting privacy of individuals. The study also examines the effects on officer safety and public safety and works to develop best practices for BWCs. Last month, U.S. Representatives Corrine Brown (FL-05) and Keith Ellison (MN-05) introduced H.R. 1680 and U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) is the first Republican to cosponsor the bill in the House. Additionally, U.S. Senators Rand Paul (R-KY) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced an identical bill in the Senate, S. 877. The Police CAMERA Act was drafted with the help of law enforcement agencies across the country. Between 2003 and 2009, the Department of Justiceâ€™s Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported nearly 3,000 homicides by law enforcement personnel in their Arrest-Related Deaths program. Full text of the Police CAMERA Act of 2015 can be found here.
04.20.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) hosted over 50 pastors today, representing nearly 30,000 church members throughout the 6th Congressional District. The event provided an opportunity for local faith leaders to come together and discuss pressing issues within the community, including the church's role in government, protecting the unborn and combatting human trafficking. "Holding fast to our values and principlesâ€”while leading with grace and humility â€“ can be a fine line,â€ said Congressman Mark Walker. â€œIt is a great honor to have so many pastors representing our community together, and I am grateful for their continued involvement and dedication to service.â€ Bringing together ministers from large and small congregations in both urban and rural communities, the breakfast offered the opportunity for leaders to break into table discussions regarding current events and the churchâ€™s proper response. At the conclusion of the event, the Congressman led a group discussion where participants elaborated on their tableâ€™s conversation. Several pastors shared the importance of community involvement that provides for the poor, the needy and those who are underprivileged. Additionally, the sanctity of life and protecting the unborn was a foundational topic of discussion. He also took time to discuss the persecution of Christians throughout the world including the additional attacks in Libya over the weekend. Congressman Walker plans to expand the group for the fall meeting in the fall, where the Congressman intends to further discuss the worldwide spread of radical extremism and recent attacks on Christians. Earlier in the year, Congressman Walker spoke about the ongoing threat of radical Islamist terrorism on the House floor.
04.16.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walkerâ€™s (NC-06) today voted in support of the House passage of H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015 which permanently repeals the federal estate taxes, commonly referred to as the â€œDeath Tax.â€ â€œThe death tax has forced hard-working American families to fire sale their effects just to comply with a tax that should never have existed. Itâ€™s abusive for the government to tax the same assets over and over again. Yet, as families are grief-stricken from the loss of a loved-one, the federal government has been unashamedly demanding families pay a 40% tax on their businesses despite being severely taxed already.â€ He added, â€œThis tax is an affront to the American Dream and discourages ingenuity. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are responsible for 70% of new jobs created. Iâ€™m proud today to stand up for small-businesses and farms across the sixth district and help ensure their families legacies are no longer threatened by this immoral tax.â€ The Tax Foundation estimates that the permanent repeal of the death tax would create 139,000 jobs, increase U.S. capital stock by 2.2% and increase federal revenue. Minority leaders have also advocated for the full repeal of the death tax. In an article in The Hill last month, Harry C. Alford, the president and CEO of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, wrote: "The death tax creates an unfair situation for minority businesses which have primarily started to accumulate wealth within the last 60 years. Many minority-owned family businesses are first-generation businesses, where children work alongside their parents. These business owners do not want to sell out at fire-sale prices to pay the estate tax and eliminate the livelihoods for the next generation in addition to the jobs for those whom they employ." ###
04.15.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today is U.S. Representative Mark Walkerâ€™s (NC-06) 100th day in Congress. In January, Walker was sworn into office and spoke of his commitment to be open and serve every constituent of the 6th district of North Carolina. In just three months, Rep. Walker visited all 10 counties, engaging with each community through meetings with business leaders, elected officials and his NC-06 Listening Tour. Walker has introduced multiple bills and amendments and is the first freshman to pass a bill in the 114th Congress. â€œEvery day, I am aware of the honor but also the great responsibility to serve in this capacity. We have already made progress towards limiting the federal government, reforming our overly-complicated tax code and building opportunities for all Americans,â€ said Walker. â€œI will continue to work to put the needs and priorities of our district to best serve every constituent of the 6th district, and I acknowledge the weight and privilege of this opportunity daily.â€ To summarize the activities of his 1st 100 days, Rep. Walker released this video:
04.13.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) introduced legislation supporting the designation of April as national organ donor awareness month. â€œRaising awareness of organ donation efforts at the federal level is a small, but significant, step towards expanding the lifesaving possibilities of organ donation and transplants,â€ said Walker. â€œIn the 6th District, we have all seen the pain and loss resulting from a lack of transplant participation. The example of Duffy Collins, a 28-year Alamance County resident who died in 2005 because he could not get a kidney transplant, shows why raising awareness is so vitally important.â€ Similar legislation was signed by Governor McCrory in 2013, designating April as Organ Donation Awareness/Donate Life month in North Carolina. Representative Walkerâ€™s efforts, and those at the state level, were the result of strong and consistent advocacy by Mary Jo and Bruce Collins, the parents of Duffy Collins. â€œIt is a testament to the love of parents and the Collins family that they have taken a tragedy and worked tirelessly to create a legacy for their son,â€ said Walker. Duffy Collins mother, Mary Jo added, â€œDesignating April to raise awareness about organ donation could help save thousands of precious lives and spare families the tragedy we experienced. This legislation highlights the national importance of organ donation and is our way of keeping the memory of Duffy alive,â€ said Mary Jo Collins. More than 116,000 people are waiting for organ transplants, and an average of 18 people awaiting transplants die each day due to the severe shortage of donated organs. One organ donor can save the lives of up to 8 people. More information about the Collins and organ donation can be found at the Duffy Collins Organ Transplant Foundation website. ###
04.08.2015	GREENSBORO, NCâ€“ U.S. Rep. Mark Walker (NC-06) today announced that Skyler Paschall from Orange High School was selected as the winner of this year's Congressional Art Competition for North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth District. Paschall's submission, a self-portrait, was selected by locally renowned artist, William Mangum, from among dozens of entries from area high school students. The portrait will hang in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. for one year, and she will also receive two roundtrip tickets to Washington D.C., compliments of Southwest Airlines, to attend the official ceremony honoring Congressional Art Competition winners from across the nation. Walker announced this year's winners at a reception hosted at his Greensboro Congressional Office last week. Mr. Mangum also attended and presented the winners with a signed copy of his book, North Carolina Beautiful. â€œI'd like to thank all of the students for participating in this year's competition, and Iâ€™m pleased to congratulate Orange High Schoolâ€™s Skyler Paschall for her winning entry,â€ said Walker. â€œI am amazed by all the talented young artists of the Sixth District, and we are so blessed to have artist William Mangum judge this great competition. I want to thank him for his wonderful support and know that his counsel is an invaluable resource for all the artists that attended. I look forward to seeing Skylerâ€™s work displayed at the U.S. Capitol and am also honored to showcase the talented work of Jillian Owens and Marcie Laird, the second and third place winners, in my D.C. office. â€ The Congressional Art Competition was created in 1982 as an opportunity to showcase the talent of high school students and acknowledge gifted young artists. Hundreds of thousands of local high school students have been able to participate over the past three-plus decades. Congressional Art Competition Winners for North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth District: 1st Place: Skyler Paschall, Self Portrait, Orange High School 2nd Place: Jillian Owens, The Innocence of the Predator, Orange High School 3rd Place: Marcie Laird, American Ballerina, Northwest Guilford High School Honorable Mentions: Brian Booe, Walter M.

04.08.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“Together with the NC Council for Women, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) hosted a Roundtable on Human Trafficking last week. The roundtable brought together key partners and organizations to collaborate and share information, discuss concerns and recommend strategic initiatives that leadership can implement to combat human trafficking in North Carolina. "I am grateful for the agencies, law-enforcement and non-profits from across the state who gathered in Greensboro to discuss the growing but horrific industry of human trafficking. They know and recognize that human trafficking is happening right here in North Carolina, and I was deeply moved in meeting and hearing from the dozens of people who are on the front lines of the fight, passionately making a difference to stop this insidious crime and restore hope to its victims,â€ said Rep. Walker. He continued, â€œThis was not a typical event and was more than about awareness. Our goal was to bring together people involved on all sides of the issue and work out a way forward. We need to assess the needs of our community and build up our capacities to prevent such victimization." During the roundtable discussion, the Congressman reiterated his commitment to moving human trafficking legislation forward this Congress. Already, the House has passed a series of bills aimed at combatting this industry, including the very first piece of legislation Rep. Walker introduced as a Member of Congressâ€”HR 460, the Human Trafficking Detection Act â€“ that works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims. Congressman Walker invited three featured speakers to share survivor stories they encountered in their work to put into context the scope of this hateful indecency. Rachel Parker, AHT Program Manager at World Relief High Point developed a survivor composite that included the different emotions, thoughts, and actions that she had seen and experienced while working with survivors of human trafficking (available here). Survivor composites were also shared by Kelly Twedell of The Dream Center in Fayetteville, NC and Caitlyn Ryland of NC Legal Aid. The roundtable participants then were broken into groups to strategically initiate collaboration with individuals with whom they do not characteristically interact. At the conclusion of the event, the Congressman led a group discussion where each roundtable participant elaborated on the group discussions and worked to identify actions needed to fight human trafficking together as a community. The Congressmanâ€™s office plans to release a Human Trafficking discussion draft to summarize and build on the conversation started in the roundtable. ###
03.26.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) today supported House passage of H.R. 2, The Medicare Access and CHIP Authorization, voting in favor of permanently repealing the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), a maligned remnant of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. â€œAfter numerous patches and lapses, we are finally giving doctors the certainty they need to focus on patients and preserving Medicareâ€™s acceptance for millions of seniors,â€ said Walker. â€œThis bill is far from perfect, and I find it difficult to fathom that we cannot find $141 billion to pay for this bill when Medicare estimates exceed $8 trillion over the next 10 years. Nonetheless, passing a SGR repeal is good government â€“ plain and simple.â€ â€œIf SGR cuts suddenly went into effect, resulting in an abrupt 21% reduction in Medicare reimbursements, millions of seniors would be left with â€˜paper coverage.â€™ They would have a Medicare insurance card but no place would accept it â€“ equating it to Monopoly money,â€ continued Walker. â€œDoctors and hospitals would flee the Medicare system because payments would dive even further below costs and result in massive losses.â€ John D. McConnell, MD and CEO of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center added, â€œWake Forest Baptist Medical Center strongly supports the full and permanent repeal of Medicare's Sustainable Growth Rate formula. Since its inception in 1997, Congress has had to act 17 times to prevent cuts to Medicare physician payments based on this flawed formula from occurring. H.R. 2, The Medicare Access and CHIP Authorization, bill fixes this problem. It repeals and replaces the formula with a stable payment system for physicians while promoting high quality care for Medicare beneficiaries.â€ The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula is a method for calculating payments to Medicare doctors that was first as a way to curb Medicare spending. However, since 2002, the SGR formula would require drastic cuts to physicians and endanger Medicare access for seniors. For over a decade, Congress has acted 17 times to override such cuts with short term patches, commonly referred to as the â€˜doc fixes.â€™ It is estimated that $170 billion has been spent on these short term delays. H.R. 2 permanently repeals the SGR formula and secures access to Medicare for seniors. Additionally, H.R. 2 extends the State Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for two years. ###
03.25.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement following House passage of FY 2016 Budget Resolution. â€œI'm proud to vote today for a balanced budget that puts our country on a path to paying off the crippling debt our country faces. Additionally, it cuts trillions in projected spending, fully repeals Obamacare and its costly ramifications, contains no tax increases and makes some much needed reforms to entitlement programs. In stark contrast, the President's budget raises taxes, increases spending and never balances. I commend Chairman Price and the House Budget Committee for their leadership throughout this process and believe that this is a strong first step in restoring fiscal sanity to Washington. Americans have been pleading for Washington to rein in its reckless spending as our debt hurtles past $18 trillion. They sent us to make tough choices, and Washington must start living within its means just as American families and businesses do every day. Continually adding to our countryâ€™s debt threatens our nationâ€™s security. A balanced budget will grow our economy and help preserve the American dream for our children and grandchildren. The House budget reflects a better future and vision for empowering all Americans. â€œ ### Click HERE for a side-by-side comparison of the House Republicansâ€™ Budget v. President Obamaâ€™s Budget.

03.03.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement on the U.S. House of Representatives passage of the Senateâ€™s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding bill. Rep. Walker voted against H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act as it failed to address President Obamaâ€™s unlawful executive amnesty plan. Earlier today, Rep. Walker also voted in favor of a motion offered by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) to table consideration of the Senateâ€™s DHS bill. â€œI am extremely disappointed in todayâ€™s vote to bring forward the Senateâ€™s DHS bill. In the House, we have been demanding for nearly two months for the Senate to work with the House but Senate Democrats continue to be obstructionists, refusing to debate the bill and resolve our differences in conference. For six years the President has said on multiple occasionsâ€”22 times â€“ that he did not have the authority to make such a decision; yet, he now insists that Congress move in a direction that he once believed was outside the law. This is about the legislative branch reasserting its authority. As Iâ€™ve stated before, this is about the Constitution. As a Member of Congress, I swore an oath to â€˜support and defend the Constitution of the United States.â€™ I have a responsibility to uphold the Constitution and a responsibility to my constituents who have told me repeatedly they do not support this Presidentâ€™s lawless actions. I believe that todayâ€™s decision further capitulates to these obstructionists in the Senate, and I remain committed to fighting the Presidentâ€™s unprecedented overreach. I want to thank the 167 Members that stood their ground and voted to defend the Houseâ€™s bill to block the Presidentâ€™s illegal executive actions. Despite the best efforts of the House, too many Members were willing to sacrifice the provisions defunding the Presidentâ€™s executive actions in order to keep the Department of Homeland Security open. While I donâ€™t agree with their decision, I can understand the concern many Members have voiced regarding the security threat posed by closing or compromising DHS at this critical hour. We know that lasting, long-term immigration reform has to be passed by Congress. This week, there are bills being debated by the House Judiciary Committee regarding immigration enforcement. I encourage you to get familiar with these bills and give me your feedback. Amnesty is not a solution. Border security and enforcement of our laws has to be the first and highest priority.â€ ###
02.26.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) issued the following statement on the Federal Communications Commissionâ€™s (FCC) 3-2 ruling to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service. â€œThe FCCâ€™s unprecedented plan to regulate the internet upends nearly two decades of bipartisan policy. It is disappointing to see Obamaâ€™s administration, once again, choosing the heavy hand of the government over the invisible hand of the market. The quickest way to screw up the internet is getting the government involved. Furthermore, this ruling has been cloaked in secrecy and FCC Chairman Wheeler continues to evade testifying before Congress. Together with my colleagues, I will continue to fight to keep a free and open internet.â€
02.24.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Representative Ron DeSantis (FL-06) have introduced the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) amendment to H.R. 5 the Student Success Act. A-PLUS aims to restore state and local control of education by giving them the option to decline participation in the prescriptive and onerous requirements of federal education programs and focus that funding on solutions that meet their community needs. â€œInnovation starts locally â€“ not in Washington. Teachers and parents know best how to meet the unique needs of their children and students, and we have seen time and time again that Washingtonâ€™s top-down approach does not work,â€ said Rep. Walker. Adding, â€œA-PLUS enables states the flexibility to completely opt out and dictate how to best utilize federal education funding. This amendment to the Student Success Act is common-sense, conservative education reform that strengthens the broader legislation's goal of removing the federal government from classrooms.â€ Rep. DeSantis added, â€œThe federal government should not be imposing mandates on states and local communities regarding K-12 education. The amendment that we are offering liberates states from burdensome and ineffective regulations, providing local communities with the flexibility to use federal education funding for programs that they believe will best increase the success of students in the classroom.â€ Click here for full text of the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) amendment to H.R. 5 the Student Success Act. ### Letters of Support: National Taxpayers Union Concerned Women for America
02.23.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker, a member of the Committee on Homeland Security, will introduce the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Grants Act tomorrow. The CVE Grants Act aims to better empower state and local authorities in combating violent extremism without requiring additional federal spending. â€œAs we continue to witness more and more barbaric acts â€“ whether it's Boko Haram in Africa or ISIS in the Middle East â€“ we must never become desensitized to violent extremists and their actions. The Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Grants Act works to combat these groups on our home front,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œCVE grants are centered on state and local law enforcement partnerships and will provide local authorities with the resources they need to neutralize both organized and lone-wolf terrorism efforts here in America.â€ H.R. 1022, the CVE Grants Act will assist state and local authorities on the frontlines of combating domestic radicalization by authorizing the use of Urban Area Security Initiative and State Homeland Security grants to deter, detect, and disrupt radical Islamist extremistsâ€™ efforts to influence and recruit Americans. The CVE Grants Act is a budget neutral solution that does not increase federal spending. The bill will also require the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to monitor the use of these grants to better measure the success of these programs and ensures the most effective use of tax payer dollars. U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, will join in co-sponsoring the bill and stated, â€œWhile ISIS and other jihadists groups continue to tailor their hateful and repressive ideology in order to appeal to and radicalize a younger generation within the United States and around the world, the president still refuses to call the threat what it is.â€ Chairman McCaul added, â€œWe must wage a more robust effort here at home to combat violent Islamist extremism by working with local communities to intervene when we see signs of it. As such, the CVE Grants Act will help state and local authorities by giving them the tools they need to root out the would be terrorist in our hometowns.â€
02.10.2015	GRAHAM, NC â€“ Yesterday, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) traveled across Rockingham County meeting with constituents, elected officials, students, and local businesses. In the morning, Rep. Walker met with business leaders at the Eden Chamber of Commerce and joined Mayor Tuggle in congratulating the Morehead High School Wrestling team on a great season. Following a lunch with elected officials, he toured KDH Defense Systems who create life-saving body armor for the armed services and law enforcement. Rep. Walker visited with Rockingham Community College's President Dr. Mark Kinlaw and concluded the day with the first stop of his NC-06 Listening Tour at the college. â€œI was blessed to spend the whole day in Rockingham County and was humbled in hearing about the great work the people there are doing â€“ people like David Herbener and Faye Robertson at KDH Defense who are creating life-saving, wearable technology for our servicemen and women,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œAt every stop yesterday, I heard from people that truly care about their community and are working to restore and improve the quality of life in the sixth district â€“ we are united in that goal. The conversation consistently turned to getting Washington out of the way of Main Street. We need to change the culture of Washington from one of spending and excessive red tape, to one that shrinks the overwhelming size of our federal government and encourages economic growth,â€ added Rep. Walker. Faye Robertson, an employee of KDH Defense discusses their innovative products with Rep. Mark Walker Starting last night, Rep. Walkerâ€˜s NC-06 Listening Tour will include ten stops throughout North Carolinaâ€™s Sixth District. They are intended to help the Congressman better learn the concerns of each community, hearing directly from his constituents. Rep.

02.06.2015	GREENSBORO, NC â€“U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) and U.S. Representative Alma Adams (NC-12) toured the Volvo Groupâ€™s Greensboro campus which is the home of the North American headquarters for Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks, and Volvo Financial Services. The joint visit included a tour of their facilities and a town hall meeting with Volvo employees to discuss their concerns and provide for both Representatives to discuss their work in Congress. â€œVolvo is a fundamental part of the economy of Guilford County, and I am appreciative of all they do in serving our communityâ€ said Rep. Walker. â€œTodayâ€™s tour allowed for both Rep. Adams and I to hear directly from their employees and see their hard work and skills in action. Receiving their feedback and concerns is crucial in helping us better advocate for our constituents in Washington,â€ added Walker. â€œVolvo is situated in both the 12th and the 6th districts which made it the perfect place for Rep. Walker and I to come together in a bipartisan fashion. Todayâ€™s tour was a real opportunity to learn more about the issues impacting local businesses while also hearing directly from the hardworking men and women who power Volvo, a company that employs over 2,200 people in the Piedmont Triad region,â€ said Rep. Adams. Adding, â€œI look forward to working with Rep. Walker, other members of the North Carolina delegation and all of my Congressional colleagues to tackle the economic issues that are impacting our working families.â€ The Volvo Group is one of the world's leading manufacturers of trucks, buses and construction equipment, drive systems for marine and industrial applications, and aerospace components, and is one of the world's leading producers of heavy-diesel engines (9-16 liter). The Group also provides complete solutions for financing and service. In Greensboro, North Carolina, the Volvo Group accounts for 2,200 jobs and over $4 billion in economic impact in the state. The Greensboro campus is the North American headquarters for Volvo Trucks, Mack Trucks and Volvo Financial Services. The campus spans over 650,000 square feet in total and is shared by both the 6th and 12th Congressional District of North Carolina.
01.27.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Today, legislation introduced by U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) to combat human trafficking unanimously passed the House of Representatives. The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460) is the first bill introduced by Rep. Walker, and he is the first member of 114th freshman class to pass a bill in the House. This bipartisan legislation works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims. January is National Human Trafficking Awareness Month. Full text of the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 can be found here. North Carolina Members of Congress, Rep. Alma Adams (NC-12), Rep. Richard Hudson (NC-8), Rep. Robert Pittenger (NC-9), Rep. Patrick McHenry (NC-10) and Rep. Mark Meadows (NC-11), who first introduced this legislation in the 113th Congress, were among 24 co-sponsors of the legislation. Rep. Walker managed the House Floor for the bill, an honor for a member of the freshman class. The following are Rep. Walkerâ€™s prepared remarks: Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 460, the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015, the first bill I have introduced as a Member of Congress. A few weeks ago, we took an oath, promising to protect the people of this great country. I am convinced that part of this high calling is protecting those who are victims of human trafficking. North Carolina is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking. This insidious industry is in our own backyard and it is growing. Just this week, in my own district, local officials announced the formation of the Alamance County Anti-Human Trafficking Advocacy Council to respond to the growing human trafficking problem throughout Alamance County. However, they cannot do it alone and we must come together to stop this unconscionable industry. As a Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I feel strongly that the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security have a crucial role in preventing human trafficking. Up to an estimated 17,500 people are trafficked into the U.S. each year, and many of these victims will pass by either Border Patrol or TSA, and we must make certain these agents are properly trained in the current trends and practices to end human trafficking. This bipartisan legislation requires the Department of Homeland Security to train Transportation Security Administration, Customs and Border Protection and other relevant DHS personnel to counter human trafficking in a manner specific to their professional roles and responsibilities. The bill also ensures that such training will be assessed by the Secretary of Homeland Security on an annual basis, so that it is based on the most current human trafficking trends and intelligence, and directs the Secretary to report to Congress on the number of suspected cases reported by DHS officials. Lastly, this legislation recognizes the critical role that state and local authorities play in preventing human trafficking by authorizing the Department of Homeland Security to make training curricula available to state, local, tribal, and private sector partners. According to the Department of Homeland Security, human trafficking is one of the most profitable forms of transnational crime in the world, second only to drug trafficking. It is incumbent upon Congress to take action and ensure that DHS personnel are better equipped to prevent this serious threat and modern-day form of slavery. The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 builds on the good work already underway at DHS by mandating position-specific, relevant training to enable effective trafficking countermeasures at points of entry, transit hubs, and other high-risk locations across the country. I would like to thank Congressman Meadows for developing and championing this legislation in the 113th Congress and for working with me to re-introduce the measure this Congress. Additionally, I would like to thank the Chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security, Mr. McCaul, for his work on this important issue and for his support of this bill, as well as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation Security, Mr. Katko, for cosponsoring this legislation. Lastly, I would like to thank each of the billâ€™s cosponsors for their support of this important legislation. I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.
01.26.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Last week, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) introduced his first bill, H.R. 460, the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation works to effectively train and inform Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel to better detect and intercept human traffickers and their victims. Rep. Walker is joined by Rep. Mark Meadows (NC-11), House Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul (TX-10) and seven additional Members of Congress in introducing this legislation. â€œ21 million people are estimated to be victims of human trafficking worldwide and this depravity is happening in our own backyards. North Carolina is often ranked as a top state for labor and sex trafficking, and we must act to end this unconscionable industry,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œAn estimated 17,500 people are trafficked through the U.S. each yearâ€”even more tragic, nearly half of these victims are children. The majority of these victims will pass by either Border Patrol or TSA, and we must make certain these agents are properly trained in the current trends and practices to end human trafficking. One victim of human trafficking is one too many.â€ â€œHuman trafficking is one of the great injustices of our time. Iâ€™m grateful to Congressman Walker for his leadership on this important piece of legislation. We must continue to do all that we can to end the tragedy of modern day slavery,â€ Congressman Mark Meadows (NC-11) said. â€œLast year, I held a Committee hearing in Texas where we heard from courageous survivors of human trafficking, as well as State and local law enforcement on how we can work together to combat this horrific crime. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) plays a critical role in this effort,â€ said Rep. Michael McCaul, chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security. â€œI am a proud to once again co-sponsor the Human Trafficking Detection Act, and I will continue to push for further measures to fight human trafficking within the United States and around the world.â€ The Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 expands the scope of mandatory training for DHS officials without increasing federal spending. It also assists local law enforcement by authorizing the Secretary to provide training curricula to any state, local, or tribal government or private organization seeking to establish a human trafficking awareness training program. Additionally, it requires DHS to start keeping records of the number of human trafficking cases reported or confirmed and report annually to Congress on these incidents. January is National Human Trafficking Awareness Month. Full text of the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 can be found here.
01.20.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following response to President Obamaâ€™s State of the Union address. â€œTonight, President Obama demonstrated that he plans to continue to do more of the same, focusing an outdated, top-down approach rather than working together with Congress to empower Americans and create opportunities for all. In November, the American people spoke against Presidentâ€™s policies, and I had high hopes he would listen to their voice and stop his unilateral executive overreach. However, he has already issued six veto threats in the first two weeks of Congress and continues to push his own agenda over the will of the American people while doubling down on Washington bureaucracy and burdensome federal policies. The American people cannot afford more wasteful spending. Smaller government, lower taxes and less spending is the way to grow a healthy economy. Letâ€™s work on empowering Americans by reducing the bureaucracy and red-tape in DC. I implore the President to work with Congress to achieve real reform and a better America.â€ Rep. Walkerâ€™s guest for the State of the Union address was Alex Vance from High Point. Mr. Vance will be graduating from the United States Capitol Police Department on Friday.
01.14.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-06) released the following statement after the House passed H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. â€œOn my first day in office, I joined several of my conservative colleagues demanding the House take immediate action to defund the Presidentâ€™s unprecedented executive actions on immigration. Today, we took a decisive step to roll back the Presidentâ€™s go-it-alone habit by using Congressâ€™ constitutionally given â€œpower of the purse.â€ Our Founding Fathers carefully modeled our government so that no one entity has too much power. Whether I or my constituents agree with the policies the President has enacted, the American people overwhelmingly reject his methods and that is what we are voting on today. The Houseâ€™s actions help restore the separation of powers that President Obama continues to disregard. I encourage President Obama to work with Congress â€“ within the letter of the law â€“ to fix our broken immigration system.â€
01.07.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ In a demonstration of his commitment to provide excellent constituent service, U.S. Representative Mark Walker has opened a new office in Graham, NC. Former Rep. Howard Coble had a Graham office for many years, but Rep. Walker is opening a larger office to hold more staff and better serve the eastern Counties of the 6th District. Janine Osborne, a long-time Rep. Coble staff person in the Graham office, has joined Congressman Walkerâ€™s team as the Director of Constituent Services. In this position, she will help lead Rep. Walkerâ€™s effort to preserve and improve Rep. Cobleâ€™s legacy of great constituent services. This Saturday, Rep. Walker will be hosting an open house at the Graham office location from 9:00-10:30am, conveniently located near other government buildings at 219 West Elm Street, Suite B. The Congressman will be present to greet constituents and talk about the services offered by his office. â€œWith the redrawn 6th District, we thought it was important to move resources and staff east to better serve the whole District,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œAlamance, Orange, Durham, Caswell, Granville, and Person Counties have many needs, and I stand ready to help when and where I can. Whether it is navigating the grant application process or helping with federal benefits, I hope people feel welcome and assisted at my district offices.â€
01.07.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ In his first legislative vote last night, U.S. Representative Mark Walker (NC-6) supported the bipartisan passage of H.R. 22, the Hire More Heroes Act of 2015, which incentivizes small businesses to hire veterans by excluding them from the Affordable Care Actâ€™s employer mandate threshold. â€œOur service men and women deserve our very best â€“ both while in uniform and when they take it off. We need to facilitate the transition back to civilian life by reducing barriers to employment,â€ said Rep. Walker. â€œLast year, the Hire More Heroes Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (406-1) yet never got to the Presidentâ€™s desk. I am proud that on my first day as a U.S. Representative I could support legislation to help our nationâ€™s heroes and reduce the burden of the Presidentâ€™s healthcare law,â€ added Walker. The Hire More Heroes Act received unanimous support in the House of Representatives last night and was passed twice in the House of Representativesâ€™ 113th Session. The Hire More Heroes Act exempts veterans who receive health care through TRICARE or the VA from being counted toward the employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act.
01.06.2015	WASHINGTON, DC â€“ Shortly after being inaugurated as the new Congressman from North Carolinaâ€™s 6th District, Congressman Mark Walker voted to re-elect Speaker John Boehner. â€œThis was a difficult vote as I share the frustrations expressed by many of my constituents, but I cast my vote today with a sense of optimism,â€ said Walker. â€œToday, the focus needs to be on Republicans re-taking the Senate and the American peopleâ€™s rejection of President Obamaâ€™s go-it-alone style. As a Congress, we are ready to pass sound, pro-growth legislation â€“ many bills with bipartisan support â€“ that will help our struggling economy. A change in House leadership, at this time and in this way, would have detracted from our conservative message. â€œI plan to keep the Speaker, and the whole House leadership team, accountable â€“ to encourage them to pass conservative legislation and not buckle under pressure from the White House or Senate. When I believe legislation is not in the best interests of the 6th District of North Carolina and the American people, I will have no problems voting against leadership.â€ â€œFinally, with respect to the other candidates for Speaker, I do not believe they possess the record of leadership and accomplishment necessary to be Speaker of the House. I cannot just vote for the most conservative candidate when considering a position that is this important to the country. We need a statesman and a full-vetting process. The House Republican conference made their selection in November and a last minute attempt to disrupt the process with insufficiently vetted candidates and minimal resolution strategy is not an earnest effort to bring about true change.â€
01.06.2015	WASHINGTON, DC - Congressman Mark Walker was sworn in today as the 36th Congressman from North Carolinaâ€™s 6th District. â€œSo many people put in long hours and hard work to make this moment possible, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve,â€ said Congressman Walker. Adding, â€œIt is a honor and great responsibility to be entrusted by the people to be their voice in Washington. I feel the weight of that duty today.â€ Since being elected in November, Congressman Walker has prioritized building relationships with local elected officials, like Sheriff Sam Page of Rockingham County and Mayor Nancy Vaughan of Greensboro, and meeting with local businesses and civic groups. Congressman Walker has also been working to open new district offices to meet the needs of his constituents. â€œCongressman Coble leaves big shoes to fill, but I believe I am ready for the challenge. Coming from a non-political background, I am ready to put the concerns of everyday people front and center. I want to make good on my pledge to put â€˜people before politicsâ€™,â€ said Walker. Congressman Walker was previously a Pastor of Worship at Lawndale Baptist Church in Greensboro, NC where he helped lead the music ministry. He left Lawndale at the end of 2013 to run for Congress full-time, concluding a 16-year career as a pastor. Before his call to ministry, Congressman Walker worked in business and finance.
