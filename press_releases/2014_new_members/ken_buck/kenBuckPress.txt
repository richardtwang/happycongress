02.04.2019	Washington, D.C. – Last week, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) introduced H.R. 807, the Water and Agriculture Tax Reform (WATER) Act of 2019, a key legislative priority that unanimously passed on the House floor last year and Buck hopes to shepherd to the House floor again in the 116th Congress. Senator Gardner will be introducing the Senate companion bill. This legislation allows mutual water storage and delivery companies to maintain their tax-exempt status, even if they receive more than 15 percent of their revenue from non-member sources, so long as the monies are reinvested into maintenance, operations, and infrastructure improvements. In other words, this legislation allows mutual irrigation and ditch companies to use their own assets to pay for infrastructure improvements that are vital to their operations, which keeps water prices lower for users. “The WATER Act is a commonsense, free-market solution that will help support our local economies, address the rising cost of water, and assist our farmers and ranchers to ensure funds are reinvested in rural water infrastructure. We worked hard to get this legislation through the House last year, and I’m hopeful that this year we’ll see it pass the House and Senate and signed into law,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “So many Coloradans rely on access to water for their livelihood. Colorado farmers and ranchers should be provided the necessary flexibility to achieve success in their respective businesses. The WATER Act will supply an avenue for water infrastructure to be built across the state, supporting agricultural communities by providing access to an affordable water supply. This is a commonsense proposal that Congressman Buck and I will work together to see signed into law,” stated Senator Cory Gardner. ###
01.28.2019	Washington, D.C. – Last week, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) introduced legislation (H.R. 793) to prohibit Members of Congress from using official funds to pay for travel to leave Washington, D.C. during a government shutdown. A Member may use official funds to return to Washington, D.C. if they happen to be away from the Capitol. However, if a Member of Congress would like to leave D.C. during a government shutdown, they will have to pay out of their own pocket. “Over the last several weeks, we witnessed the longest government shutdown in our nation’s history. If this happens again and Members fail to reach an agreement in the future, they should be expected to stay in Washington, D.C. until a compromise is reached and the government shutdown is over. If Members choose to go on with usual business or take vacation while hundreds of thousands of Americans suffer due to dysfunction here in Washington, they should have to pay out of pocket for their trip.” “Earlier this month, Speaker Pelosi and some Democratic colleagues planned a week-long trip to Brussels, Egypt, and Afghanistan that was scheduled in the midst of the government shutdown. This showed a total lack of interest in reaching a solution while hundreds of thousands of Americans were going without pay. This should never be the case. During any government shutdown, Members should be here in D.C. working overtime until the issue is resolved.” “It is time for us to hold Members of Congress accountable. If we’re going to change Washington, then we’ve got to change how Washington works too.” ###
12.03.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) announced the winner of the Congressional App Challenge for the 4thCongressional District. Matthew Paris, a student at Eaton High School, received top honors for his app, “Home Safe.” This application allows individuals to receive a call on their mobile phone when they need to exit a potentially problematic situation (learn more about the app here). “I’m proud of Matthew’s work on this app and I’m excited to see him use his coding skills in the future to contribute to our communities and our country,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “Thank you to all the students who participated in the Congressional App Challenge this year.” Congress conducts the Congressional App Challenge every year to encourage students around the country to develop their Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) skills. Students compete within their congressional districts, and then the winner from each district has the opportunity to showcase their app in the nation’s capital. In the 4th District, entries were judged by professional programmers from the community. ###
09.27.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Ken Buck (CO-04) and Jim Costa (CA-16) introduced bipartisan legislation (H.R. 6927) to ensure a fair and free market for the pricing of aluminum in the United States. The Aluminum Pricing Examination (APEX) Act grants the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) the statutory authority to conduct oversight of the aluminum market and to investigate price setting, benchmarking, and reporting entities. At the same time, the bill enables the Department of Justice to consult with the CFTC to be sure that all regulatory and oversight actions align with anti-trust statutes. “Our beverage and beer industry, along with so many other job-creating industries, rely on a fair and free market for aluminum purchases,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “To avoid perversions of the free market, like monopoly pricing, we need to fully equip the CFTC, alongside the Justice Department, to investigate pricing irregularities that have been plaguing the aluminum market for months now.” The APEX Act comes at a time when the price of sheet aluminum has faced troubling irregularities. There is a sole reference price that operates like a shipping and handling fee added to the cost of sheet aluminum in the U.S., called the Midwest Premium (MWP). This price, set by S&P Global Platts, the sole company responsible for the pricing methodologies and benchmarking of the aluminum markets, has more than doubled (137%) since early 2018. This unforeseen price variation doesn’t reflect the fundamentals of the market. Part of this price increase may be attributed to a reliance on duty-paid prices. End-users of aluminum in Colorado have noted that producers are selling 100% of their aluminum at a price that factors in the duty, or tariff, the producer paid to the government, even though around only 30% of the aluminum these producers are selling was originally subject to a duty when they purchased it from the original supplier. Much of the other 70% comes from recycled aluminum that does not have a duty assessed. The sharp increases in price have negatively impacted both end users of aluminum and consumers who buy water, soda, beer, and other household goods made from aluminum. With the APEX Act, the government will be able to play its proper oversight role in the aluminum market, ensuring with the Department of Justice that price-setting entities in the market are acting fairly and transparently, complying with all anti-trust statutes. This summer, Rep. Buck sent a bi-partisan letter to the Attorney General, along with 31 of his colleagues, asking the Department of Justice to examine possible antitrust violations in the pricing of aluminum. ###
09.26.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck commended the inclusion of his opioid data-sharing language in a bicameral, bipartisan agreement to fight opioids in the United States. His provisions, which were included in H.R. 6, the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, specifically enhance data sharing between wholesale registrants and law enforcement. “I’m thankful that the agreement text includes language to enhance data-sharing among opioid wholesalers and law enforcement,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “If we’re going to stand up to this opioid epidemic in America, then we need everyone on the same page, sharing information to catch the bad actors while still providing good people with the pharmaceuticals they need.” The provisions require reporting of anonymized industry sales data to the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) ARCOS system (Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System). By sharing this information with each other through the ARCOS system, wholesalers of opioid pharmaceuticals can better track and prevent future suspicious sales of controlled substances to pharmacies or practitioner registrants. Rep. Buck’s provisions also require the U.S. Attorney General to publish a report every six months detailing opioid distribution patterns for use by local law enforcement and state attorneys general. Additionally, the provisions from Rep. Buck’s bill will hold registrants responsible for tracking suspicious orders and reporting those to the DEA. ###
07.24.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, the House of Representatives unanimously passed H.R. 519, the WATER Act, which Congressman Ken Buck introduced in 2017 to keep water affordable for rural Colorado. The WATER Act amends the tax code to allow mutual irrigation and ditch companies to reinvest revenue earned from non-member sources, ultimately making water resources more affordable for farmers and ranchers. “By empowering nonprofit mutual irrigation and ditch companies to raise revenue from non-member sources, H.R. 519 will reduce the cost of water for cash-strapped farmers,” Congressman Buck said on the House floor today. “It offers farmers and ranchers an affordable water supply. And, in doing so, it supports not only our agricultural communities, but everyone in America who relies on farms and ranches for food.” Many farmers rely on member-owned mutual irrigation and ditch companies to supply their water. By sharing expenses, these nonprofit organizations help reduce costs. But water shortages are driving up the price of water, increasingly incentivizing farmers to leave the Colorado region because they can’t afford water. H.R. 519 allows these cooperatives to raise more than 15% of their revenue from non-member sources and still maintain their non-profit status, so long as they reinvest the revenue in maintenance, operations, or infrastructure. With the WATER Act, instead of passing the costs of infrastructure and maintenance along to cash-strapped farmers, these cooperatives can raise revenue through recreational water access rights or crossing fees, for example. The WATER Act will now go to the Senate for consideration. Watch the entire speech here: https://youtu.be/7qZSX343eWQ ###
07.20.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released a statement praising the release of the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) for the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP). After 15 years of wading through needless red tape in the federal permitting process, the completion of the FEIS marks a significant milestone. “This is a great step forward for a very important project,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “For northern Colorado, proper water stewardship and storage is vital to our agriculture, recreation, and economy. While it’s unfortunate that overly complex government permitting regulations have held up NISP for this long, I am extremely encouraged that this final impact statement will soon allow northern Colorado to have a more certain supply of water.” The FEIS is an exhaustive study undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that investigates potential alternative water supply sources for northern Colorado and addresses environmental concerns with the NISP project. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act requires a permit for this project because it intends to impact 51 acres of federal Waters of the U.S. and 19 acres of wetlands. NISP is a water storage and infrastructure project that would provide a more reliable water supply in fifteen towns, cities, and water districts throughout the region. Congressman Buck has been vocal about the need for faster permitting of water storage projects and has called attention to the unnecessary delay of the NISP project. He has also supported legislation such as the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act, which would streamline the water project permitting system. ###
06.21.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted for reforms to the food stamp program and for continued support of Colorado farmers. “This legislation ensures a secure national food supply and takes serious steps to reform the food stamp program,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “Congress is requiring qualified individuals to look for work and contribute to society like everyone else.” The Agriculture and Nutrition Act (H.R. 2) would implement a 20-hour per week work requirement for all able-bodied adults who wish to continue receiving food stamps, unless they’re in a work training program. Seniors, the disabled, and those with children under six years of age or caring for someone with disabilities would be exempted from the requirements. The bill also improves employment training programs, ensuring that individuals have the opportunity to improve their work prospects. These reforms eliminate fraud and abuse of the food stamp program, instead equipping individuals to find decent jobs and gain their financial footing. H.R. 2 also includes several important provisions that support the farming and ranching community in Colorado. Agriculture is a key industry in Colorado’s 4th Congressional District. In 2012, 25,965 constituents operated 15,949 farms totaling over 20 million acres (USDA). ###
06.21.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck commended the House Ways and Means Committee for approving the WATER Act (H.R. 519). This legislation amends the tax treatment of mutual water storage and delivery companies so that they can maintain their non-profit status even if more than 15% of their revenue comes from non-members. The non-member revenue beyond 15% must be invested in maintenance, operations, and infrastructure improvements. By changing the tax code in this way, the WATER Act allows these mutual water companies to reinvest in key infrastructure, keeping water affordable for farmers, ranchers, and rural communities. “This legislation meets the needs of rural Colorado by keeping water affordable,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I thank the members of the Ways and Means Committee for considering this legislation and I ask my colleagues to support the bill on the House floor.” The WATER Act will next go to the House floor for a vote by the whole House. ###
06.18.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck led a bipartisan letter, signed by 31 of his colleagues, requesting that Attorney General Jeff Sessions examine possible antitrust violations occurring in the U.S. aluminum market. Presently, end users of aluminum pay a price set in part by the Midwest Transactional Premium, or MWTP, used to factor in the storage and transportation costs of the final product. But consumers of aluminum are increasingly concerned that Platts, the rating service in charge of setting the MWTP, has deviated from its standard practice of using spot transactions to set the price and is instead working with a few producers, merchants, traders, and banks to set a potentially artificial price. “When monopolies manipulate aluminum prices, normal Americans suffer from higher prices for the products they buy,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I encourage the Attorney General to ensure a fair and transparent process for the pricing of aluminum in this country.” Aluminum prices impact end-users of aluminum and the consumers who purchase products like soft drinks and beer. When supply prices are artificially inflated, suppliers are enriched and consumers face a higher cost for products. A PDF of the letter can be found here. ###
06.06.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck praised the awarding of a Department of Transportation Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA) Grant for improvements in the I-25 South “Gap” corridor between Monument and Castle Rock. Buck, along with a bi-partisan group of Colorado federal legislators, penned a letter to Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao asking for full and fair consideration of the important project, and later convened a call with Undersecretary of Transportation for Policy Derek Kan to discuss the merits of the project. “Our transportation infrastructure must meet the needs of Colorado’s growing population and bustling economy,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “I’ve worked closely, alongside my colleagues in the delegation, to emphasize to the Department of Transportation the importance of the I-25 Gap project for the people who rely on this section of the interstate as a key thoroughfare. These grant dollars will make Colorado better connected, benefiting our economy and our communities.” The I-25 South “Gap” is a 34-mile segment of highway stretching from Monument to Castle Rock. This stretch of road has been plagued by high levels of congestion, including delays of greater than 40 percent beyond normal travel time every day of 2016. The GAP project will modernize Colorado’s infrastructure and reduce traffic delays for Colorado drivers. ###
05.16.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, DC – Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO), Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Congressman Ken Buck (CO-4) today introduced the Amache Study Act, legislation that would direct the Department of Interior to conduct a special resource study at Amache, a former Japanese American relocation center in Granada, Colorado. The purpose of the study is to assess the historical significance of Amache and determine the feasibility of Amache becoming part of the National Park System. Currently, Amache is a National Historic Landmark. During World War II, about 10,000 Japanese Americans passed through Amache and over 7,000 called Amache home. According to the National Park Service, “the cemetery, a reservoir, a water well and tank, the road network, concrete foundations, watch towers, the military police compound, and trees planted by the internees still remain.” “When I visited Amache last summer, it served as a stark reminder of a dark moment in our country’s history,” said Gardner. “It’s important we remember the grave injustice that was committed against Japanese Americans during World War II so that we never repeat our mistakes from the past. I’m introducing the Amache Study Act with Senator Bennet and Congressman Buck so we can begin the process of recognizing Amache as a part of the National Park System and ensure the site is preserved for future generations.” “The incarceration of Japanese Americans is a shameful part of our heritage,” Bennet said. “Amache serves as a reminder of that heritage, and as a reminder that progress is not inevitable. Former Colorado Governor Ralph Carr spoke out against camps like Amache—and lost his political career as a result. Preserving Amache will teach future generations that we cannot ignore what is wrong in the present and continue Governor Carr’s legacy of standing up to injustice.” “America is better today because we’ve learned from the lessons of our past,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Camp Amache is one of those hard lessons that needs to be preserved, for the people of Eastern Colorado and the rest of our nation.” As The Prowers Journal reported, “U.S. Senator, Cory Gardner, visited the site and the Amache Museum in Granada Monday, August 21st to get a better understanding of the scope of the Camp and the private efforts that have allowed the site and the museum to be developed and maintained.” Gardner met with local officials and students involved in the preservation of the current site. Bennet also visited Amache last year, where he was guided through the site by John Hopper, founder of the Amache Preservation Society, and student volunteers. Gardner will be traveling to Amache this Saturday, May 19, 2018 to participate in the Annual Amache Pilgrimage. ###
05.11.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Representatives Ken Buck (CO-04), Paul Gosar D.D.S. (AZ-04) and Andy Biggs (AZ-05) met with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, along with their respective senior staff, to discuss critical immigration policy issues. These matters included border security, administrative court processing and sanctuary/fugitive cities. The meeting served as an opportunity for the congressmen to share their concerns, and to seek ways to partner with the Attorney General on strengthening immigration enforcement by eliminating current loop holes, reducing false claims for asylum, reducing false claims for refugee status, and withholding funds for cities that refuse to enforce federal law or cooperate with federal law enforcement. Lastly, the parties discussed applying international law regarding claims for refugee status as opposed to the current standard relative to contiguous state passage. In addition, the Attorney General briefed the members on the status of DACA court cases now pending in several jurisdictions and expressed his confidence that the Obama letter deferring deportation will be eliminated by the courts and the rule of law restored. Attorney General Jeff Sessions explained that "For decades, the American people have pleaded with our elected officials for a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest—one that we can be proud of. To achieve that, Congress and the Executive Branch must take bold actions to stop the rampant illegality at our Southwest Border and to encourage sanctuary cities to change their policies. I appreciate the support of Congressman Buck and other Members of Congress who have supported the Department of Justice’s initiatives and heeded the calls of their constituents to restore the rule of law in America.” Congressman Ken Buck stated, “I thank Attorney General Sessions for leading the effort to secure our border and fight the sanctuary city policies that allow heroin traffickers to walk our streets, suppress wages for American workers and burden our education, health care and judicial systems.” Congressman Paul Gosar stated, “The Obama Administration's lack of enforcement on our immigration laws have put our families, communities and our country at risk," said Congressman Gosar. “Obama’s open border policies have encouraged lawlessness, drug trafficking, sex trafficking, gun running and directly lead to the opioid crisis in our country. I commend Attorney General Sessions for doing what he can to reverse this reckless and irresponsible Obama era disaster.” Congressman Andy Biggs stated, “Yesterday, I had the opportunity to join my colleagues to meet with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. We had a very productive conversation, discussing a wide range of issues that affect his jurisdiction – particularly the Department of Justice’s enforcement of illegal immigration. I’m thankful that we have an administration that understands the necessity of protecting innocent Americans through enforcing our laws and securing the border. Congress should also act by enacting laws to codify the administration’s efforts into law, including ending ‘catch and release’ of criminally violent illegal aliens (by passing Grant’s Law) and removing incentives for aliens who illegally enter the U.S. I hope that Attorney General Sessions continues his mission to end illegal immigration, and I will support him with his worthy endeavors to this end." BACKGROUND On Thursday May 10, 2018, Congressman Ken Buck, Congressman Paul Gosar and Congressman Andy Biggs, along with their respective Chiefs of Staff, Ritika Robertson, Thomas Van Flein and Deborah Mazol, met for over an hour with Attorney General Sessions and his senior staff at the Attorney General’s office. The parties discussed the current crisis on the border and the chaos created by the Obama Administration when it reduced border security and issued a letter withholding deportation or deferring deportation of illegal aliens known as “DACA.” ###
04.27.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO), Jared Polis (D-CO), and Tom Garrett (R-VA) introduced the Review Every Act Diligently In Total (READ IT) Resolution to amend House rules to establish a mandatory minimum review period for all legislation that is brought to a vote. This Resolution would ensure that the text of any bill, resolution, joint resolution, or conference report would be available for a minimum number of minutes equal to two times the number of pages from the time new text is released until the time of the Floor vote. “Having only a few hours to read and digest huge bills is an absurd way to run a government. You’d be upset if your teacher assigned War and Peace in the morning and tested you on it later that afternoon. You should be upset at Congress when we vote on legislation that we haven’t even read. That’s why the READ IT Resolution is so important,” said Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO). “It’s a sad state of affairs that this even has to be said, but Members of Congress should absolutely have time to read legislation before voting,” said Congressman Jared Polis (D-CO). “It’s an affront to the people we serve that too often our elected officials aren’t even given the time to read legislation. Congress is broken, and this is one of the reasons why. Let’s get to work (and let’s get to reading) and fix it,” concluded Polis. “Our Founding Fathers created a representative democracy. It follows that elected legislators can’t adequately represent their constituents’ views if their representatives don’t have the chance to weigh in on a bill or let alone an opportunity to review it. The READ IT Resolution is an effort to give members of the House the chance to be a truly deliberative and representative institution. This will create a more transparent government and give our House colleagues on both sides of the aisle ample opportunity to advance legislation with full knowledge of its implications,” said Congressman Tom Garrett (R-VA). Read the full text of the READ IT Resolution HERE. ###
04.26.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Last night, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) became an original co-sponsor of the No Enforcement, No Grant for Sanctuary Cities Act (H.R. 5617), which is sponsored by Rep. Dan Donovan. This legislation withholds State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Funds (SCAAP) from cities that prevent cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration agents, sending a strong message that there will be consequences for cities choosing to ignore the rule of law. Rep. Buck’s co-sponsorship follows his effort to shine a light on the connection between sanctuary city policies and the heroin epidemic, specifically in Denver. The city has become a hub for heroin trafficking across the Rocky Mountain region, helped in part by illegal immigrant heroin traffickers who can no longer be removed from the streets due to the city’s sanctuary policy. “Sanctuary cities not only violate the rule of law, they also create safe harbor for illegal immigrants engaged in heroin trafficking,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “If we want to protect our children and grandchildren and stop this disastrous heroin epidemic, then we need to use every tool at our disposal to end sanctuary city policies.” SCAAP funds help states and localities offset correctional costs related to incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens, and are offered with the expectation that those governing entities receiving the funds comply with applicable Federal immigration laws. H.R. 5617 would withhold funds directly tied to incarcerating these criminal aliens from cities that have chosen to violate Federal immigration law. ###
03.22.2018	For Immediate Release Thursday, March 22, 2018 Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Buck stood against out-of-control spending in Washington. He opposed a 2,232-page Omnibus spending bill which passed the House of Representatives by 256 to 167. The bill was introduced late Wednesday night, leaving members of both parties with less than 24 hours to read and discuss the text before being called to the floor for a vote. The legislation increases federal spending by $143 billion dollars, a number that not only further grows our nation’s debt, but that also sets a disastrous precedent for future appropriations processes. “Today, Congress passed a spending bill that disregards our duty to future generations, adding billions more to the debt, failing once again to seriously tackle our nation’s deficit,” said Congressman Buck. “I voted against this legislation because I believe both parties need to come together and find ways to limit spending on both the domestic and defense side of the ledger. Until we do this, the prosperity of our generation and future generations will be anchored to our ballooning deficit.” ###
03.14.2018	For Immediate Release Wednesday, March 14, 2018 Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) praised the passage of H.R. 4465, the Endangered Fish Recovery Programs Extension Act. This legislation, which Rep. Buck co-sponsored, passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly last night and will now go to the U.S. Senate for consideration. The bill continues an important consensus effort by environmentalists, government, and water users to protect fish species while ensuring that our state’s precious water resources can still be used for recreation, drinking, and agriculture. “Communities across the 4th Congressional District rely on water from the Colorado River,” Rep. Ken Buck stated. “This legislation allows those communities to thrive while still protecting our endangered species. Working together, Coloradans have proven that they are the best stewards of our state’s precious natural resources.” The legislation continues base funding for the Upper Colorado and San Juan Recovery Implementation Program. This program, which began in 1998, assures compliance with Endangered Species Act (ESA) requirements to protect 4 endangered fish species native to the Colorado River while also permitting river water to be used by residents across Colorado who depend on it. Several water projects supplying the 4th Congressional District rely on the accessibility of water in the Upper Colorado river basin, including the Arkansas-Fryingpan Project, the Colorado Big Thompson Project, and the Windy Gap Project. ###
03.06.2018	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Ken Buck (CO-04) and Ted Lieu’s (CA-33) legislation to prevent political burrowing unanimously passed the House of Representatives. H.R. 1132, the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act, prevents temporary political appointees from converting into permanent civil service positions when their appointing president leaves office. This process, called “burrowing,” undermines merit-based hiring for the civil service, allowing former presidential appointees to use their political connections to land a life-long job in the federal bureaucracy. Political appointees serve in government temporarily to advance the president’s policy agenda within the executive branch. Burrowing allows them to continue advancing that agenda long after their appointing president has left office. “If we really want to drain the swamp in Washington, then we must end this practice of political burrowing,” Rep. Ken Buck stated. “Political appointees have the privilege of advancing their appointing president’s agenda for a period of time, but when that president leaves, they have a duty to Americans to step aside as well.” “A hallmark of our democracy is our apolitical civil service. By safeguarding the nonpartisan nature of our government, we can ensure that it continues to work to benefit the American public first and foremost,” stated Rep. Ted Lieu. The Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act prevents political appointees from being hired into the civil service for two years following their departure from a political position. Thereafter, the head of an agency seeking to hire a former political appointee must submit a written request to the Office of Personnel Management to explain why the hiring of the former political appointee is necessary to achieve the agency’s mission. ###
12.12.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - U.S. Congressmen Ken Buck (R-CO), Pete Sessions (R-TX), and Walter B. Jones (R-NC) have diligently worked with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to urge them to offer Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) as a treatment option for our nation’s veterans. Last month, the VA made an announcement that two Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities will partner with local providers to offer HBOT as a treatment option for Veterans with persistent post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms resistant to standard options. In addition, the VA and the Department of Defense are planning a multisite research study to examine more fully the use of HBOT for patients diagnosed with PTSD. “I’m pleased to see the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offering hyperbaric oxygen therapy as another option in treating the physical and mental injuries that so many veterans acquire while defending our freedom,” said Congressman Buck. “After talking to veterans and providers, I’m convinced that America’s heroes deserve HBOT therapy as an option in treating their injuries. I look forward to continuing our work with the VA and Congress to ensure that this important therapy is utilized to its full capacity.” “Thousands of brave men and women in uniform are returning from duty with severe physical and mental injuries causing many to be unable to find a job and in many cases resulting in suicide,” said Congressman Sessions. “Our nation’s veterans deserve our unwavering support and that is why I have been working with my colleagues for more than a decade to research, study, and better understand how hyperbaric oxygen therapy could help treat injuries. I am delighted with the VA’s decision to offer this life saving treatment to our nation’s heroes and I look forward to continuing to work with them on this important issue.” “America’s courageous veterans deserve our full help and support when healing from PTSD or a TBI. That is why for years, my colleagues and I have worked with the VA and DoD to find further treatments to help those men and women on the road to recovery,” saidCongressman Jones. “It gives me great joy to announce that two VA facilities will now offer HBOT treatment to our heroes suffering from those invisible injuries. I want to thank Secretary David Shulkin for his leadership on this pilot program and my colleagues for their persistent support of HBOT research and treatment.” ###
12.08.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Windsor, CO – Today, Congressman Ken Buck announced the 4th Congressional District winners of the Congressional App Challenge. Evan Hassman and Hunter Burley, students at Erie High School, received first place for their app, “In Space, Out of Gas.” The computer-based role-playing game written in the Scratch programming language challenges users to explore a perilous space environment. “I’m incredibly proud of everyone who participated in the Congressional App Challenge this year.

Students have the opportunity to code an app of their choice, either individually or in teams. A panel of judges from Colorado’s technology community evaluate the entries and choose a first-place winner who will be invited to Washington, D.C. to present the app. Winning entrants Hassman and Burley posted this video description of their app. ###
12.06.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Rice: Coleman Lamb (202-225-5516) Buck: Kyle Huwa (202-225-4676) Kilmer: Tim Biba (202-225-5916) Norman: Jessica Cahill (202-225-5501) Moulton: Matt Corridoni (202-603-1859) Peters: Colin MacCarthy (202-225-0508) Washington, D.C. – Today, Representatives Kathleen Rice (NY-04) and Ken Buck (CO-04) launched the bipartisan Congressional Reformers Caucus in the United States House of Representatives. Co-chairs Buck and Rice were joined by 17 of their colleagues as founding members of the caucus. The group pledges to work across the aisle in pursuit of common sense reforms to Congress and the legislative process. “The members of this caucus come from across the political spectrum and disagree on plenty of issues, but it’s obvious to all of us that Congress is in dire need of reform, and we’re committed to taking real action to change the status quo in Washington, reduce the influence of money in our political process, and get our government back to work for the people we serve,” said Representative Kathleen Rice, co-Chair of the Congressional Reformers Caucus. “People are tired of partisan gridlock and double standards for politicians, and they’re waiting for leaders to step up and work together to reform our campaign finance system and legislative process so we can solve real problems. That’s exactly why we created the Reformers Caucus, and I’m excited to join my colleagues in this effort to start restoring the public’s faith and trust in their government.” “Washington is broken. Donors and insiders have too much influence, and too often backroom deals trip up good legislation. Political party has nothing to do with good governance, which is why I’m proud to be joined by my friend, Rep. Kathleen Rice, and a bipartisan group of colleagues who all want a Congress that works for the people. I’m eager to develop legislation with this group that will improve America’s trust in our democracy,” stated Congressman Ken Buck, co-chair of the Congressional Reformers Caucus. “People are right to view Washington, DC in such low regard,” Rep. Derek Kilmer (WA-06) said. “Bills are being written by special interests in order to benefit campaign donors with no concern for the effects it has on the people who have to live with the results. That’s wrong, and the Reformers Caucus will work to bring the will of the American people back into the debate.” “The time is now to bring common sense reforms, accountability, and transparency to Washington. I look forward to joining this bipartisan group so that we can work to regain the trust of the American people,” stated Congressman Ralph Norman (SC-05). "I'm proud to join this bipartisan effort to restore greater transparency, fairness, and ethics to the legislative process. Leaders should be held to a higher standard. It's time to bring integrity to Washington D.C.,” stated Congressman Seth Moulton (MA-06). “San Diegans know that our collaborative culture among businesses, universities, and government can be a model for Washington. I’m pleased to join this Caucus, dedicated to working across the aisle in good faith to pass common-sense reform that would result in greater government transparency, an overhaul to the way our elections are run, and restoration of the full legislative process,” stated Congressman Scott Peters (CA-52). The launch of this caucus comes at a time when confidence in Congress sits at all-time lows. Americans worry that donors and Beltway insiders have undue influence over a broken legislative process. Citizens are losing confidence in our nation’s capacity for good governance and functional democracy. The Congressional Reformers Caucus aims to work across the aisle on common sense reforms, fighting for greater transparency, fairness, and ethics in the legislative process. Below are the founding members of the Congressional Reformers Caucus: Democrat: Kathleen Rice (NY-04) Derek Kilmer (WA-06) Scott Peters (CA-52) Seth Moulton (MA-06) Ron Kind (WI-03) Tom O'Halleran (AZ-01) Cheri Bustos (IL-17) Stephanie Murphy (FL-07) Donald Norcross (NJ-01) John Sarbanes (MD-03) Republican: Ken Buck (CO-04) Mike Gallagher (WI-08) Ralph Norman (SC-05) Andy Biggs (AZ-05) Jack Bergman (MI-01) Matt Gaetz (FL-01) Rodney Davis (IL-13) Jeff Fortenberry (NE-01) Mike Coffman (CO-06) ###
11.30.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04), along with Reps. Dave Brat (VA-07), Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-08), Tom Garrett (VA-05), Jody Hice (GA-10), Mike Johnson (LA-04), Steve Pearce (NM-02), and Scott Taylor (VA-02), introduced H.R. 4495, the Settlement Tax Deductions are Over for Predators Act (STOP Act), legislation to prohibit the deductibility of legal settlements related to sexual assault and sexual harassment as business expenses. “When we allow companies to deduct sexual assault and sexual harassment related settlements, we’re asking the American taxpayer to subsidize hush money payments that cover-up sexual misconduct,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Our tax code should make it harder, not easier, for sexual misconduct to occur in the workplace,” said Congressman Scott Taylor. “Currently, the tax code allows companies to deduct sexual assault and harassment settlements. As with lawmakers using our tax dollars for settlements, this is outrageous. These should have never been burdens the tax payer bears.” “There is absolutely no place for sexual harassment in the workplace or anywhere. Using taxpayer dollars to hide sexual harassment claims does nothing but protect the wrongdoer. It is shameful, and it must be stopped. I will continue to seek solutions that empower those who have fallen victim to sexual harassment and promote initiatives that combat this behavior,”stated Congressman Mike Johnson. “Whether it’s Hollywood, Congress or a corporate boardroom, there is no place for sexual abuse or harassment in the workplace. Just as I’m committed to protecting taxpayer dollars from being misused in Washington to cover up sexual misconduct allegations, I’m also committed to preventing private sector businesses from using tax breaks to sweep these heinous acts under the rug. This Congress must stand with the victims of this harassment and take swift action to root out those who would sexually harass any other person, regardless of position or title,” said Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick. “This bill is long overdue. American taxpayers should not be footing the bill for settlements related to sexual assault and sexual harassment. I’m proud to work with my colleagues today to ensure no one, regardless of their wealth or power is able to write off the crimes they commit,” stated Rep. Steve Pearce. Currently, companies can deduct as ordinary and necessary business expenses any legal settlements, fines, fees, and expenses related to sexual assault and sexual harassment cases. In allowing businesses to write off these expenses, the American taxpayer is effectively subsidizing the cost of resolving legal issues related to sexual misconduct. The STOP Act would prohibit deduction of these expenses in cases where the allegations are public or in cases involving a non-disclosure agreement. S.1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is being considered by the U.S. Senate today, includes similar language. The legislation offered by Buck and the original co-sponsors shows support in the House of Representatives for the inclusion of this language in a final tax bill package. ###
11.14.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck offered an amendment to H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, prohibiting tax subsidies for legal settlements related to sexual assault or sexual harassment. “America has been watching Hollywood for decades, but not watching closely enough. Behind the red carpets and glitzy premieres is a culture of deceit and depravity. As Congress rethinks our tax code, we need to rethink the way we treat Hollywood by eliminating the business expense deduction for hush money associated with sexual assault and sexual harassment cases,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. When companies pay settlements and legal fees in the regular course of their business, these costs can typically be written off as ordinary and necessary business expenses. In allowing these businesses to expense the cost of resolving legal issues, the tax code makes it less financially costly for the business to engage in or allow activity that draws lawsuits. In Hollywood, this means that when companies settle a sexual harassment or sexual assault case and then deduct that settlement from their tax liability, the American taxpayer effectively subsidizes those companies’ costs of covering up the illegal behavior. Rep. Buck’s amendment would eliminate business expensing for legal settlements, fines, fees, and legal expenses associated with sexual assault and sexual harassment. ###
11.03.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Last night, Congressman Ken Buck led a special orders hour on the House floor to highlight the House of Representative’s accomplishments and the Senate’s inaction. During the hour, several Members of Congress joined Rep. Buck to talk about important legislation that has passed the House but is now stalled in the Senate. Members joining Rep. Buck on the floor included Rep. Alex Mooney, Rep. Andy Biggs, Rep. Jody Hice, Rep. Steve King, Rep. Ted Poe, Rep. Dan Donovan, and Rep. Paul Gosar. Legislation discussed included the Financial CHOICE Act (H.R. 10), Kate’s Law (H.R. 3004), the Email Privacy Act (H.R. 387), and the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act (H.R. 372), among others. Below is an excerpt from Rep. Buck’s introduction to the hour. Click here for a video of Rep. Buck’s opening remarks. “In 2016, the American people commissioned us with a task. They asked us to fight for jobs. They asked us to fix healthcare. They asked us to roll back regulations. They asked us to secure the free world. They asked us to secure our own borders. The House of Representatives heard them. We’ve been busy developing and passing legislation that meaningfully improves the lives of Americans. I commend the Speaker and his leadership in moving these bills through the House. Unfortunately, much of the House’s important work has stalled in the U.S. Senate. It’s time the Senate pass important legislation and restore trust in our Republic. Because before this week, the House had sent 308 bills to the Senate that are still stalled in that chamber. This is more than any of the previous four presidential administrations had stalled at this same time in their first year. And for the record, the House of Representatives in the 115th Congress has also passed more total bills than Houses in any of the last four presidential administrations at this point. We’re at 394 total bills. The dreams of this great Republic cannot be realized by the House alone. The Senate must hear the people and come together around the often bi-partisan measures we’ve been sending to them.” ###
11.03.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck’s (CO-04) legislation to prevent political appointees from burrowing into the bureaucracy was approved by the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Buck’s legislation prevents non-career, political appointees from converting into senior-level civil servants at the end of their appointing President’s term. When they leverage their political connections to win a life-long job in the bureaucracy, they’re also jumping ahead of the hard-working, career civil servants who were hired into their roles based on merit. “I’m thankful that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved my legislation to prevent burrowing of political appointees,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “We need to prevent political appointees of either party from embedding in the bureaucracy and carrying on the agenda of their appointing President long after his or her term is completed.” Buck and Rep. Ted Lieu (CA-33) introduced the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act in February 2017 along with Reps. Pete Sessions (TX-32) and Jared Polis (CO-02). The bill was reported with an amendment from the Oversight and Government Reform Committee on Thursday, November 2, 2017, and will now wait for consideration on the House floor. ###
10.23.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck sent a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting information on the Department of Justice’s actions to prosecute individuals who engage in criminal activity against energy infrastructure. The bi-partisan letter, signed by over 80 members of the U.S. House, comes amid recent attacks by environmental activists on pipeline infrastructure around the country. “Environmental activists who choose to use violence against our nation’s energy infrastructure and the men and women who work in the energy industry should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “While I will continue to support their right to protest policies they disagree with, we need to send a strong message to those who destroy property that such dangerous behavior will not be tolerated by the communities who live around and rely on this energy infrastructure.” In October of 2016, several activists attempted a coordinated attack against oil pipeline infrastructure. Subsequent attacksoccurred on the Dakota Access Pipeline. Environmental extremists have been open about their intentions to damage infrastructure and hurt people in order to advance their political agenda. Some have filmed and posted their criminal behavior online, while another wrote a letter-to-the-editor to a Colorado newspaper calling for violence against energy infrastructure and employees of energy companies. Under pressure, the newspaper ultimately edited the online version of the letter. Congressman Buck’s letter to the Department of Justice seeks information as to whether federal statutes adequately allow the DOJ to prosecute criminal activity against energy infrastructure and whether the DOJ has and will federally prosecute individuals engaged in this illegal activity. The text of the letter can be found at this link. ###
10.03.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) voted to protect unborn children across America by supporting the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36). This important pro-life legislation prevents children 20 weeks and older from being electively aborted. “Science shows us that unborn children not only experience pain but also may have a chance to survive if born at 20 weeks,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “We have a responsibility to the unborn babies, our families, our communities, and humanity to end the injustice of late-term abortion.” Scientific research increasingly shows that unborn children can feel pain at 20 weeks post-fertilization, and anesthesiologists routinely apply pain medication to unborn babies when performing prenatal surgery. Studies indicate that unborn children often react to noxious stimuli in a way that implies a pain response. Additionally, a quarter of babies born prematurely, as early as 20 weeks after fertilization, are now surviving with proper medical care. H.R. 36 calls on America to recognize that abortions after 20 weeks amount to ending the life of a child who can feel pain and could survive outside the womb. Multiple polls show that a majority of Americans agree with placing limitations on abortion after the 20-week mark. America remains one of only seven nations in the world, alongside China and North Korea, to still allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. H.R. 36 will next be considered by the Senate. ###
09.14.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Ken Buck called on residents of the 4th Congressional District to help his office recognize those Hispanic-Americans who have made significant contributions to their communities. His effort to honor these individuals comes in advance of National Hispanic Heritage Month, which lasts from September 15 to October 15. "Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to remember and learn about the important contributions of Hispanic Americans in our community," Congressman Buck stated. "I already know so many in the Hispanic American community who have deeply impacted Northern Colorado, and I'm sure there are many more individuals across our district who should be honored as part of this legacy." Congressman Buck encourages constituents to share the names and stories of Hispanic Americans in the 4th Congressional District who have made significant contributions to the Colorado community with this form: https://buck.house.gov/hispanic-heritage-month. The deadline for submissions is October 1.
08.04.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – This week, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) and several colleagues signed a letter to President Trump, asking for closer coordination between federal, state, and local authorities on issues related to federal land and resource use policies. The federal government owns more than 635 million acres of land and many of these vast tracts are found in western states. Land use policies are often poorly coordinated with local experts, causing federal regulations to harm Americans more than help them. Federal land use policies can have drastic impacts on local governments and economies, making it imperative that federal officials consider the interests and concerns of impacted communities. “Too often, federal agencies ignore the expertise and input of local government officials when implementing policies that impact our land and natural resources,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “That’s why I strongly encourage the President to review and revise the current regulations and statutes applying to federal coordination with state and local governments. When it comes to utilizing and stewarding our nation’s lands and resources, I trust local stakeholders and officials more than I trust Washington bureaucrats to know what’s best for Colorado, for the West, and for the entire nation.” Congressman Buck signed the letter with almost two dozen of his colleagues, many of whom are also members of the Congressional Western Caucus, a group of representatives who work together to develop and promote policy that positively impacts the western United States. The letter also includes a draft Executive Order and draft policies for the president’s consideration. If the president enacts these proposals, federal and local agencies will be able to leverage their combined expertise as they find ways to responsibly care for federal lands. The full text of the letter can be read here. ###
06.30.2017	For Immediate Release Friday, June 30, 2017 Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck signed a letter, with several of his colleagues, asking Speaker Ryan to cancel August recess unless the House can complete several vital legislative goals. Buck wants the House to complete the annual budget, the annual appropriations process, and to reform the tax code. “If we can’t get our work done, we shouldn’t be going on recess,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Leaving for August recess before we’ve completed our appropriations bills and tax reform will fail to boost our economy and imperil the people’s trust in Republican governance.” Republicans promised the American people that a unified government would allow for the achievement of several policy priorities, the letter notes. The Congressional Budget Act also requires the House to remain in session in July until all appropriations bills have been passed, meaning the House has a duty to follow the spirit of the rule by disallowing any recess. The text of the letter is below: June 30, 2017 The Honorable Paul Ryan Speaker of the House H-232 The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Speaker Ryan, We request that you cancel Congress’s current plans to recess for the month of August to ensure there is enough time to address the long list of pressing issues on our docket. During the 2016 elections, President Trump and Republican candidates running for the House and Senate promised the American people that with unified Republican government we could achieve many of the policy priorities that have been mere wishes for the last several years. We vowed to repeal Obamacare, pass pro-growth tax reform, reign in federal spending, and work towards balancing the budget. The American people put their faith in us and are counting on us to carry out these goals. Prior to September 30, we must also find a path forward on passing a federal budget and appropriating funding for fiscal year 2018, reviewing the federal debt limit, and consider reauthorizing the Federal Aviation Administration, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the National Flood Insurance Program, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and more. Our constituents expect us to work hard and will be disappointed if we shut down for four to five weeks when we could move our agenda forward. We have achieved some notable accomplishments you have rightly called singles and doubles, but working during August could facilitate hitting some home runs. We are not under the illusion that any of these things will be easy to accomplish, but we fully intend to work in good faith to remain true to our constituents in our respective districts. We cannot afford to lose any of the momentum we have and therefore request that you cancel August recess. ###
06.27.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck praised the Trump Administration’s proposal to repeal former President Obama’s Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule. The rule, finalized by the Obama administration in 2015, created an over-broad classification of waters that fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. In expanding the definition of Waters of the U.S., the rule would have given the federal government expanded control of local water resources, potentially violating the private property rights of local farmers and ranchers. “I applaud the administration’s decision to roll back this overreaching WOTUS rule,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Farmers and ranchers across Colorado will now be free from Washington bureaucrats who want to regulate every small body of water on their private property.” Congressman Buck is encouraged by the administration’s plan to rewrite the WOTUS rule and encourages the EPA to empower states and local stakeholders in determining how to regulate water resources, instead of Washington officials. ###
06.21.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck spoke on the House floor about H.R. 1654, the Water Supply Permitting Coordination Act. This legislation places the Bureau of Reclamation within the Department of the Interior in charge of coordinating project permitting among State and Federal governments on federal lands, allowing for a more streamlined process. Congressman Buck has pushed for federal changes to water project permitting since he entered Congress, especially in light of the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP), a multi-county water storage effort that would impact most of Northeastern Colorado. NISP and similar projects face delays that have lasted over a decade as they jump through hoop after hoop with various federal agencies at various levels of government. The permitting of the NISP project has already cost Colorado communities over $15 million and has dragged on for over 13 years. H.R. 1654’s reform of the permitting process would help eliminate duplication and excessive requirements in water project permitting, speeding-up a process that would otherwise take years. “In Colorado, water is tough to come by, which makes water storage a necessity. That’s why H.R. 1654 is so important,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “We need to streamline the water project permitting process so that future projects like NISP don’t take over a decade to win a permit.” Watch this video for Congressman Buck’s floor speech: https://youtu.be/jQG3dyeTtUY For more information on NISP and water permitting, visit Congressman Buck’s website: https://buck.house.gov/buckstopshere-part1. Text of the speech is below: I thank the gentleman from Washington and my colleague on the Rules Committee, Mr. Newhouse, for yielding to me. Mr. Speaker, in the West, water is life. Coloradans must wisely steward the precious water flowing through our lands. And that’s why we’re so focused on water storage projects. Unfortunately, many water storage projects in my state face significant setbacks in permitting due to a long list of regulatory checkboxes. Local, state, and federal agencies have all their own requirements. For the past several years, I’ve followed multiple important water storage projects on the front range of Colorado that deeply impact Coloradans. Year after year, the shovels remain untouched as the water projects inch their way through the regulatory permitting process. Water projects should not take over ten years to permit and then only a few years to build. Much of this delay occurs because each level of government—local, state, and federal—requires their own studies and permitting checklists, even though many of those requirements are the same or only slightly different. H.R. 1654 makes this process more efficient, allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to coordinate the federal and state permitting processes, so that we can avoid unnecessary duplication and so that we can better unify the approval requirements. H.R. 1654 offers a more streamlined approval process for our water projects, but still empowers state and federal governments to fulfil our duties to protect communities and the environment. This is a good government bill. We’re simply asking different levels of government to work together so that our water projects can earn the permits they rightly qualify for. No water project should take 10 years to gain approval, but too many have. H.R. 1654 ensures that projects on federal lands will have a clear, more efficient permit application process. We owe this bill to the people of Colorado. We owe this bill to the people of the West. We owe this bill to everyone in this country who relies on fresh, clean drinking water. To the farmers who need water for their crops. To the ranchers who need water for their livestock. To the anglers who need water for their recreation. I’m supporting H.R. 1654 for these people. I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation as well. Thank you, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time. ###
06.21.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) announced the names of the 14 students from Colorado’s 4th Congressional District, all of whom he nominated, who have received appointments to the U.S. military academies. Of the 14, eight will be attending the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs while one will attend the Merchant Marine Academy, three will attend the Naval Academy, and two will attend West Point. Each of these candidates has been appointed for their superior academic and athletic achievements as well as their commitment to public service in their communities. Congressman Buck is proud of these young students, who represent the very best that the 4th District has to offer. “I’m so proud of the young men and women from Colorado who have committed their lives to protecting this country and our ideals,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I couldn’t be more confident in our nation’s future because these men and women will be in charge.” The service academies offer students dedicated to public service an undergraduate education that integrates academic studies with athletic competition and preparation for military leadership. To be admitted to a military academy, students must be nominated by their Representative, their Senator, or the Vice President of the United States. Upon receiving a nomination, applicants must pass the admissions processes of the academies themselves. Once admitted, these students will receive a top-tier education for free with the commitment that they will serve in the armed forces for five years after graduation. Scott Johnson, from Douglas County, will attend the Air Force Academy this fall and shared his thoughts in this video. Congressman Buck’s remarks on these students were entered in the Congressional Record and each student received a copy of their Congressional Record entry (see attached photos). Below is a list of students from the Fourth Congressional District who have been appointed to a military academy in the 2017-2018 academic year after receiving a nomination from Congressman Buck: Air Force Academy: Victoria Bernabei – Chaparral High Jordan Coffman – Hoehne High/University of CO-Colorado Springs Alexander Hamilton – Regis Jesuit High Scott Johnson – Legend High Gianni Orlando – Valor Christian High Spencer Rohlwing – Regis Jesuit High/Northwestern Preparatory School Shaina Smidt – Castle View High/Northwestern Preparatory School Nolan Laufenberg – Castle View High Merchant Marine Academy: Alexander Mueller – Front Range Christian Naval Academy: Philip Dalke – Castle View High/CSU-Pueblo Paul Fletcher – Legend High Jeanette Steerman – McClave High School West Point: Katherine Murphy – Colorado Early Colleges Julia Wyatt – Frederick High ###
06.08.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, the House passed the Financial CHOICE Act by a vote of 233 to 186. The House also passed, on a bipartisan 233 to 185 vote, an amendment to the CHOICE Act offered by Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) that makes more efficient use of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) headquarters building in Washington, D.C. Financial CHOICE Act The CHOICE Act holds Wall Street accountable, reins in the CFPB, and improves economic growth and job creation by increasing access to capital and banking services. The bill replaces the Dodd-Frank Act, a law that has benefited big banks to the detriment of small community banks in Colorado. “The Financial CHOICE Act was written for Main Street, not Wall Street,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “The CHOICE Act will roll back those costly regulations that prevent our local banks from offering the services our community deserves.” Many Colorado banks have been significantly impacted by Dodd-Frank. Josie Huelskamp, Senior Vice President at FirstBank in Colorado, stated, “While Dodd-Frank was well intentioned, these complex regulations limit our ability to provide needed financing to even some of our most trustworthy, long-term customers who impact job creation, economic prosperity and community development. This is why we support the CHOICE Act because it will allow our bank to better serve customers and, therefore, the Colorado community.” Congressman Buck spoke about his support for the CHOICE Act in this video: https://youtu.be/1DBmZ2tdf5k. Congressman Buck’s Amendment The Financial CHOICE Act makes changes to the CFPB which will likely result in different real estate needs for the agency. Congressman Buck’s amendment to the CHOICE Act requires a study to determine if the current CFPB building is a cost-effective use of taxpayer dollars. If the study determines their real estate needs have changed, and there is no other government agency that can utilize the building, it authorizes the sale of the property. “The lavish, $200 million renovation of the CFPB’s headquarters was a waste of taxpayer money,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “My amendment simply ensures that we use the CFPB’s current office space as efficiently as possible.” ###
05.19.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – After the House of Representatives passed legislation this week to protect law enforcement officers, Congressman Ken Buck released a statement about National Police Week (May 15 - May 21) and the importance of protecting police officers. “Our law enforcement officers make a sacrifice every time they step outside in uniform,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “National Police Week gives us all a chance to honor them for their service, and to think about ways we can serve our law enforcement officers and their families. The legislation we passed this week sends a message to criminals that violence against officers will be met with an appropriately harsh penalty.” Congressman Buck voted for the Thin Blue Line Act on Thursday, May 18, legislation which adds the killing or attempted killing of law enforcement or first responders as an aggravating factor in federal death penalty cases. He previously offered an amendment in the Judiciary Committee to the legislation to ensure that not only the killing but also the “targeting” of officers would be added as an aggravating factor. He also had the opportunity to manage floor debate on the rule resolution for the Thin Blue Line Act on Wednesday, May 17. Video of his closing statement during that floor debate can be found here. Congressman Buck also voted for the Probation Officer Protection Act on Friday, May 19. This legislation allows federal probation officers to arrest hostile third parties without first seeking a warrant if the officer has probable cause to believe the third party assaulted or obstructed a probation officer performing his or her official duties. Both of these bills passed the House and will now be considered by the Senate. ###
04.06.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck introduced the Federal Budget Accountability Act. This legislation requires the Office of Management and Budget to begin tracking the revenue collected from budget offsets and then compile this information into an annual report to Congress. “More transparency in our budgeting process is always a good thing,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “This legislation measures whether or not Congress complies with discretionary spending caps by offsetting any budget increases with accurate, realistic decreases in spending.” Budget “offsets” or “payfors” are the reductions in spending, or increases in revenue, that often accompany an increase in spending during the budget process. For example, the budget could include a spending increase that is offset by sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But because the price of crude oil changes over the course of these sales, the total revenue received from the offset may not be the amount promised during the budgeting process. By requiring OMB to track the actual revenue received and then report this to the legislative branch, Congress can create an environment of accountability and realistic budgeting. ###
03.28.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) applauded President Trump for issuing an executive order that rolls back some of the most economically harmful and poorly crafted regulations from the Obama administration. Among the repealed regulations is the costly Clean Power Plan that would drive up electricity costs and kill American jobs, as well as the moratorium on federal coal leasing. Also, the order requires that agencies use sound science when analyzing the impact of regulations. “The President’s action today will contribute to lower electricity and energy prices in Colorado’s Fourth Congressional District,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “This executive order plays a key role in unleashing American energy and creating well-paying jobs through Colorado.” ###
03.21.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) introduced an amendment that passed by voice vote to H.R. 1367 to make clear that former political appointees in the Department of Veterans Affairs cannot have their positions converted into competitively-selected civil service positions without going through the proper civil service hiring process first. This practice is commonly called “burrowing,” and according to Office of Personnel Management data, at least 17 individuals from various Executive agencies successfully burrowed between September 1, 2015 and July 14, 2016. Several dozen more attempted to do so. By burrowing into career civil service positions, political appointees use their political connections to jump ahead of other qualified individuals. “Political appointees in the VA have a duty to step down when their appointing president leaves, allowing new appointees and accomplished, life-long civil servants to continue the work of serving our nation’s veterans,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “We cannot allow the very same Obama administration political appointees who so poorly managed the VA during their appointments to then burrow into the agency and continue their poor performance.” Congressman Buck has introduced legislation (H.R. 1132) that would prevent political appointees across the government from burrowing into civil service positions. Until that legislation becomes law, this amendment prevents the practice from occurring in the Department of Veterans Affairs. H.R. 1367 passed the House and will now be considered by the Senate. ###
03.09.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck’s (CO-04) Innocent Party Protection Act (IPPA) passed the House by a vote of ___ to ___. This legislation prevents trial lawyers from fraudulently joining local small businesses to a lawsuit in order to have their case heard in a court they perceive to be a more favorable forum. The small businesses are added to the suit, even though the trial lawyers have no intention of pursuing a claim against them. When these small businesses are dragged into the courtroom and forced to pay legal fees to defend themselves for doing nothing wrong, they can't focus on creating jobs and adding value to the American economy. The IPPA gives judges more discretion to prevent the practice of fraudulent joinder. “When local small businesses are fraudulently joined to a lawsuit, the only winners are the trial lawyers,” stated Congressman Buck. “By protecting our innocent local businesses from these lawsuits, we enable them to focus on job creation and growth.” The IPPA will now go to the Senate for consideration. ###
03.01.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Tonight, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released the following statement in response to President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress. “I’m eager to work with President Trump to advance conservative policy,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “Tonight he called for lower taxes for the middle class, a roll back of excessive regulations, a better healthcare system for Americans, and safety and security for our communities. It’s time for America to once again be optimistic.” ###
02.16.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Reps. Ken Buck (CO-04) and Ted Lieu (CA-33), along with Reps. Pete Sessions (TX-32) and Jared Polis (CO-02), introduced the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act. The process of non-career, political appointees leveraging their appointment into special job protections by converting into high-paying, senior-level civil service positions is called “burrowing.” This legislation establishes a two-year prohibition on certain non-career political appointees accepting a career position in the federal civil service. By restricting the practice of burrowing, the bill ensures that federal civil service hiring standards remain solely merit-based, rather than based on political favors. “A political appointment is a privilege that carries with it the responsibility of serving your country. Part of serving your country means stepping down at the end of your term of service, and this bill simply enforces that expectation,” said Rep. Ken Buck. “Without this bill as a safeguard, political appointees can embed across our bureaucracy, carrying on the agenda of their appointing president long after voters have chosen a new direction.” “This bill, which would ensure a cooling off period for political appointees before accepting a position in our civil service, is a simple good-government initiative. It is part of our orderly transfer of power that when an Administration comes to an end, presidential appointees leave the executive branch with the President,” stated Rep. Ted Lieu. ###
02.13.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck announced the 2017 Congressional Art Competition for the Fourth Congressional District. The theme this year is “America the Beautiful.” High school students from the Fourth District are encouraged to submit an original work of art for the contest. Submitted works will be displayed during the month of April at Centennial Park Library in Greeley as part of the exhibition. On April 14, the winners of the competition will be announced at an awards ceremony, also held at Centennial Park Library. The winning work will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for a year. “Every year the students in our district impress me with their artistic talent,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I’m eager to see the works submitted this year and encourage any high schooler with an interest in art to participate.” Interested art teachers and students can find more information and deadlines at buck.house.gov/services/art-competition. ###
02.02.2017	Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck’s legislation, the Innocent Party Protection Act (IPPA), passed the House Judiciary Committee by a vote of 17 to 4. This legislation protects innocent small businesses from being fraudulently added to a lawsuit by trial lawyers. “When our small businesses are tied up in fraudulent lawsuits, their ability to create jobs and grow the economy is significantly reduced,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “The Innocent Party Protection Act guards the integrity of our judicial system by protecting small businesses from these bad-faith lawsuits.” Trial lawyers use fraudulent joinder to keep lawsuits in their preferred local courts as opposed to a federal court. To achieve this they join innocent small businesses to a lawsuit in the local jurisdiction where they want the trial to be held. When they’ve successfully moved the case to a state court, the trial lawyers typically end up dropping the small business from the case, but not before the small business incurs significant legal costs defending itself. The Innocent Party Protection Act gives judges more discretion to release local defendants from a case if it’s not plausible to conclude that local state law imposes liability on the local defendant or if it’s determined that the plaintiff does not have a good-faith intention of ultimately seeking a judgement against the local defendant. ###
01.31.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Tonight, U.S. Reps. Ken Buck (CO-04), Scott Tipton (CO-03), Mike Coffman (CO-06), and Doug Lamborn (CO-05) issued the following statement responding to President Trump's nomination of Colorado native, Judge Neil Gorsuch, to fill the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy: “The nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court is welcome news. Judge Gorsuch’s record in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit shows that he will defend the original intent of our Founding Fathers and preserve the fundamental rights of Americans protected by the Constitution. It will be great to see a Coloradan serve on the country’s highest court, and considering he was confirmed for his current position by voice vote in the U.S. Senate in 2006, we encourage our Colorado colleagues in the U.S. Senate to support Judge Gorsuch’s swift confirmation.” Representative Ken Buck also released the following statement on the nomination: “I commend the President’s nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by the untimely death of Justice Antonin Scalia. I’m confident Judge Gorsuch will succeed in the Supreme Court because he holds sound judicial interpretation in such high regard. As a Coloradan, I know Mr. Gorsuch will take his common sense values with him to the nation’s highest court.” ###
01.25.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted to protect life by making permanent the United States’ long-time policy of prohibiting federal funding for abortion. Since 1976, majorities in Congress have supported adding the Hyde Amendment, a provision that prohibits federal dollars from paying for abortions, onto federal funding bills. H.R. 7 permanently codifies this long-standing prohibition in statue. The bill also finally pulls Obamacare into line with Hyde Amendment precedent, ensuring that federal subsidies are no longer used for Obamacare plans that cover abortions. “No taxpayer should be forced, against their moral or religious conscience, to fund an abortion,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Americans and Congress have prohibited federal funding of abortion for decades, and this bill simply makes that prohibition permanent.” A recent Knights of Columbus-Marist poll revealed that 61% of Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortion. ###
01.19.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Windsor, CO – This week Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) sent a letter to Governor John Hickenlooper commending him for his focus on rural economic development in his State of the State address. In the address, Governor Hickenlooper proposed creating an office focused on bringing rural broadband to all of Colorado by 2020, an initiative that will help people and businesses throughout Colorado be better connected with the world. He also proposed the creation of a rural economic development director. As someone who represents a largely rural district, Congressman Buck has focused in Congress on ways to enable economic development in these less populated but equally important parts of the state. “When I travel through the rural parts of my district, I see communities that are ready for economic growth,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “But government must create the right environment for this growth, and I’m eager to work with the Governor to create policies that allow rural Colorado to flourish.” Congressman Buck’s letter is printed below in its entirety. --- Governor Hickenlooper, Thank you for your early focus on rural Colorado in your State of the State address. I was particularly encouraged by two initiatives you announced that will benefit the people of eastern Colorado. Access to broadband and economic development are vitally important issues to the rural communities of eastern Colorado and the Fourth Congressional district. I applaud your willingness to take on these important concerns. Eastern Colorado has wonderful communities and people, but the region faces unique economic challenges that we must address. The Eastern Plains are a great place to do business. Family-run operations like the Coffee Holding Company in La Junta bring stability and rootedness to their communities. While locally-based businesses are important to these communities, companies like Pelsue Manufacturing based in Englewood also have production facilities in Lamar. Partnerships between these communities -- urban and rural -- can be winning solutions for Colorado companies and rural Colorado. On behalf of our shared constituents, I want to thank you for your attention to these matters and encourage you to solicit input from the people of eastern Colorado. I am eager to assist and collaborate with your administration on these important issues. Through a collaboration of federal, state, and local efforts, I’m confident we can help rural Colorado thrive. Regards, Ken Buck Member of Congress (CO-04) ###
01.13.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted for the first step in repealing and replacing Obamacare by supporting the Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2017. This legislation will serve as a vehicle for the replacement of Obamacare, fulfilling a promise Republicans made to the American people. Congressman Buck wants to replace Obamacare with a more market-oriented plan that makes healthcare affordable for all Coloradans. At the same time, Buck wants to ensure that there are no lapses in coverage during the transition and that anyone who has coverage now, including those with pre-existing conditions, maintains access to coverage. “I voted today to begin the process of replacing Obamacare with a more affordable, patient-centered alternative,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “As we craft the replacement system, I’m eager to listen to the concerns and ideas of my constituents. Constituents are encouraged to visit the Congressman's website at buck.house.gov or to call his office (202-225-4676) to share their thoughts on healthcare reform. ###
01.13.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) introduced H.R. 519, the Water and Agriculture Tax Reform Act of 2017 (WATER Act), a key legislative priority that Buck shepherded through committee last year and hopes to see on the House Floor in the 115th Congress. The legislation permits mutual water and storage delivery companies to retain their non-profit status even if they receive more than 15% of their revenue from non-member sources. The additional non-member revenue raised under the act must be used for maintenance, operations, and infrastructure improvements. By allowing these companies to raise additional revenue from non-members, they can invest in infrastructure improvements that allow them to offer more affordable water resources to their members. “Farmers and ranchers around the Fourth Congressional District support this legislation because they need affordable water,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “We worked hard on this legislation last year and I’m hopeful that this year we’ll see it pass the House and Senate and signed into law.” ###
01.03.2017	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (WI-1) and Chairman of the House Rules Committee Pete Sessions (TX-32) announced that Congressman Ken Buck (CO-4) will be joining the House Rules Committee for the 115th Congress. The Rules Committee determines when and how bills are considered on the House floor through special orders known as “special rules.” It also considers original jurisdiction measures, which often affect the standing rules of the House. “I’m honored for the opportunity from Speaker Paul Ryan and Chairman Pete Sessions to join the House Rules Committee,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “The House has an important role to play in returning our nation to the right path, and I’m eager to get to work.” Congressman Buck will also continue to serve on the House Judiciary Committee for the 115th Congress. ###
12.16.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) announced the winner of the Congressional App Challenge for the Fourth Congressional District of Colorado. This competition gave students several months to develop their own software application. The winning app in the Fourth Congressional District was designed by Etash Kalra, a sophomore at Douglas County High School. Etash developed “Spell Me,” an iOS-based app that assists students in studying spelling words by allowing them to participate in a virtual spelling bee or spelling test. “I’m so proud of Etash and all the students who participated in the Congressional App Challenge this year,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “STEM education is so important to our nation’s future, and I’m confident these student participants will play key roles in America’s success.” App Challenge winners will be invited to Washington D.C. for #HouseOfCode, a chance to present their apps to Members of Congress and the tech community. ###
12.09.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) joined the newly launched Second Amendment Caucus this week. This caucus serves as a community for members of Congress who strongly value the right to bear arms. They seek to prevent executive overreach that would curtail second amendment rights and to enable law-abiding citizens to possess and carry firearms. “As a former prosecutor and a Coloradan, I’m eager to work with my fellow caucus-members to uphold our constitutional rights and empower law-abiding citizens to protect themselves,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. Congressman Thomas Massie (R-KY) led the effort to relaunch the caucus. Congressman Buck joins him and several other founding members, including Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Ted Yoho (R-FL), Brian Babin (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Mark Meadows (R-NC), Alex Mooney (R-WV), Justin Amash (R-MI), Jody Hice (R-GA), Dave Brat (R-VA), Warren Davidson (R-OH), James Comer (R-KY), and Scott Perry (R-PA). ###
12.08.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, I joined 235 of my colleagues in voting for the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, often referred to as WRDA (S. 612). This legislation will specifically benefit farmers and rural communities in the Fourth Congressional District by funding vital maintenance and improvements of the nation’s ports and inland waterways. It also revises policies regarding water storage delivery. For farmers in the Fourth Congressional District, this infrastructure development will improve access to water and will assist in transporting crops to the appropriate markets. “We must invest wisely and frugally in America’s infrastructure, which is why I voted for the WRDA Act,” stated Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04). “Growing a bushel of Colorado corn doesn’t do anyone much good if you can’t get that corn to the right market.” Additional investments in drinking and wastewater infrastructure will ensure that urban and rural communities have access to the water they need. The bill also allows individuals impacted by the Gold King Mine spill to make claims to the EPA for damages. ###
12.02.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) voted for The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (S. 2943). The NDAA provides $619 billion for national defense purposes and includes a 2.1% pay raise for America’s troops, the largest raise in the past six years. The bill also ends the reductions in troops, provides advanced funding for submarines and amphibious ships, improves healthcare quality for our troops and their families, and continues the prohibition on the transfer of Guantanamo Bay Detention Center detainees to the United States. “If we’re going to maintain peace in this world, then we must have a strong military,” Congressman Ken Buck remarked about the legislation. “This NDAA takes care of our troops while equipping them to adequately defend our nation.” Further details about the NDAA can be found here. ###
11.29.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, the House Republican Conference announced the rules of the 115th Congress, which were approved on November 16. Included was a rule offered by Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) that ensures the House of Representatives spends time considering legislation to reassert the Article I authority of the legislative branch. Between excessive rulemaking and executive orders, the executive branch has overstepped its constitutional authority to simply execute the laws made by Congress. The rule passed today encourages the House Majority Leader to schedule floor time for the consideration of single issue bills related to Article I authority. “Republicans promised to roll back President Obama’s oppressive regulatory regime,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “This House rule allows Congress to reassert its rightful authority over the executive branch by repealing excessive regulations and overreaching executive orders.” By designating floor time specifically for the purpose of repealing President Obama’s agenda of overreach, the House will be able to quickly and efficiently assist President-elect Trump in rolling back federal red tape and implementing an agenda to create jobs and secure America The full rules can be read here. Below is the amendment added by Congressman Ken Buck: (b) It is further the policy of the Republican Conference that— (1) the Majority Leader shall prioritize measures that seek to preserve Congress’ authorities under Article I of the Constitution when scheduling the House Floor, which should periodically include, after receiving concurrence from the appropriate committee chairs of primary jurisdiction, designated floor time for consideration of single-issue bills related to exercising such authorities; and (2) the Republican Conference shall periodically schedule Planning Conferences to include the topic of preserving and exercising Article I of the Constitution. ###
11.01.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck, along with 105 of his colleagues, sent a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy regarding the ecological risk assessment for atrazine, one of the most commonly used herbicides in the United States. Even though atrazine has been safely and effectively used by corn, sugar cane, and sorghum growers for decades, the EPA’s draft risk assessment greatly restricts the use of atrazine, effectively banning this vital herbicide. The bi-partisan letter demands that the EPA uses sound science and takes into account the needs of farmers when finalizing the assessment. “Our corn and sorghum farmers in Colorado already face a number of federal regulations that make their jobs harder,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I urge the EPA to rethink their approach to atrazine, using sound science and listening to the concerns of farmers instead of barreling forward with flawed research.” Atrazine has been a staple herbicide used by farmers for more than 50 years. Without atrazine, conservation efforts would be more difficult and the agricultural community would have to turn to more expensive and environmentally harmful pesticides. An economic analysis by Don Coursey, Ameritech Professor of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, showed that without atrazine, farmers could end up losing $59 per acre. Small family farmers would be especially hurt if their access to this safe and effective herbicide was limited. A copy of the letter can be found on Rep. Buck’s website or below: Dear Madam Administrator: The undersigned Members of the U.S. House of Representatives are writing to express our concern with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) draft ecological risk assessment on atrazine. In its present form, it would have a significant negative impact on farmers and rural communities nationwide. Atrazine has been used for decades as an effective herbicide for tens of thousands of growers, and it is particularly important for corn, sugar cane and sorghum producers. Moreover, it is one of the most thoroughly studied herbicides used today, accounting for nearly 7,000 scientific studies. Unfortunately, EPA’s draft ecological risk assessment throws its future use into doubt, an outcome that, according to many, may not be scientifically justified. This criticism appears to be borne out by the agency’s approach, where it is setting standards on studies that the EPA’s own Science Advisory Panel considered “flawed” in 2012. When used properly and in accordance with label instructions, atrazine is one of the most vital herbicides available to farmers. It has been used safely for more than fifty years and is a critical tool in assuring the sustainability of many farms nationwide. Farmers are great stewards of their land, and they understand the importance of using safe products on their crops. Limiting atrazine would create a reliance on more expensive and environmentally harmful pesticides, and make conservation efforts more difficult by impeding farming methods such as no-till or strip-till. It would be irresponsible to greatly restrict one of the safest and most trusted herbicides on the market. Various economic analysis studies show farming without atrazine could cost growers up to $59 per acre. This is especially detrimental to the small family farms that would be hurt by an unsubstantiated government decision. With this information in mind we ask that you take into account the needs of farmers and use sound science when finalizing the ecological risk assessment for atrazine. It is imperative that EPA take the science and public comments seriously and revise the preliminary ecological risk assessment using the best available data. We look forward to your response. ###
10.05.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) visited Phoenix Weaponry, a machining and manufacturing company in Longmont that focuses on high grade weapons and weapons components. The stop came in advance of Manufacturing Day on October 7 and gave Congressman Buck an opportunity to learn about the issues faced by local manufacturers. “Manufacturing businesses are vital components of our economy,” stated Congressman Ken Buck. “In Washington, I’m fighting government overreach so that small businesses, especially gun manufacturers who rely on the protection of our Second Amendment rights, can continue contributing to the economy and creating jobs.” Manufacturing Day brings to light the challenges faced by manufacturing businesses across the United States. These companies rely on strong economic growth, diverse education opportunities for future employees, and freedom from red tape in order to create their products, provide jobs for members of the community, and contribute to an improved quality of life for the nation. Attached: Photo of Congressman Ken Buck touring Phoenix Weaponry in Longmont and a photo of Congressman Ken Buck learning about the manufacturing process from Phoenix Weaponry owner, Aaron Cayce. ###
09.29.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Ken Buck joined dozens of his colleagues from both sides of the aisle this week on a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi demanding the full funding of the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program (PILT). Under this program, the federal government provides offsetting funds to local governments that lose property tax revenue due to the existence of tax-exempt federal lands in their jurisdiction. County governments depend on PILT payments to fund vital services like law enforcement and health services, as well as transportation infrastructure. “Since it’s exempt from local property taxes, the federal government should contribute to local communities through PILT funds,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I encourage Congress to fully fund the PILT program and to ensure its long-term existence.” The letter requests “a fiscally responsible, long-term and sustainable solution to fully fund PILT in FY17 and beyond.” Without a long-term solution, counties must regularly contend with the uncertainty of not knowing whether PILT funds will be available. Below is a table of counties from the Fourth Congressional District with their fiscal year 2016 PILT payments and eligible acreage (U.S. Department of the Interior does not list all counties).

09.21.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, the WATER Act, H.R. 4220, sponsored by Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04), was marked up and voted out of committee by the House Ways and Means Committee. The WATER Act Allows mutual water storage and delivery companies to maintain their non-profit status, even if they receive more than 15% of their revenue from non-members, so long as the monies are reinvested into maintenance, operations, and infrastructure improvements. In other words, this legislation would allow mutual irrigation and ditch companies to use revenue from non-members for infrastructure that’s vital to their operations, which keeps water prices lower for users. “The WATER Act ensures that farmers and ranchers have access to low cost water resources,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I’m glad I could work with Chairman Brady and the House Ways and Means committee to advance this legislation that is so important to communities in the Western United States.” Rep. Buck’s bill will next go to the House floor for a vote by the whole House. For more information, visit Rep. Buck’s website: https://buck.house.gov/water-act ###
09.15.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted for H.R. 5351, legislation he co-sponsored, that prohibits the transfer of any individual detained at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba detention facility until the end of the year or until the enactment of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2017. The bill prevents President Obama from transferring the remaining detainees as part of his plan to permanently shut down the military detention facility, ensuring that no terrorists are transferred to the United States or any other holding facility in the world. “This legislation should prevent President Obama from even starting to think about moving terrorists into Colorado,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “For the safety of Colorado, America, and the world, these terrorists should be locked up in Guantanamo Bay for a long, long time.” Earlier this year, President Obama announced his desire to completely close Guantanamo. But several former detainees who were transferred out of the facility have already returned to terrorism. The Director of National Intelligence reported a few years ago that at least 118 past detainees had resumed terrorist activities. Earlier this year Paul Lewis, who serves as the Defense Department’s special envoy for Guantanamo closure, admitted that Americans “have died because of Gitmo detainees.” Another former detainee might have contributed to the Benghazi attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. This year reports have surfaced that former Guantanamo detainees have been recruiting for ISIS. H.R. 5351 will prevent further detainees from rejoining the terrorist cause and killing additional American citizens Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

09.14.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) voted for the VA Accountability First and Appeals Modernization Act of 2016, H.R. 5620. This important legislation empowers the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to better hold VA employees accountable for their actions, ultimately improving the quality of care for veterans around the country. “This legislation holds employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable for failing our veterans. After the sacrifices our veterans have made, they deserve the best care we can offer,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. A few years ago reports surfaced that veterans were facing extremely long wait times at VA facilities, with some even dying while waiting for care. In response Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act (VACAA) of 2014. This legislation expanded veterans’ options for care, opening the door for non-VA providers in cases where VA facilities were too far or too crowded. It also improved accountability mechanisms within the VA, providing for easier ways to remove problem employees. Nevertheless, misconduct at the agency continued, and VA leadership often found it challenging to remove the problem employees. H.R. 5620 gives the VA Secretary greater power to hold the agency accountable. Under the legislation, the Secretary can more quickly demote and fire most employees for performance or misconduct, can reduce pensions for SES employees if they’re convicted of a felony, and can recoup bonuses, awards, and relocation expenses if the employee has engaged in fraud, waste, or malfeasance. It also offers greater protection to whistle blowers, those employees who care deeply about our veterans and bravely speak out against misconduct in the agency. H.R. 5620 will now go to the Senate for consideration. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

He specifically highlights the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP), an effort to increase water storage in northern Colorado through the creation of a new reservoir. “In Northern Colorado, water is life for farmers and everyone else who lives in the region. I’ve watched firsthand as water shortages in Colorado drive farmers and their families to desperation,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “We need to reform federal regulations so that water projects can be completed more quickly and more efficiently.” Read Congressman Buck’s op-ed on the issue here: https://www.coloradostatesman.com/buck-government-red-tape-must-be-cut-on-water-storage-projects-133477-2/ Watch Harry Strohauer, a farmer from LaSalle, tell his personal story: https://youtu.be/DtseNotYnrk The NISP effort has experienced numerous delays due largely to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. This federal law is meant to protect the environment during major infrastructure projects, but it ultimately drowns the project in red tape and often causes years of delays as project management conducts study after study to determine the environmental impact. Congressman Buck seeks to reform the approval process for water projects by improving the efficiency of the impact studies, encouraging various agencies to coordinate studies, and overhauling the National Environmental Policy Act.

07.14.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted to keep food prices affordable by fighting government red tape. He opposed Senate Bill 764 because it mandates a GMO labeling regime that burdens farmers, small business owners, and consumers. Scientific studies have shown repeatedly that consuming modified foods pose no risk to human health. “A GMO labeling mandate ties up food producers in red tape, driving up costs for Colorado families,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “A flawed labeling law in one state should not lead us to create a shortsighted law for the other 49 states.” S. 764 is an attempt to preempt the State of Vermont’s poorly written GMO labeling law. The state’s new legislation requires food producers across the country to meet onerous new requirements in order to sell food in Vermont. But S. 764 takes a flawed idea in one state and applies it to all 50 states. Creating a new labeling mandate based on the nonscientific demands of GMO labeling advocates sets an extremely dangerous precedent of federal intervention in the agriculture and food industries. Congressman Buck believes food producers should be permitted to voluntarily include GMO labeling. That’s why he cosponsored and voted for H.R. 1599, the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act, a bipartisan bill that protects consumers from a patchwork of labeling laws and allows voluntary labeling.

07.02.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – This week Congressman Ken Buck took a tour of the wheat industry in the Fourth Congressional District. The purpose of the tour was to learn about challenges facing wheat growers and to discuss policy ideas that would benefit the industry and the broader economy. “I appreciated the chance to learn about issues faced by the wheat growing community,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I’m working in Congress to ensure that our farms and the surrounding communities can thrive.” Congressman Buck visited Progressive Farms in Deer Trail, Beedy Farms in Genoa, and Flagler Equity Co-Op in Flagler. Discussions along the tour covered issues from the cost of production to the affordability of crop insurance to GMO labeling.

06.28.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck spoke on the House floor about an amendment he introduced to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act that prohibits funds from being used to implement Department of Defense Directive 4715.21 on Climate Change Adaptation and Resilience. This directive, issued by the President, forces the military to incorporate climate change into everything they do, from training to preparedness to combat operations. The directive requires additional bureaucracy at the Pentagon to ensure climate change is considered throughout the Department of Defense. “When we distract our military with a radical climate change agenda, we detract from their main purpose of defending America from enemies like ISIS,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “This amendment refocuses the military on our real enemies.” The thinking behind this directive has already been exhibited by military decision makers. Michael Morrell, the former acting director of the CIA, admitted that the military held back from bombing ISIS-controlled oil fields in part over fears of the environmental impact. The amendment will receive a recorded vote on the House floor today. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

06.22.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – On Monday, Congressman Ken Buck introduced an amendment to the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, 2017 to remove John Koskinen as commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service by reducing his pay to $0. Buck’s non-profit, Balance America, was among 426 groups targeted by the IRS for discrimination, even though Balance America simply promoted a balanced budget amendment. “I experienced IRS abuse first-hand,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “When Congress then investigated the agency’s behavior, Commissioner Koskinen misled us. This is a serious breach of trust. He works for the American people, and it’s time for the American people to fire him. The IRS would be better off without Commissioner Koskinen showing up to work every day.” Koskinen misled congressional investigators when he suggested that email evidence requested by Congress had not been destroyed by the agency. Congress had requested the email records of former IRS commissioner Lois Lerner in an effort to investigate the agency’s discrimination against conservative organizations. Koskinen not only oversaw the IRS during the time of the evidence destruction, he also told Congress that no records were destroyed. He then waited for months to inform Congress after definitively learning about the evidence destruction. The change required by the amendment expires on January 20, 2017. Rep.

06.10.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today Congressman Ken Buck voted in favor of House Concurrent Resolutions 89 and 112. These resolutions express the sense of the House of Representatives that a carbon and oil tax, respectively, would be detrimental to American families and businesses. Both of these taxes would regressively impact Coloradans who rely on these energy sources for heating their homes, driving to work, and powering the small businesses they own. “Today the House of Representatives sent a clear message to the President,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “It’s not OK to implement a radical green energy agenda on the backs of the American people.” A recent Congressional Research Service report predicts that the President’s proposed $10.25 gas tax could increase the price of a gallon of gasoline by 20-25 cents. A carbon tax would similarly be passed onto the consumer in the form of higher electricity costs and increased prices on products and services. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

06.09.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Ken Buck announced today the names of the Fourth Congressional District students who received military academy nominations from his office and have accepted their offers of appointment. The selected students exhibit the character, leadership skills, and academic aptitude required of future officers in the U.S. Armed Forces. To earn admission to a military academy, students must receive a nomination from their Member of Congress, their Senator, or the Vice President, and must pass the academy’s own admissions process. Appointees receive a world-class education for free at their respective academy in return for a 5-year service commitment. “Students like these make me more hopeful about our future,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “They’ve committed their lives to serving our nation through thick and thin. I commend them and wish them the best as they begin their journey in the U.S. Armed Forces.” Below is a list of students from the Fourth Congressional District who have received appointments to a military academy in the 2016-2017 school-year after being nominated by Congressman Ken Buck: U.S. Air Force Academy Mr. Jack Beebe Castle Rock, CO Ms. Sydney Eismeier Castle Pines, CO Ms. Kelly Grier Parker, CO Ms. Rebecca Kholos Parker, CO Mr. Adam Kratt Lone Tree, CO Mr. Andrew Voydat Longmont, CO U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Mr. Micah Grissom Parker, CO Ms. Kyleigh Kappas Parker, COU.S. Military Academy, West Point Mr. Angus Pfister-Paradice Larkspur, CO Mr. Levi Walters Parker, CO U.S. Naval Academy Ms. Andriann Oakley Strasburg, CO ###
05.26.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck introduced an amendment to the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2016 (H.R. 5055). The amendment would prohibit paternalistic Department of Energy regulations that mandate energy efficiency standards for everyday products. These mandates drive up prices for products like dishwashers and ceiling fan lighting kits, eliminating consumer choice and draining pocketbooks. This amendment would return decision-making to the consumer, trusting market demand to drive efficiency improvements. “This amendment stops the administration from imposing their radical green energy agenda on the backs of American families,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Let’s end these mandates and return choice to consumers.” The amendment passed last night by voice vote, however the underlying bill failed to receive enough votes for passage on the floor today. Congressman Buck will continue to fight against mandates that increase costs and limit consumer choice. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

05.13.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – This week Congressman Ken Buck testified at the Ways and Means Committee hearing on behalf of H.R. 4220, the Water and Agriculture Tax Reform Act of 2015. This legislation reforms the IRS rules as they apply to mutual irrigation, reservoir, and water companies. Normally, these cooperatives are member-owned and also tax exempt. This legislation ensures that these cooperatives can remain member-owned without the cost of water assessments skyrocketing, by allowing the cooperatives to raise additional revenue from recreational leases and crossing fees without losing their tax-exempt status. “Farmers and ranchers rely on water for their very livelihood,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I urged the Ways and Means Committee to pass the WATER Act this week to keep water costs for rural America low and to empower farmers and ranchers to have a stake in their water resources.” The legislation will next face a committee vote in the Ways and Means Committee.

05.05.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Greeley, CO – Today, Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) took Rep. Jared Polis (CO-02) on a tour of businesses in the Fourth Congressional District. The tour gave the congressmen, from different sides of the aisle, a chance to put aside partisan politics and focus on the ideas and needs of Coloradans. The members of Congress first visited Leprino Foods in Greeley, where they learned about the food processing industry from the world’s leading producer of mozzarella cheese. They then toured Front Range Energy, a supplier of fuel ethanol, where they heard about ways in which fuel ethanol can serve as an energy source for Colorado’s economy. “I appreciated the chance to show my colleague, Rep. Polis, around the Fourth Congressional District today,” Buck stated. “We may come from different sides of the aisle, but we know it’s important to work together and collaborate on ways to address the needs of all Coloradans.” "I'm grateful when we're able to put Colorado before partisan politics. Yesterday, Rep. Buck graciously travelled to Loveland and Fort Collins to visit with our communities here, and today, he invited me to Greeley to meet with his communities,” said Polis. “Colorado is at our best when all districts are served, and the best way we can serve our communities is by listening and learning from them.” On Wednesday, May 4, 2016, Rep. Buck joined Rep. Polis for a tour of businesses, schools, and government facilities in the Second Congressional District. The congressmen visited the Rocky Mountain Center for Innovation and Technology, Poudre High School, Colorado State University, and the U.S. Center for Disease Control (C.D.C). At the C.D.C., the members of Congress learned about the government's efforts to combat the increasing threat of the Zika virus.

04.29.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck voted for House Joint Resolution 88, a resolution disapproving the Department of Labor’s (DOL) overreaching fiduciary rule. The resolution passed the House by a 234-183 vote. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), the DOL has authority to regulate financial services professionals who provide investment advice. The updated rule places new regulations on “fiduciaries,” those professionals who provide investment advice to individuals. The DOL claims the new rule is needed because retirees are incapable of making their own informed investment decisions. But the rule creates a web of cumbersome regulations that make little sense for investment advisors’ business models or their clients. The rule limits retirement investment options and will drive up the cost of business for advisors, pricing middle-class investors out of the investment advice market. “The fiduciary rule hurts well-intentioned financial advisors and the Coloradans who need to plan for their retirement with sound, affordable investment advice,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “H.J. Res. 88 makes it loud and clear: Congress does not approve of the Executive Branch overregulating our lives.” Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

03.17.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck introduced H.R. 4760, the Blue Lives Matter Act of 2016. This legislation extends greater protections to police officers by expanding the federal hate crime statute to include law enforcement. As a prosecutor, Congressman Buck charged individuals for committing egregious hate crimes. These laws protect people who are wrongly targeted for acts of violence and terror solely based on their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability. The Blue Lives Matter Act extends this protection to individuals targeted for acts of violence and terror because they’re police officers. “Despite the risk, our law enforcement officers put on their uniform every day so that they can serve our communities,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Whether based on skin color or uniform color, a crime motivated by hate is not going to be tolerated in America. By adding law enforcement to the federal hate crime statute, we can protect those who protect us.” The killing of individuals due to their inherent characteristics or closely held behaviors and beliefs causes significant emotional harm to the targeted communities and can result in societal discord. Law enforcement officers hold the fabric of American communities together, protecting people from crimes, serving those in need, and setting standards of conduct. Those who would create a climate of intimidation by committing crimes of hate against law enforcement must be held accountable for their evil actions. Click here to view the Dear Colleague Letter.

The bill, introduced by Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO), will protect innocent companies, often small businesses, from being wrongfully joined in a lawsuit.

02.23.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck expressed outrage at the President’s plan to move terrorists onto American soil. Eight years after committing to radical elements of his political base that he would close Guantanamo Bay terrorist detention camp, the President fulfilled that misguided promise by announcing his plans to close the camp. The remaining terrorists will be transferred to other nations or to the United States, where the administration has been considering locations like Fremont County, Colorado, as a final destination. “Time and time again, public safety has taken a back seat to political point-scoring with this President,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “Not only could the President’s plan cost nearly half a billion dollars, but it makes us less safe.” Rep.

02.12.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck joined a group of lawmakers in introducing H. Res. 613, a measure designed to reaffirm the powers granted to Congress by Article I of the Constitution. Since arriving in office, President Obama has consistently attempted to sidestep the legislative branch of government, using increasingly controversial executive orders, legally questionable regulations, and selective enforcement of statute to impose his radical and unpopular agenda on the American people. On issues from healthcare and immigration to gun rights, the President has repeatedly legislated by executive fiat, bypassing the people’s representatives for input, and usurping Congressional authority. House Resolution 613 declares the legislative branch’s intent to restore its Constitutionally-granted power. “Apparently President Obama was absent the day they taught civics,” Buck said. “This Article I Resolution sends a clear message to the President that Congress alone has the right to make laws -- and that the people expect him to faithfully execute those laws.” The severity of executive overreach has increased in the past few years. The President took unprecedented executive action last month to strip away the public’s gun rights, and has repeatedly tried to save his dysfunctional healthcare law by unilaterally discarding inconvenient provisions of the legislation. Congressman Buck has been a longtime champion of limited government, and founded the Article I Caucus to organize efforts of the House of Representatives to reassert congressional power and rein in White House abuses of power.

02.05.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck released a statement in response to President Obama’s proposal to phase in a $10 tax on every barrel of oil. The President will suggest the tax hike, which will cost Americans over $30 billion per year at current consumption rates, in the budget he presents to Congress next week. Revenue raised through the tax will be used to fund wasteful green energy projects and cash hemorrhaging transportation projects. “Every day, parents, farmers, and small business owners rely on affordable transportation, so a tax hike on fuel hits them the hardest,” Congressman Buck stated. “The federal government has no business picking winners and losers in the energy economy with our tax dollars.” At current oil prices, every barrel of oil would be taxed at a 30% rate. Consumers will feel that cost at the pump in what could be a 24 cent per gallon increase. Experts suggest that every cent increase per gallon of gas amounts to an addition $1.5 billion cost to consumers. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

02.03.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, in the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Ken Buck voted for the authorization of an executive overreach task force. The taskforce, of which he’ll be a member, will spend six months investigating ways in which the President has exceeded his constitutional scope. Executive overreach has become particularly severe in recent years, but Presidents of both parties have increased the power of the Presidency at the expense of Congress. Through executive orders, regulations, and selective enforcement of laws, the President can bypass the will of the people as expressed through their representatives in Congress. The overreach task force will allow Congress to identify ways in which the legislative branch can reassert its constitutional authority and hold the President accountable. “When the executive branch bypasses Congress, it bypasses the voice and will of the American people,” Congressman Buck stated. “We’ve seen the President bypass the will of the people recently—on gun rights, health care, and costly regulations. I’m eager to participate in this executive overreach task force because reasserting the power of Congress is actually reasserting the power of the people.” The House Judiciary Committee approved the resolution by voice vote.

In the unlikely event of a Carolina Panthers win, Congressman Buck will treat Congressman Meadows to some locally-raised, mouth-watering 4th Congressional District steak. The beef industry, along with many others, provides jobs across the district and is hurt by government overreach. If the Broncos continue their streak of dominance and triumph over the Panthers on Sunday, Congressman Meadows agreed to serve up North Carolina Barbecue. “They say defense wins championships, which is why I'm confident in a Broncos victory," said Buck, a former college football player himself.

01.13.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Yesterday, Congressman Ken Buck introduced H.R. 4371, the Article I Consolidated Appropriations Amendments, 2016 Act. This legislation acts as a platform for many of the amendments that were ultimately left out of the Omnibus funding bill passed in December of last year. At its heart, the legislation addresses the issue of executive overreach. Through executive orders, administrative rules, and judicial reinterpretations of law, the President and the judicial branch have wrested constitutionally-granted power away from Congress. The provisions included in this legislation all serve as a way for Congress to reassert the power granted under Article I of the Constitution. “Congress has sat idle for too long, allowing the President to act beyond his authority,” Congressman Buck stated. “With this bill, Congress will be reasserting its Article I power and reining in executive overreach. I encourage my colleagues to become co-sponsors.” Today, Congressman Buck sent a letter to his colleagues, asking them to join him as a co-sponsor on H.R. 4371. Below is the text of the letter: January 13, 2016 Dear Colleague Article I serves as the Constitutional bulwark against consolidation of power in the executive branch. According to Article I, Congress, which directly represents the collective will of the nation, has the authority to decide how much, and in what way, taxpayer dollars are spent. But executive branch overreach and judicial branch intervention have appropriated the power originally granted to Congress by the Constitution. Federal government spending has consequently ballooned out-of-control. New regulations have killed jobs and cost small businesses. Executive orders have fundamentally altered America’s statutory code. The President, often with the judicial branch’s consent, has wrested power away from the legislative branch. In so doing, the President has muted the voice of the people, who decide how the government affects their lives and destinies through the voice of their Representatives. To recalibrate the Constitutional structure of the federal government, Congress must reassert its power of the purse. The Omnibus bill last December provided a perfect chance for Congress to set funding priorities and direct the policies carried out with those funds. Unfortunately, Congress failed to address its power deficit through the bill. In 2016, we can and must do better, and that is why I am introducing the Article I Consolidated Appropriations Amendments, 2016 to provide a consolidated platform of many of the riders and defunds that were discussed but not enacted in the Omnibus. Many of these important actions already have separate legislative vehicles and their inclusion in this legislation is complimentary to those separate efforts. Many of the items included in the Article I Consolidated Appropriations Amendments, 2016 have already passed as an appropriations rider by the House of Representatives, or were included in underlying appropriations bills that have gone through the Committee process. By doing our work, House Republicans have laid out a counterbalance to President Obama’s wholesale assault on free markets and individual liberties. Article I Consolidated Appropriations Amendments, 2016 consolidates some of this work in the hopes of providing each House Republican a solid platform from which to begin the process of reclaiming Congress’ rightful place in our Constitutional government. H.R. 4371 includes the following provisions (in addition to several others): Places a moratorium on any new rules or regulations proposed by the executive branch Prevents ambush union elections Defunds President Obama’s illegal executive action on immigration Makes the Census’s American Community Survey voluntary Defunds the EPA’s Waters of the U.S. Regulations Prohibits HUD from implementing, enforcing or administering the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing regulations Blocks harmful regulations that would debilitate mining operations Blocks union representatives from participating in OSHA walk-arounds Restricts grant funding to sanctuary cities Prevents IRS use of funds to implement Obamacare Defunds of Obama’s coal fired plant rules. Prohibits of the Justice Department from entering into settlements forcing defendants to fund third party groups. . If the legislative branch hopes to regain its rightful authority to legislate, then it must be willing to pass legislation that directly challenges the overreach of the executive branch. Article I is not a keyword, a trend, a brand, or a Facebook graphic. It’s a principle that protects the Republic. But the Republic only benefits if Members of Congress assert their Constitutional mandate. Please join me in sponsoring H.R. 4371, and let’s come together as a Conference behind these common principles. Sincerely, Ken Buck Member of Congress Rep.

01.06.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted for a new direction in healthcare and to defund Planned Parenthood by supporting H.R. 3762, the reconciliation bill. The bill repeals major portions of Obamacare, including premium subsidies, tax credits, Medicaid expansion, individual and employer mandates, reinsurance programs, and risk corridors. The unpopular medical device and health insurance tax will also be repealed. Additionally, the legislation ends taxpayer support of all elective abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood. These funds are instead redirected to community health centers. “We promised America that we’d repeal Obamacare,” Congressman Buck stated. “Americans deserve better, and I believe there are many good market-oriented alternatives.” “This legislation will also defund elective abortion providers,” Congressman Buck continued. “President Obama will have to decide whether or not to continue to use tax dollars to subsidize the abortion of unborn children.” The reconciliation bill will now go to President Obama for his consideration.

01.05.2016	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck spoke strongly about the President’s latest executive action on gun control, calling for the protection of Second Amendment rights and for a return to constitutional governance. President Obama’s executive actions bypass Congress, and in doing so bypass the will of the people. They also set a precedent for future violations of the Second Amendment. “The President’s latest executive action violates the Constitutional mandate that Congress create the laws while the President only enforces them,” Congressman Buck stated. “Which amendment in the Bill of Rights will be tossed to the wolves tomorrow?” One of the measures attempts to expand the use of background checks. However, under current law it’s already a felony for any individual to transfer a gun to someone who they reasonably believe can’t legally possess it. Additionally, gun show and online sellers are already required to operate with licenses. “If the President wants to start enforcing laws that are already on the books, he should start protecting our border,” Congressman Buck stated.

12.10.2015	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck, president of the Republican Freshman Class, announced that the class will pursue a project to reassert the Constitutional powers of Congress. In a time when Executive Branch overreach is at an all-time high, this project will encourage Congress to fulfil its purpose set out in Article I of the Constitution. “We heard from the Speaker’s Chief of Staff, who told us that our continual reliance on big, bloated omnibus bills steals from Congress 90% of its Power of the Purse,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “To reassert Congressional power, we need to return to a regular appropriations process with multiple, separate funding bills.” “The freshman class is eager to restore Constitutional order to our government,” Congressman Buck stated. “The people elected us to balance out Executive overreach.” President Obama has issued hundreds of executive orders to date, including granting amnesty to 5 million illegal immigrants, increasing the minimum wage for federal contractors, disregarding welfare reform laws with broad waivers, unilateral land grabs under the guise of designating national monuments, and ignoring both the deadlines and clear language of the Affordable Care Act. Congress must hold the Executive Branch accountable for enforcing the laws it passes and must rein in abuses of power through executive orders. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

12.07.2015	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Buck led a letter signed by 11 of his colleagues in Congress calling on Congressman Hal Rogers, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, to include several policy provisions in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. The letter explains that Article I of the Constitution should serve as the basis and structure for funding priorities in appropriations bills. Unfortunately, Congress’ rightful power to legislate has been sidelined by bureaucratic regulations and judicial activism. The letter suggests the inclusion of several of Congressman Buck’s colleagues’ policy provisions as a way to reassert Congressional authority. The following Members of Congress joined Congressman Buck in signing the letter: Paul Gosar (AZ-04), Lynn Westmoreland (GA-03), Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (GA-01), Jeff Duncan (SC-03), Sean Duffy (WI-07), Mark Meadows (NC-11), Gary Palmer (AL-06), Dave Brat (VA-07), Alex Mooney (WV-02), Matt Salmon (AZ-05), and Louie Gohmert (TX-01). Congressman Buck released the following statement regarding the letter: “Congress must use the Omnibus Appropriations Act to reassert its Power of the Purse. The provisions we’d like to include in the Act will rein in the overreach that has become all too commonplace in President Obama’s administration.” Below is the text of the letter: December 7, 2015 The Honorable Hal Rogers Chairman House Committee on Appropriations H-305, The Capitol Washington D.C. 20515 Dear Chairman Rogers: Article I is the Constitutional basis and structure for Congress to set funding priorities and policies in the pending Omnibus Appropriations Act. Decades of unchecked bureaucratic regulations and judicial activism has relegated Congress, particularly, the House of Representatives to the sidelines. With over $19 trillion in debt and job killing regulations routinely implemented by Administrations of both parties, the House of Representatives must lead and protect individual rights through the Power of the Purse. Delegating this authority away for political expediency or in the name of being a team player is a losing proposition for our constituents. Our Founding Fathers expected more from us and it is time we recommit to our constituents and our fellow members a resolve to use Article I as the core focus of our legislative responsibilities. Contrary to Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Senator Harry Reid’s recent statements, the upcoming Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act is and must be our opportunity to offer policy provisions restoring individual rights and freedoms while serving as a check on the federal bureaucracy. Many of our colleagues have worked very hard to garner support for their legislative initiatives. Many more colleagues were shut out by a Democratic majority intent on obstruction and deceit. This letter is not exhaustive of the concerns that need to be addressed in the upcoming FY 2016 Omnibus Appropriations Act but WE FEEL THE FOLLOWING POLICY PROVISIONS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS ACT: Chairman Tom Cole included in the FY 2016 Labor/HHS Appropriations Act passed by the House Appropriations Committee a key provision commonly referred to as the OSHA Walk Around Rule barring individuals associated with third-party organizations, i.e., union officials, from joining OSHA inspectors on work site safety inspections; Chairman Cole also included provisions blocking the ambush election rule proposed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and a prohibition on issuing new joint-employer standards; Rep. Andy Harris included in the same bill a micro-union amendment prohibiting funding to implement or enforce a National Labor Relations Board ruling that allows certain groups of employees within a larger company to form separate unions; Rep. Peter Roskam’s extensive work as Chairman of the House Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee has uncovered the need for an amendment to defund a regulation allowing for the hiring of outside counsels to administer IRS responsibilities. Rep. John Katko has sponsored similar legislation; Rep. Sean Duffy has authored successful ICANN defund amendments included in the Fiscal Year 2015 CROmnibus Act and Fiscal Year 2016 Commerce Justice Appropriations Act prohibiting President Obama and the Department of Commerce from transferring control of the Internet to foreign control; Rep. Paul Gosar has successfully sponsored amendments the past two years to defund the HUD’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing Regulation in the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act. As Rep. Gosar and other colleagues have previously written against it, “the rule will result in increased local taxes, [and] will depress property values.” Congress is on record opposing the use of taxpayer funds to transfer Gitmo detainees to U.S. soil. Transferring known terrorists to U.S. soil threatens the lives of our constituents. Maintaining this prohibition is the only way to prevent President Obama from acting unilaterally and unconstitutionally. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland’s “Sue and Settle Amendment” pending in the Interior Appropriations bill would prohibit the EPA and other agencies from engaging in this tactic. As Rep. Westmoreland has written to his constituents, “The ‘Sue and Settle’ tactic is a form of collusion between the EPA and radical environmental groups. These groups then sue the EPA over the scope of a specific law, but rather than go to court, back-room settlements are made that would expand the EPA’s power….These tactics side step our Congress and the voice of our citizens, but businesses still have to adhere to these new, costly regulations.” The House of Representatives is on record supporting Rep. Pat Meehan’s Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act. Rep. Meehan spoke on the floor. “The bill before us today presents a different but related question: should Iran receive U.S. sanctions relief before it pays the victims of its terrorism all of what U.S. courts say those victims are owed?...Until they pay these victims what they’re owed, let’s say no to Iran, not one cent.” Rep. Yoder has successfully authored an amendment in the FY 2016 Homeland Security Appropriations Act passed by the Committee to prohibit certain state and local grants from going to “Sanctuary” Cities. Other proposals we support including in the final FY 2016 Omnibus is the “REINS Act” and defund amendment to the “Waters of the United States” rule as well as the Department of Labor’s “Fiduciary Rule.” The above are not all inclusive, but provide a baseline framework of some of the important policies and priorities that need to be included in the upcoming Omnibus funding bill. The runaway Executive Branch has been allowed to usurp Congress’ Constitutional authority for too long. We have a responsibility to begin to re-establish the pre-eminent role of the House of Representatives in determining how the people’s money should be spent. In historic remarks, you [Speaker Paul D. Ryan] said, "the House is broken. We are not solving problems." We concur. Going forward under new leadership, our constituents will hold us more accountable: no more talk and press release governance. We can only restore the trust of our constituents if we fully implement Article I priorities by successfully sponsoring legislation and amendments reining in the entire Executive Branch and bureaucracy. We respectfully urge each one of you to stand with us as we reassert the authorities granted to us by Article I of the United States Constitution, and the citizens who have elected us to office. Rep.

12.03.2015	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Congressman Ken Buck voted today for the North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015. This important legislation impacts energy accessibility and production in the United States, rolling back government regulation so that America can modernize its energy infrastructure and strengthen its energy security. The bill lifts the crude oil export ban, reforms the permitting process for energy projects, and improves the approval process for energy exports. “After many months of calling for legislation to lift the crude oil export ban, I’m thankful the House passed this bill,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “In an increasingly volatile world, securing America’s energy infrastructure should be a top priority.” The North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015 will now go to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

12.03.2015	For Immediate Release Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted to support local transportation decisions in the conference report on H.R. 22, the Surface Transportation Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2015 (FAST Act). This legislation increases surface transportation spending levels beyond the bills passed in both the House and Senate, blowing past Highway Trust Fund expected revenue by $70 billion. Further, Highway Trust Fund dollars are still used on non-highway projects. Funding for the bill is achieved through budget gimmicks, including another raiding of America’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Additionally, the legislation includes a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, a crony-capitalist government financing program. “With the FAST Act, Washington, D.C. voted to continue its tight-grip on transportation spending in America,” Congressman Ken Buck stated. “I trust the commissioners in the 4th Congressional District to build a better, cheaper road than bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.” Rep.

11.19.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today Congressman Ken Buck joined a bipartisan majority in voting for H.R. 4038, a bill that pauses the resettlement of Syrian refugees to the United States. The bill passed with 289 votes in support, and only 137 opposed. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, this legislation gives Congress and the President time to determine a process that will keep Americans safe. “ISIS has declared war on the world,” Congressman Buck stated. “Our first priority is keeping Americans safe, which is what this bill does. We must put a hold on all Syrian refugee resettlement until we can determine how to ensure Americans’ safety.” Buck continued, “I urge President Obama to sign this legislation immediately, because Americans should spend the Thanksgiving holiday celebrating our blessings in this country, not worrying about terrorist attacks.” Rep.

10.29.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted against H.R. 1314, the budget deal negotiated by Congressional leadership and President Obama. The deal, released near midnight on Monday, was rushed to the floor for a vote on Wednesday. The legislation increases the debt limit without any entitlement reform and adds an additional $80 billion in discretionary spending over the next two fiscal years. “This budget deal blows through the debt limit and the spending caps we fought hard to implement in 2011,” Congressman Buck stated. “We’re trading short-term spending for the promise of long-term savings.” Buck continued, “The deal raids the Social Security trust fund to bailout the Disability Insurance Program, a program that needs real reform.” The bill also extends sequester into 2024 and 2025 to help pay for the increased spending. Other sources of offsets include allowing public airwaves to be used for telecommunications companies and sales of the strategic petroleum reserve. Rep.

10.27.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today, Congressman Ken Buck voted against H.R. 3762. This legislation repeals a portion of Obamacare, but fails to repeal vital aspects of the bill, including Obamacare subsidies, Medicaid expansion, and the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). “We promised America we would use reconciliation to fully repeal Obamacare, but this legislation doesn’t do that. We can’t repeal half of the law and leave the expensive spending provisions in place. We don’t want a bigger mess than we’re already in.” “Some believe we needed to soften this bill to pass the Senate,” Buck continued. “But I believe we need to legislate from a position of strength.” Rep.

10.09.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Kyle Huwa, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. – Today Congressman Ken Buck voted for H.R. 702, a bill that lifts the ban on crude oil exports. The ban, enacted in 1975, was initially a response to the Arab oil embargo. Lifting the ban would lower prices at the pump by increasing world supply of oil, create jobs in the American crude oil industry, and bolster the nation’s national defense. “I voted to end the ban on crude oil exports. It’s good for Colorado because we’ll create more jobs without raising the price of gas at the pump,” Congressman Buck stated. “President Obama thinks Iran should be allowed to export oil, so we should be allowed to export oil from Weld County too. Iran and Russia use their oil as a weapon to bully other nations. Exporting oil from the US counters their influence.” Due to misaligned refining capabilities, the ban on U.S. export limits world supply of oil, causing higher than necessary prices at the pump. The GAO predicts that lifting the ban would lower gasoline prices by 1.5 to 13 cents per gallon. Moreover, the larger market created by lifting the ban would create more jobs in the crude oil extraction industry. The IHS believes that in 2018, nearly 1 million additional jobs could exist if the ban is lifted. ###

Congressman Buck voted against the resolution, and released the following statement: â€œThe President's deal with Iran is at best delusional and at worst despicable. It makes the entire world less safe. Whether you live in Julesburg or Jerusalem, a nuclear Iran poses a threat,â€ said Congressman Buck. â€œFrom the beginning I urged my colleagues to follow the Constitution and treat this deal as a treaty. I voted against H.R. 1191, the Corker-Cardin bill,â€ Buck stated. â€œYesterday the House demanded that President Obama submit the entire agreement to Congress so that we can make an informed decision. Today I voted against the deal itself. At least Americans who oppose this deal 2-to-1 will know who stands with them and who doesn't.â€ He concluded: â€œI cannot believe that on the anniversary of the worst terrorist attack ever on American soil, we have a President and a party that agrees to give the leading state sponsor of terrorism billions of dollars to be the central bank of terror.â€ Rep.

07.28.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington â€“ Monday night, Congressman Ken Buck hosted a conference call for county commissioners in the Fourth Congressional district. Commissioners from Douglas, Weld, Boulder, Arapahoe and Adams counties were invited to join the call. Congressman Buck released the following statement after the call: â€œAgain, I am very thankful for the county commissioners joining the call. We exchanged valuable information and ideas. They have their finger on the pulse of Coloradans, which is exactly the type of contact I want to maintain. As I travel back and forth from the district to DC, these calls provide me with necessary information about the needs of Coloradans,â€ said Congressman Buck. Commissioner Sean Conway of Weld County thanked Congressman Buck for having area representative Wes McElhinny speak at the Northern Integrated Supply Project (NISP) hearing in Greeley. Commissioner Deb Gardner of Boulder thanked the Congressman for being available to facilitate intervention with the federal agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the ongoing aftermath of the floods. Commissioner Rod Bockenfeld of Arapahoe County will send a joint letter from Colorado Counties Inc. (CCI) and Colorado Municipal League (CML) that has to do with the Marketplace Fairness Act. Commissioner Bockenfeld also said he appreciated the help he had received from the district staff regarding a constituent issue that had to do with a septic dumping incident. Commissioner Bockenfeld and Commissioner Jan Pawlowski of Adams raised issues they were having with prairie dogs in their areas. While primarily a state issue, the ranchers have to apply for federal grants to get rid of the prairie dogs after Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPAW) relocates them. Rep.

07.28.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington â€“ Today, the House passed the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015 (H.R. 427) by a vote of 243-165. The REINS Act requires that federal agencies submit major regulations (those that cost the economy $100 million or more) to Congress for approval; guarantees that no major regulation becomes effective until Congress approves it; and requires an expedited up or down vote on major rules within 70 legislative days. Congressman Buck voted for the bill and released the following statement: â€œWe have handed over way too much of Congressâ€™ legislative authority to unaccountable Washington bureaucrats. Handing the steering wheel to the executive on regulations has resulted in the nightmares of Obamacare and Dodd Frank. Everyone in America loses when we donâ€™t keep costly regulations and unaccountable bureaucrats in check,â€ said Congressman Buck. Regulations have grown dramatically under President Obama. By the end of 2014, agencies adopted over 184 major rules â€“ rules costing $100 million or more yearly â€“ imposing $80 billion in new annual costs on the American economy. There are 126 new regulations pending. The annual cost of regulations in the United States is estimated to be as high as $1.882 trillion. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

07.23.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington â€“ Today, the House of Representatives voted 241 to 179 to pass the Enforce the Law for Sanctuary Cities Act (H.R. 3009), which would cut federal funding to â€œsanctuary cities.â€ Sanctuary cities are jurisdictions that have policies directing local law enforcement to not cooperate with the Immigration and Customs Enforcementâ€™s (ICE) efforts to track and apprehend criminal illegal aliens. Congressman Ken Buck, a cosponsor of the bill, released the following statement: â€œSanctuary cities are part of a much broader problem with immigration enforcement in the United States. This Administrationâ€™s policies have handcuffed ICE agents. As a District Attorney in Weld County, I saw firsthand how low the morale was among ICE law enforcement officers specifically because they have been handcuffed from doing their job. H.R. 3009 is a step toward fixing this problem,â€ said Congressman Buck. â€œThere is much more that needs to be accomplished to reform our immigration system, but this is a start.â€ Sanctuary cities prohibit law enforcement officers from sharing information with federal immigration authorities to enable the removal of unlawful and criminal aliens. According to ICE records, and the Center for Immigration Study, more than 8,100 deportable aliens were released by sanctuary jurisdictions between January and August 2014. Three thousand of them were felons and 62 percent had a prior criminal history. The problems facing our immigration system extend beyond sanctuary cities. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte has noted, there are almost 180,000 convicted criminal aliens currently in removal proceedings living in the United States and almost 170,000 convicted criminal aliens who have been ordered removed also living free here. Under the Obama Administration, the total number of such convicted criminal aliens who are not being detained has jumped 28% since 2012. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

Congressman Ken Buck voted for the bill and released the following statement: â€œYou wonâ€™t have to worry about another extreme interest group coming after the corn that you grow,â€ said Congressman Buck. â€œThis bill sets up a transparent, accurate, and voluntary labeling system as a national standard. Producers and consumers will be much better served under this system instead of a patchwork of disparate state laws.â€ H.R. 1599 establishes a federal labeling standard for foods with genetically modified ingredients, giving sole authority to the Food and Drug Administration to require labeling on such foods if they are ever found to be materially different from foods produced without GM ingredients. It includes a provision to allow those who wish to label their products as GMO-free to do so through a USDA-accredited certification process. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

07.22.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington â€“ Today, the House of Representatives voted 258 to 166 to pass the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act of 2015 (H.R. 1734), which provides for the safe management and disposal of coal ash in a manner that preserves jobs and encourages recycling. â€œObamaâ€™s war on coal has to stop. Regulating coal fired power plants out of business hurts the poor; it hurts families; and it hurts farmers. We should be solving problems, not causing them,â€ said Congressman Buck. The House Energy and Commerce Committeeâ€™s summary of the legislation can be found here. According to analysis by the Heritage Foundation, high energy costs caused by Washington regulations disproportionately harm the poor. They state: â€œWhile the median family spends about 5 cents out of every dollar on energy costs, low-income families spend about 20 cents,â€ which is why President Obamaâ€™s energy policies and war on coal hit Americaâ€™s poor the hardest. Heritage found that killing the coal industry would result in an income drop of more than $1,200 per year for the typical family of four. The war on coal also kills jobs. According to the Colorado Division of Reclamation Mining and Safety, coal production in the state slipped to a 20-year low in 2014, according to state data. There was a nearly 20 percent cut in mining jobs in Colorado in 2014. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

Congressman Buck listened to and addressed their concerns on a variety of issues facing the Fourth District. County commissioners from Morgan, Logan, Sedgwick, Phillips, Yuma, Washington, Kit Carson and Elbert Counties were invited to join the call. Commissioner Dave Donaldson of Logan County, Robin Wiley of Yuma County and Kelly Dore of Elbert County asked questions and expressed concerns about transportation, immigration, EPA regulations, and Waters of the US.

This kind of dialogue is critical to my ability to better serve and represent the Fourth District, and I look forward to hosting these calls with all county commissioners in the Fourth,â€ said Congressman Buck. Logan County Commissioner Donaldson raised concerns that Highway 71 has been closed by high water and discussed what the Army Corps of Engineers and the Colorado Department of Transportation are doing to address the situation. Yuma Commissioner Wiley mentioned Compact Compliance and broadband improvement.

07.09.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington â€“ Wednesday night, Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) offered three amendments to the FY16 Interior Appropriations bill, and spoke on the House floor about each one. In his first speech, Congressman Buck highlighted the regulatory burdens American farmers face at the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). These regulations have caused the number of American farms to steadily decline over the past several decades. Remarks as Prepared: Agricola Americus Amendment Congressman Ken Buck: My amendment appropriates up to 50,000 dollars from the retention bonuses of Senior Executive Personnel at the EPA to conduct a study of whether Agricola Americus, the American Farmer, should be classified as an endangered species. This money should be used to determine whether there is crucial habitat that is essential for the conservation of the species of Agricola Americus and acting in accordance with 16 U.S.C. Chapter 35 if such a finding is made. The federal government is no stranger to using its regulatory powers to interfere in important national issues, so it came as a surprise when I discovered that the federal government had overlooked the most endangered species in America. The Fish and Wildlife Service has been so thorough in designating animals as endangered all around farms, but for some reason havenâ€™t seen the plight of the American Farmer. Paul Harvey recognized in 1978 that God made Agricola Americus with a unique set of characteristics essential to our nation, so I am troubled that the number of farmers in America has steadily declined over the last six decades. Not only has the number of American Farmers shrunk, but so has the number of farms. Those lost have mainly been family farms, passed down through generations of hard work and built up with years of sweat equity. They have faced numerous man-made obstacles that interfere with their environment and encroach on their natural territory. They have been subject to the ravages of wolves released by the very Agency that should be tasked with protecting this essential American species. Yet the Department of Interior does not have a monopoly on societyâ€™s invasion of Agricola Americusâ€™s natural habitat. Family farms have been destroyed by the death tax, regulated out of business by FDA and EPA mandates, and forced to dump crops by outdated government programs that even now, are being struck down by the Supreme Court. How much more of this regulatory onslaught can the Agricola Americus take before we recognize the harm of our actions and work to make sure that we are not complicit in its disappearance? We cannot leave the farmer alone in the eye of the regulatory storm. Defunding Settlement Funds From Being Diverted to Third Party Groups by EPA and Department of Interior Congressman Ken Buck: My amendment bars the EPA and Department of Interior and any of its agencies from requiring mandatory donations to third party groups as a part of any settlement agreements the agencies enter into. In agencies across the government, settlement funds are being funneled to third party groups, contravening congressional budget authority. A recent investigation by the House Judiciary and Financial Services Committees found as much as a half billion dollars had been diverted by the Department of Justice to third parties as a result of these settlements in the past year. This is inexcusable. And it is not unique to the Department of Justice. At the Department of Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Fish and Wildlife routinely sue and then enter into settlements with businesses and individuals â€” who then are forced to make donations to third party, radical environmentalist groups. This is all made possible because community service is expressly allowed as a condition of probation by the United States Criminal Code. In addition, the United States Sentencing Guidelines allow community service where it is reasonably designed to repair the harm caused by the offense. This results in settlement funds being directed to supposed â€œcommunity serviceâ€ groups. This is a practice that must be brought to an end. As Thomas Jefferson once wrote, â€œto compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical.â€ In this case, businesses and individuals are being sued by the government for violating environmental regulations, and then as part of the settlement, they have to make payments to environmental organizations that engage in advocacy supporting the regulations. This power grab is abhorrent. Please support my amendment to stop these agencies from funneling court settlement funds to radical environmentalists. Official Time Amendment Congressman Ken Buck: My amendment would prohibit paying any federal employee for the time spent not working for the taxpayers, but working for a third party, a labor union. This practice is known as â€œofficial time.â€ Unlike any other type of third party organization, labor unions have been granted the privilege of being able to have taxpayer funded employees do their business, on duty time, instead of doing the taxpayersâ€™ work. This is outrageous. Like any other type of private entity, labor unions should pay for their own employees to work for them. The taxpayers should not be picking up the tab for this practice. According to the U.S. Office Personnel Management, this practice costs taxpayers approximately $156 million per year. Thatâ€™s assuming that the agencies are correctly reporting the amounts spent and there have been indications that this number actually under reports the total cost. In some instances we are not talking about just a few minutes here and there for an agency employee who is a union official to confer with management about a workplace issue - sometimes the agency employee is actually working full-time for the labor union, all the while being paid by the taxpayers for this union work. For instance, the IRS has more than 200 employees working full-time for labor unions. The Veterans Administration has over 250 employees working full-time for labor unions â€“ this at a time when there is a significant backlog of cases to be processed. One of these employees doesnâ€™t even work in a VA facility, but instead works remotely from a private union office in D.C. Imagine the dent that could be put in the case backlog if those 250 employees were working for Veterans instead of the union. The EPA, while not having as many personnel on full-time official time as some agencies still pays over $1.6 million just for those personnel who are working full-time for their union. Some agencies, such as the Department of Transportation have numerous employees making over $170,000 per year while working full-time for the union. This is more than almost all federal employees make, higher than the salaries of many Senate-confirmed Assistant Secretaries. My amendment would not prohibit this practice, but would make certain that the right party pays for this work, the labor union. Itâ€™s not right to force our taxpayers to pay the bill to subsidize these private organizations any more than it would be right to force them to subsidize other private organizations such as the National Rifle Association or the Sierra Club. Like any business, labor unions should pay the costs for their own employees, not taxpayers. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

06.23.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today the House passed the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act of 2015 (H.R. 1190), which repeals the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act providing for the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). IPAB is a board of unelected bureaucrats tasked with finding and implementing ways to control Medicare spending. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) voted for the bill, which passed by 244 to 154, and released the following statement: â€œGiving a small group of unelected bureaucrats such strong influence over senior citizensâ€™ health care decisions is unacceptable. Itâ€™s the kind of top-down, Washington-centric solution that will severely limit health care options. It opens the door to rationing of care without congressional approval,â€ said Buck. He continued, â€œWe have a lot of work to do on health care before the American people are given a health care system that actually works for them. Obamacare has caused so much damage already. To turn it around means repealing Obamacare in its entirety and passing new reforms that empower patients.â€ According to analysis by the Heritage Foundation, IPAB is statutorily prohibited from â€œrationing,â€ but the statute includes no formal definition, and the board will still have to restrict access to providers, services, and/or treatments to hold down costs. Because the board is prohibited by law from proposing real structural reforms the only cuts it is allowed to make would be cutting providersâ€™ reimbursements. Rep.

06.17.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today, the House passed the Protect Medical Innovation Act of 2015 (H.R. 160), by a bipartisan vote of 280 to 140. The bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to repeal the 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers and importers. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO), a co-sponsor of the bill, released the following statement: â€œWashington is hurting people with the medical device tax just like it is hurting people with Obamacare as a whole. The tax burden medical device manufacturers bear gets passed onto patients in the form of more expensive health care procedures and products,â€ said Congressman Buck. He continued, â€œAmerica deserves a health care system that allows people to access quality care, not one that makes innovative, high quality care less accessible. The medical device tax is smothering innovation, which is critical to reducing the cost of health care products and discovering new life-saving technologies. By repealing the tax â€“ an effort that has long had bipartisan support â€“ we are at least partially reducing the burden that Obamacare has imposed on the American people.â€ Rep.

Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) voted against TPA and released the following statement: "There is no way I can support ObamaTrade. I believe in free trade, but this President has proven over and over again that he can't be trusted to make decisions that are good for America.

06.02.2015	FOR IMMEDAITE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington - Today Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) gave Americans a second chance to exercise their Second Amendment rights. He offered an amendment to the FY16 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (H.R. 2578). The amendment was adopted by voice vote. Congressman Buck released the following statement: "America is a land of second chances. One mistake should not define your future. A law-abiding, 45-year-old dad who made one mistake at 18 should have the choice of how best to protect his family or to take his kids hunting. He should have the chance to make a petition to restore his constitutional right to bear arms. This solution is long overdue." said Congressman Buck. The amendment allows people who made a mistake to petition the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) for restoration of their Second Amendment rights. They can seek this relief by petitioning the District Court in the District in which they reside. In 1986, Congress voted to create a program to allow Americans subject to a federal gun ban to petition BATFE to have their rights restored. Since the early 1990's Congress has annually adopted an appropriations rider by then-Rep. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), which cuts off all funds for the implementation of BATFE's system to restore Second Amendment rights. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

05.14.2015	FOR IMMEDAITE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House of Representatives Wednesday approved the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36) by a vote of 242-184, which would ban abortions, with limited exceptions, in the United States after 20 weeks post fertilization. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) voted for the bill and released the following statement: â€œWe are one of only seven nations in the world â€“ on a list that includes known human rights abusers China, North Korea, and Singapore â€“ that still allows late term abortions. These innocent unborn babies deserve our protection,â€ said Congressman Buck. According to a November 2014 Quinnipiac University Poll, 60 percent of Americans â€“ including 56 percent of independents and 46 percent of Democrats â€“ support legislation banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of rape and incest that are reported to authorities. At 20 weeks gestation, or five months of pregnancy, infants in the womb are capable of feeling excruciating pain. Current federal policy permits some doctors to treat these unborn infants as patients and to perform prenatal surgery on them while providing them anesthetics. Current law also permits abortion on request up to nine months of pregnancy. The only other nations in the world that legally permit late term abortions are China, North Korea, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands.
05.13.2015	FOR IMMEDAITE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House passed the USA Freedom Act of 2015 (H.R. 2048), which reforms our nationâ€™s intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Section 215 of the Patriot Act, along with two other provisions, are set to expire at the end of the month. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) voted in favor of the bill and released the following statement: â€œThe USA Freedom Act is a positive step toward protecting Americansâ€™ right to privacy while simultaneously ensuring their safety. The Act secures important reforms that end bulk data collection, strengthen protection of civil liberties, and prevent government overreach. This bill was the result of a careful compromise between the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. I appreciate the efforts that went into crafting this compromise. It is because we must act quickly to reform the carte blanche collection of information that we did not adopt amendments that might have improved the bill further,â€ said Buck. He continued, â€œAlong with protecting our national security it is necessary to protect the rights of every American. It is important to ensure that any federal employee who intentionally, knowingly, or willfully requests or uses information made available under this Act for any unlawful purposes, including private or political gain, be held liable for their actions. While the vast majority of federal employees are outstanding fiduciaries of the public trust, we must safeguard against any rogue individual who might abuse their authority under this Act. Americans must be assured that our privacy is protected and that neither the government nor any agent affiliated with the government can abuse our privacy. We must ensure that the government and its agents abide by the Constitution, and protect our rights as well as our safety. I am also working with my colleagues on further legislation that prohibits warrantless searches of government databases for information about U.S. citizens, and forbids government agencies from mandating or even requesting â€œback doorsâ€ into commercial products that can be used for surveillance. I will continue to work to balance our national security and constitutional liberties.â€ Although the USA Freedom Act does not explicitly set penalties for those who abuse the power it conveys, there are basic laws in place that safeguard privacy. It must be stressed that the protections afforded to Americans under statutes, such as the Espionage Act and the Privacy Act of 1974 must be adhered to in the implementation of the USA Freedom Act. These established statues prohibit federal employees from improperly obtaining information for private gain, or to the detriment of this nation. It is imperative that federal agencies seriously consider the penalties established through these statutes and enforce them expeditiously in the case of any willful violation. Rep.

05.13.2015	FOR IMMEDAITE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) introduced legislation Tuesday (H.R. 2258) to amend the Antiquities Act of 1906 so presidential declaration of a national monument will be a temporary measure. For a new national monument to achieve permanent status, each designation must be approved by Congress and by the legislatures affected by the declaration. Congressman Buck released the following statement: â€œThis amendment is part of my broader mission in Congress, to restore power to the people. With this bill, I am working to give authority back to the peopleâ€™s elected representatives. Our land and our natural resources are precious to us as Americans, and the Antiquities Act has historically served a good purpose. However, President Obama and other presidents in the past have abused the power granted to them by the Antiquities Act. This bill will prevent the President from unilaterally advancing a political or policy objective that is harmful to the local community affected by the designation of a national monument.â€ The Antiquities Act of 1906 was originally intended to prevent looting of archaeological and Native American structures and objects. Rapid westward expansion and industrialization threatened the regionâ€™s natural wonders. The Antiquities Act addressed the problem by granting the president authority to designate, and thereby protect, places of extraordinary historic or scientific value as national monuments â€“ without time-consuming congressional approval. Under the Antiquities Act, President Theodore Roosevelt preserved some of America's greatest treasures: Devil's Tower in Wyoming; El Morro in New Mexico; Muir Woods in California; the Petrified Forest and Grand Canyon in Arizona. Other presidents added to the long list, proclaiming national monuments large and small. Today, however, western states are now populated by private citizens who elect their own local and state governments. Congressman Buckâ€™s amendment would give them a greater say in decisions about how best to protect and use their land and natural resources. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

04.30.2015	FOR IMMEDAITE RELEASE CONTACT: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House voted Wednesday to shift $2 million of funding from the Department of Energyâ€™s salaries and expenses account to the Bureau of Reclamationâ€™s water and related resources account. The money will be used to help fund the Arkansas Valley Conduit (AVC), a regional water supply project, which will deliver treated drinking water to rural water providers in southeast Colorado. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) supported Rep. Scott Tipton's (R-CO) amendment and released the following statement: â€œThis project was authorized in 1962 to bring clean drinking water to 40 communities in southeast Colorado, many of which are in violation of clean water standards because of naturally occurring elements. Why donâ€™t we spend some money to benefit future generations instead of ourselves?â€ Congressman Buck also spoke in support of the Tipton amendment on the House floor. According to the Southeastern Colorado Water Conservancy District, the AVC is a feature of the federal Fryingpan-Arkansas (Fry-Ark) Project, which was constructed and is operated by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation). It was included in the original 1962 authorizing legislation for the Project. This regional water supply project will deliver treated drinking water to nearly 40 small, rural water providers from east of Pueblo to the state line. The AVC will address safe water drinking problems for residents of southeast Colorado. Lower Arkansas River communities currently use groundwater wells to supply their drinking water. However, more and more towns have found that their groundwater contains naturally occurring cancer-causing radioactive contaminants, such as radium and uranium, in concentrations that exceed primary drinking water standards mandated by the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) has notified these water providers that they must treat water supplies to remove these contaminants or find a better quality water source. Water providers in Lower Arkansas River communities are also having a difficult time meeting non-mandatory secondary drinking water standards for salts and sulfate. Some water providers are not meeting secondary drinking water standard for iron. Replacing contaminated groundwater supplies with local surface water from the Arkansas River is problematic because the river downstream of Pueblo also contains high levels of selenium, sulfates, uranium, and salts.

04.24.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) led a special order hour Thursday to call for the end of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. He was joined by Congressmen Jim Jordan (R-OH), Dave Brat (R-VA), and Alex Mooney (R-WV). Each member made a strong case against the corruption, fraud, and cronyism that are perpetuated by the Ex-Im Bank. Congressman Buck released the following statement following the special order hour: â€œThe Export-Import Bank is a corrupt federal agency. I want to thank my colleagues for standing with me today against its reauthorization. We know that it is a hard battle to fight. Politically favored companies receiving subsidies donâ€™t want to lose them. But there have been far too many instances of corruption and fraud at the Bank for Congress to renew its charter.â€ Congressman Ken Buckâ€™s Ex-Im Bank Special Order Speech â€œBribery. Corruption. Fraud. Throughout my tenure as a prosecutor, I saw all of these and more. I am disappointed to say that the words I once used to describe white collar criminals can now be used to define a federally funded entity. The Export-Import Bank, or as some know it, Ex-Im, has taken advantage of our free market system.â€ Congressman Jim Jordanâ€™s Ex-Im Bank Special Order Speech â€œOur job as members of Congress is to remember people like the second grade teacher and the second shift worker and fight for things they care about. And hereâ€™s one: they care about this concept that goes on in this town where connected companies get special deals with their tax money, and they want that to stop.â€ Congressman Dave Bratâ€™s Ex-Im Bank Special Order Speech â€œIâ€™m an economist whose been working on international trade policy and economics for more than two decades. I support free trade and equal treatment under the law. I oppose special privileges. Everyone likes free money, and that gets to the crux of this issue.â€ Congressman Alex Mooneyâ€™s Ex-Im Bank Special Order Speech "When the federal government inserts itself into the process, you end up with a system where Washington special interests drive decision making, not free-market principles." The Export-Import Bank is the official export credit agency of the United States. It provides taxpayer-backed loans and loan guarantees to foreign companies for the purchase of American goods and services. Between October 2007 and March 2014 alone, there were 124 investigations linked to corruption surrounding the Ex-Im bank. This includes some 792 separate claims involving more than $500 million dollars. The Ex-Im Inspector General also revealed last week that 31 other Ex-Im Bank employees are currently being investigated for fraud. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) is the Freshman Class President.

Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) voted to pass the bill and released the following statement: "We all saw the threat in real life when Sony was hacked.

H.R. 1195 codifies two other advisory committees that have already been created by the CFPB: the Credit Union Advisory Council and the Community Bank Advisory Council. Each board or council advises and consults with the Bureau on relevant issues and provides information on emerging practices and concerns. It requires the CFPB Director to appoint at least 15, but no more than 20, members to the board and sets forth eligibility criteria for such appointments. Rep.

04.15.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House voted today to pass H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. Sponsored by Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX), the bill would repeal the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, as well as cut the top gift tax rate. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) released the following statement: â€œYou shouldnâ€™t lose the farm when you lose a loved one. The death tax hurts the economy and families who have worked hard to build up their own businesses. This double tax is un-American. The government takes from Americans as they work to save and build up their livelihoods only to slam them again with a death tax on their heirs,â€ said Congressman Buck. He continued, â€œIt's time the government stops punishing Americans for working hard, becoming successful, and creating jobs. This tax results in an insignificant amount of revenue for the federal government but imposes a huge burden on families and their businesses. We should repeal the death tax.â€ Repealing the death tax will result in a tax cut of $269 billion over 10 years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). The American economy generates 18,000 fewer jobs each year than it otherwise would because of the death tax, according to a 2014 Heritage Foundation estimate. â€œAfter paying the death tax, many businesses have a substantially reduced ability to expand hiring and investment,â€ Heritage notes.

04.14.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House passed by a vote of 263 to 162 H.R. 650, the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015, a bill to protect the availability of financing for affordable manufactured housing sponsored by Rep. Stephen Fincher (R-TN). The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau released guidelines in 2013 that went into effect last year to expand the range of loan products considered to be â€œhigh-costâ€ under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act. H.R. 650 makes two changes to these regulations. It modifies the definition of high-cost loans so that manufactured housing loans are not unfairly considered high-cost loans. It also clarifies that manufactured housing retailers not engaged in financing loans should not be considered mortgage loan originators for purposes of heightened regulation and limitation on activity under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO), a co-sponsor of the bill, released the following statement: â€œThis bill will ensure hard-working, low-income and middle-income families in rural Colorado and other rural areas across the country have better access to loans for affordable housing. Manufactured homes are a critical housing option for some Americans. The CFPBâ€™s regulations are allegedly designed to help these communities, but they are in fact jeopardizing financing for manufactured homes and harming Americans whose livelihoods are connected to the manufactured homes industry.

03.25.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today, the House voted to pass H. Con. Res 27, the fiscal year (FY) 2016 budget sponsored by Rep. Tom Price (R-GA). The Republicans Study Committee budget, titled "Blueprint for a Balanced Budget," was offered as an amendment, but failed to pass. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) released the following statement: "I voted for the Republican Study Committee Budget, which represents a serious vision for balancing our budget. It repeals Obamacare and promises to use the budget reconciliation to achieve that goal. It devolves transportation decisions back to states and local governments, and it delegates elementary and secondary education to states and localities,â€ Buck said. He continued, â€œI did not vote for the leadership-backed budget because it will not balance, it is filled with gimmicks, and it will lead to increased taxes and deficits. It is based on false assumptions and ignores the political and economic realities we will face over the next decade. Our $18.1 trillion debt is harming the economy now, and as the debt continues to skyrocket, it will destroy the economy for our children and grandchildren.â€ Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

03.18.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ The House voted 241 to 175 pass H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act, which requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to make public for review the scientific data used in the agency's regulatory and rule-making process. The House also voted to pass H.R. 1029, the EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2015, which expands public participation, transparency, and fairness in the EPA's Science Advisory Board. Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) released the following statement: â€œThe Environmental Protection Agency has earned a reputation as a rogue agency that is unaccountable to the people. Today, I joined many other members of the House in restoring the accountability and transparency that the American people deserve from this agency. The EPAâ€™s invasive rules directly impact American familiesâ€™ finances, choices, and businesses. The EPA claims its regulations are based on sound scientific data, which means they should have nothing to hide. The data they use should be made available for peer review and scrutiny, and the American people should be allowed to live their lives without expensive and excessive regulations based on faulty science.â€ In 1978, Congress created the EPA Science Advisory Board to provide independent scientific advice to the Administration. The Science Advisory Board has silenced voices of dissent, limited public participation in its decisions, and has shown a potential conflict of interests. Rep.

Ken Buck (R-CO) announced the Congressional Instituteâ€™s 2015 Congressional Art Competition opening show, featuring studentsâ€™ artwork from Coloradoâ€™s Fourth Congressional District. The Congressional Institute sponsors this annual, nationwide visual arts competition, honoring the talents and abilities of the nationâ€™s finest student artists. More than 650,000 high school students have participated in the Congressional Art Competition since its inception in 1982. The grand prize winnersâ€™ artwork will be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year, and will attend a reception in their honor at the White House.

03.03.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington -- Today, the House voted to approve H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. Amendments to defund President Obamaâ€™s executive actions on immigration were stripped from the bill. Congressman Ken Buck released the following statement: â€œPresident Obamaâ€™s executive amnesty violates our Constitution. His actions are inexcusable and antithetical to our system of government. The passage today of a bill that funds President Obamaâ€™s executive amnesty is a loss for the Constitution and those who want to uphold it. Todayâ€™s vote is a win for our lawless president and for members of Congress who wanted to protect his unlawful executive actions,â€ Buck said. "Immigrants from around the world are attracted to America in large part because we have a profound respect for the rule of law. That is precisely why President Obamaâ€™s illegal, unconstitutional executive actions are so harmful to our nation and system of government. His executive amnesty is not merely prosecutorial discretion, as he has so often repeated. He changed the law to grant work permits and social security numbers to those here illegally. In doing so, he bypassed Congress and disregarded current law,â€ Buck continued. President Obama said in November that he, â€œtook an action to change the law,â€ an action that he told the American people 22 times he did not have the authority to take. Twenty-six states have filed suit challenging the presidentâ€™s executive actions, and one federal judge has temporarily stopped the processing of work permits for illegal aliens. Rep.

03.03.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington -- Today, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session Congress, in the wake of continued negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran. Congressman Ken Buck released the following statement: "Prime Minister Netanyahu's address today came at critical time. The Prime Minister stated, 'the greatest danger facing our world is the marriage of militant Islam with nuclear weapons.' He exhibits clarity of thought that our commander in chief has failed to exhibit in his dealings with Iran. A nuclear Iran is unacceptable, and it is an existential threat to Israel. American leaders must not be shortsighted. There are evil actors on the international stage that eagerly desire the destruction of freedom-loving people around the world. For President Obama to negotiate with a regime that refers to America as the 'Great Satan' and organizes 'Death to America' rallies is utter nonsense. I thank Prime Minister Netanyahu -- and all government officials who attended and supported his address -- for casting politics aside and speaking truthfully about the very real threats facing the free world today," said Congressman Buck.

02.05.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington -- Today, the House voted to pass H.R. 527, the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2015, which requires federal agencies to better assess the impacts of their regulations on small business and to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burdens and design smarter, less onerous rules. It clarifies that agencies have to consider the indirect economic effects as well as direct economic effects of regulations. H.R. 527 eliminates the Internal Revenue Service's commonly used loopholes to avoid communicating with small businesses, and gives small businesses earlier input on new rules through Small Business Advocacy Review panels. Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released the following statement: "Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. Yet, in the current regulatory environment, they have to pay thousands of dollars per employee to comply with federal regulations each year. To impose such a great burden on our job creators is simply wrong. Millions of families across the country rely on small businesses for their livelihood, to put food on the table and educate their children. This bill helps ensure that the federal government refrains from imposing harmful, duplicative, or unnecessary regulations on America's job creators." According to the Congressional Research Service, half of America's workforce goes to work in a small business every day. The Small Business Administration estimates small businesses have to pay about $11,000 per employee to comply with federal regulations each year. Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

02.04.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today, the House voted to pass H.R. 50, the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act, which requires federal agencies to consult with state, local, and tribal governments while developing significant regulatory mandates and extends this requirement to the private sector. Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released the following statement: â€œI am proud of my vote for the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. This bill will protect the private sector and local communities from onerous, costly regulations and mandates. Requiring the federal government to consult the individuals who will be affected adversely by federal mandates before they are imposed on them makes perfect sense. This bill closes loopholes that allow the federal government to impose unnecessary burdens on local governments and individuals in the private sector without accountability and transparency. This solution is long overdue, and I hope that the Senate passes this bill and President Obama signs it into law.â€ H.R. 50 seeks to close the loopholes in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA), which was enacted to promote informed and deliberate decision making by Congress and federal agencies. UMRA was found by the 112th Congress to be largely unsuccessful in living up to its original intent. It failed to keep onerous mandates off the backs of local governments and the private sector due to loopholes, exemptions, and narrow coverage. H.R. 50 requires independent regulatory agencies to comply with the UMRA and closes the loophole that currently allows any agency to forgo UMRA analysis if the agency never issued a notice of proposed rulemaking for a federal regulatory mandate.

02.02.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today, the House passed H.R. 596 to repeal Obamacare in its entirety by a vote of 239 to 186. To date, the House has voted to pass 59 bills related to Obamacare, including bills to fully repeal, partially repeal, delay implementation, defund, or otherwise change the law. Of those 59 votes, President Obama signed ten bills into law. The House has voted four times to fully repeal the law. Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released the following statement: â€œObamacareâ€™s deleterious effects on the middle class are not up for question. Hundreds of thousands of Americans in Colorado alone have been harmed by the Presidentâ€™s healthcare law. Perhaps one of the most perverse aspects of the law is how it grows government at the expense of the middle class. We will not create an opportunity economy, nor will we restore America, by gutting and punishing the middle class. Under Barack Obamaâ€™s leadership, Wall Street is thriving, and government dependence is increasing, while the middle class shrinks,â€ Buck said. He continued, â€œLabor participation is at a historic low, with the Obama economy offering workers less opportunity and hundreds of thousands of Americans dropping out of the workforce altogether. Obamacare is a major culprit in this trend because it discourages small businesses from hiring. I will continue to work to repeal and replace it with a healthcare law that benefits the middle class and all Americans.â€ According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Affordable Care Act will eliminate the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs a year. The law reduces both the supply and demand for workers, according to analysis by the Heritage Foundation. Rep.

01.27.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€” Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) was named Vice Chair of the Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on the Interior. The Interior Subcommittee was created to oversee the Interior, EPA, and the Energy and Agriculture departments, which impact the economy and industries in rural Colorado. Congressman Buck released the following statement: â€œI am very pleased with this position. It will allow me to work closely with Chairman Lummis and the other members of the Interior Subcommittee to prevent excessive and unwelcome encroachment by the federal government into issues that affect our economic development and prosperity. I will be able to work on issues that are crucially important to Colorado and other Western states such as fracking, other forms of energy development and restrictions on the use of federal lands," said Congressman Buck. Buck continued: "Congressman Lummis is a strong leader and a colleague whom I already admire for her willingness to tackle tough issues head on. She will not tolerate actions by this administration or any future administration that needlessly waste or mismanage taxpayer money. I am confident that her leadership and our efforts will produce results that benefit the people of Colorado and other Western states.â€ Congressman Cynthia Lummis (WY), Chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, stated: â€œI am very pleased to have my good friend and newly elected colleague Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado join me as my Vice Chairman on Oversight and Government Reformâ€™s Subcommittee on the Interior. This is an especially critical position for Western states like Colorado and Wyoming, and I look forward to working with Rep. Buck as we move forward with government oversight." Congressman Jason Chaffetz (UT-03), Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, added: â€œCongressman Buck understands the value of vigorous oversight and the importance of making sure the government runs effectively and efficiently.

01.27.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€” This week Americans across the country celebrate National School Choice Week. Congressman Ken Buck is a strong supporter of educational choice and released the following statement: "The issue of school choice is a limited government issue. We have to decide how much control the federal government should have over our childrenâ€™s education. I believe parents and local leaders are best equipped to make these decisions, because they know the unique needs of their students. Yet some lawmakers and bureaucrats still want to centralize control over education in Washington. They view school choice as a threat because these successful programs hold a mirror up to the failures of the education system in this country. That is precisely one of the most compelling reasons to champion and support school choice. These programs are an innovative way for children from low-income families to access the quality education they deserve â€” that they may not be receiving elsewhere â€” and they create an environment in which all educators can be held to higher standards. In my own state of Colorado, the issue of school choice has gone all the way to the Colorado Supreme Court in the case of Taxpayers v. Douglas County Board of Education. A decision by the Colorado Court of Appeals in 2013, which overturned an injunction placed on the Douglas County Choice Scholarship Program, was a victory for students in Colorado. School choice gives parents in Colorado control and makes education dollars more mobile. Now the fate of this successful school-choice program lies in the balance, as the Colorado Supreme Court prepares to make its ruling. As a lawmaker, I will continue to promote the value of educational choice and the innovative solutions created by school-choice programs.â€ Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

01.22.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Today the House of Representatives passed H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, sponsored by Congressman Chris Smith (R-NJ). As Heritage analyst Sarah Torre notes, â€œAn ever-encroaching government is trampling on the conscience rights of pro-life Americans, and Obamacare continues to find new ways to send taxpayer money to the abortion industry.â€ H.R. 7 helps prevent this perverse government encroachment. Congressman Buck supported this bill and released the following statement: â€œI was proud to vote in favor of H.R. 7 today on the 42nd anniversary of Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, which invented a constitutional right to abortion-on-demand. The passage of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act signifies our commitment to protecting life and protecting conscience rights of all Americans. It will permanently ensure that taxpayers are not funding abortion or insurance coverage that includes abortion. I am honored to vote in favor of legislation that defends the lives of innocent and defenseless unborn children and aims to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. No American citizen should be forced to choose between honoring their conscience and funding abortion.â€ Rep. Ken Buck (CO-04) serves on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.

Mike Pompeo (R-KS). H.R. 161 will help provide the infrastructure necessary to deliver affordable energy to American households and businesses. It will also help modernize the federal review process for natural gas pipeline permit applications. "I want to do everything I can to lower energy prices for hard-working American families. Families in Colorado and across the country who need to heat their homes in the winter and cool them in the summer will save money if this bill becomes law. Natural gas is an important source for electricity generation, and the burdensome regulations currently in place needlessly slow the permitting process for natural gas pipelines. This bill modernizes our energy infrastructure and stabilizes the permitting process,â€ said Congressman Ken Buck. He continued, â€œColorado produces an abundance of natural gas. Our prices are held artificially low, hurting Coloradans when we canâ€™t deliver our product to market quickly and efficiently. This bill will help create more jobs in rural Colorado by dealing with this issue. It is a common sense solution the Senate should pass and the President should sign into law." Rep.

01.20.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-226-8414 Washington â€“ Tonight, President Obama gave his sixth State of the Union address, and Congressman Ken Buck (CO-04) released the following statement: "Tonight President Obama expressed a desire to help the middle class, but the middle class is the group that feels most alienated and harmed by the President's current policies. His plan for the next two years is more of the same: to grow government and increase taxes. The President claims his proposals will expand opportunity, but a continuation of the same stale policies will only result in dwindling opportunities. On top of that, he has grown our debt to over $18 trillion. Sadly, the President fails to acknowledge his contribution to the fiscal burden he is imposing on future generations," said Buck. He continued, â€œI will work with my colleagues in the House and Senate to reduce expensive regulations that burden the middle class and small businesses, the backbone of our economy. We have already gotten off to a positive start in the House with the passage of H.R. 37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. Above all, we must tackle the debt, which poses an existential threat to our nation.â€ Rep.

Ken Buck (CO-04) voted in favor of H.R. 240, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act , 2015 and released the following statement: "This week I responded to calls from a majority of Americans to fund the Department of Homeland Security and defund President Obamaâ€™s unprecedented, unilateral action on immigration. Congress, not the President, has the authority to change our immigration laws. Even President Obama admitted this repeatedly before he took his recent executive actions on immigration. Passing H.R. 240 was an important first step to ensure changes to our immigration system are made through the proper channels. Once the Senate acts, it is incumbent on President Obama to put the security of the American people before his political goals.â€ Rep. Buck also supported all five amendments to H.R. 240 and was strongly in favor of the DeSantis, Roby amendment to ensure domestic violence perpetrators and sex offenders are priorities for removal by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

01.09.2015	FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Katherine Rosario, 202-225-4676 Washington, D.C. - Today the House voted on the Keystone XL Pipeline Act (H.R. 3), sponsored by Rep. Kevin Cramer (R-ND). Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO), a proud cosponsor, released the following statement: "Today, together with my colleagues in the House, I responded to calls from a majority of Americans by voting to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. For years, President Obama and the Democrat-controlled Senate needlessly delayed the project to appease radical environmentalists and promote their agenda. They willfully ignored important facts about the project. Pipelines are the safest mode of transporting oil and gas to Americans. State Department studies and environmental reviews have repeatedly demonstrated the pipelineâ€™s environmental impact will be negligible. It will increase energy security and independence for the American people and will create thousands of jobs. With a Republican-controlled Senate, the onus is on President Obama to put the good of the American people over his ideological agenda. Even Former Obama Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar called the project a â€œwin-win.â€ Yet, President Obama has already threatened to veto the project, once again demonstrating a disregard for the will of the people. Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle should be able to come together on this common sense issue and overcome President Obamaâ€™s needless obstruction." Rep.

01.06.2015	WASHINGTON D.C. â€“ Congressman Ken Buck (R-CO) released the following statement after being sworn in as a member of the 114th Congress: "Never before in our nation's history have we been burdened with the incredible debt we face today. The $18 trillion debt is a direct consequence of decisions made in Washington. It undermines the economy and national security and endangers future generations. Confronting this issue is no small task, but it is one I came to Washington to perform. Washington must not continue to impede economic growth and prosperity by growing the debt and deficit and strangling the private sector with regulations. I will work to return the federal government to its proper size and scope and to limit the federal government's functions to the confines delineated by the Constitution and envisioned by the Founders. This is not a partisan issue; it is not a political issue; it is an issue we all must face and confront boldly as Americans. Washington has created problems at the federal level we are now obligated to fix. America is the greatest nation in the world -- not without imperfections or free of trials -- but with exceptional beginnings, incredible accomplishments, and with political and philosophical foundations for greatness unparalleled in human history. I am honored to serve the great people of Colorado's Fourth Congressional District and all Americans by confronting our nation's most pressing issues head on, not the least of which is our unfathomable debt."
01.06.2015	Washington, D.C. â€“ Representative Ken Buck (R-CO) issued the following statement regarding the reelection of Representative John Boehner (R-OH) as Speaker of the House: â€œToday, I chose to vote for Speaker John Boehnerâ€™s reelection as Speaker of the House because with majorities in both the House and Senate, Republicans are operating from a new position of strength and unity. Speaker Boehner has the opportunity to work the Republican majorities in both chambers to combat President Obamaâ€™s lawlessness and unconstitutional actions. I intend to work toward that end, to reduce federal spending, and to reduce red tape and regulations that stifle the private sector. I do not agree with every decision Speaker Boehner has made, but under his leadership the House passed 387 bills during the 113th Congress designed to improve the economy and increase our liberties. They all sat on Harry Reidâ€™s desk in the Senate and went nowhere. Speaker Boehner is now being given the chance to work with the new Senate majority to solve problems and rein in the federal government. I am not in Washington to cast protest votes or to vote present. Republicans nominated Speaker Boehner. As todayâ€™s vote demonstrated, he garnered the most support from the Republican Party. The members who stepped forward as alternatives were well intentioned and their decision was admirable. However, there was no other viable candidate for the position of Speaker of the House. With this vote complete, I look forward to working to solve the problems we face as a nation, chief among them our debt and deficit.â€
