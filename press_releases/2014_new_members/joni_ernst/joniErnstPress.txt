04.24.2019	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) released the following statement to encourage Iowans to participate in the 17th National Prescription Drug Take Back Day on Saturday, April 27, 2019. “Tragically, the opioid epidemic impacts millions of Americans and countless Iowans, either directly or indirectly, and claims more than 100 lives every day. Congress has taken substantive steps to provide support for addicts and their families during recovery and beyond. We’ve also put in place prevention efforts to help deter individuals from falling victim to this terrible epidemic. One of those efforts is National Prescription Drug Take Back Day. “Drug take back programs are a simple and effective way to stop addiction before it starts. They’re also an opportunity for everyone to help reduce the devastating impacts of opioid abuse. We encourage Iowans to find their nearest collection site and participate. It’s an easy way to help save lives in our communities.” National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is a national program coordinated by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Its purpose is to provide a safe, convenient and anonymous way to dispose of unused prescription drugs. In 2016, Ernst and Grassley, requested that the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct a review of drug take back programs. Its report found low participation in the program due to confusing federally imposed regulations. Ernst and Grassley also urged the President’s Commission on Combatting Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis to conduct an evaluation of drug take back programs. The final report spurred increased participation in these programs from hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies through year-round unused drug collection. Ernst and Grassley also worked with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) to introduce the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act (AIDD), bipartisan legislation that creates a federal demonstration program that allows states to apply for grant funding from the DOJ to grow participation in drug take back days. The AIDD Act was included in the comprehensive opioid legislation that was signed into law last year. During the 16th National Drug Take Back Day in October, 2018, the DEA organized 5,839 collection sites and collected more than 900,000 pounds of prescription medicine nationwide. That’s more than 457 tons of drugs that were diverted from theft, misuse, and polluting the environment. Since the first national collection in 2010, the DEA has collected nearly 11 million pounds. In Iowa, 88 law enforcement officers worked at 128 collection sites throughout the state and collected 10,444 pounds of unused prescription drugs. More than 123,500 pounds of unused drugs have been collected in Iowa since the beginning of the drug take back program. To find an authorized collection site, contact the DEA Office of Diversion Control’s Registration Call Center at 800/822-9539 or visit http://takebackday.dea.gov and enter a city, county, state or zip code to find the location most convenient for you.

04.17.2019	Glenwood, Iowa – During a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee field hearing hosted and chaired by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), the Senator questioned officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on river management in the wake of the recent devastating floods in Iowa. “Having your farmland, homes, and businesses flooded out every few years cannot become a ‘fact of life’ for folks who live in the vicinity of the Missouri River. This trend of flood and rebuild, flood and rebuild must end,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Today’s conversation is only one in a broader dialogue about solutions that will help Iowans who are in dire need. I’m hopeful that what we’ve heard today will help shed light on what those solutions may be.” Senator Ernst’s full opening remarks as prepared for delivery can be found HERE. Witnesses included officials from the Army Corps and local leaders and stakeholders from Fremont County, Iowa, among others. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Jerry Moran (R-KS), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) also participated in the hearing. Background: In the wake of the flooding, Senator Ernst has worked tirelessly to provide aid to Iowans in need. She helped introduce legislation, the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019, to provide tax relief to Iowans in declared disaster zones. She is also working with Senator Grassley on an amendment that will extend federal relief from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (UDSA) to cover Iowa farmers who have lost stored grain. The Senator has surveyed flood damage in Western Iowa multiple times, including last week with the Vice President of the United States, Mike Pence, Governor Kim Reynolds (R-IA), and Senator Grassley. Senator Ernst has also met directly with President Trump at the White House to discuss a way forward to get timely and badly needed aid to Iowa communities, on top of the disaster dollars available from FEMA and other federal resources. The meeting came on the heels of Senate Democrats voting down a disaster aid package that would have provided support to Iowans in need. For Iowans impacted by floods, there are many resources available.

04.13.2019	Continuing to Fight for Iowans Affected by Flooding Senator Ernst again this week is voicing her support for Iowans and those across the Midwest whose lives have been upended by the recent flooding. Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. Additionally, Senator Ernst and fellow Iowa Senator, Chuck Grassley, introduced legislation to provide tax relief to Iowans impacted by the recent floods. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 would allow individuals in areas of Iowa and Nebraska that have been declared a major disaster by the president to be eligible for a number of tax benefits. In the wake of the flooding, Senator Ernst will be hosting a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee field hearing in Southwest Iowa this upcoming week. The hearing will focus on answering questions about the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ river management. Witnesses will include officials from the Army Corps and local leaders and stakeholders from Fremont County, among others. Combating Sexual Assault As part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Senator Ernst spoke on the floor of the Senate, encouraging her fellow lawmakers to join her in working to combat sexual assault. During her speech, the Iowa Senator stated, “Whether it’s working with Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee Senator Feinstein to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, or fighting to reduce the abuse of females in custody through legislation with Senators Booker and Blumenthal, combatting sexual assault should be bipartisan, and something we all can agree on.” Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s speech on combating sexual assault. In keeping with this effort, Senators Ernst, Grassley, and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are probing the Department of Defense for an apparent failure to ask victims of sexual assault if they would prefer their case to be tried in a civilian or military court. In a letter to the Acting Secretary of Defense, the senators are seeking information about what rules are in place to ensure that victims are properly notified and how often prosecution in these cases takes place in the victim’s preferred venue. The full text of the senators’ letter can be found HERE. Standing Up for Life and Iowa’s Children This week, during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, Senator Ernst, a fierce defender of life, questioned witnesses and shared the remarkable story of Micah Pickering, a native of Newton, Iowa. During the hearing, Ernst explained how at 20 weeks, “the humanity of Baby Micah was undeniable.” She went on to explain that Micah’s story is “a powerful testament to the fact that at five months of development, an unborn child is in every way a child, capable of feeling pain and growing up to live a full and happy life.” Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s opening remarks and questioning. During a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, Senator Ernst questioned witnesses on Child Nutrition Reauthorization. There are few barriers that inhibit a child’s development greater than hunger, and Senator Ernst was outspoken about her commitment to ensuring children in Iowa have access to quality, healthy food.

04.11.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) have introduced legislation to provide tax relief for Iowans in areas impacted by the recent devastating floods. “My number one focus right now remains squarely on how to get our fellow Iowans the help and support they need—and to get it as quickly as possible,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This bill will help provide important and badly-needed relief for Iowans in disaster areas.” “Families and businesses in Iowa and throughout the nation are working to rebuild their lives and reopen the doors of their businesses after the terrible disasters that have ravaged parts of the nation. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019, which includes a series of disaster tax relief provisions, would give a hand up to Americans who are trying to move forward and get their lives back on track and businesses that trying to get up and running again,” said Senator Chuck Grassley. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 would provide tax relief for individuals in areas of Iowa and Nebraska that have been declared a major disaster by the president. Benefits under the bill include special rules allowing access to retirement funds, a special credit for employee retention during business interruption, suspension of limits on deductions for certain charitable contributions, special rules for deductions for disaster-related personal casualty losses, and special rules for measurement of earned income for purposes of qualification for tax credits. A more detailed summary of the bill is available here. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 is sponsored by Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE) in the U.S. Senate and Rep. Adrian Smith (R-NE) in the House. ###
04.11.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) are probing the Department of Defense for apparent failure to ask victims of sexual assault if they would prefer their case to be tried in a civilian or military court. Such notifications are required by law, but a recent inspector general report found a widespread lack of compliance and failure to record the victim’s preference. “The findings in this inspector general report are simply unacceptable. Victims of sexual assault must be heard. For this to happen, they must be asked their preference for venue of prosecution” said Senator Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. “As a former company commander and retired lieutenant colonel, I strongly believe we need to take concrete steps to encourage reporting of sexual assault within our ranks; failure to listen to victims will only serve to discourage them from doing so.” “Informing victims of their options is an important piece of making sure justice is served. Every failure to give a victim their options makes that justice harder to achieve, and every failure to properly handle a case will weigh on those deciding to come forward and report in the future. Those who choose to serve their country in the armed forces deserve the best we can give them. The inspector general’s findings show that’s not what they are getting,” said Senator Chuck Grassley. “When survivors of military sexual assault come forward to tell their stories, they have the right to say whether they want their case tried in either a military or civilian court. This right is protected by a law that passed years ago, but the recent OIG report reveals that the Department of Defense is too often failing to record the preferences of survivors or to even tell them that they have this option at all,” said Gillibrand, Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee. “This is unacceptable and shows a disrespect for the survivors of military sexual assault, which is why I am calling on the Department of Defense to implement this law without further delay. I will always do everything in my power to combat sexual assault in the military.” For more than four years, the law has required that the proper authorities ask military sexual assault victims whether they prefer to try their case in civilian or military courts. Providing victims this choice of venue could improve the overall reporting rates. But in a review of 86 cases published in March, the Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General found that 21 victims had not been given the venue options and only five cases could be verified as fully complying with the law. In a letter to the Acting Secretary of Defense, the senators are seeking information about what rules are in place to ensure that victims are properly notified and how often prosecution in these cases takes place in the victim’s preferred venue. The senators also ask whether the department disagrees with any of the inspector general’s recommendations and which recommendations will not be implemented. Full text of the senators’ letter follows or can be found HERE. April 8, 2019 VIA ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION Patrick M. Shanahan Acting Secretary of Defense 3010 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-3010 Dear Acting Secretary Shanahan: Under section 540(b) of the FY 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, military authorities are required to ask victims of sexual assault if they prefer their case to be tried in civilian or military courts.[1] However, according to a recently released Department of Defense Office of the Inspector General (DOD OIG) report, the Department of Defense (Department) is failing to notify and record the preferences of the alleged victims in accordance with this provision.[2] The DOD OIG audit found that at least 21 victims had not been asked their preference prior to the prosecution of their case.[3] In another 56 cases, officials stated that the victims were asked, but little or no documentation exists to indicate the victims’ preference for the record.[4] This audit suggests that multiple victims were deprived of their ability to provide input on the venue for their case, and because the sample size was limited to one installation from each of the military branches, it is possible that the problem is more widespread than the audit suggests.[5] While the victim’s preference as to jurisdiction is non-binding, these statistics are disconcerting as some advocates and victims believe that providing victims the ability to offer input concerning court venue could increase overall victim reporting rates.[6] It is important that victims have a voice and that their wishes are carefully considered by those in positions of authority. Noncompliance with section 540(b) ensures that those important voices will not be heard. The widespread nature of these violations suggests an institutional failure rather than an isolated instance. The IG audit supports this notion, as it states in the report that the “[Department] did not establish a [Department] wide process to ensure that victims of alleged sexual assault were asked about their preference for prosecution…”[7] It also points to the lack of victim prosecution preference tracking by the Department’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (SAPRO) as a contributing factor to this problem.[8] Only 5 out of 82 cases reviewed were found to have been handled correctly.[9] To confirm that victims of sexual assault are appropriately notified of their ability to be consulted on their preferred venue, as required under the law, please answer the following questions by April 22, 2019: 1. What specific Department or Service rules implement the statutory consultation requirement? a. Do the Department’s requirements designate a specific individual or office as responsible for consulting with the victim regarding venue preference, and a timeframe in which to do so? If not, why not? b. What training is provided to the relevant civilian and military personnel that are tasked with consulting with the victim on his/her venue preference in sexual assault cases? Please provide policy and training document examples. c. Does the Department require authorities to use a specific form to indicate, for the record, a victim’s preference in venue? If not, why not? Which personnel, if any, are trained in the use of this form? Does this form require the victim’s signature? If not, why not? 2. The DOD OIG report states that the Department, “generally agreed with the recommendations” suggested by the OIG. Are there any elements of the DOD OIG’s recommendations that the Department does not plan to implement? If so, which elements and why? 3. How frequently does the prosecution take place in the victim’s preferred venue? Out of the total number of sexual assault cases prosecuted each year since implementation, how many were prosecuted in the victim’s preferred venue? Please explain under what circumstances the Department does not honor the victim’s preference. Should you have any questions, please contact Daniel Boatright of my Committee staff at (202) 224-4515. Thank you for your attention to this important mater. Sincerely, ###
04.10.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) will chair a Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee field hearing next week in Southwest Iowa focusing on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ river management following the devastating flooding in the region. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) will also participate. Witnesses will include officials from the Army Corps and local leaders and stakeholders from Fremont County, among others. “As Iowans continue to recover from the devastating floods, we need answers to the critical question of how best to manage our rivers and water infrastructure,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This hearing will bring together officials from the Army Corps and local leaders and stakeholders to examine what happened over the last few weeks and discuss how we can prevent this kind of destruction from happening again.” “Flood control should be the number one priority of the Army Corps of Engineers,” said Senator Chuck Grassley. “The current river management policy needs fixing, and recent flooding makes that more urgent than ever. This hearing will help put a spotlight on the real-world impact that policies crafted in Washington have on Iowans and Americans across the Midwest. I thank Senator Joni Ernst for her hard work and leadership on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee. Having her in this key role will continue to pay dividends for Iowans.” WHAT: Senator Ernst to host EPW field hearing with Senator Grassley in Southwest Iowa, entitled “Oversight Hearing on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Management of the 2019 Missouri River Basin Flooding.” WHEN: Wednesday, April 17 at 8:30 a.m. CT WHERE: Kaufman Hall, 24116 Marian Ave., Glenwood, IA 5153 WITNESSES: Major General Scott Spellmon Deputy Commanding General, Civil and Emergency Operations U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Civil Works) John Remus Chief, Missouri River Basin Water Management Division U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Civil Works), Northwestern Division Cathy Crain Mayor City of Hamburg, Iowa Leo Ettleman Farmer & Community Advocate Fremont County, Iowa Joel Euler Attorney Doniphan County, Kansas

04.10.2019	WASHINGTON—Yesterday, as part of Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), spoke on the Senate floor to encourage her fellow lawmakers to join her in working to combat sexual assault. On the floor of the Senate, Ernst highlighted a number of her legislative efforts to confront the issue of sexual assault, to include the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, a bill that she recently reintroduced with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). In addition, Senator Ernst called for action on the part of the Senate to combat this issue that has touched so many women and men in Iowa and across the country. Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s speech. Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks. “I rise today to focus on a serious issue that has plagued our society and impacted the lives of so many people across our great nation: sexual assault. “During my time at Iowa State University, I served as a volunteer counselor at a crisis center that provided shelter and support to survivors of abuse and sexual assault. “I heard so many gut wrenching stories of women, and of men, fleeing domestic abusers, suffering not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. “Taking calls on our hotline from people that had been raped and sexually abused was absolutely heartbreaking. “Abuse is not something you can just simply forget – it stays with you forever. And I know this personally. “As a survivor and as a United States Senator, I feel it is important to be a voice for the thousands of victims across Iowa—and so many more across our nation—who have fallen prey to sexual assault, to rape, to harassment, and other forms of abuse. “Our country is facing a mental health crisis, and one cannot help but feel that these issues are all too often interwoven into the stories of so many Americans. “April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. As lawmakers, it is a stark reminder that we must take a long hard look at how we can combat this problem and take real steps to confront sexual assault in our society. “Just last week, with my colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator Gillibrand and others, we reintroduced a bipartisan bill to combat sexual assault on our college and university campuses. “Our bipartisan measure will make campuses in Iowa safer and ensure victims are fairly heard by changing the way our universities handle sexual assault cases. “But it’s not just these young men and women at these institutions who have been victimized. “Like so many of you, I was horrified, absolutely horrified, to hear of the crimes committed by Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics doctor who abused hundreds of young athletes. “The actions of Nassar, and the individuals and institutions that facilitated and then protected his behavior, are inexcusable. “The cases were also symptomatic of broader problems our society faces on sexual assault, rape, harassment, and abuse—leaving women and men, young and old, vulnerable. “These types of failures are the reasons I have worked with my colleagues in Congress on reforms to ensure sexual misconduct is reported, responded to, taken seriously, and, ideally, prevented. “For instance, we introduced a bill to require the governing bodies of U.S. amateur athletic organizations to immediately report sex-abuse allegations to local or federal law enforcement, or a child-welfare agency. “But the work doesn’t end with our educational and athletic institutions. We must challenge people to do better, to protect people from these horrendous actions. “In the case of the military, the Department of Defense should take a stronger posture in terms of preventing sexual assault within its ranks. I say this as a former company commander and a retired lieutenant colonel. “While there have been concrete steps taken to improve the safety of our servicemembers, there is more that we can and we should do to protect our men and women in uniform and change the overall culture. “The message I hear all too often is that victims in our armed services have a fear of retaliation. “And folks, this is absolutely unacceptable. “Those who report sexual assault should not fear coming forward, and those who retaliate against individuals should be punished to the full extent of the law. “I helped author a bill to make retaliation its own unique offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and fortunately for our service members, this bill is now law. “It is my hope that Congress can continue to work on legislation that addresses these issues. “While my personal story certainly does play a role in my passion for change, so also do the stories and faces of men and women back home in Iowa. Every single one of them. With that face, with that name, with that heart, and with that soul. It’s their stories that push me to want to make real and lasting change. “Whether it’s working with Ranking Member on the Judiciary Committee Senator Feinstein to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, or fighting to reduce the abuse of females in custody through legislation with Senators Booker and Blumenthal, combatting sexual assault should be bipartisan, and something we all can agree on. “I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues toward ending sexual assault once and for all. “This issue will continue to plague us until we come together and take concrete steps to address it. We all can, and must, do better. “This month, as we raise awareness of sexual assault, I hope to see this body taking real and lasting action. “Thank you.” ###
04.09.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a fierce defender of life, questioned witnesses and shared the remarkable story of Micah Pickering, a native of Newton, Iowa. Micah was born prematurely at 20 weeks—the age at which the legislation would prohibit abortions. During the hearing, Ernst explained how at 20 weeks, “the humanity of Baby Micah was undeniable.” She went on to explain that while Micah is a healthy, energetic 6-year-old boy, his story “is not an isolated incident, and that it is a “a powerful testament to the fact that at five months of development, an unborn child is in every way a child, capable of feeling pain and growing up to live a full and happy life.” Click here to watch Senator Ernst share Micah’s story. During the hearing, Ernst questioned Dr. Donna Harrison, Executive Director of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists. She posed questions to Dr. Harrison on her experiences with babies at the gestational age of 20 weeks. Background: The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would prohibit abortion after about five months post-fertilization, the point in development that science has shown unborn children can feel pain. As an original cosponsor of the bill, Senator Ernst has consistently called on her colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The Iowa Senator has led the fight to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect taxpayer funds to women’s health care and eligible entities like community health centers, which provide greater health care services but do not provide abortions. In 2017 she championed legislation that was signed into law by President Trump that overturned an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration, and restored decisions about the best eligible Title X providers to the states. ###
04.09.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), expressed her continued support for Iowans, and everyone in the Midwest. Speaking to members of the press, Ernst discussed legislation that she is working on to provide relief to Iowans affected by the flooding. Click here or the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks. Background: Senator Ernst is working with her fellow Iowan, Senator Chuck Grassley, on an amendment that will extend federal relief from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (UDSA) to cover Iowa farmers who have lost stored grain as a result of the disastrous flooding. In addition, Ernst is working on legislation that will provide tax relief to make it easier for Iowans to recover and rebuild. For Iowans impacted by floods, there are many resources available. For a list highlighting resources for Iowa families, businesses, and farmers, as well as information about contacting Senator Ernst’s office for assistance, click here. ###
04.06.2019	Working to Provide Relief for Iowans This week, there was a bill on the floor of the U.S. Senate that would have included needed aid for communities in Iowa impacted by flooding. It was voted down by Democrats who wanted to play politics instead. Senator Ernst spoke out about her frustration with Senate Democrats putting partisanship over disaster relief for Iowans. Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. In addition to continuing to fight for speedy disaster aid and ensuring Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and other federal agencies are helping Iowans on-the-ground, Senator Ernst is fighting for help for Iowans facing losses from the destruction of their grain storage. Right now, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) disaster relief program covers lost crops that are in the ground, but not harvested crops that are lost while in storage, like what has happened to so many Iowa farmers. Together, with Senator Chuck Grassley, Ernst is working on an amendment that would extend coverage from the USDA’s disaster programs to include stored grain. For families, individuals, and businesses across Iowa, there are a number of resources available. Click here to learn more. Sexual Assault Awareness Month’s Day of Action Tuesday was Sexual Assault Awareness Month’s Day of Action. In honor of that day, Senator Ernst helped introduce bipartisan legislation to combat sexual assault on college and university campuses by reintroducing legislation that protects students and strengthens accountability and transparency for colleges and universities. The Campus Accountability and Safety Act would reform the way colleges and universities address and report incidents of sexual assault that take place on their campuses, and it would help protect both survivors and accused students by ensuring that schools have a uniform and fair process for investigating and conducting campus disciplinary proceedings. 70th Anniversary of NATO As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, as well as a member of the Senate NATO Observer Group, Senator Ernst was honored to help welcome North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to the U.S. Capitol this week. Leading up to the 70th anniversary of the alliance, Secretary General Stoltenberg gave a joint address to Congress. Following the address, Senator Ernst recognized the importance of alliances and partnerships like NATO.

04.03.2019	WASHINGTON –Following a joint address to Congress by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate NATO Observer Group and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, issued the following statement: “The power of the United States abroad, and our safety at home in Iowa, is built on alliances and partnerships like NATO. For the past 70 years our membership in the organization has proven crucial to American security and prosperity at home and abroad. “Today, Secretary General Stoltenberg reminded us just how critical the NATO alliance is to protecting our homeland and ensuring our way of life. I’m encouraged by his remarks, and look forward to our continued partnership with our NATO allies and friends around the globe.” ###
04.02.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, on Sexual Assault Awareness Month’s Day of Action, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers are taking action to combat sexual assault on college and university campuses by reintroducing legislation that protects students and strengthens accountability and transparency for colleges and universities. “Sexual assault is a serious matter that has no place on college campuses or anywhere else,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This bipartisan legislation will make campuses safer, provide critical resources for survivors, and institute important reforms to the ways universities handle sexual assault cases so victims are fairly heard.” “Sexual assault is pervasive on colleges and universities all over the country, yet Congress has not done nearly enough to address this crisis,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), the lead sponsor of the bill. “For far too long institutions have gotten away with sweeping this problem under the rug. Students are demanding that Congress take this problem seriously, and we must listen to them. That’s why I am proud to reintroduce my bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which would hold colleges and universities accountable and help give survivors the support they need. I urge my colleagues to take this issue seriously and fight with us to pass this bipartisan bill.” The Campus Accountability and Safety Act would reform the way colleges and universities address and report incidents of sexual assault that take place on their campuses, and it would help protect both survivors and accused students by ensuring that schools have a uniform and fair process for investigating and conducting campus disciplinary proceedings. This legislation would incentivize colleges to protect students and professionalize their responses to sexual assault. It would create new resources and support services for survivors and set new notification requirements for both survivors and accused students involved in the campus disciplinary process. Specifically, this legislation would do the following: Establish new campus resources and support services for student survivors: Colleges and universities would be required to designate Sexual Assault Response Coordinators to assist survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. Sexual Assault Response Coordinators would coordinate support services and accommodations for survivors, provide information about options for reporting, and provide guidance or assistance – at the direction of the survivor – in reporting the crime to campus authorities and/or law enforcement. Schools would no longer be allowed to sanction students who report sexual violence but reveal a non-violent student conduct violation in good faith, like underage drinking. Require fairness in the campus disciplinary process: All schools would be required to use one uniform process for campus student disciplinary proceedings and would no longer be allowed to have athletic departments or other subgroups handle complaints. Schools would be required to provide written notification to the accused as well as the victim of any decision to move forward with a campus disciplinary proceeding within 24 hours of that decision. The notice must include details of the complaint, a summary of the disciplinary proceeding, and the rights and due process protections available to both parties. Ensure minimum training standards for on-campus personnel: This legislation would ensure that everyone from the Sexual Assault Response Coordinators to those responsible for investigating and participating in disciplinary proceedings receives specialized training so that they have a firm understanding of the nature of these crimes and their effect on survivors. Create historic new transparency requirements: For the first time, students at every college and university in America would be surveyed about their experience with sexual violence to get an accurate picture of this problem. This new biennial survey would be standardized and confidential, with the results published online so that parents and high school students could make an informed choice when comparing universities. The Department of Education would also be required to publish the names of all schools with pending investigations, final resolutions, and voluntary resolution agreements related to Title IX with respect to sexual violence and requirements of the Clery Act. Ensure coordination with law enforcement: This legislation would require colleges and universities to enter into memoranda of understanding (MOU) with each local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction to report to a campus as a first responder. These MOUs would ensure that the school and law enforcement clearly delineate duties and share information so that when a crime occurs, both campus authorities and local authorities can focus on solving the crime rather than debating jurisdiction. Establish stiffer penalties for violations: Schools that do not comply with certain requirements under the bill may face a penalty of up to 1 percent of the institution’s operating budget. The bill would also increase penalties for Clery Act violations to up to $150,000 per violation, from the current penalty of $35,000 per violation. Financial penalties collected from institutions in violation will be distributed back to campuses through a new competitive grant program, administered by the Secretary of Education, for which colleges and universities can apply for the purpose of researching best practices for preventing and responding to sexual and interpersonal violence on college campuses and sharing such research with peer institutions and the Department of Education. The bill has eight additional Republican and Democratic cosponsors, including Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA). ###
04.02.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) expressed her disappointment in her Democratic colleagues for choosing to play partisan political games over providing desperately needed support and aid for flood victims in Iowa, and across the Midwest. Senator Ernst’s home state of Iowa is facing up to $1.6 billion in damages from devastating flooding that began on March 12, 2019. Click here or the image above to watch the Senator Ernst’s full remarks. In her remarks, Senator Ernst stated, “Words can’t really express my disappointment in the Democrats blocking the supplemental disaster package yesterday that was put forward by Chairman Shelby. Folks in Iowa have lost their businesses, they have lost their homes. Our communities have lost their infrastructure. Livestock, gone. Grain, gone. It is devastating and it is heartbreaking. The package that was put forward yesterday was the most comprehensive package available—it covered not only the disasters in Iowa with the flooding and across the Midwest, but it included all of the other disasters from 2018. Again, the most comprehensive, far-reaching disaster supplemental package, and it was blocked by my colleagues across the aisle. Shame on them. “A number of my Democratic colleagues have been finding their way across the state of Iowa, telling Iowans how important they are to them as the presidential caucuses are nearing, and yet they voted to block the very funding that would help these families out.” Background: Last night, Senate Democrats voted against the most comprehensive disaster relief bill on the table. This measure offered $13.45 billion in relief to areas affected by 2018 disasters, including those in South Carolina, Georgia, and Puerto Rico, and extended eligibility for disaster relief to people across the Heartland, including Iowa, who have been impacted by the recent flooding this year. ###
04.01.2019	WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) voted today in support of an amendment that would make Iowans eligible to benefit from parts of a $13.45 billion disaster recovery funding measure. Despite her support, Senate Democrats forced the measure to fail. “The devastating floods have upended the lives of countless Iowans across our state. Today, the Senate had the opportunity to provide federal assistance to families in Iowa, and across the Midwest; but, instead, Senate Democrats played politics and left folks across the heartland without desperately-needed aid. “To my colleagues across the aisle, the livelihoods of people in my home state, and across much of this country, are at stake. We should be doing everything we can to support the recovery efforts and get folks the resources they need to repair and rebuild.” Background: The emergency supplemental appropriations legislation, H.R. 268, provides $13.45 billion in supplemental funding for states and territories ravaged by tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons, and other such events in 2017 and 2018. Senate appropriators amended the disaster legislation to expand eligibility in certain accounts for states in the Midwest, like Iowa, and the South that have experienced catastrophic flooding and tornadoes in 2019. ###
03.30.2019	In the Wake of Flooding, Iowans Stand Resilient Many folks across Iowa are facing the harsh realities of the devastating floods that have wreaked havoc on homes, businesses, farmland and lives as a whole. Senator Ernst is doing everything she can to ensure Iowans get the help they need. Just last week she was on the ground meeting with constituents, local, state, and federal officials, and emergency management personnel to review and discuss the damage from the flooding. The focus right now is on the recovery efforts, this includes getting the attention of federal lawmakers and raising awareness of what’s going on back in Iowa. On Tuesday, Senator Ernst spoke on the Senate floor to do just that. Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s full speech. Ernst’s colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee expanded disaster aid eligibility so that Iowans impacted by the recent flooding can now benefit from parts of the $13.45 billion federal relief package that is being taken-up in the Senate. In addition, the senator sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue urging him to provide Livestock Indemnity Program assistance as quickly as possible. Tournament of Government Waste In the spirit of March Madness, Senator Ernst and her fellow lawmakers, Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), James Lankford (R-OK), and Rand Paul (R-KY), are participating in the Tournament of Government Waste. Each senator had four “team” entries competing through four rounds of elimination, with the champion being crowned on Monday, April 1 with the title of Waste of the Year. In case you missed it, Thursday morning Senator Ernst joined Fox and Friends to discuss the latest on the ‘Tournament of Government Waste’ as well as her common sense legislation that would create more transparency and accountability by requiring every project supported with federal funds to include a price tag that is easily available for taxpayers. Click here or on the image above to watch the full interview. Working for Women Senator Ernst continues to be a voice for women. Speaking on the floor in honor of Women’s History Month [add video link], Ernst outlined a number of important women in Iowa’s history as well as her work on a number of women’s initiatives. On Thursday, Ernst announced that she is working across the aisle with Senators Cory Booker (R-NJ) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) on a bill to prohibit federal law enforcement officers, agents, or employees from using the consent defense loophole when accused of sexually assaulting someone in their custody. Also this week, the senator introduced legislation to expand health care choices for women by increasing access to contraceptives over-the-counter (OTC) and without a prescription. The bill would also allow women to use health savings accounts to purchase OTC medications without a prescription. Governor Kim Reynolds (R-IA) has a similar bill at the state level and this week it passed the Iowa State Senate. Senator Ernst sat down with Governor Reynolds last week to discuss their efforts to expand access to care for women.

03.28.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is introducing legislation to expand health care choices for women by increasing access to contraceptives over-the-counter (OTC) and without a prescription. The bill would also allow women to use health savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter-medications without a prescription. “Expanding health care choices for Iowa women in a responsible way is deeply important to me,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “By allowing women to purchase birth control over-the-counter and without the requirement of a prescription, we are giving them more options, with fewer delays and without unnecessary hurdles. It’s critical we remove barriers for women in Iowa and across the country to give them the best access to care possible.” “Making contraception more accessible, especially for rural Iowans is the right thing to do,” said Governor Kim Reynolds. “That’s why we introduced legislation this year to improve access and reduce unintended pregnancies. What Senator Ernst has unveiled at the federal level closely aligns with our efforts, and I appreciate her leadership on this issue.” The Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act makes routine-use contraceptives available OTC to patients without a prescription. The bill grants priority review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to any supplemental application made by a drug manufacturer to move its routine-use contraceptive product from prescription to OTC for individuals over the age of 18. A priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months. It also waives any FDA fees that would be associated with such an application. The legislation also repeals provisions in current law, under the Affordable Care Act, that affect the use of tax-advantaged savings accounts for health care expenses, such as health savings accounts (HSAs), flexible spending accounts (FSAs), and medical savings accounts (MSAs). In particular, the legislation repeals the ACA’s prohibition on using funds from these accounts to purchase OTC medications. It also repeals the $2,500 annual cap on contributions toward these types of accounts imposed by the ACA. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) is an original cosponsor on the bill. ###
03.28.2019	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and others are urging U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue to provide Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) assistance as quickly as possible. The senators also requested that USDA delegate Livestock LIP approval authority to Farm Service Agency (FSA) County Committees because they are the most familiar with local weather, disaster events, and the livestock management practices of area farmers and ranchers. The letter follows a series of severe weather events in the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes regions that have had devastating livestock losses due to the extreme weather. The senators also urged Perdue to prioritize LIP regulatory updates as USDA implements the 2018 farm bill, revisit and broaden weather-related LIP eligibility criteria, and adhere to the management protocol changes outlined in the 2018 farm bill. “Cold is much deadlier to livestock, especially newborn or young livestock, at +10 degrees Fahrenheit when accompanied by high winds and/or excessive moisture than simply -10 degrees Fahrenheit,” the senators wrote. “In a blizzard, death can occur to a newborn calf in less than an hour when unintentionally exposed to these conditions. A combination of weather factors occurring simultaneously often kills and harms livestock over a short period of time compared to a single adverse weather event, and to place a finite time eligibility requirement such as ‘duration for at least three consecutive days,’ is not realistic and can result in livestock producers being determined ineligible and denied LIP assistance by FSA for legitimate livestock death losses. In addition, severe storm events that occur at critical times, such as calving and lambing cycles, are much more devastating than when livestock are older and much more able to withstand weather-related stresses.” Full text of the letter is below: The Honorable Sonny Perdue U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Perdue: We write this letter on behalf of the livestock producers in our states who, due to a combination of weather events including severe cold, unseasonal heavy rains, blizzards, and record-breaking flooding, have experienced livestock death losses and may lose more young livestock due to weather-related sickness. Preceded by days and weeks of record cold from a polar vortex, the recent “bomb cyclone” weather system, which was described by the National Weather Service as “historic” and “incredible,” brought record high winds, rain, and snow to a large portion of the United States. At the peak of calving and lambing seasons, livestock producers in the Rocky Mountains, the Plains, the Mississippi Valley, and the Great Lakes regions have had devastating livestock losses due to these extreme weather events. Due to these considerable and mounting livestock death losses, we write to bring your attention to the pressing need for Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) assistance. The economic assistance LIP provides for producers with livestock losses that are due to natural disasters and weather-related causes is now desperately needed. As was done in 2018 (see attached letter), we urge you to delegate LIP approval authority to Farm Service Agency (FSA) County Committees, who are elected by their peers and are the most familiar with local weather, disaster events, and the livestock management practices of area farmers and ranchers, instead of relying on headquarters personnel. This would help ensure that LIP assistance is provided to producers that need it as soon as possible. In addition, we request that you prioritize LIP regulatory updates as you work on the implementation of the 2018 farm bill. While the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 made very few modifications to the existing livestock disaster programs statute, it did make one important change regarding management protocols concerning weather-related death losses and death losses due to weather-related diseases. The Congressional intent in Sec. 1501(b) is for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to grant Farm Service Agency (FSA) County Committees the authority to approve credible LIP claims that can be verified by a licensed veterinarian. As the regulations governing LIP are drafted, we request that you revisit LIP eligibility requirements regarding weather criteria and refrain from placing singular arbitrary timelines and other definitive factors on weather eligibility considerations for LIP. For example, 7 CFR § 1416.302 states “Winter storm means a storm that is severe as to cause fatal injury to livestock and lasts in duration for at least three consecutive days and is accompanied by high winds, freezing rain or sleet, heavy snowfall, and extremely cold temperatures.” We agree that winter storms and other weather events that kill and harm livestock often consist of a combination of factors such as wind chill, snowfall, or rainfall amounts. However, singular factors such as length of weather event, extreme temperatures, and excessive rainfall or snowfall amounts can cause excessive livestock death losses as well. Cold is much deadlier to livestock, especially newborn or young livestock, at +10 degrees Fahrenheit when accompanied by high winds and/or excessive moisture than simply -10 degrees Fahrenheit. In a blizzard, death can occur to a newborn calf in less than an hour when unintentionally exposed to these conditions. A combination of weather factors occurring simultaneously often kills and harms livestock over a short period of time compared to a single adverse weather event, and to place a finite time eligibility requirement such as “duration for at least three consecutive days,” is not realistic and can result in livestock producers being determined ineligible and denied LIP assistance by FSA for legitimate livestock death losses. In addition, severe storm events that occur at critical times, such as calving and lambing cycles, are much more devastating than when livestock are older and much more able to withstand weather-related stresses. The aforementioned LIP weather eligibility examples demonstrate the importance of having authority delegated to FSA County Committees to approve LIP losses because they are local and have the most knowledge about the weather events and management practices of the livestock producers in their areas. We sincerely appreciate all that you and your staff have done and are doing for our farmers and ranchers. We make these requests regarding LIP implementation so our livestock producers, as intended by Congress, will be eligible for and receive the death loss assistance they desperately need for the devastating livestock losses that began earlier this year. Please do not hesitate to contact any of us or members of our staff if we can be of assistance in any way. Thank you for your timely attention to our requests. Sincerely, ###
03.27.2019	WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) has introduced a bill to prohibit federal law enforcement officers from claiming consent as a defense when accused of sexually assaulting someone in their custody or while exercising their authority under color of law. She’s joined in this effort by Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Cory Booker (D-NJ). Some states have enacted legislation closing a loophole that allows law enforcement officers to claim that a sexual encounter with someone in their custody was consensual to avoid assault charges. While there is a federal law that prohibits sexual contact between corrections employees and those in federal custody, no such prohibition exists for other federal law enforcement officers. “It should be considered a criminal offense for any federal law enforcement officer, agent, or employee to engage in sexual misconduct while on duty. Current law prohibits the use of the consent defense for federal correctional employees, but does not hold accountable all persons involved in the administration of federal criminal law. That’s unacceptable. Our bipartisan bill will close this loophole and encourage states to enact similar legislation that protects those in custody,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “It isn’t consent when one person is exercising the power of law enforcement and the other is handcuffed, in custody, in the back of a cop car,” said Senator Blumenthal. “This legislation would close a dangerous legal loophole that allows law enforcement officers to claim consent as a defense against accusations of sexual assault and rape.” “Federal agents and law enforcement officers hold positions of public trust and are expected to serve and protect,” said Senator Booker. “Those who abuse their power and this mission by sexually assaulting individuals in their custody shouldn’t be shielded from accountability because of a loophole in federal law. Our bipartisan bill closes this egregious loophole at the federal level and encourages states to do the same to ensure that no law enforcement officer can evade sexual assault charges from a detainee by claiming consent.” Background: The Closing Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act would: Make it a criminal offense for a federal law enforcement officer to engage in a sexual act with anyone in his or her custody or while exercising their authority under color of law, regardless of consent. This would include federal agents, probation officers, judges, and prosecutors. Require the Department of Justice and the Government Accountability Office to provide Congress with yearly data on documented instances of sexual misconduct by law enforcement officers while exercising their authority under color of law. Provide additional Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) grant funding to states that pass laws that: Make it a criminal offense for state and local law enforcement officers to engage in sexual acts with individuals while in his or her custody or while exercising their authority under color of law, regardless of consent; and Submit information on the number of complaints made to law enforcement agencies regarding an officer engaging in a sexual act with any individual that meets the above description to the U.S. Attorney General on an annual basis, who will then report to Congress a report on the findings. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by U.S. Representative Jackie Speier (D-CA). The legislation is endorsed by the National Task Force to end Sexual and Domestic Violence (NTF), the National Association to End Sexual Violence (NAESV), the Rape, Abuse, Incest National Network (RAINN), and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA). “Providing security and safety for those in our custody is a fundamental responsibility of all law enforcement officers. It is abhorrent that anybody would sexually assault a prisoner and then use the victim’s consent as an excuse. This abuse of power is unconscionable and should not be tolerated. FLEOA applauds Senators Blumenthal, Booker and Ernst for introducing this bill,” said the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association (FLEOA) President Nathan R. Catura. FLEOA represents approximately 27,000 federal officers and agents in 65 federal agencies. “The National Alliance to End Sexual Violence is in strong support of the ‘Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole’ Act, introduced by Senators Blumenthal, Booker, and Ernst. Anyone interacting with law enforcement should expect to be treated with respect, not to become victims of an abuse of power. We thank Senator Blumenthal, Senator Booker, and Senator Ernst and hope that states follow this great example to keep communities safer,” said Terri Poore of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. “NDAA is encouraged that Congress is taking common sense steps to address a gap in federal law. The legislation closes a dangerous loophole, thus ensuring federal law enforcement officers are prohibited from engaging in sexual acts with individuals who are in custody. We look forward to continuing our work alongside lawmakers and their staff to improve federal law in a way that promotes the integrity of law enforcement and emphasizes safety in our communities,” said Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett and President of the National District Attorneys Association. ###
03.26.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded Senate appropriators for expanding disaster aid eligibility so that Iowans impacted by the recent devastating flooding can now benefit from a $13.45 billion federal relief package that is advancing in the Senate. “In my years as a member of the Iowa National Guard, I was on the front lines of several major floods—including the 2008 Cedar Rapids flood and the 2011 Missouri River flood. Tragically, the flooding and destruction I witnessed last week back home is as bad as I’ve ever seen,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “I am committed to doing everything in my power to make sure Iowans have every bit of help they need. The expanded eligibility for assistance from this disaster relief package is welcome news and will get more desperately needed aid to Iowans.” The emergency supplemental appropriations legislation, H.R. 268, provides $13.45 billion in supplemental funding for states and territories ravaged by tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, volcanoes, typhoons, and other such events in 2017 and 2018. Today, it was announced that congressional appropriators in the Senate have amended the disaster legislation to expand eligibility in certain accounts for states in the Midwest, like Iowa, and the South that have experienced catastrophic flooding and tornadoes in 2019.
03.26.2019	WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a lifelong resident of Southwest Iowa and a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa National Guard, spoke on the Senate floor today on the devastating flooding in the state. Last week, Senator Ernst visited many constituents in affected communities and met with local, state, and federal officials and emergency personnel in Pottawattamie, Mills and Fremont Counties to review the damage from the flooding. On the Senate floor, Senator Ernst said, “In the near term, our focus is on recovery efforts, and I will do everything in my power to make sure Iowans have every bit of help they need. We need to get our farms and small businesses back up and running as soon as possible, so Iowans can do what they do best: work hard and take care of their families.” Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s speech. Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks as prepared for delivery. “I rise today to speak about the flooding that has devastated wide swaths of the Midwest in recent weeks. “A harsh winter combined with unseasonably warm weather and heavy rains created conditions that overwhelmed much of our flood mitigation infrastructure up and down the Missouri River and its tributaries. “In Iowa alone, the flooding has caused an estimated $1.6 billion in damages—thousands of homes have been damaged or destroyed, and nearly 250 miles of levees will need to be repaired or rebuilt. “Thousands of acres of farmland have been impacted, with losses to the ag sector in excess of $200 million. Fremont County alone has lost $7 million worth of grain. “I spent much of last week on the ground in Iowa visiting hard hit areas of the state and meeting with local, state, and federal officials. “In my years as a member of the Iowa National Guard, I was on the front lines of several major floods—including the 2008 Cedar Rapids flood and the 2011 Missouri River flood. I can tell you that the flooding and destruction I witnessed last week was as bad as I’ve ever seen. “The devastation is simply incomprehensible, with the most severe damage concentrated in Iowa’s westernmost counties. “I’ve spent most of my life in Southwest Iowa, so this hits particularly close to home for me. When I toured affected communities last week, the folks I met with weren’t just Iowans and constituents, many of them were friends. In this part of the state I’m just as likely to be called “Joni” as “Senator Ernst.” It was heartbreaking to see what they’ve been through. “It will take a lot of hard work and determination to get our communities back on their feet, but Iowans are resilient people and I know they are up to the task. “Since the first signs of trouble over a week ago, our state and local emergency response teams have been working together around the clock to help keep their fellow Iowans safe. “I credit Governor Reynolds and her office for quickly gathering damage assessments from around the state in order to make a strong case to the President that a federal disaster declaration was warranted. “I also want to thank President Trump for recognizing the gravity of the situation on the ground in Iowa, and swiftly approving the request. “Nearly 60 of Iowa’s counties will now have access to much-needed federal assistance. “In the near term, our focus is on recovery efforts, and I will do everything in my power to make sure Iowans have every bit of help they need. “We need to get our farms and small businesses back up and running as soon as possible, so Iowans can do what they do best: work hard and take care of their families. “But as we move forward, I intend to review Army Corps of Engineers policies and closely examine how they were applied throughout this flood event. “It’s important that we study and learn from events like this, so we can try to prevent them from happening again in the future.” ###
03.25.2019	WASHINGTON—In the spirit of March Madness, Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and her fellow lawmakers, Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), James Lankford (R-OK), and Rand Paul (R-KY), are participating in the Tournament of Government Waste. The organization Pursuit will be hosting the tournament that will feature four entries from each of the senators. The public will get to vote on which entry will take home the title of Waste of the Year. First round of voting is open NOW and closes tomorrow at 12:00am EST. There will be four rounds until the champion is crowned next Monday, April 1. You can find all of the entries here and vote here. As part of her effort to hold Washington accountable and to “make ‘em squeal,” Senator Ernst has chosen four entries for this year’s Tournament of Government Waste. Team Ernst’s line-up is below: 1. The Cat’s Meow Cats that are pampered with treats and classical music every day are less likely to poop outside of the litter box or cough up hairballs. This pawsh study may sound hissterical, except the research was supported with National Institute of Health (NIH) grants totaling $1.3 million, which is likely to make taxpayers furious. 2. Game Glitches Classic Nintendo video games like Super Mario Bros. are hard, unless players cheat by taking advantage of programming glitches, according to a study funded, in part, by the National Science Foundation (NSF). Super Mario World, for example, can be beaten in less than three minutes “by performing a sequence of seemingly arbitrary and nonsensical actions, which fools the game into thinking the game is won.” Supported with funding from three NSF grants totaling more than $1.6 million, these researchers are literally playing games with taxpayer money. 3. Gambling Pigeons Pigeons were trained to press, or rather peck, their luck on a bird-sized slot machine, featuring flashing lights just like in a real casino and pellets as the payout, as part of a study to test the birds’ “affinity for gambling.” Supported with grants from NIH totaling nearly $1.3 million, the poker-faced pigeons were found to behave like “pathological gamblers.” With the national debt now surmounting $22 trillion, it is not worth going for broke on more of these bird-brain studies. 4. Elvis Impersonator An Elvis sighting reported in Oklahoma inspired a study on false perception funded by a $90,000 NIH grant with additional support from the National Science Foundation. The Elvis impersonator in question was a sour cream and onion flavored potato chip. While the researchers concluded, “the potato chip really does look like Elvis!,” taxpayers may look at both the potato chip and the study with suspicious minds. ###
03.24.2019	WASHINGTON—Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement with regard to Attorney General Barr’s primary conclusions from the Mueller investigation: “After this nearly two-year investigation, the Special Counsel has concluded that there was no collusion or coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election. It’s time to move on and focus on preventing any more involvement or influence by Russia in our elections, which is vital to protecting our democracy and our nation’s security. “I strongly believe that as much of the report that can be made public should be—barring any national security threat. Taxpayers have paid millions for this investigation; it’s only right that they see its findings.”
03.22.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to President Trump in support of Governor Kim Reynolds’ (R-IA) request for a federal disaster declaration for the State of Iowa. Nearly 60 counties in Iowa have experienced significant damage resulting from severe storms, heavy rain, and flooding that began on March 12, 2019. In the letter, Senator Ernst wrote, “I’ve spent much of this week on the ground in Iowa surveying the damage and meeting with constituents and local, state, and federal officials. The devastation caused by the flooding is incomprehensible. I respectfully ask you to approve Governor Reynolds’ request as expeditiously as possible.” The full letter is below, and can be found here. March 22, 2019 The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has requested a major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa as a result of severe storms and flooding that have significantly impacted nearly 60 counties since March 12, 2019, causing an estimated $1.6 billion in damages. By requesting a major disaster declaration, Governor Reynolds has determined that the State of Iowa and local governments cannot effectively respond to this flooding incident without supplementary assistance from the federal government. I’ve spent much of this week on the ground in Iowa surveying the damage and meeting with constituents and local, state, and federal officials. The devastation caused by the flooding is incomprehensible. I respectfully ask you to approve Governor Reynolds’ request as expeditiously as possible. I thank you for your consideration of this request, and will continue working with you and your administration to ensure Iowans receive the assistance they need. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator ###
03.20.2019	Senator Ernst meeting with emergency management personnel from Pottawattamie and Mills Counties on Tuesday evening. COUNCIL BLUFFS, IA —Yesterday, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) met with local and state officials and emergency management personnel from Pottawattamie and Mills Counties to review the damage from this week’s devastating flooding and to lend her support to all the communities and families impacted. “So many of my fellow Iowans have been impacted by these devastating floods, but as we saw in 2011, Iowans are resilient and are quick to lend a helping hand in time of need. “My staff and I are in constant communication with local, state, and federal officials during this time. I strongly encourage anyone who is in an affected area to listen to the emergency management personnel on the ground, reach out for help, and stay safe,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Iowans can find a list of disaster recovery resources here. In addition, the Iowa Department of Transportation has compiled a list of road closures throughout the state. Iowans can find that information here or by calling 511. ###
03.18.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is working to protect young girls in Iowa, and across the country, from being exploited through a loophole in our immigration laws allowing for child marriages. Following a report released by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) on how current U.S. immigration laws encourage child marriages, Senator Ernst joined Senators Ron Johnson (R-WI), chairman of HSGAC, and Tom Cotton (R-AR) in introducing legislation that would prohibit spousal and fiancé(e) immigration benefits if one of the applying parties is under the age of 18. “Child marriage is a serious problem which puts young girls, in particular, at risk,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “With more than 8,600 such marriages granted over a ten year period, we must address this massive loophole in our immigration system with common sense solutions, and that’s exactly what our legislation does: require both parties be 18 years-old in order to obtain spousal immigration benefits.” "A visa to enter the United States is a privilege, and this straightforward reform will help close a loophole that can lead to the abuse and exploitation of children,” said Senator Johnson. “I hope my colleagues will join me to advance this commonsense legislation.” “Child marriage, almost always between a male adult and a female minor, can rob young girls of their education, personal development, and physical and mental health,” said Senator Cotton. “Unfortunately, U.S. law currently grants immigration benefits to individuals seeking adult-minor unions. Our immigration laws shouldn’t be used to encourage child marriage, and our bill would put an end to this exploitative practice.” U.S. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (WI-05) is the author of the companion version of the bill in the House of Representatives. “The committee’s eye-opening report shows the gruesome reality that people manipulate our immigration system to enter into child marriages,” said Representative Sensenbrenner. “I’m proud to lead the effort in the House to stop the exploitation of children through our immigration laws and am grateful to Senator Johnson for his work uncovering this disturbing information.” Key findings from the staff report that spurred this legislation include: U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) approved immigration petitions for 8,686 spouses and fiancé(e)s in marriages involving minors from FY2007 to FY2017. In 95 percent of the cases, the younger person was a girl. USCIS awarded petitions to people with significant age differences, including a 71-year-old U.S. citizen’s petition for a 17-year-old spouse from Guatemala and a 14-year-old’s petition for a 48-year-old spouse from Jamaica. USCIS approved 149 petitions involving a minor with an adult spouse or fiancé(e) who was more than 40 years old. USCIS awarded green cards to 4,749 minors in the United States on spousal or fiancé(e) visas, allowing them to adjust status to become lawful permanent residents from FY2007 to FY2017. Presently, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), a U.S. child may petition for a visa for a spouse or fiancé(e) living in another country, and a U.S. adult may petition for a visa for a minor spouse or fiancé(e) living abroad. The committee’s recent report found that from 2007 to 2017 there were more than 5,500 cases of adults petitioning for a spouse or fiancé(e) visa for a minor, and nearly 3,000 cases of a minor petitioning for a spouse or fiancé(e) visa for an adult. The bill text can be found here. ###

03.16.2019	Paid Parental Leave: CRADLE Act On Tuesday, Senator Joni Ernst announced a new proposal aimed at giving parents in Iowa and across America the option of taking paid parental leave. Millions of working moms and dads in our country face huge hurdles in taking time off to spend with their newborns, which is why Senator Ernst is putting forward a proposal to address the issue. Click here or on the image above to watch a recap of the Senator’s press conference. As part of her plan, parents would be given the ability to receive one, two, or three months of paid leave by having the option to postpone activating their Social Security benefits for two, four, or six months. Parents can choose whether or not they’d like to opt in. Senator Ernst’s proposal is a path forward for a budget neutral paid leave option that gives parents greater flexibility without imposing a new government mandate. The senator penned an op-ed in The Washington Post, entitled “How to provide paid family leave without further indebting the nation.” In addition to The Post, CBS This Morning, Radio Iowa, Washington Examiner, and a number of other outlets across the country covered the paid parental leave proposal. To watch Senator Ernst’s full CBS This Morning interview, click here or on the image above. A Government Study on Elvis Presley-Shaped Potato Chip… This week is “Sunshine Week” –an annual celebration of the importance of transparency and citizens’ access to information about our government. In keeping with the spirit of the week, Senator Ernst introduced new legislation called the Cost Openness and Spending Transparency Act (COST Act) which requires every project supported with federal funds to include a price tag with its cost that is transparent and easily available for taxpayers. While these cost disclosures are supposed to be required already for some agencies, an investigative report released this week from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that many federal departments aren’t even monitoring or enforcing compliance at all. A review by Senator Ernst’s office identified several government projects that didn’t follow the law. Among them: a $90,000 NIH study focused on a sour cream and onion flavored potato chip resembling Elvis Presley. The Washington Times covered this “salty” story. E15 Year-Round Proposal Moving Forward This week the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) issued their proposed rule to allow the sale of E15 year-round and to improve renewable identification number (RIN) transparency. Senator Ernst issued a statement in part saying, “I’m thrilled to see the proposed rule for the year-round sale of E15 move forward. As the nation’s leader in ethanol production, Iowa farmers and producers are depending on this rule being in place by the summer driving season, to fulfill President Trump’s promise.” Communicating Priorities ###

03.14.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), who has worked to root out Washington’s wasteful spending and to “Make ‘em Squeal,” just introduced legislation requiring every project supported with federal funds to include a price tag that is easily available for taxpayers. The Senator’s bill, called the Cost Openness and Spending Transparency (COST) Act comes on the heels of a watchdog investigation that was released today. The report found federal agencies are not abiding by current law requiring the full disclosure of costs for their taxpayer-funded projects. The legislation would give the administration the authority to withhold funding for a portion of a grant from recipients of government funding that are ignoring the law and not properly posting costs. Ernst is joined by Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and Rand Paul (R-KY) in introducing the COST Act. “Taxpayers in Iowa, and across the nation, have a right to know exactly how their hard-earned dollars are being spent. While current law requires projects funded by some federal agencies to disclose the costs, my office has found that these agencies are largely ignoring the law and failing to comply,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “That’s unacceptable, and it’s exactly why I’ve teamed up with lawmakers to ensure that every federal agency discloses the exact costs of any project. The COST Act guarantees hardworking Iowans have easy access to see how their tax dollars are being spent, and gives them the ability to decide for themselves whether or not the price is right.” “After just releasing the fourth volume of Federal Fumbles, which highlighted several questionable federal grants, American taxpayers deserve to know that Congress and federal agencies are providing proper oversight of the grant process to help protect against waste, fraud, and abuse,” said Senator Lankford. “The Stevens Amendment was intended to provide transparency of federal project costs. The Stevens Amendment requires Labor, HHS, and Ed grantees to include the total cost of the project and amount of federal funds used when they publish materials for public consumption. However, thanks to GAO we now know these federal agencies have not monitored grantee compliance with the Amendment. The COST Act is a commonsense, good governance bill that ensures the Stevens Amendment is properly followed by all federal agencies. I appreciate Senator Ernst’s continued work to help fight federal waste and protect taxpayers.” “If we want to stop wasteful government spending, we must ensure the American people can more easily find out exactly how it uses their money. Through the COST Act, and other transparency efforts such as my Waste Report, we can empower Americans to better hold government accountable for its choices,” said Senator Paul. Background: The COST Act requires every project supported with federal funds to include a price tag with its cost to taxpayers. Under this legislation, both the dollar amount and the percentage of the overall budget for any project, program, or activity would be disclosed in all public documents. To guarantee compliance, the COST Act gives authority to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to withhold a portion of a grant from a recipient that does not disclose the costs. Current law requires most projects funded with taxpayer money provided by the Departments of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education to disclose costs. Senator Ernst recently requested a review by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) to look into why recipients of federal funds are not disclosing the cost of their projects, as required. In the report released today, the GAO found these federal agencies aren’t monitoring or enforcing compliance and do not believe that it is their responsibility to do so. Senator Ernst's office found a number of questionable National Institutes of Health (NIH)-supported studies that do not provide the cost to taxpayers as required by law. Below is a short summary of some of these non-compliant studies. You can find a more detailed summary HERE. The Cat’s Meow: Ten different cat studies supported by NIH grants totaling $1.3 million found that cats pampered with treats and classical music every day are less likely to poop outside of the litter box or cough up hairballs. Senator Ernst awarded NIH her January Squeal Award for these “catty” studies. The Batman Effect: According to research funded from a $405,000 NIH grant and additional support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), researchers found that when encouraged to put on a cape and pretend to be Batman, kids were less distracted from doing a boring assignment. Elvis Sightings: A study on false perception concluded that a sour cream and onion flavored potato chip resembling Elvis Presley was funded by a $90,000 NIH grant with additional support from the NSF. Picky Pigeons: Supported by a $256,000 NIH grant, researchers found that sunflower seeds are the most pleasing food to the palates of pigeons, followed by popcorn and peanuts, according to a taste test of seven different foods involving eight pigeons. Gambling Pigeons: A slot-machine of sorts was developed for pigeons, with flashing lights just like in a real casino and pellets as the payout, as part of a study to test the birds’ “affinity for gambling.” Supported with grants from NIH totaling nearly $1.3 million, researchers trained the birds how to gamble. The poker-faced pigeons were found to behave like “pathological gamblers.” The Catwalk: Returning to a fur-miliar subject, NIH funded another study to determine “how do cats manage to walk so graciously on top of narrow fences or windowsills high above the ground while apparently exerting little effort?” With support from a $178,000 NIH grant, ten cats were literally put on a catwalk and another was trained to strut on a treadmill. The purr-pose for spending tax dollars on this study may leave many Americans purr-plexed. Click HERE to see the official GAO report. Click HERE for a summary of S. 807, the COST Act. ###
03.14.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a town hall meeting in Dallas County as part of her 99 County Tour for 2019. Senator Ernst looks forward to hearing from constituents in the area about the issues most important to them. This town hall meeting is open to the public. Thursday, March 21, 2019 Dallas County Town Hall Meeting 8:00 AM Adel DeSoto Minburn High School Auditorium 801 Nile Kinnick Drive South Adel, IA 50003 NOTE: If you are a credentialed member of the media and plan to attend the event, please RSVP to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov. # # #
03.12.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following statement with regard to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed rule to allow the sale of E15 year-round and to improve renewable identification number (RIN) transparency. “I’m thrilled to see the proposed rule for the year-round sale of E15 move forward. As the nation’s leader in ethanol production, Iowa farmers and producers are depending on this rule being in place by the summer driving season, to fulfill President Trump’s promise. “When it comes to RINs, I will be reviewing what the Agency has proposed. It’s imperative that EPA creates more transparency in the RIN market and, in addition, takes a long, hard look at how they grant small refinery waivers. I hope we’re past the days of former Administrator Pruitt’s gross mishandling of the RFS and waiver process.” Background: Senator Ernst has worked tirelessly with the Trump Administration, specifically EPA, to remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round by expanding the Reid vapor pressure (RVP) waiver to fuel blends up to 15 percent ethanol throughout the year. A few examples are below: Submitted comments to EPA Acting Administrator Wheeler on the proposed volume requirements under the RFS and urged the Agency to follow through on the President’s directive to remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round. Questioned a Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) nominee about the importance of biofuels for rural communities and the need to uphold the RFS. Pushed for year-round waiver for E15 in a letter to then EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Penned a letter to EPA asking then Administrator Pruitt to examine the burdensome regulation that makes it more difficult to sell gasoline with ethanol content above ten percent, such as E15 year-round. Awarded the 2018 Fueling Growth Award by Growth Energy for her work to advance renewable fuels like ethanol and to increase consumer choice at the pump. Pushed for legislation that would remove unnecessary regulatory hurdles that keep E15 and higher blends of ethanol from being sold year-round across the country. Questioned USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue on the agency’s efforts to protect the RFS and the 88,000 farms across Iowa and 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry. Demanded commitments from Administrator Wheeler during his confirmation hearing in meeting the summer driving season deadline. ###
03.12.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mike Lee (R-UT) are putting forward a paid parental leave plan that is budget neutral and flexible for parents who choose to opt in. Their legislation, the CRADLE Act, would allow parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid leave by giving them the option to postpone activating their Social Security benefits. The plan provides every new mom and dad the flexibility to stay home with their newborns during the critical first months after birth, without creating another massive mandated government program or adding to our ever-growing deficit. “It’s past time we modernize our family leave policies to reflect the evolving needs of today’s workforce and to reduce the barriers that pose challenges for parents balancing family and work. Millions of working moms and dads in Iowa, and across the country, face huge hurdles in taking time off to spend with their newborns. As a mother, I understand how important it is for children to bond with their parents in the first precious few weeks after birth,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Our proposal is a path forward for a budget neutral paid leave option that gives parents greater flexibility without imposing a new government entitlement or mandate.” “Families are the bedrock of our society. If young people can’t afford to marry and start a family then the American dream literally has no future,” Senator Mike Lee said. “We need to make sure our existing social insurance programs are doing all they can to work for working families. The CRADLE Act will give working families the flexibility they need to make sure Social Security is working for them.” Background: The Child Rearing and Development Leave Empowerment (CRADLE) Act would allow both natural and adoptive parents to receive one, two, or three months of paid leave benefits by giving them the option to delay activating their Social Security benefits for two, four, or six months. Expectant parents would simply fill out a form to notify the Social Security Administration (SSA) of their intention to take paid leave before an expected birth or adoption. Then, after the birth or adoption, the SSA would begin payments two weeks after parents applied for their baby’s social security number. To be eligible, parents must meet certain work requirements, and benefit levels would be determined by using the same formula used for determining Social Security Disability benefits. The formula is progressive, meaning that monthly benefits would be more generous to those least likely to have the luxury of an employer-sponsored benefit. Click HERE for a full summary of the bill.

03.12.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities (ETC), held the inaugural subcommittee hearing of the 116th Congress. The hearing focused on artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives within the Department of Defense (DoD). In her opening remarks, Chairman Ernst stated: “Our adversaries understand the critical importance of AI. Last year, the Chinese government released a strategy detailing its plan to take the lead in AI by 2030. Less than two months later, Vladimir Putin publicly announced Russia's intent to pursue AI technologies, stating, ‘Whoever becomes the leader in this field will rule the world.’ Both of these countries are investing heavily in military applications of AI to achieve a warfighting advantage. “The United States is also investing heavily in AI applications. Over the last year, the Department has initiated several important efforts to accelerate the adoption of AI, including: the establishment of the Joint AI Center; the development of a DARPA ‘AI Next’ campaign; and, the release of the DoD AI Strategy. These efforts demonstrate the extent of the AI transformation already underway within the Department of Defense and the priority that is being placed on growing these capabilities. “However, with these important efforts comes the challenge of coordinating hundreds of disparate AI efforts across multiple offices and organizations. I look to our witnesses to help the committee better understand how AI can be adopted more rapidly, how coordinating the initiatives already underway within Department can help us harness this powerful technology, and where we must invest in future research to ensure we maintain a long term advantage.” Click here or on the image above to watch Chairman Ernst’s opening remarks. Today’s subcommittee hearing witnesses included: Mr. Michael Brown, Director of Defense Innovation Unit (DIU); Dr. Peter Highnam, Deputy Director, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); and, Lt. Gen. John N.T. “Jack” Shanahan, Director, Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, DoD CIO. The hearing also included a discussion on recent organizational changes, including the establishment of the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JAIC) and the roles of university, defense labs, and industry in AI research and development strategy, coordination among DARPA, JAIC, and the Services, and workforce needs to support the AI Strategy. Chairman Ernst questioned the witnesses on the need for the U.S. to have a competitive advantage when it comes to AI, specifically asking if there needs to be particular investments in order to ensure this. In addition, Ernst asked about any challenges the United States is facing in attracting candidates and if our country is making use of the Reserve community when it comes to support for DoD AI activities.

03.09.2019	Green New Steal With a $93 trillion price tag, Senator Joni Ernst gave a Squeal Award to the so-called “Green New Deal.” Ernst, and nearly a dozen other senators, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to call out the radical government takeover that would cost every American family $65,000 annually. That’s more than most households in Iowa make in a year! Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks on the Green New Deal. Cutting Red-Tape for Small Businesses Senator Ernst teamed up with her Democratic colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) to eliminate a discrepancy in small business contracting that puts women and service-disabled veterans at a disadvantage. The Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act would ensure small businesses, regardless of the program they are certified under, have access to the same threshold of benefits in sole-source contracting. It would also give the Small Business Administration (SBA) more authority to identify and deter fraud and abuse in the contracting process. Helping Veterans in Crisis In addition to helping our service-disabled veterans who own small businesses, Senator Joni Ernst has introduce two bipartisan bills aimed at assisting Iowa veterans, and those across the country, who are in crisis. The Green Alert Act of 2019 would assist states in implementing a “Green Alert” system to locate veterans who are missing—similar to the AMBER Alert system for missing children and the Silver Alert system for missing elderly. Her second bill, Honoring American Veterans in Extreme Need (HAVEN) Act, would remove a disparity in bankruptcy law that puts the well-being of veterans and their families who rely on disability benefits at risk.

03.07.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, has introduced two bipartisan bills to help Iowa veterans, and those across the country, who are in crisis. The first bill would assist states in implementing a “Green Alert” system to locate veterans who are missing—similar to the AMBER Alert system for missing children and the Silver Alert system for missing elderly. The second bill would remove a disparity in bankruptcy law that puts the well-being of veterans and their families who rely on disability benefits at risk. “Unfortunately, due to the stress and trauma associated with their time in uniform, many veterans experience hardships when they return home,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “As a combat veteran myself, I know the challenges our servicemembers can face and understand the incredible responsibility we, as lawmakers, have to ensure they get the support they are promised. Teaming-up with Democrats and Republicans, I’ve introduced bipartisan legislation to help our veterans in crisis.” Senator Ernst, an outspoken leader in pushing the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to fix problems in its suicide prevention outreach program, sent a letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie in December 2018 calling for answers to the department’s failures in addressing veteran suicide. This week, the Senator applauded the Trump Administration for addressing this urgent crisis by creating a new task force for preventing veteran suicide. Background: 1. The Green Alert Act of 2019, introduced with Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH), would establish a federal commission to develop best practices and provide technical assistance to states to implement Green Alert systems that would be used to alert law enforcement and the public in the event of a veteran’s disappearance. The bill would establish a commission comprised of members from the Departments of Justice, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and Health and Human Services, as well as state and local officials and veterans. The Commission would work to develop best practices and provide technical assistance to states to establish a Green Alert system. Additionally, after two years of enactment, the Commission would provide a report to Congress on recommendations for any appropriate additional actions to support states as they develop Green Alert systems. 2. The Honoring American Veterans in Extreme Need (HAVEN) Act, introduced with Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and John Cornyn (R-TX), would protect the economic security and well-being of veterans and their families who rely on disability benefits and may be experiencing financial hardship. Under current bankruptcy law, disability benefits paid by the VA and Department of Defense (DoD) are included in the calculation of a debtor’s monthly disposable income, increasing the portion of the debtor’s income that is subject to the reach of creditors. By contrast, bankruptcy law explicitly exempts Social Security disability benefits from this calculation. To remove this unequal treatment among various disability benefits, the HAVEN Act would exclude VA and DoD disability payments made to veterans or their dependent survivors from the monthly income calculation used for bankruptcy means tests. This bill complements recent congressional efforts to combat servicemember and veteran mental health issues, addiction, suicide, poverty, and homelessness – all of which are exacerbated by financial hardship. The HAVEN Act is supported by Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), the American Legion, Society of Military Widows, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Veterans for Common Sense, U.S Army Warrant Officers Association, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Association of the United States Army, the Association of the United States Navy, and the American College of Bankruptcy. ###
03.06.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), the first two women combat veterans to serve in the Senate, are working to eliminate a discrepancy that puts women and service-disabled veterans who own small businesses at a disadvantage when competing for contracts. “Iowa is the proud home to more than 200 women-owned small businesses and more than 50 small businesses owned by service-disabled veterans. Starting and operating a small business is an exciting and rewarding experience, but it comes with risk,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Women- and veteran-owned small businesses should be afforded the same contracting opportunities as businesses certified under other programs. This bipartisan measure is a sensible and simple fix to help ensure all of Iowa’s small business owners get a fair shot to compete and succeed.” “If we want to help main street, we need to make it easier for small businesses to expand their business and hire new workers,” Duckworth said. “This bipartisan legislation will help do that by leveling the playing field for small businesses that are owned by women and Veterans with service-connected disabilities and are competing for federal contracts. By doing so, this bill will expand opportunities for these small businesses, and encourage economic growth.” The Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act would ensure small businesses, regardless of the program they are certified under, have access to the same threshold of benefits in sole-source contracting. It would also give the Small Business Administration (SBA) more authority to identify and deter fraud and abuse in the contracting process. Background: Current law, under the Small Business Act, is designed to allow certified small businesses to be awarded sole-source contracts, as a way of ensuring they are not forced out of opportunities by larger multiple-award contracts that are generally more difficult for them to earn. While small businesses that are certified under the 8(a) Business Development and HUBZone programs can receive sole-source contracts of up to $7 million for manufacturing, Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) are limited to only $6.5 million. In addition, WOSBs and SDVOSBs currently rely on self-certification for eligibility and not front-end certification from the SBA, like small businesses in the 8(a) Business Development and HUBZone programs. A recent SBA Inspector General report on WOSBs found that the majority of contracts sampled under the self-certification process failed to comply with federal rules. This means fraud and abuse could exist in the contracting process. The Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act would eliminate the discrepancy between sole-source programs, setting the contract manufacturing threshold at $7 million for businesses certified under each program. The bill would also strengthen oversight on the eligibility process to deter fraud by authorizing a new eligibility determination check by the SBA. ###
03.06.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), who came to Washington with the promise to Iowans of rooting out wasteful government spending and “Making ‘em Squeal,” is awarding her monthly Squeal Award to the so-called Green New Deal, which is estimated to cost $93 trillion over 10 years. Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s speech. In her remarks on the Senate Floor, Senator Ernst outlined exactly how unrealistic and outrageously costly this proposal is—pointing out that the $93 trillion price tag would: be over $10 trillion larger than the combined GDP of every nation on Earth in 2017 exceed, by $10 trillion, the entire recorded spending of the United States government since the Constitution went into effect in 1789 Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks as prepared for delivery. “I rise today to join at least a dozen of my colleagues to speak in opposition to the so-called, Green New Deal. “Merriam-Webster defines a deal as “a bargain” or “an agreement for mutual advantage.” By its name you’d think that Americans are going to derive some benefit from it, but this couldn’t be further from the truth. “The truth is this proposal is a raw deal for America, especially our rural communities. “As many of you know, every month I give out a Squeal Award, which draws attention to outrageous examples of wasteful and reckless spending of taxpayer money. With a $93 trillion price tag—roughly $10 trillion more than the entire recorded spending of the US government since 1789—this month’s squeal award goes to the Green New Deal. “Just think about that number…93 trillion dollars. To fund this radical government takeover, every American family would have to pay $65,000 annually, more than most households in Iowa make in a year. “The ideas presented in the Green New Deal used to only garner support from the furthest fringes of the political left. Concepts like rebuilding every building in the country, outlawing fossil fuels, and guaranteed jobs, would never have made their way into mainstream discourse just a few years ago. Now, our Democratic colleagues are trying to make them mainstream. “In fact, 100 of the 282 Democratic members of the House and Senate have signed on in support of this plan. This is the creep of socialism into America. “If you work in a part of the energy industry that’s fallen out of favor, your job has no place in the economy envisioned by the Democrats. The Green New Deal states that one of its goals is to meet “100 percent of the power demand in the U.S. through clean, renewable, and zero emission energy sources.” “Don’t get me wrong. Increasing our reliance on renewables is a good goal and one I support, but we have to be realistic about our current energy capabilities and needs. “Private sector investment and innovation, coupled with government support and incentives, has contributed to significant advances in renewable energy. “I’m proud to say that my home state of Iowa is one of the nation’s leaders in renewable energy, with wind providing nearly 40% of our electricity, more than any other state. With more wind coming on line, coal went from producing 76% of our electricity in 2008 to 45% of it in 2017. “And I would note that this transition towards renewables happened largely as a result of state policies and community engagement, not heavy handed government regulation. “Another one of the “goals” I find most interesting in this unrealistic proposal is that of providing “guaranteed jobs.” “What may be lost on the Democrats is that the best guaranteed jobs program is not housed in a government building, it’s a strong economy like the one we’re living in now, one not bogged down by job-killing regulations and punitive tax rates. “If you want proof of this, look no further than Iowa. Our unemployment sits at a low 2.4% and we have over 63,000 job openings and about 40,000 folks looking for work. That’s more job openings than people looking for jobs! “Lastly, I would point out that as part of this proposal, our Democratic colleagues want to ‘overhaul transportation systems in the United States.’ “If you live in places like New York City you can walk to the grocery store, but in rural communities like my hometown of Red Oak, Iowa, it can take 30 minutes to drive to the nearest Walmart. “Everything from combines, to fertilizers and trucks to transport grains to market, would be impacted. The Green New Deal is unrealistic, and would unfairly impact rural communities across the country. “So, folks, we have a clear choice – we can continue to support rural America and pro-growth economic policies that boost our economy and create jobs, or we can allow socialist fantasies like the Green New Deal to creep in, take hold, bankrupt our nation, and devastate our rural communities.” ###
03.02.2019	Make ‘Em Squeal Senator Ernst made a promise to Iowans to cut wasteful spending, hold Washington accountable, and to “Make ‘em Squeal.” As part of these efforts, each month Senator Ernst gives out a “squeal award.” This month’s award goes to the infamous California bullet train project that is now 13 years behind schedule and $44 billion over its original price tag. In conjunction with her squeal award, Ernst introduced the Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act, which would require an annual report to taxpayers listing every government-funded project that is $1 billion or more over budget, or five years or more behind schedule. Radio Iowa and The Federalist wrote pieces on the boondoggle bill. In keeping with her pledge to Iowa taxpayers, the senator also introduced a bipartisan bill with Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) to put limits on taxpayer-funded benefits for former presidents, including expenses for their travel, personal staff, office space, and communications after they leave office. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2019 will not only put a cap on the monetary allowances allotted to former presidents, but also reduce the allowances based on the amount of income they make after leaving office. Senator Ernst joined CNBC’s Squawk Box to discuss all of these issues, and more. Click here or on the image below to watch. Council Bluffs Update More good news for the Council Bluffs community! On Tuesday, the House of Representatives followed the Senate’s lead in passing the bipartisan 2019 Lands Package that included Senators Ernst’s and Grassley’s language to allow for an underutilized trails center—the Western Historic Trails Center (WHTC) in Council Bluffs—to be repurposed for public use or potentially developed. The bill now heads to the president’s desk for signature. Trade with China In Iowa, one in five jobs is tied directly to international trade. To ensure farmers and manufacturers have the opportunity to compete in the global market, Senator Ernst feels strongly that we must address China’s unfair trade practices and get a good deal for all Americans. She discussed this topic during a media availability this week. Communicating Priorities ###
02.27.2019	WASHINGTON – Building on her efforts to cut wasteful spending, protect taxpayer dollars, and hold Washington accountable, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is reintroducing legislation with Senator Maggie Hassan (D-NH) that puts limits on taxpayer-funded benefits for former U.S. presidents, including expenses for their travel, personal staff, office space, and communications after they leave office. “The national debt recently exceeded $22 trillion, thanks in part to taxpayer-funded presidential perks. It’s time we cap the monetary allowances allotted to former presidents and reign in Washington’s out-of-control spending,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Former presidents rake in millions from book deals, speaking engagements, and more; there’s no need for taxpayers to subsidize unlimited perks to the tune of millions of dollars. My common sense, bipartisan bill will reform the system that provides former presidents with benefits, while saving hard-working Iowans, and taxpayers across the nation, millions.” “Given that former Presidents often have a variety of opportunities to earn money after their time in office, this bipartisan legislation would reduce a former President’s annual monetary allowance if he or she earns more than $400,000 in a year,” Senator Hassan said. “This legislation would not affect funding for a former President’s security and is a common-sense step to ensure that taxpayer dollars are well-spent. I am glad to work with Senator Joni Ernst on this issue, and I am committed to working with members of both parties to find innovative ways to maintain fiscal responsibility within the federal government.” Since 1958, when Congress passed the Former Presidents Act, taxpayers have been providing former presidents with generous pensions, as well as monetary allowances to cover expenses like travel, staff, communications, and office space. The bill was supposed to help “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and assist with the costs associated with having held the office of president. However, times have changed, and former presidents make millions from lucrative post-presidency opportunities. The Former Presidents Act is in major need of modernization. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2019 would establish a cap on former presidents’ monetary allowances, which are currently unlimited, and fund resources like office space, staff salaries, cell phone bills, and more. If enacted, this legislation will apply to future former presidents—current ex-presidents will continue receiving benefits via the existing system. Senator Ernst first introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Presidential Allowance Modernization Act in 2015. After passing both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with unanimous support, it was ultimately vetoed by President Barack Obama. Senator Ernst introduced the bill again last Congress. It passed the House and committee in the Senate with unanimous report, but did not become law. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2019 would: Provide former presidents with a pension of $200,000 and a monetary allowance of $200,000 a year. Reduce a former president’s annual monetary allowance dollar-for-dollar by each dollar of income a former president earns in excess of $400,000. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. ###
02.26.2019	WASHINGTON—Iowans sent Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) to Washington to hold the government accountable and to “make ‘em squeal.” As part of that effort, Senator Ernst is introducing a bill that will require full public disclosure of the cost and timeline of mammoth government-funded projects costing billions more than promised and behind schedule, such as California’s infamous failed high-speed rail project. “Iowans deserve to know how their hard-earned money is being spent. There are far too many taxpayer-funded projects that are billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “The Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act will require the disclosure of the cost and timeline of these federal projects, bringing overdue accountability and transparency to the process, which will allow us to identify problems before they become a bottomless pit of taxpayer dollars.” The Billion Dollar Boondoggle Act requires the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to submit to Congress an annual report listing every government-funded project that is $1 billion or more over budget or five years or more behind schedule. For each project, the report would provide: a brief description, including the purpose, location, the year in which it was begun, the Federal share of the total cost, and the contractors and grant recipients; an explanation of any change to the original scope of the project, including adding to or narrowing of the initial requirements; the original expected and current expected completion date; the original and current cost estimate; an explanation for a delay in completion or increase in the original cost estimate; and, the amount of and rationale for any award, incentive fee, or other type of bonus awarded for the project. Identifying projects that are significantly over budget or behind schedule allows Congress and federal agencies to better manage taxpayer dollars and prevent bigger boondoggles. Often these projects are riddled with avoidable complications, like workers being paid for not working, contractor kickbacks exchanged for preferential treatment, or retaliation against whistleblowers for bringing problems to light. Not every project that misses a deadline or costs more than anticipated is a boondoggle. Those symptoms, however, can be warning signs of larger troubles, such as questionable expenditures, mismanagement, incompetency, and even corruption. While there are many boondoggles in our federal government, here are five projects that Senator Ernst would like to highlight: 1. High-Speed Train on Fast Track to Nowhere Project: A 520-mile high-speed “bullet” train rail line connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles is 13 years behind schedule and $44 billion over its original price tag. Original Cost Estimate: $33.6 billion in 2008 Current Cost Estimate: $77.3 billion Project Began: Construction began in October 2013 Original Completion Date: 2020 Current Completion Date: 2033 Federal Spending: $3.5 billion to date. 2. Subway Tunnel Keeps Digging a Deeper Hole Project: The East Side Access project to connect New York City’s subway between Long Island and Grand Central Station is nine years behind schedule and almost $5 billion over budget. Original Cost Estimate: $4.3 billion in 1999 and revised upward to $6.3 billion in 2006 Current Cost Estimate: $11.1 billion Project Began: 2007 Original Completion Date: 2009 in 1999 and revised to December 2013 in 2006 Current Completion Date: December 2022 Federal Spending: $2.7 billion 3. Census Bureau Can’t Count Project: The 2020 national population count conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau is more than $3 billion over budget and will be the most expensive in U.S. history and government auditors are warning that the current cost estimate is not reliable. Original Cost Estimate: $12.3 billion in 2015 Current Cost Estimate: $15.6 billion Project Began: 2012 Original Completion Date: September 2023 Current Completion Date: September 2023 Federal Spending: $15.6 billion 4. Waste Clean Up Is A Total Mess Project: The cleanup of radioactive waste at a site in Washington state where plutonium was produced during the Cold War began decades ago, but has not treated any waste as of yet. As a result, the project is 25 years behind schedule and may end up costing $100 billion more than originally estimated. Original Cost Estimate: $4.3 billion to complete the waste treatment plant and $47- $50 billion to complete the cleanup Current Cost Estimate: $16.8 billion for the waste treatment plant, and $141 billion to complete the cleanup. Project Began: 1989 (The project has been repeatedly canceled and restarted.) Original Completion Date: The plant was required to begin operating in 2011 with the tank waste treatment to be completed by 2028. Current Completion Date: Operation of the plant has been delayed until the end of 2036 with most of the cleanup finished by 2060 and the entire project completed before the end of 2090. Federal Spending: More than $19 billion has already been spent as of 2015 and the project is costing $2.5 billion a year, but the agency says more than $4 billion is needed per year for the duration of the mission to meet the “scheduled milestones.” 5. Grounded Moon Rocket Costs Soar Project: The rocket intended to return astronauts to the moon has been grounded by repeated delays while its costs are soaring billions of dollars over budget due to the “poor performance” of a contractor that continues to be paid big bonuses by NASA. Original Cost Estimate: $6.2 billion in 2012 Current Cost Estimate: At least $8.9 billion projected in 2018. Project Began: 2012 Original Completion Date: June 2017 for delivery of the first stage; the first unmanned mission was planned for December 2017 with the first crewed mission was projected to launch in mid-2021. Current Completion Date: December 2019 for delivery of the first stage; the first unmanned mission has been rescheduled for mid-2020 and the first crewed mission is now planned for mid-2022. Federal Spending: $5.3 billion as of August 2018. ###
02.25.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a longtime and outspoken pro-life advocate, today voted in support of legislation to protect the lives of children born-alive after a failed abortion. While Senator Ernst voted in support of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, ultimately Democrats forced it to fail. “Today, we had the opportunity to categorically reject infanticide. I am heartbroken to find that, instead, partisanship prevailed. We face a moral crisis when the United States Senate, the world’s greatest deliberative body, refuses to acknowledge the repugnancy and savagery of infanticide. We must do better. I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that our laws respect the human dignity of all persons, especially our most vulnerable babies and children,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Background: Senator Ernst is an original cosponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill requires health care practitioners to provide the same degree of care to a baby who survives an abortion as they would any child born naturally premature at the same age. While legislation from 2002, known as the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (BAIPA), recognizes and defines any child who has survived a botched abortion as a full person under the law, these protections are only partially effective without concrete federal enforcement measures. Specifically, BAIPA lacks concrete ways to hold abortionists accountable for killing, harvesting organs, or denying medical care to infants born alive. Additionally, reports show that some abortion providers still do not regard babies born alive during abortions as persons and therefore do not provide them with the types of care that would be provided to infants who are spontaneously born prematurely. ###
02.22.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and member of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, concluded a congressional delegation visit to Ukraine, one of America’s closest strategic partners in the region. This visit comes at the same time the country is recognizing its five-year anniversary of their successful Revolution of Dignity. During her time there, Ernst met with senior Ukrainian military and government leaders, including the Minister of Defense. As the subcommittee chairman, Senator Ernst has oversight over numerous commands and agencies within the Department of Defense, including U.S. Special Operations Command. While in Ukraine, Ernst visited a special operations training center in Berdychiv, where the U.S. and Ukrainian special operations forces are working closely together to improve recruitment, retention, training, and overall military tactics. In addition, she was able to see and hear firsthand the threats Ukrainian forces are facing on the Eastern front while spending time at the Joint Forces Operations Headquarters in Kramatorsk. Senator Ernst also met with members of civil society organizations and the parliament to discuss governance, combating corruption, and ongoing reforms such as decentralization. “Being on the ground in Ukraine allowed me to directly convey to our ally that the United States will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with free, democratic governments. While Russia continues its aggression towards its neighbors and their sovereignty, the United States is here to promote good governance and provide greater military partnership with our ally, specifically through the development of Ukrainian special operations forces,” said Senator Joni Ernst.

The protests were against the decision by the government of then-President Viktor Yanukovych to suspend signing the Ukraine-European Union (EU) Association Agreement, and to instead pursue closer ties with the Russian Federation. The Maidan protesters stood against the corruption of the Yanukovych regime and wanted to make it clear that they favored integration with the EU. Throughout the three month long protest, the Ukrainian police force persistently engaged in acts of violence against the protesters, including the burning down of the Trade Union Building in Kyiv, which had been used as a makeshift headquarters for the protestors. At the height of the violence, Yanukovych’ police forces opened fire on a crowd of protesters, resulting in the deaths of more than a hundred civilians, who are now remembered in Ukraine as the “Heavenly Hundred.” On February 21, 2014, President Yanukovych fled to Russia and Ukraine’s special police force was dissolved. In response to Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity, the Russian Federation launched military aggression against Ukraine, illegally seizing the Crimean Peninsula and large swaths of the country’s east in an effort to stifle its pro-democracy development. Senator Ernst recently joined Senate Ukraine Caucus Co-Chair, Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), on a bipartisan resolution commemorating the five-year anniversary of the conclusion of the Revolution of Dignity. The resolution recognizes the bravery of the Ukrainian people and those killed during the revolution; congratulates Ukraine on the progress the country has made since 2014; condemns Russian efforts to destabilize Ukraine; and, encourages further reforms to align with Euro-Atlantic norms.
02.21.2019	WASHINGTON – Just weeks into the new session of Congress, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is fighting to lower drug costs for Iowans, having already introduced and cosponsored four different bills each aiming to crack down on high prices. “The high costs of prescription drugs and health care affect all Iowans, but especially our elderly and families on a fixed income. Again, in this Congress, I’m working with lawmakers across the aisle on legislation to increase competition in the marketplace, to drive down prescription drug prices, and to close loopholes that allow bad actors to take advantage of the system,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Brad Anderson, AARP Iowa State Director, said, “We are pleased that Senator Ernst has made reducing high drug prices a top priority. We particularly applaud the Senator’s co-sponsorship of two bills supported by AARP, the CREATES Act and the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act— both bills would improve competition by getting lower priced drugs to market faster, thus lowering prescription drug prices, and saving taxpayers money.” In the last seven weeks, since the start of the new Congress, Senator Ernst helped introduce and is a cosponsor of the following bills targeting high drug costs: The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act — This bipartisan legislation would limit anticompetitive pay-for-delay deals that prevent or delay the introduction of affordable generic versions of branded pharmaceuticals into the marketplace. The Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act — This bipartisan and bicameral bill would prevent brand-name pharmaceutical and biologic companies from stifling competition by blocking the entry of lower-cost generic drugs into the market. It is supported by the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), the American College of Physicians, FreedomWorks, and the Coalition for Affordable Prescription Drugs, among others. The Right Rebate Act of 2019 — In light of the pharmaceutical company Mylan misclassifying the EpiPen as a generic drug and paying lower rebates through Medicaid than the company should have, this bipartisan bill closes this loophole by giving the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to reclassify drugs, impose penalties on bad actors, and demand payment from companies that underpay. The Preserving Access to Cost Effective Drugs (PACED) Act — This bill would remove a loophole in the patenting process which allows manipulators to pay Indian tribes to take “ownership” of their patents, thereby allowing the tribes to claim sovereign immunity and avoid review in the case of a dispute. The PACED Act restores the power of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, federal courts, and the International Trade Commission to review patents regardless of sovereign immunity claims made as part of questionable transactions. ###
02.16.2019	Paid Family Leave On Wednesday, Senator Ernst had the opportunity to sit down with Ivanka Trump and a number of her colleagues to discuss a path forward on paid family leave legislation. Senator Ernst and Ivanka Trump discussing paid family leave. As a mom, Senator Ernst understands the importance of ensuring our policies reflect the evolving needs of our workforce; and that’s why she’s pushing for a budget-neutral, child-focused paid leave program, rather than a new entitlement or mandate. Ernst sat down with the Washington Examiner and joined WMAL Radio to discuss her proposal. Council Bluffs and Cedar Rapids This week, the Senate passed legislation that included Senators Ernst’s and Grassley’s language to allow for an underutilized trails center-- the Western Historic Trails Center (WHTC) in Council Bluffs—to be repurposed for public use or potentially developed. The senators worked closely with Council Bluffs community leaders and state officials to include their language into the 2019 Lands Package (S.47). Securing the critical funding for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project was one of Senator Ernst’s top priorities in 2018. Now that the project has received federal funding, her focus has shifted to oversight—making sure it stays on track. To monitor the project’s progress, Senator Ernst included language in America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 requiring the Army Corps of Engineers to submit a report within 90 days of its enactment detailing the project’s status. After that 90-day mark passed recently, she sent a letter to the Army Corps requesting an update as soon as possible. KWWL-TV covered the developments, explaining how Ernst has played a key role throughout this project. #HomeState Since Valentine’s Day was this past week, Senator Ernst organized an event on the floor where a number of her Senate GOP colleagues spoke about what they love about their states and initiatives they’re working on to support communities back home. Senator Ernst highlighted a number of things that she loves about Iowa, including the spirit of working families, rural communities, small businesses, and veterans. Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s floor speech. Border Security The Senate passed compromise legislation this week to provide funding for border security and to complete the appropriations process to fund the government through fiscal year 2019. Senator Ernst supported the measure and released a statement in part saying this legislation is a key starting point that will allow the president to move forward on desperately needed border security efforts, including to curb illegal immigration and the flow of drugs into Iowa and the rest of the country. This week, Senator Ernst spoke about the importance of getting her bill, Sarah’s Law, finalized and signed into law. The legislation will require federal law enforcement to detain any illegal immigrant who kills or seriously injures another person. In addition, she joined Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ben Sasse (R-NE) on a letter to William Barr, the new U.S. attorney general, urging him to prioritize review of Sarah’s Law. Communicating Priorities ###
02.14.2019	WASHINGTON — Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on the Senate’s passage of compromise legislation to provide funding for border security and complete the appropriations process to fund the government through fiscal year 2019: “Negotiating in good faith and working towards a compromise means both sides get things they want and things they don’t. There’s a lot of good in this compromise legislation, but there are also parts that fall short,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “We successfully fought back against radical and unreasonable positions from our Democratic colleagues—like abolishing ICE and borders all together—in order to reach a deal that provides critical funds for border security and gives the president the tools to curb illegal immigration and the flow of drugs into Iowa and the rest of the country. “However, I’m frustrated this bill fails to extend the Violence Against Women Act, legislation I have long called on to be modernized and reauthorized. It also contains a provision that could hamstring federal law enforcement efforts and open the door for illegal criminals to evade deportation using vulnerable children. While it sets up the critical framework for a border wall, I’m concerned there are provisions tucked into this compromise bill that will actually establish roadblocks for wall construction in areas where it is needed. “At the end of the day, this legislation is a key starting point that will allow the president to move forward on desperately needed border security efforts.”
02.14.2019	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Ben Sasse (R-NE)—Midland senators serving on the Senate Judiciary Committee—are urging William Barr, the next Attorney General of the United States, to prioritize his review of Sarah’s Law. “Sarah Root’s story is one of tragedy and injustice. While we’re working to pass Sarah’s Law in Congress, it’s imperative we have the commitment of the Department of Justice and our next Attorney General to make implementation of this commonsense legislation a top priority. We have an obligation to the Root family, and to the American people, to ensure that no person falls victim to this injustice again,” said Senator Joni Ernst, member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. “Local and federal authorities must cooperate to ensure no victim and family is deprived of justice. Sarah Root had her whole life in front of her, but it was taken away by someone who shouldn’t have even been in the country. Sadly, that tragedy is not an isolated case. Many innocent Americans have been seriously injured, and in some cases killed, because of the actions of criminal illegal aliens. Once he’s confirmed, I expect Attorney General Barr to work with us to finally enact Sarah’s Law and ensure justice is served for her family and any family like hers,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. “Sarah’s Law is a common-sense proposal and the next Attorney General ought to commit to working with us to make this a top priority for the Department of Justice. This important legislation needs to go to the President for his signature. We’re working hard to make sure that happens here in the Senate — and I hope General Barr makes a review of the legislation a priority in his first 60 days. Sarah’s family deserves justice, and criminals like Edwin Mejia should be in jail, not on the run,” said Senator Ben Sasse, member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary. Sarah's Law would require federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. Edwin Mejia was living illegally in the United States and killed Sarah Root in a drunk driving incident. Mejia then fled and remains on ICE's most wanted list. This week during the Senate leadership stakeout, Senator Ernst, vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, spoke about the importance of codifying Sarah’s Law. Watch here. Text of the letter can be found here or below: Dear General Barr, Congratulations on your recent nomination to serve again as Attorney General of the United States. As members of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, we write to you today to follow up on a line of questioning by Senator Ernst during your recent confirmation hearing. As Senator Ernst related, in January of 2016 an illegal alien, Edwin Mejia, was street racing while intoxicated in Omaha, Nebraska when he violently crashed his pickup truck into the back of another vehicle. Inside the other vehicle was a young woman named Sarah Root. Ms. Root, a Council Bluffs, Iowa native who had graduated college just hours before, was rushed to the hospital, where she died from her injuries. In light of Mejia’s past encounters with law enforcement that included a skipped court hearing and a subsequent warrant issued for his arrest, Omaha police requested that the Obama administration detain Mejia, but it refused to do so, allowing Mejia to disappear. He remains at large, and Ms. Root’s grieving family and friends have been deprived of justice. To address this case and other such tragedies that have befallen the Midlands and the rest of the country, we introduced Sarah’s Law, which amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the detention of illegal aliens who have been charged in the United States with a crime that resulted in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. In your hearing, you described our legislation as “a very commonsensical bill and something that [you] would certainly be inclined to support.” We find your statement greatly encouraging. We write to you today to spell out steps we urge you take in regards to this critical issue: If confirmed, please prioritize review of this legislation by the appropriate components of the Department to be completed within the first 60 days of your time in office; Should the Department under your leadership determine that it can support this legislation, please commit to working with us to enact it into law; and Please commit to conduct a review within 180 days of Department policies to determine steps that the Department has taken and could take in the future to effectuate the goals of Sarah’s Law and Executive Order 13768. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact our staff at (202) 224-4224, (202) 224-3254, and (202) 224-3744. Sincerely, Ben Sasse Joni Ernst Chuck Grassley ###
02.13.2019	Senator Ernst and Ivanka Trump discussing paid family leave. WASHINGTON—U.S Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Mike Lee (R-UT) released the following statements today after meeting with Senior Adviser to the President Ivanka Trump to create a path forward on enacting paid family leave legislation. Staff from the offices of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Senator Todd Young (R-IN) also attended the meeting. “Today we had a productive conversation about paid family leave policy focused on the bipartisan desire to find a solution that supports American workers and families. We are seeking to build consensus around policy that can garner enough votes to be passed into law and thank the Senators on both sides of the aisle who are working together towards that goal,” said Ivanka Trump, Advisor to the President. “As a mother, I understand firsthand how important it is for our policies to reflect the evolving needs of our workforce and to reduce the barriers imposed on parents who are balancing family and work,” said Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Small Business Committee. “In his State of the Union address, the president made it clear that paid family leave is a priority for his administration. That’s why I am all the more encouraged to continue working with my colleagues, and the administration, to create a path forward for a voluntary, budget-neutral, child-focused paid leave program rather than impose a new entitlement or mandate.” “There is widespread interest in helping moms and dads have the financial flexibility they need to raise children. The key will be crafting a policy that is fiscally sustainable, targeted, and doesn’t bury taxpayers in even more red ink,” said Dr. Cassidy, chairman of the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Fiscal Responsibility and Economic Growth. “We’re going to work hard in my committee to craft a good, bipartisan solution that empowers families to succeed. This is pro-family, pro-baby, pro-mama.” “I commend the White House for continuing to show leadership and making it clear that paid family leave is a priority for this Administration,” said Senator Rubio, chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. “I am honored to participate in the ongoing, substantive discussion about how best to implement this policy and committed to seeing this effort through. Too many new parents, especially those with low incomes, take on new debt or fall onto welfare programs just to pay for their basic living costs after having a child. It is time to take action.” “Families are the foundation of our country, yet our tax and entitlement systems penalize parents and growing families. If young people can’t afford to form a household and have children then the very future of our nation is in jeopardy,” said Senator Lee. “It was great to hear President Trump mention this issue in the State of the Union and the continued interest of Senior Adviser Ivanka Trump is a fantastic sign. I look forward to working with the WH and my Senate colleagues to identify ways we can reform federal government policies to help solve this problem.” “Most parents today work outside the home and childcare costs are a burden for many families. The first months of life are a critical period for newborns. We should take a look at any policy that might help in their development,” said Senator Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “It’s been several decades since we’ve updated federal family leave laws. I look forward to working with my colleagues in both parties to explore new ideas.” ###
02.09.2019	#SOTU On Tuesday night, President Trump delivered the annual State of the Union address. Senator Ernst, as vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, helped to escort the president onto the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. Following the speech, Ernst issued a statement, calling the president’s message one of “unity, cooperation, and prosperity.” She also recorded a video message focused on the tremendous economic success we’ve seen under Republican pro-growth policies. A number of local media outlets covered the senator’s take on the address, including WHO Radio, Omaha World-Herald, and KIOW. To watch the full video message, please click here or on the image above. Jobs, Jobs, Jobs The January Jobs Report showed 304,000 new jobs were added last month. It is yet another example of the success of Republican pro-growth policies—like tax reform and regulatory reform—that are getting people back to work in Iowa and across the country. On Wednesday, Senator Ernst led an event on the Senate floor focused on our booming economy. She was joined by five other senators, including chairman of the Senate Republican Conference Senator John Barrasso (R-WY) and Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-SD). Click here or on the image above to watch the full speech. Reforming National Security Tariffs Iowa farmers, manufacturers, and business owners have been hit hard by Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs. This week, Senator Ernst introduced bipartisan legislation that would reform the process for an administration to issue tariffs on the basis of national security threats. The Trade Security Act would require the Department of Defense, not the Department of Commerce, to evaluate the national security basis behind a proposed tariff under Section 232. The bill also gives Congress more oversight of this process. The Washington Examiner covered this bipartisan bill. Protecting Life and the Second Amendment In recent weeks, we’ve seen the ugly truth about the far-reaching grasp of the abortion industry and its radicalized agenda. Senator Ernst strongly believes this assault on life cannot stand. On Monday evening, she spoke on the Senate floor in support of Senator Ben Sasse’s (R-NE) Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Click here or on the image above to watch the full speech. Senator Ernst joined Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and a number of her colleagues in reintroducing legislation that will ensure federal funding is not used by states, localities, or any other organizations to maintain gun registries. The Gun-owner Registration Information Protection Act (GRIP Act) will make sure that gun owners in Iowa and across the country are not unlawfully tracked by any government. Communicating Priorities In case you missed it, CNN did a story on this “bipartisan spin class!” ###
02.07.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and nine of their colleagues in reintroducing the Gun-owner Registration Information Protection Act (GRIP Act) to ensure federal funding cannot be used by states, localities, or any other organization to maintain gun registries. The GRIP Act would clarify existing law that prohibits the use of any federal funding by states or local entities for the storage or “listing” of sensitive, personal information related to the legal ownership or possession of firearms. The bill has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association (NRA). “Law-abiding citizens should be free to exercise their Second Amendment rights without overly intrusive government interference. This bill will help to ensure that gun owners are not unlawfully tracked by any government,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Federal law prohibits the government from tracking law-abiding gun owners and that ban extends to using federal dollars for such ill-advised activities on the local or state level. This legislation clarifies that point,” said Senator Hyde-Smith. “It would ensure local gun control schemes don’t wrongfully exploit federal resources to track people who own or purchase firearms legally.” Original cosponsors of the legislation include Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Mike Lee (R-UT), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tim Scott (R-SC), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Roger Wicker (R-MS). “The Second Amendment is one of the most important freedoms we have as Americans,” said Senator Blackburn. “Our government should value the privacy of our civilians, and this bill ensures that federal funds cannot be used to encroach on a gun owner’s right to privacy.” “The right to keep and bear arms, ultimately the right to self-defense, is a fundamental right that should not be stolen by any level of government. If enacted, the GRIP Act would ensure that no federal dollars are used for the creation of state-run gun owner databases. I will always fight any infringement on the Second Amendment every step of the way, and that includes fighting for the privacy rights of law-abiding gun owners,” said Senator Cramer. “I have been and will continue to be a defender of the right of the American people to keep and bear arms,” said Senator Enzi. “This legislation helps prevent the personal information of law-abiding citizens from being used to infringe on their rights.” “As an avid hunter and lifelong firearm owner, protecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners is a priority of mine,” said Senator Rounds. “In some states and cities around the country, local governments are seeking to limit the Second Amendment right to bear arms. The GRIP Act will clarify laws already on the books designed to make sure no federal funds are spent by states and local units of government to establish or maintain firearm databases.” Under current law, the federal government may not store information acquired during the firearms background process. This legislation clarifies that this prohibition extends to the use of federal funds by states, localities, and other groups for the creation or maintenance of a full or partial gun registries. The measure does not include any limitations related to state recordkeeping for permitting, law enforcement-issued firearms, or lost or stolen firearms. A one-page summary of the GRIP Act is available here. A copy of the legislation is available here. ###
02.07.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced legislation to reform the process for an administration to issue tariffs on the basis of national security threats to better align with the original intent of the law and to increase congressional oversight of the process. “When bad actors abuse and take advantage of our trade policies in a way that threatens our national security, the president needs to have tools available—such as tariffs under Section 232—to hold them accountable. However, the Department of Defense, not the Department of Commerce, should evaluate and verify the national security basis for these tariffs. Increasing congressional oversight will help the president make decisions that support American jobs while protecting our national security,” said Senator Joni Ernst. The Trade Security Act would require the Department of Defense, rather than the Department of Commerce, to justify the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. A bipartisan group of senators, including Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Doug Jones (D-AL), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and Todd Young (R-IN), introduced the bill. Representatives Ron Kind (D-WI), Jackie Walorski (R-IN), Terri Sewell (D-AL) and Darrin LaHood (R-IL) introduced a companion version in the U.S. House of Representatives. “We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable, but we must do so in a way that protects American jobs and strengthens the U.S. economy,” said Senator Portman. “I have repeatedly expressed concerns about the misuse of the Section 232 statute to impose tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, and its impact on Ohio jobs and the U.S. economy as a whole. This bipartisan legislation preserves this trade tool while properly placing the national security designation at the Department of Defense and expanding the role of Congress in the process. As a former USTR, I know that misusing our trade tools not only hurts our exports and our manufacturers, but also our consumers, so I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.” “When it comes to trade, our first priority should always be to protect American jobs and grow our own economy,” said Senator Jones. “I agree we need to hold bad actors like China accountable for their actions, but we cannot do so at the expense of hard-working Americans who are the backbone of important industries like auto manufacturing. If a trading partner is suspected of threatening our national security, we need our top defense experts to investigate that claim and make an informed recommendation. I am proud to join Senators Portman and Ernst to once again introduce this legislation to reform the Section 232 process and help the Administration make better-informed decisions that support American jobs.” “No state would be more damaged by these tariffs than Tennessee — in many ways we are the nation's number one auto state,” said Senator Alexander. “Tariffs are the constitutional responsibility of Congress, and this bipartisan bill would increase Congressional oversight over these tariffs.” “Congress gave the president Section 232 authority to quickly respond to national security threats, not to pick political fights with our trading partners,” Senator Feinstein said. “In California, farmers and manufacturers are being unnecessarily hurt by this multi-front trade war. It’s time for Congress to reassert its constitutional authority to regulate trade and reform Section 232 to ensure it’s used only for true national security purposes.” “While I support modernizing our trade agreements, agriculture producers in Nebraska and across the country continue to face uncertainty as a result of tariffs,” said Senator Fischer. “Agriculture is the backbone of Nebraska’s economy, and we must make sure our producers and manufacturers have the market access they need to prosper. That’s why I’m pleased to join my colleagues on this bipartisan legislation that maintains the administration’s ability to use trade tools to protect national security while restoring Congress’s oversight role. This legislation will ensure that the Department of Defense justifies the national security need for any tariffs imposed under Section 232.” “This bipartisan bill will help prevent unnecessary trade wars that hurt Arizona's economy,” said Senator Sinema. “Indiana is the most manufacturing intensive state in the country, and Hoosiers continually express their desire for Congress to exert its Constitutional role in the 232 process, which has the ability to detrimentally impact Hoosier farmers and manufacturers if wrongly utilized. I’ll continue working with Senator Portman and the Finance Committee to ensure Hoosiers have a seat at the table for future trade discussions,” said Senator Young. Background: The Trade Security Act reforms the Section 232 statute to ensure that (1) any Section 232 actions are based on a national security determination by the Department of Defense; and (2) Congress has a larger role to play in 232 actions. Specifically, this bill will: Bifurcate the existing Section 232 process into an investigation phase, led by the Department of Defense, and a remedy phase, led by the Department of Commerce. Splitting these responsibilities, while guaranteeing consultation between the two departments at all stages of the process, plays to each department’s strengths to ensure that the statute is used for genuine national security purposes. Require the Department of Defense – instead of the Department of Commerce – to justify the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232 and make the determination about the national security threat posed by imports of certain products. If a threat is found, the Department of Defense would send its report to the president. In the event that the president desires to take action based on the finding of a national security threat, the president would then direct the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the U.S. Trade Representative, to develop recommendations for how to respond to the threat. After receiving the recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce, the president would decide whether to take action. Increase the role of Congress in the Section 232 process by expanding the process whereby Congress can disapprove of a Section 232 action by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. Currently, Section 232 contains a disapproval resolution process limited only to the disapproval of actions on oil imports, which was inserted into Section 232 in 1980 by Congress in response to concerns about the misuse of the statute. This bill would expand the use of that disapproval resolution process to all types of products. The reformed disapproval process will only apply to future Section 232 actions. Require consultation with Congress throughout the Section 232 process. ###
02.05.2019	WASHINGTON – Following President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement: “Tonight we heard a message of unity, cooperation, and prosperity from President Trump. He called on us to come together for the greater good to find bipartisan solutions and to continue to work together to grow our economy. “Under Republican pro-growth policies like tax reform and regulatory reform, the economy is booming, jobs are growing, and wages are rising. Nowhere is the strength of the economy more evident than in the great state of Iowa, where the 2.4 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in the nation. “Through strong trade deals, like the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, we are seeing greater access to new markets for our farmers and producers, which is so important to Iowa’s economy. While Iowans also support the administration taking a tough line with China, it’s critically important that we find resolution on the tariffs soon. “Yet again, tonight, the president was clear on the need for border security and lasting immigration reform. Securing our southern border is a key part of a system to discourage illegal immigration and curb human trafficking and the transport of illegal weapons and drugs into Iowa and across America. While the administration included major parts of my bill, Sarah’s Law, via executive order, I hope Congress will work together to take up this commonsense bill and codify it into law. “In keeping with the bipartisan message heard tonight, I’m hopeful we can build on the bipartisan successes of last Congress for hardworking Iowans, and all Americans.” Downloadable media of Senator Ernst’s statement: State of the Union audio message ###
02.04.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators David Perdue (R-GA), Angus King (I-ME) and 23 bipartisan members of the U.S. Senate Armed Services and Budget Committees in sending a letter to Acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan requesting his commitment to the timely completion of a full audit of the Department of Defense in FY2019. “We commend Mr. Norquist and the Department of Defense for finishing its first-ever complete audit required by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. This was a critical first step to bring greater transparency and accountability to the Pentagon; however, more progress must be made to reach a clean opinion,” wrote the senators. “It is important to note that the benefits of the audit go beyond good stewardship of the taxpayer dollar,” continued the senators. “Not only will it improve business operations, but also it can enhance national security by ensuring accuracy in inventory and by identifying vulnerabilities in our cybersecurity. Ultimately, because only 5 of the 24 individual audits conducted received a passing grade, it is imperative that subsequent, annual audits continue as planned to properly measure progress.” Senators Ernst, Perdue and King were joined by Senators Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Tim Kaine (D-VA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Doug Jones (D-AL), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Gary Peters (D-MI), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

02.02.2019	Honoring Sarah Root On January 31, 2016, the day of her college graduation, Iowa native Sarah Root was struck and killed by an illegal immigrant who was drag racing and driving extremely drunk. After he was charged, he was not detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and instead posted bail and disappeared. Now, three years later, Sarah’s killer remains at large. In honor of Sarah, this week, Senator Ernst took to the Senate floor to reintroduce her bill—Sarah’s Law—which would require federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants who are criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. Ernst spoke to Fox News and Radio Iowa about the importance of getting Sarah’s Law passed. Click here or on the image above to watch the whole interview. Putting Iowa First Earlier this year, the Department of Education announced an initiative that would address the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion in schools across the country. Senator Ernst has been engaged with the Department of Education on this issue, following allegations of misreporting of seclusion and restraint within the Cedar Rapids Community School District. KCRG covered Senator Ernst’s reaction to the new initiative, which you can watch here. On Wednesday mornings when the Senate is session, you can find Senator Joni Ernst talking with Iowans over a warm cup of coffee. This week, Ernst held her inaugural Capitol Grounds constituent coffee for 2019! Check out some photos below. One of Senator Ernst’s favorite traditions is doing a ruck march in Washington, D.C. with fellow veterans and members of her staff to honor our nation’s veterans and servicemembers. Despite the cold weather—though not as cold as back home in Iowa—Senator Ernst pushed full-speed ahead on Wednesday night. Ensuring the Enduring Defeat of ISIS and Al Qaeda The Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act, which was again considered by the Senate this week, is a bill that will help reinforce our alliances in the Middle East and keep pressure on the Assad regime in Syria. Ernst cosponsored an amendment to the bill that urges the Administration to ensure conditions have been met for the enduring defeat of al Qaeda and ISIS, as well as the protection of regional partners and allies, before withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria or Afghanistan. Making ‘em Squeal Senator Ernst was elected to make Washington “squeal.” She is always searching for and identifying areas of waste, fraud and abuse. Each month, Ernst gives out a “Squeal Award” which recognizes a Washington expense, program or concept that’s wasteful and must be cut. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) supported ten different cat studies—funded from grants totaling $1.3 million of taxpayer money—that concluded classical music has an effect on cat behaviors. These studies do not comply with a law requiring disclosure of the cost to taxpayers for a federally funded project. Senator Ernst has asked the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to find out why NIH studies are refusing to disclose the cost. These cat studies are another great example of taxpayer dollars being tossed around like a “ball of yarn,” and that’s why NIH received the January Squeal Award. Communicating Priorities ###
01.31.2019	WASHINGTON – On January 31, 2016, the night of her graduation, Sarah Root, a twenty-one year-old Iowan from Council Bluffs, was struck and killed in Omaha, Neb., by Edwin Mejia, who entered the country illegally and was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit. Today, on the third anniversary of her death, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Deb Fischer (R-NE) and 11 of their colleagues, re-introduced legislation in honor of Sarah, to allow federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. “It is wholly unacceptable that someone who is here illegally and is responsible for the death of another human being is not considered an enforcement priority nor is detained by ICE. We have an obligation to the Root family, and to the American people, to ensure that no person falls victim to this injustice again. Sarah’s Law brings us one step closer to restoring justice in our broken immigration system by allowing ICE to detain and hold these criminals accountable,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA). “The tragic death of Sarah Root three years ago and the ongoing search for her killer underscore the serious attention border security and immigration enforcement require in America. Sarah’s life was cut short by an undocumented immigrant who disregarded the rule of law and decided to get behind the wheel after drinking. The Obama Administration refused to take custody of Sarah’s killer because it didn’t consider him a priority, allowing him to disappear into the shadows. The Roots have been robbed of their daughter, and at least for now, they have been robbed of justice. Our legislation, named in Sarah’s memory, will ensure that those who harm or kill Americans will be taken into custody and removed while also ensuring that victims and their families get the information they deserve from the government as they pursue justice,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA). “Edwin Mejia’s mugshot shouldn’t be on a most wanted poster — Edwin Mejia should be in jail, serving hard time for the life he took and the pain he left behind,” said Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE). “Sarah’s Law is common-sense legislation that Sarah and her family deserve to have signed into law. Congress should waste no time sending this legislation to the President’s desk for his signature.” “No family should have to endure the tragedy and pain the Root family has experienced. Sarah’s Law would end the flawed policies that allowed her killer to evade justice. Let’s honor Sarah’s memory by enacting this important solution to make our communities safer,” said Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE). “We need to remember the story of Sarah and other victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants,” said Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). “On December 29, 2018, Pierce Corcoran, the 22-year-old son of a Knoxville Fire Department captain, died after he was struck by a car driven by an undocumented immigrant who was in this country illegally for 14 years and is now in ICE custody. No family should have to suffer this tragic loss. No longer should our borders be left unpoliced for criminals, drug cartels, and human traffickers to slip across.” “Americans killed or injured at the hands of criminals in our country illegally deserve justice,” said Senator Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA). “Under no circumstances should an illegal immigrant get a ‘get out of jail free’ card after being charged with a deadly or serious crime. Three years later, Sarah Root’s killer is still on the run, and no American family should have to suffer that injustice. Imagine if Spencer Chauvin, Jermaine Starr and Vontarous Kelly’s killer had been allowed to disappear into society and never pay a price for stealing their lives?” “Sarah’s murder was a great tragedy. That tragedy was compounded by her killer’s escape from justice. Sarah’s Law would ensure that federal law enforcement detains criminals who enter our country illegally and harm our citizens,” said Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR). “It shouldn't take a law to emphasize the protection of our citizens is a priority for any federal agency, especially in cases of illegal immigrants committing serious crimes. Just so it's clear, this legislation codifies President Trump's executive order to ensure illegal immigrants who commit crimes are detained and held to account,” said Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS). “It is unconscionable that loopholes in our immigration system allow an illegal immigrant who has been charged with heinous crimes to be released into the communities, giving them the opportunity to skip bail or fail to appear for court. Sarah’s Law ensures that ICE can detain criminal offenders so we can bring them to justice,” said Senator Jim Inhofe (R-OK). “Sarah’s Law will help fix our broken immigration system by holding people in this country illegally accountable for laws they break,” said Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS). “Loopholes in our immigration system shouldn’t allow criminals to walk free after taking an innocent life. Sarah’s Law will not only make our communities safer, it will help bring closure to families dealing with tragic losses, like the Roots.” “While this might seem like a common-sense proposal to many Americans, the current legal system presents several unnecessary hurdles with respect to detaining illegal immigrants who are accused of committing serious crimes. We owe it to victims and their loved ones, like Sarah Root and her family, to do everything we can to ensure the law is enforced and justice is served,” said Senator John Thune (R-SD). “Three years after Sarah Root’s tragic and preventable death, it is alarming that the illegal immigrant who killed her remains at large, and that cannot be repeated in future cases,” said Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC). “We cannot continue to allow illegal immigrants who are dangerous criminals to remain at large in our communities. This legislation will prevent these injustices in the future and ensure illegal immigrants who are charged with killing or seriously injuring another person will be in federal custody and removed from the United States.” “Our family is very grateful for Senator Ernst and her willingness to continue to push for Sarah's Law. It means a lot to us that she is reintroducing this bill on the third anniversary of Sarah's death. This law is to make sure no other family has to go through what our family has. Sarah's killer is still on the run and if this law was in place when she was killed we wouldn't be looking for her killer today – he would be in custody and serving his time,” said Michelle Root, mother of Sarah Root. Following state criminal charges of motor vehicle homicide and outreach by local law enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) used its discretion to decline to issue a detainer on Edwin Mejia, Sarah’s killer. Subsequently, Mejia posted bond, disappeared and now, three years later, still remains at-large. About Sarah’s Law: Sarah’s Law would amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the federal government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally, violated the terms of their immigration status or had their visa revoked and is thereafter charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. The legislation also requires ICE to make reasonable efforts to identify and provide relevant information to the crime victims or their families. Under this law, Mejia would have been detained by law enforcement and not allowed to flee from justice. The Root family would have been kept up-to-date on Mejia’s status and federal immigration authorities’ efforts to remove him from the United States. In January 2017, President Trump implemented major parts of Sarah’s Law via Executive Order, which included prioritized detention of criminal illegal immigrants and the creation of the Office of Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement. Passage of Sarah’s Law would codify the order into law, to prevent future administrations from withdrawing President Trump’s executive order, or deprioritizing the detention of illegal immigrants who commit crimes involving death or serious bodily injury, and restricting information to victims of such crimes.

01.31.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) reintroduced Sarah’s Law today, in honor of a fellow Iowan, Sarah Root, a 21 year-old young woman who was struck and killed by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. Sarah’s Law will allow federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. To download the full video recording, click here or on the image above. The full script is below. Hi, I’m Senator Joni Ernst. Many Iowans have heard the tragic story of Sarah Root. At just 21 years of age, Sarah was killed by a drunk driver who was in our country illegally. After being charged, Sarah’s killer was allowed to post bail, and was not detained by authorities. Sarah’s killer disappeared and remains at-large to this day. Today, on the three-year anniversary of Sarah’s death, I am reintroducing my legislation in her honor, which is named Sarah’s Law. This bill is commonsense legislation. It requires federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants who are criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person, like Sarah. We have an obligation to the Root family, and to the American people, to ensure that no daughter, sister, friend or neighbor falls victim to this injustice again. For Sarah and all those who face injustice like this, I’ll be working hard on the Senate Judiciary Committee and on the Senate floor to move this bill forward. Thank you. ###
01.30.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), has joined Senator Mike Enzi (R-WY) and U.S. Representative John Curtis (R-UT), in introducing legislation that would improve the information provided to students and families taking on federal loans to finance higher education. The bill was also cosponsored by U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY) and U.S Representatives Ted Budd (R-NC) and Bill Posey (R-FL). The Transparency in Student Lending Act would require disclosure of the annual percentage rate (APR) for federal student loans. The APR assists borrowers by showing the true cost of a loan, helping students and their families make more informed financial decisions. Currently, borrowers of private student loans receive this information, but borrowers of loans issued by the Department of Education do not. “Over 90% of student loans are originated and guaranteed by the federal government,” Ernst said. “It’s critical that prospective students and their families have access to necessary information about these loans when considering their lending options, and that’s exactly what this bill does.” “Borrowers of federal student loans need transparent information when considering loan options and federal student loans should have to be upfront about their true costs,” Enzi said. “This bill would provide more transparency so families can be better informed about their financing options.” “As our global economy grows ever more competitive, education is key. Unfortunately, costs—including hidden costs—can be crippling,” Curtis said. “As the primary provider of the vast majority of student loans and education financing options, the federal government should provide a transparent and full accounting of associated costs and fees for borrowers. I represent the youngest Congressional district in the country with an average age of 26 years old; these students must be equipped to make the right decisions for their families and their futures.” “Students face many challenges in trying to plan and pay for college. When making these important financial decisions, they shouldn’t have to struggle to understand the true cost of their federal student loans,” Barrasso said. “Our bill will provide much needed transparency to the federal loan process and give students and their families more certainty when it comes to financial planning.” The APR is expressed as a single percentage number that represents the actual yearly costs of funds over the term of the loan and takes into account the stated interest rate of the loan and any fees or additional costs associated with the loan. The Consumer Banker Association, Education Finance Council and Utah Higher Education Assistance Authority have all voiced support for the legislation. ###
01.29.2019	WASHINGTON - U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Doug Jones (D-AL), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and Jack Reed (D-RI) have introduced the Teachers Are Leaders Act, which would create partnerships between colleges and high-need schools to develop and support innovative teacher leader roles. Teachers are one of the most important factors in student achievement. Unfortunately, high teacher attrition rates, which have neared 8 percent in recent years, mean that quality teachers are leaving the classroom every year. Teacher attrition rates are highest in our lowest-performing schools, where students have the greatest need for high-quality teachers. The top reasons for teachers leaving the classroom often include a lack of administrative support, professional learning opportunities, and decision-making input. Teachers desire and deserve a variety of career advancement opportunities to lead in their school without having to leave the classroom. Recognizing this, innovative districts and states such as Delaware and Iowa have created “teacher leader” roles, wherein classroom teachers take on additional responsibilities to address unique school needs. To support these efforts, this bill would support locally-designed teacher leader development programs that would create teacher leader roles that directly address demonstrated school needs, which could range from peer coaching to developing new dual enrollment courses. The bill would ensure that the continuum of teacher preparation and development extends beyond the first few years of teaching and would offer a practical way for higher education to address teacher recruitment and retention challenges. “Investing in Iowa’s educators is investing in our future leaders. Unfortunately, rural school districts are struggling to attract and retain teachers, often due to lack of administrative support and professional development opportunities. The Teachers Are Leaders Act will enable teachers to develop their skills and take on additional responsibilities, while providing a better-quality education for our students,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Teachers invest so much of themselves in their students, so it’s critical that we invest in them to ensure they have all the resources they need to make sure every child can receive an excellent education. Teacher leadership is a promising investment that offers teachers new learning and leadership opportunities, which have been shown to improve teacher job satisfaction, and more importantly, to increase student achievement,” said Senator Coons. “Boosting teachers’ ability to improve student learning will build a better future for our kids and our country. Iowa’s teacher leadership program has proven results with increases in both retaining excellent teachers and districts meeting their achievement goals. This legislation will help us spread that success nationwide,” said Senator Grassley. “As a father of three children currently enrolled in the Colorado public school system, I understand the pivotal role teachers play in the development of our students,” said Senator Gardner. “When quality teachers leave the classroom because they don’t have the necessary resources, it is our children who suffer. Students everywhere deserve to have the best learning opportunities at their disposal and that starts with providing leadership opportunities and support for our teachers.” “Great teachers are great equalizers - they can help students overcome any barrier to learning. This bill helps local communities support the development of great teachers and keep them in the classroom,” said Senator Murphy. “Teachers play a critical role in student success,” said Senator Inhofe. “By supporting local teacher leadership programs, we can do more to support our teachers by creating and expanding professional development opportunities to improve teacher retention.” “The National Network of State Teachers of the Year salutes Sens. Coons, Ernst, Grassley, Gardner, Murphy, Whitehouse, Roberts, Inhofe, and Reed for their compelling policy initiative and understanding that teacher leadership is a critical thread in this country’s fabric that enables educators to advocate for the issues and practices that provide all students with exceptional and equitable learning opportunities,” said Katherine Bassett, President and CEO, National Network of State Teachers of the Year (NNSTOY). "Teach Plus is thrilled to endorse the Teachers Are Leaders Act. The tens of thousands teachers in the Teach Plus Teacher Leader Network understand that teacher leadership is a smart investment that yields gains in student success. We applaud the bill's attention to improving preparation, and its innovative approach to differentiated career paths that will foster new opportunities for professional growth,” said Alice Cain Johnson, Executive Vice President, Teach Plus. “We know teachers want opportunities to lead from the classroom, yet we’ve seen that teacher leadership roles typically come without quality training and support. This situation does a double disservice: it takes teaching time away from the educators best prepared to accelerate student learning and it fails to equip them with the skills they need to lead other teachers to similar success. The Teachers Are Leaders Act helps address this challenge by creating opportunities for teachers to access high-quality leadership training that arms them with the knowledge and skills they need to work together with their principal and colleagues to make hiring decisions, set curriculum, design in-school training, coach their peers, and establish other shared practices that lead to better outcomes for students,” said Jean Desravines, CEO, New Leaders.

01.29.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota were joined by Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa in sponsoring bipartisan legislation to bring down the skyrocketing prices of prescription drugs. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act would limit anticompetitive pay-for-delay deals that prevent or delay the introduction of affordable follow-on versions of branded pharmaceuticals. Grassley introduced this legislation with Klobuchar in December of 2018. "Making sure drugmakers are playing by the rules is critical to lowering the price of prescription medications. This bill will curb anti-competitive, pay-for-delay tactics that artificially inflate prices for patients and prevent access to more affordable alternatives,” Grassley said. “Senator Ernst has a long history of supporting patient access to affordable medications and I'm happy to welcome her in this commonsense, bipartisan effort." “High drug prices affect all Iowans, especially our seniors and those living on a fixed income. When competition is artificially stifled and affordable alternatives are purposely kept off the market, prices stay high and our seniors and middle-class Americans foot the bill. Our bipartisan legislation will help increase competition and lower drug costs,” Ernst said. ###
01.26.2019	Kicking Off the 99 County Tour for 2019! This week, Senator Joni Ernst kicked off her 99 County Tour for 2019, beginning her journey across Iowa visiting every single county in the state. Senator Joni Ernst began her 99 County Tour with a public meeting in her hometown of Red Oak, in Montgomery County. Participants included Iowans of all different ages, backgrounds and political stripes who asked questions directly to the senator on a wide range of issues.

Ernst Votes to Immediately Reopen the Government On Friday, Senator Ernst voted to reopen the government, following a deal announced between President Trump and Congress to allow more time to address the humanitarian crisis and to secure the southern border. Senator Ernst also voted to end the partial government shutdown and secure our southern border on Thursday. To underscore her commitment to a bipartisan solution to secure our border and immediately reopen the government, Senator Ernst also took to the Senate floor, joining Republican and Democratic colleagues, to give a powerful speech about the need to work together, in support of the American people. “The American people expect us to do better; we have an opportunity to step up and do the right thing, and that's find a solution.” In her speech, she outlined the fundamental duties of Congress: to provide for our nation’s security and to fund the government. She also outlined the impact that the partial shutdown has had on Iowans. Click here or on the image above to watch. Communicating Priorities
01.24.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) voted to end the partial government shutdown and secure our southern border. “Today, every senator had the opportunity to vote to immediately reopen the government. The End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act is a commonsense compromise that would fund critical federal agencies and enhance border security to help curb human trafficking and the transport of illegal weapons and drugs into communities in Iowa, and across the nation,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Background: The End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act provides investments in border security, specifically supporting all activities and resources outlined in a letter from the Trump Administration. This legislation includes $5.7 billion for construction of a physical barrier along the highest priority locations of the southern border, in addition to providing funding for 750 new border patrol agents and 375 new customs officers as well as counter-drugs and weapons technology and humanitarian needs. Under the End the Shutdown and Secure the Border Act, “provisional protected presence” status will be granted for three years for foreign nationals who grew up in the United States and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. This three year provisional protected presence will also be granted to certain current Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients as well. This package also includes language to reform the way we process in-country asylum claims for Central American minors. Specifically the Act would require a statutory change, along with reallocation of State Department funds, to establish in-country processing capacities at Northern Triangle consulates and embassies in an effort to reduce the incentive for such persons to make the dangerous journey to the United States southern border. The measure provides $12.7 billion in supplemental disaster funding for states and territories recently ravaged by hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, volcanoes and other such events. The package also includes FY2019 appropriations bills that passed by a strong majority of committee members when voted out of the Senate Appropriations Committee earlier this year: Agriculture, Rural Development Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies; Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Interior, Environment and Related Agencies; Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies; and, State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. ###
01.19.2019	WASHINGTON – Following President Trump’s proposed compromise to end the partial government shutdown, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement: “Hardworking Iowans, and Americans across the country, are sick of government shutdowns and dysfunction in Washington. Americans want their elected officials to work together to solve the toughest problems facing our country – from our border security and immigration challenges to our broken budget and appropriations process. “Our lack of border security has resulted in a humanitarian crisis with tens of thousands of illegal and inadmissible immigrants on our southern border every month. At the same time, many young, undocumented children were brought here by parents, caretakers, and so forth through no fault of their own. We should show compassion toward these now young men and women and pursue a measured approach that addresses their unique situation, while also respecting our immigration laws and discouraging future illegal immigration. “I agree with President Trump and many of my colleagues that securing our southern border is a key part of a system to discourage illegal immigration and curb human trafficking and the transport of illegal weapons and drugs – in addition to the ability of gangs and terrorists to exploit the holes in our system. “We have an opportunity to pass a bipartisan immigration bill. The deal President Trump has put on the table is one that both Democrats and Republicans can support. A bipartisan plan that includes a secure border will not only reopen the government, but also put the wellbeing of American citizens first.” ###
01.19.2019	Protecting and Celebrating Life Yesterday, Americans from every state gathered in our nation’s capital to participate in the 46th Annual March for Life. With that in mind, Senator Ernst took to the Senate floor and urged action on pro-life legislation, including her Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act, which she introduced this week. This legislation would strip funding from Planned Parenthood and redirect those funds to eligible women’s health care providers. Life News wrote a piece on Ernst’s legislation. Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s floor speech on protecting life. Senator Ernst also helped reintroduce legislation this week that would establish permanent, government-wide prohibition on taxpayer funding for abortion. She stated, “Like millions of Americans, I do not believe our hard-earned tax dollars should ever be used to cover the costs of abortion procedures.” Read more here. No Budget, No Recess Following years of repeated ineffectiveness to responsibly fund the federal government, Senator Joni Ernst introduced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress from leaving Washington if they failed to pass a budget on time. The No Budget, No Recess Act would prohibit Congress from leaving Washington if they fail to pass a budget by April 15 or approve regular spending bills by August 1. This means that Congress would be unable to adjourn for the August state work period – commonly referred to as “recess” – until they complete their work. Judiciary Committee Responsibilities In her first Senate Committee on the Judiciary hearing, Senator Ernst questioned President Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney General, William Barr. She pressed Mr. Barr on a number of topics important to Iowa, including immigration policies and human and drug trafficking. During the hearing, Ernst announced that she would be reintroducing her bill, Sarah’s Law, before the end of the month. KIOW covered Ernst’s questioning. Click here or on the image to watch Senator Ernst’s line of questioning. Twice during the hearing, Senator Ernst made history: being the first Republican woman to question a witness during a Judiciary hearing; and, Ernst became the first Republican woman to chair a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, filling in for Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) during a vote series. The Hill covered the “firsts” for Republican women on the Judiciary Committee. E15 Year-Round Update According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, the Agency is on track to have the E15 year-round rule in place by the summer driving season. This is great news for Iowa farmers and would fulfill President Trump’s promise. In a Senate Environment and Public Works hearing on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be EPA Administrator, Senator Joni Ernst pressed Mr. Wheeler on both the E15 rule and the Agency’s practice of evaluating and determining hardship for small refinery exemptions. The American Coalition of Ethanol praised Ernst for “confronting” Mr. Wheeler “about the ethanol demand destruction created by an unprecedented number of RFS small refinery exemptions.” Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s line of questioning. For her tireless efforts and consistent leadership on pushing the administration to fulfill President Trump’s promise of E15 year-round, Senator Ernst received the E15 award from the Iowa Corn Growers Association.

01.18.2019	WASHINGTON – Iowa’s U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley today joined colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee in reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The legislation would provide commonsense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization, a point at which there is significant scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on the unborn. Earlier this week, Ernst and Grassley joined colleagues in an effort to end taxpayer funding for abortions. The Pain-Capable legislation has been introduced in the last three Congresses. “At five months, we know that babies can yawn, make faces, wiggle their ten fingers and ten toes and feel pain. Sadly, the United States is only one of a handful of countries around the world—including North Korea and China—where on-demand abortions after the five month mark are legal. This isn’t right. I am committed to defending these innocent lives,” Ernst said. “Science tells us that an unborn child has many of the neural connections needed to feel pain perhaps as early as eight weeks and most certainly by 20 weeks fetal age. And the American people overwhelmingly support restrictions on late-term abortions. That’s for good reason. One Iowan, Micah Pickering, was born early at 20 weeks. Today Micah is living proof that just 20 weeks can create a beautiful human life. This bill will help make sure that other human lives also have a chance,” Grassley said. Background on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: At the age of 20 weeks post-fertilization, scientific evidence demonstrates that an unborn child can feel pain. Anesthesia is administered directly to the unborn child in second-trimester fetal surgery. The unborn child shows physical, chemical, brain and stress responses demonstrating pain at this stage of development. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is based in science, has overwhelming public support, and is necessary to protect unborn children from painful and untimely deaths. Advances in modern medicine help babies born at 20, 21 and 22 weeks post-fertilization survive outside the womb. The pain these babies feel outside the womb gives evidence to the pain their unborn counterparts feel while in utero. The United States is one of only seven countries that allows on-demand abortions past 20 weeks. The other six are North Korea, China, Vietnam, Singapore, Canada and the Netherlands. Pain-Capable legislation has already passed in South Carolina, Ohio, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Indiana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky and Arizona. Ultrasounds show unborn babies at 20 weeks sucking their thumb, yawning, stretching and making faces. Summary of Provisions: The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would make it illegal for any person to perform, or attempt to perform, an abortion without first making a determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child. If the post-fertilization age of the unborn child is determined to be 20 weeks or greater, an abortion shall not be performed, unless – It is necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman; The pregnancy is a result of rape and the woman has received medical treatment or counseling at least 48 hours prior to the abortion; or if she chooses to do so, has made a report to law enforcement; or The pregnancy is a result of rape or incest against a minor and the abuse is reported to either social services or law enforcement. In the case of the exceptions – The abortion may only proceed in a manner that provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive unless that would pose a greater risk of death or serious bodily injury to the pregnant woman; and The abortion provider must receive informed consent from the pregnant woman, certifying that she has been provided the child’s gestational age, a description of the law, and her rights under the law. A woman on whom an abortion was performed in violation of this Act may bring a civil action against the abortion provider in court to recover damages. Abortion doctors are required to submit annual data to the National Center for Health and Statistics providing statistical information about abortions carried out after 20 weeks post-fertilization age. The criminal punishment for a violation of this Act by a provider is imprisonment of up to five years, fines, or both. The bill makes clear that a woman who receives an illegal abortion in violation of this act may not be prosecuted.

01.17.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley received the E15 award from the Iowa Corn Growers Association for their work in the Senate championing year-round sales of E15. Ernst and Grassley have been steadfast advocates for ethanol and environmentally-friendly alternative energy sources. Last year, Ernst and Grassley joined a bipartisan group of 35 other senators urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase volume obligations for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel and ensure any small refinery economic hardship exemptions are appropriately accounted for in its final rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Ernst and Grassley were also leaders in encouraging the Trump administration to approve year-round sale of E15 to help farmers and lower the cost of RFS compliance for oil refineries by producing more Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) which are used to ensure biofuels are being blended into our nation’s fuel supply. “Iowa is proudly leading the way in corn and ethanol production. With strong support from the Iowa Corn Growers Association, Senator Grassley and I have continued to push the Trump Administration to fulfill President Trump’s promise of E15 year-round, which will boost our economy and provide Iowans choice at the pump,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Thank you for this recognition; I’m humbled to receive this award.” “Iowa is the number one corn-producing state in the nation. We are also the number one ethanol-producing state in the country with 43 refineries employing thousands of workers, boosting economic activity on Main Street and expanding the local tax base,” said Senator Chuck Grassley. “Opening the door for year-round sales of higher blends of ethanol is a victory for Iowa farmers, rural America and the nation as a whole. I’m honored to receive this recognition.” “We thank our champions Senators Grassley and Ernst on their leadership and unwavering commitment to Iowa corn farmers that resulted in the proposed E15 rule,” said Mark Recker, the chair of the Iowa Corn Growers Association.

01.17.2019	WASHINGTON – Following years of Congress’ repeated ineffectiveness to responsibly fund the federal government on time, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and David Perdue (R-GA), introduced legislation that would prohibit members of Congress from leaving Washington if we fail to pass a budget on time. “Hardworking Iowans, and Americans across the country, are sick and tired of government shutdowns, continuing resolutions and massive omnibus spending bills. This dysfunctional cycle is not the way our government was designed to function or should function. If we fail to pass a budget and spending bills, we should stay in town and work together until we get the job done,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “If the government shuts down due to congressional dysfunction and failure to agree on spending bills, Members of the Senate and House, the President, and his Cabinet should not be allowed to leave DC,” said Senator Lankford. “If we want to really put the pressure on Congress to take action on funding, we should prevent Members from going home or traveling during pre-scheduled ‘recess weeks,’ which would encourage Congress to actually have those tough conversations about spending. Just as Americans expect us to, we need to stay until the job is done. We are on day 26 of the longest-ever government shutdown, and yet Congress is about to go home for the weekend, with some Members flying out of the country. The proposal that we offer today would keep Congress in town until the budget is finally resolved. During a government shutdown, Congress and the White House should experience pain, not the American people.” “Congress should be held to the same standards of people in the real world,” said Senator Perdue. “Washington’s broken funding process has created a dysfunctional cycle of continuing resolutions, last-minute spending deals, and government shutdowns. Enough is enough. It’s time to create a politically neutral platform to fund the government on time every year, including real consequences for Members of Congress if they don’t get the entire job done. We should not go home until we have completed our work. Period.” The No Budget, No Recess Act would prohibit members of Congress from leaving Washington if we fail to pass a budget by April 15 or approve regular spending bills by August 1. This means that Congress would be unable to adjourn for the August state work period—commonly referred to as “recess”—until work is completed. Congress is supposed to fund the government by October 1—the first day of the new fiscal year. However, since 1976, Congress has only funded the government on time four times. Instead, Congress usually relies on temporary funding extensions called “continuing resolutions,” which are wasteful and create uncertainty. Worse yet, there have been 21 government shutdowns since 1976. Additional Background Under the No Budget, No Recess Act, if both the House and Senate have not approved a budget by April 15 or passed all appropriations bills by August 1, then: Congress would not be able to adjourn for more than eight hours. No funds would be available for official travel. Two quorum calls would be held per day to ensure that Members of Congress cannot leave Washington. Congress’ dysfunctional budget process by the numbers: $22 trillion: The U.S. is nearly $22 trillion in debt. $1 trillion: U.S. budget deficits are projected to exceed $1 trillion in coming years. 21 Shutdowns Or Funding Lapses: Since 1976, funding battles have shut down the government or caused funding gaps 21 times, costing billions in retroactive pay and lost economic output. 1996: The last time that Congress funded the government on time was 1996 – over 20 years ago. 11 budgets in 20 years: Congress has passed a budget resolution only 11 times in the past 20 years, and has passed all appropriations bills only four times since 1976. 5 Continuing Resolutions: Since 1999, Congress has passed an average of five continuing resolutions per year, creating constant uncertainty for federal agencies, grantees and others who rely on federal funding. $4 billion in waste: Our reliance on continuing resolutions has forced the Department of Defense to ground or underfund dozens of programs and has, for example, resulted in $4 billion in waste for the Navy since 2011. ###
01.17.2019	WASHINGTON – Ahead of this week’s March for Life in Washington, D.C., Iowa’s U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley joined their colleagues to introduce the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019” (S.109). The measure would establish a permanent, government-wide prohibition of taxpayer funding for abortion. Similar policies, such as the Hyde Amendment, currently require annual passage and do not apply to Obamacare. “Like millions of Americans, I do not believe our hard-earned tax dollars should ever be used to cover the costs of abortion procedures. For many, protecting the lives of the defenseless, the unborn, is a deeply moral and personal issue, and they should not be forced to pay for a practice they passionately object to and which violates their own beliefs,” Senator Joni Ernst said. “An Iowa boy born five short months after conception named Micah Pickering stands today as living proof that we can always do more to protect unborn children. For those of us who embrace the sanctity of life, using taxpayer dollars to fund and support abortion just isn’t right. One way to fix that problem is to pass this bill and ensure that taxpayer money doesn’t go to funding abortions,” Senator Chuck Grassley said. In addition to establishing a government-wide ban on federal funding for abortion, the legislation would: Prohibit funding for health benefits coverage that includes coverage of abortion with funds authorized or appropriated by Federal law; Prohibit abortion in federal health facilities (such as DOD and VA hospitals) and ensure that no federal employee provides abortion services in the course of their employment; Make permanent the provisions of the DC Hyde Amendment, or the Dornan Amendment, which clarifies that the federal provisions regarding abortion funding also apply to the government of the District of Columbia; Ensure that elective abortion is not deductible for tax purposes by amending Section 213 of the Internal Revenue Code; and Ensure that Affordable Care Act premium assistance subsidies provided in the form of refundable advanceable tax credits are not used to pay for health insurance plans that include abortion, except in cases of rape, incest, or the life of the mother. The legislation also includes a provision requiring that all plans offered by Obamacare exchanges disclose whether a plan includes coverage of elective abortion procedures, as well as the abortion surcharge embedded into abortion-covering plans. The U.S. Senate is expected to take a procedural vote on the bill this week. The bill is led by Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and James Lankford, R-Okla and co-sponsored by 32 other senators including: John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., Roy Blunt, R-Mo., Mike Braun, R-Ind., Bill Cassidy, R-La., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, Steve Daines, R-Mont., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., James Inhofe, R-Okla., Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., John Kennedy, R-La., Mike Lee, R-Utah, Jerry Moran, R-Kan., David Perdue, R-Ga., James Risch, R-Idaho, Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., John Thune, R-S.D., Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., Todd Young, R-Ind., John Hoeven, R-N.D., Tim Scott, R-S.C., Rob Portman, R-Ohio, Ben Sasse, R-Neb., John Cornyn, R-Texas, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and Thom Tillis, R-N.C. ###
01.16.2019	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) held U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler’s feet to the fire, today, with regard to fulfilling President Trump’s promise of E15 year-round and ensuring the Agency examines its practice of evaluating and determining hardship in small refinery exemptions. During the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works hearing on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be EPA Administrator, Senator Ernst asked Mr. Wheeler directly if the Agency will have the E15 year-round rule in place by May 31, the beginning of the summer driving season. Ernst also asked Mr. Wheeler for assurance that EPA will examine small refinery exemptions closely and not give blanket exemptions, as was done by his predecessor, Scott Pruitt. Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Joni Ernst’s full line of questioning. Below is an excerpt of Senator Joni Ernst’s line of questioning. Ernst: “What I’d like to just have you reaffirm for me today—and you know exactly the questions I’m going to ask—reaffirm the commitment that we will see E15 for our summer driving season?” Wheeler: “Yes, we are still on schedule for that. We are not able to work on it during the shutdown.” … Ernst: “Can you assure me then that you will be examining those [economic hardship] exemptions and not giving blanket exemptions as it appears has been done in the past by your predecessor?” Wheeler: “Yes, we will examining each one individually to make sure that each one is warranted, individually.” Ernst: “Certainly we understand the potential for hardship out there, but we don’t agree that every exemption that has been given in the past has been due to a hardship.” ###
01.16.2019	WASHINGTON – With the 2019 March for Life coming up this Friday, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the importance of protecting life, urging Congress to act on pro-life legislation. She highlighted bills that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks of development; force abortion practitioners to provide the same degree of care to a baby who survives an abortion as any child born naturally premature; and, ensure no taxpayer dollars will be used to subsidize abortion procedures and abortion industry giants, like Planned Parenthood. Click here or on the image above to watch. On the Senate floor, Senator Ernst said: “I am pleased to be joined on the floor today by Senators Blunt, Wicker, and Fischer to speak about the importance of protecting, and celebrating, life. “This Friday, Americans from every state in our nation – from tiny, rural towns to bustling urban cities – will gather in our nation’s capital to participate in the 46th Annual March for Life. “Each year, I am amazed and inspired by the immeasurable strength, compassion, and support demonstrated by the pro-life community as hundreds of thousands of its members come to Washington D.C. and tirelessly work to protect the most vulnerable in our society – the unborn. “As members of the Senate Values Action Team, throughout the year, we are blessed with the opportunity to work with and hear from so many who are committed to protecting human life at all stages. “I thank my colleagues for sharing this message of life today, and I would like to yield to the senator from Missouri. “As my colleagues can attest, the invaluable message being shared by the pro-life community this week has implications far beyond the March for Life. “As I travel in my home state of Iowa, I see this life-affirming message in our pregnancy resource centers, maternity homes, and adoption agencies. “These comprehensive, on-the-ground services provide women and families with service options that are changing, and saving, lives every single day. These life-affirming services are the foundation of the pro-life movement across our nation, and I sincerely thank these centers and agencies for their critical work to fight for vulnerable lives throughout the year. “I see this same message in the remarkable stories of individual families, such as the Pickering family from Newton, Iowa. I have had the opportunity to share the phenomenal story of Micah Pickering on the Senate floor before. “As you may recall, Micah was born at just 20 weeks post-fertilization. He was only about the size of a bag of M&Ms – the size of the palm of my hand. Yet Micah was also a perfect, fully-formed baby boy, with 10 fingers and 10 toes. In fact, no one makes this points more eloquently than Micah himself. “When I first met Micah, I had a picture of him displayed in my office from the day he was born. He immediately ran up to the picture, pointed it at, and said “Baby!” “Micah recognized right away that even at just 20 weeks, the humanity of these children is undeniable. Micah’s parents and the doctors and nurses at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics recognized this humanity as well and were dedicated to his survival. Today, Micah is a happy, healthy, energetic 6-year old boy. “Stories like Micah’s are extraordinary reminders of how the life-affirming services that the pro-life community marches for have real and significant impacts on the lives of families across America. “Since coming to Congress, I have also tried to do my part to ensure that this message from those in my home state of Iowa – and from others in communities across our nation – is taken back and turned into action in Washington. “For me, that has meant supporting crucial pro-life initiatives like the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prevent abortions after 20 weeks of development – the very same age at which Micah was born. “Another critical piece of legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, would create concrete enforcement provisions to hold abortionists accountable if they do not provide the same degree of care to a baby who survives an abortion as they would any child born naturally premature at the same age. “Fighting for common sense legislation that protects innocent life has been a priority of mine in the Senate. But Congress must also do more to ensure that taxpayers are not forced to subsidize abortion or abortion industry giants such as Planned Parenthood. “During the 115th Congress, I led the fight in the Senate to pass critical legislation – which was signed into law in 2017 – that ensures states are not forced to provide entities like Planned Parenthood – the nation’s single largest provider of abortions – with federal Title X dollars. “I am grateful to have worked with former Congresswoman Diane Black, my Senate colleagues, and President Trump to make sure states are not forced to award providers like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars through Title X family planning grants. “As I have stated time and again, taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for roughly half a billion dollars annually for an organization like Planned Parenthood that exhibits such disrespect for human life. With that in mind, today I reintroduced legislation that would defund Planned Parenthood while still protecting vital funding for women’s health care services. “Contrary to what they claim, Planned Parenthood is not the nation’s preeminent provider of women’s health care. In fact, Planned Parenthood facilities do not even perform in-house mammograms. “On the other hand, community health centers continue to greatly outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide and provide more comprehensive preventative and primary health services – including cervical and breast cancer screenings, diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, and so much more. “Access to comprehensive health services is absolutely critical to women and families across this nation, and federally qualified health centers offer such services – regardless of a person’s ability to pay. “A recent GAO study that I requested, along with many of my colleagues in both the House and Senate, showed that over a three-year period, federally qualified health centers served 25 million individuals compared to only 2.4 million individuals at Planned Parenthood – that’s more than ten times more people served. “Furthermore, a recent Marist poll shows that 54% of Americans do not support taxpayer dollars going toward abortions. “While there are federal regulations that prevent federal dollars from directly covering abortion, these laws are governed by a complicated patchwork of policies and funding riders that must be reapproved during the appropriations process each year. Since 1976, the Hyde Amendment has been attached to appropriations bills in order to block federal funds from paying for abortion. “However, this policy, which once drew widespread, bipartisan support has recently been under attack. For the first time ever, the Affordable Care Act authorized and appropriated funds that bypassed Hyde Amendment funding restrictions. In 2016, the Democratic Party added the repeal of Hyde Amendment protections to its presidential platform. “The Hyde Amendment is a longstanding and critical provision that protects federal dollars and ensures taxpayers are not footing the bill for abortion procedures. “That is why I support the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2019, which was recently reintroduced in the Senate. “This legislation would permanently codify the Hyde Amendment, ensuring that funding restrictions remain in place and are applied to all federal programs. Furthermore, this bill takes important steps to eliminate certain tax benefits related to abortions and improve disclosure requirements related to insurance coverage of abortion. “Preventing our taxpayer dollars from paying for abortion procedures – a position that a majority of Americans agree with – should not be a complicated process vulnerable to partisan attack. Congress must take steps to ensure permanent protections apply government-wide. “As such, I urge the Senate to consider the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Disclosure Act on the floor in order to protect not only our taxpayer dollars, but the innocent lives of our most vulnerable. “Thank you.” ###
01.16.2019	WASHINGTON – In her first hearing as a member of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned the nominee for U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, on “restoring the rule-of-law” in our immigration system, combating human trafficking, and curbing the influx of drugs coming into Iowa and the nation. In her questioning, Senator Ernst announced she would be reintroducing her bill, known as Sarah’s Law, before the end of the month. Ernst’s legislation, named after Sarah Root of Council Bluffs who was killed by an illegal immigrant driving drunk, would require the detention of illegal immigrants who have been charged with a crime that resulted in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. Barr called the bill “commonsensical” and one he would be inclined to support. Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Joni Ernst’s full line of questioning. Senator Ernst also questioned Barr about what he sees as the main contributor to human trafficking in the United States and what the Department of Justice can do to combat and prevent these crimes. She pointed out that human trafficking is the second-largest criminal industry in the world, generating an estimated $32 billion annually. Senator Ernst asked Barr about how he would help curb the drug epidemic in Iowa and the United States, and specifically what he would do to stop the crisis at the southern border where methamphetamine and other substances continue to pour into the country. Lastly, Senator Ernst highlighted the desperate need to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) is housed within the Department of Justice. In the 2017 Fiscal Year, Iowa was awarded $8.7 million from 13 OVW programs. ###
01.16.2019	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), and 31 of her Senate colleagues, reintroduced legislation to prevent any taxpayer dollars from going to the nation’s single largest provider of abortions, Planned Parenthood. “We must fight to protect the most vulnerable of our society, the unborn. Iowans, and all Americans, should not be forced to fund the nation’s largest abortion provider with their hard-earned tax dollars. This legislation will put an end to this practice and redirect those funds to eligible women's health care providers,” said Senator Joni Ernst. The Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act prohibits taxpayer dollars from going to Planned Parenthood. Instead, the bill redirects those funds to other eligible women's health care providers while ensuring there is no reduction in federal funding for women’s health services. “The majority of Americans are unequivocal in their belief that our taxpayer dollars should not go towards funding organizations that provide abortions, including Planned Parenthood,” said Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). “The Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act puts a stop to government-funded abortions while ensuring that much needed funding for women’s health services is protected.” “No American taxpayer should be forced to fund abortions or abortion providers,” said Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO). “A majority of Americans agree that abortion is not the right place to spend federal tax dollars. This bill will ensure that every dollar taken away from the nation’s largest abortion provider will go toward women’s health care through community health centers and other providers that offer more comprehensive treatment services.” “Americans should be able to fund women's health services without their money being used to pay for abortions. This bill will protect the unborn while preserving funding for women’s health services,” said Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR). “I’ve long been an advocate for pro-life policies that show compassion to women and the unborn. Through the Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act, federal funds will be directed to community health centers, like the 44 sites we have across Nebraska, and not to Planned Parenthood. I’m proud to once again join my colleagues on this common-sense solution that will help provide comprehensive health care for women and protect life,” said Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE). “This important bill would protect health services for women, but without supporting an organization known for providing controversial abortion procedures. By denying Planned Parenthood access to federal funds, more women’s health resources would be available to rural hospitals, community health centers, and other providers,” said Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS). “This important bill helps ensure women have numerous options to receive quality and affordable health care while preventing federal dollars from going to Planned Parenthood,” said Senator James Lankford (R-OK). “By redirecting federal dollars away from abortion-providers and shifting them to thousands of other eligible women's health care providers that do not perform abortions but do provide critical screenings and health care, we can ensure taxpayers do not have to choose between valuing life and protecting women’s health care.” “On the week of March for Life, Republicans are unified in their fight to protect the unborn,” said Senator Tim Scott (R-SC). “I am proud of the work we are doing to preserve and protect the sanctity of life.” Specifically, the Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act: Prohibits federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliate organizations; Forbids Planned Parenthood from being eligible for any federal dollars, including through mandatory expenditures or unobligated funding of individual agencies; Protects federal funding for health services for women, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, cervical and breast cancer screenings and more; and, Ensures there is no reduction in overall federal funding available to support women’s health.

Background: In 2016, Planned Parenthood received $543.7 million in combined federal, state and local government grants and reimbursements. According to a March 6, 2018, Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, Planned Parenthood spent $288.8 million in federal funding that had been received, directly and indirectly, from federal agencies from FY2013-2015. Over the same period, the International Planned Parenthood Federation spent $13.97 million in federal funding. Over the three years documented by the GAO study, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) served 25 million individuals compared to 2.4 million individuals at Planned Parenthood. ###
01.12.2019	Let’s Work Together to Secure Our Border Following President Trump’s address to the nation on Tuesday night, Senator Ernst issued a strong statement: “The President has been abundantly clear that the Democrats need to start working with Republicans – not against them – to reach an agreement on securing our southern border and putting the wellbeing of American citizens first…I agree, Mr. President. Let’s work together to secure our border.” In a call with Iowa reporters later in the week, Senator Ernst reiterated the need for a comprehensive plan on border security. KMA Land was on the call and reported on Ernst’s comments. National Security and Middle East Allies The Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act, which was considered by the Senate this week, is a vital national security bill that will help reinforce our alliances in the Middle East and keep pressure on the Assad regime in Syria. Unfortunately, Democrats in the Senate decided to block this important bill, placing partisan politics ahead of our country’s defense. On Wednesday, Senator Ernst took to the Senate floor calling for the U.S. to continue strengthening our armed forces in line with the national defense strategy, and to recognize the return of great power competition. Watch the full speech here. Senator Ernst speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Responsibilities Senator Ernst met with the nominee for U.S. Attorney General, William Barr, on Thursday. Next week, Senator Ernst will take part in Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on Mr. Barr’s nomination where she will have the chance to fully vet his nomination. William Barr, nominee for U.S. Attorney General, and Senator Ernst On Thursday night, Ernst spoke with Fox News’ Martha MacCallum about the importance of being one of the first Republican women senators to sit on the Judiciary Committee. Watch the full interview by clicking here or on the image below. Senator Ernst also sat down with USA Today to discuss her role on the Judiciary Committee and the significance of having Republican women not only on the committee, but in Congress. On recruitment of Republican women, Ernst stated, “We do that by demonstrating we have room for you and we have room for your ideas on our committees. We have good assignments waiting for you.” Legislative Victories This week, Senator Ernst, and a number of her colleagues, reintroduced legislation to rein in unelected bureaucrats by giving Congress the authority to review sweeping rules and regulations that impact Iowans and all Americans. Read more about the REINS Act here. In addition, Senator Ernst cosponsored the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which will allow law-abiding citizens with concealed carry privileges in their home state to safely conceal carry in other states that also allow it. The bill would not preempt any state law or establish a national standard for concealed carry. Read her statement here. Fourteen Senators, including Senator Ernst, wrote a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar urging him to move forward with a final rule that would ensure pro-life consumers enrolled in Affordable Care Act health plans aren’t subsidizing abortion services. KIOW in Forest City, Iowa covered the news. To read the full letter to Secretary Azar, click here. Law Enforcement Appreciation Every single day, brave police officers put their lives on the line to protect our communities. Senator Ernst extended her gratitude to these men and women who make tremendous sacrifices to look after our friends, neighbors and loved ones on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day.

01.11.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a strong supporter of Iowans’ Second Amendment rights, is cosponsoring the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, legislation to allow law-abiding citizens with concealed carry privileges in their home state to safely conceal carry in other states that also allow it. The bill would not preempt any state law or establish a national standard for concealed carry. “Individual states, like Iowa, know the policies that work best for their communities. This legislation is a sensible solution to permit law-abiding citizens with legal concealed carry privileges to safely conceal carry in other states that allow it,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Background: The Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would permit individuals who legally possess a firearm in the state he or she resides, and has proper identification, to carry a concealed weapon across state lines, if certain conditions are met. The legislation would not preempt any state law or establish a national standard for concealed carry. Individual state gun laws would still be respected. All 50 states have passed laws allowing citizens to carry firearms in public, with most states requiring a permit. In an instance where an individual is prohibited from concealed carry, they will continue to be prohibited under this bill. The legislation was introduced by U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) and is cosponsored by 30 other senators, including Senator Ernst. ###
01.11.2019	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Todd Young (R-IN), Ted Cruz (R-TX) and 29 other cosponsors, reintroduced the “Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny” (REINS) Act to increase accountability and transparency in the federal regulatory process. Senator Paul has been lead Senate sponsor of the bill each Congress since 2011. The REINS Act would rein in unelected federal bureaucrats by requiring that Congress affirmatively approve every new “major rule” proposed by the Executive Branch before it can be enforced on the American people, as opposed to the status quo, where regulations ultimately take effect unless Congress specifically disapproves. “We must increase transparency and hold regulatory agencies accountable to ensure they are upholding the congressional intent of our nation’s laws. The REINS Act gives Congress the authority to review sweeping rules and regulations and is a step in the right direction to rein-in burdensome, out-of-control government regulations that impact Iowans, and all Americans,” said Senator Ernst. “Last Congress, we made tremendous progress on relieving the burdens placed on the American people by unelected bureaucrats, but much more remains to be done. Passing the REINS Act would reassert Congress’ legislative authority and help us further reduce unnecessary, overreaching government interference in Americans’ everyday lives,” said Senator Paul. “Even when well-intended, government regulations are all too often ineffective, counterproductive or even outright harmful. Heavy-handed Washington regulators frequently fail to understand the real-world effect of their actions. As the Constitution outlines, laws are written and passed by the people’s branch of government, not by unseen and unknown executive branch employees behind closed doors who can’t be voted out of office. Thankfully, the Trump administration has taken significant action to repeal burdensome regulations. But more needs to be done to reclaim the rightful role of Congress as the lawmaking body of government and restore democratic accountability for rules that impact the lives and livelihoods of Americans,” said Senator Grassley. “We have made significant progress reining in costly, job-killing regulations since I first introduced the REINS Act in the House six years ago, but we still have more work to do to protect hardworking Americans. I will continue fighting for the passage of this common-sense legislation in the new Congress,” said Senator Young. “In an age where unelected federal bureaucrats have unprecedented power to unilaterally invent binding, economically destructive federal regulations, the REINS Act is a necessary step in curbing this excessive power. If enacted, the REINS Act would be the most significant, far-reaching structural regulatory reform ever passed, and I will continue to fight for this important reform,” said Senator Cruz. Reiterating current federal law, the bill defines a “major” rule as one that the Office of Management and Budget determines may result in an economic impact of $100 million or greater each year; “a major increase in costs or prices” for American consumers, government agencies, regions, or industries; or “significant adverse effects” on the economy. By passing the REINS Act, the American people - through their elected officials - will once again have the final say on whether or not such rules are the right course for our future. In the 115th Congress, the legislation passed the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on May 17, 2017, while the U.S. House passed Rep. Doug Collins’ (R-GA) companion legislation by a vote of 237-187 in January 2017. You can read the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act HERE. ###
01.10.2019	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, today met with President Donald Trump’s nominee for U.S. Attorney General, William Barr. "As a former attorney general, William Barr has professional experience serving our country and a background befitting of the office. Today, I had a productive and fruitful conversation with Mr. Barr, and as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I look forward to fully vetting his nomination to be the nation’s top law enforcement officer,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA). ###
01.09.2019	WASHINGTON – Fourteen Senators, including Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), are encouraging the Trump administration to move forward with a final rule that would ensure pro-life consumers enrolled in Affordable Care Act (ACA) health plans aren’t subsidizing abortion services. In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, the Senators expressed their support for an HHS rule on ACA Section 1303. The rule, titled “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Exchange Program Integrity,” would require policy holders to submit separate payments for basic insurance and additional coverage for abortion. “The proposed rule aligns with the clear meaning and congressional intent of Section 1303 by eliminating the hidden abortion surcharge in many ACA plans,” the lawmakers wrote. “The Hyde Amendment protects federal health care dollars from funding elective abortions and insurance plans that include elective abortion. The ACA deviated from this long-standing precedent by creating its own funding stream making taxpayer dollars available to buy abortion-covering health insurance plans in ACA exchanges throughout the country,” they said. The Senators also strongly encouraged HHS to strengthen the final rule to clarify the illegality of the Obama administration’s interpretation of ACA Section 1303. “The Obama Administration’s misinterpretation created a hidden abortion surcharge on many health care plans in exchanges throughout the nation,” the letter said. “The meaning of Section 1303 is straightforward and congressional intent is clear. We are concerned that the proposed rule’s analysis fails to adequately acknowledge the illegality of the prior regulation. We ask that the final rule directly addresses this concern.” In addition to Ernst, the letter was signed by Senators Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).

01.09.2019	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) spoke on the floor of the Senate calling for the U.S. to continue strengthening our armed forces in line with the national defense strategy, and to recognize the return of great power competition. She also highlighted the significance of our alliances around the globe while emphasizing the importance of sound fiscal policy in providing funding for our common defense. Click here or on the image above to watch. On the Senate floor, Senator Ernst said: “Mr. President, I rise today to speak on U.S. national defense. “In the last couple of years, we have made tremendous progress in strengthening our military and have effectively realigned our global posture and strategy. “Under the new National Defense Strategy, the U.S. has rightfully recognized the return to great power competition, where our priorities have shifted from low intensity conflict to posturing against peer and near-peer adversaries. Over the last 17 years of combat in the Middle East, U.S. dominance and deterrence against great power competitors has diminished. Meanwhile, nations like China and Russia have undertaken extraordinary military modernization efforts while engaging in unprecedented and destabilizing aggression. “We have seen Russian intrusions in cyberspace, the illegal annexation of Crimea, information attacks on western democratic institutions, and the spread of lies, half-truths, and slander in order to sow division and chaos between the U.S. and our partners. These gray zone activities – which are actions below the level that would provoke an armed conflict – have gone mainly unchecked by the U.S., which has set a troubling precedent and only served to encourage further provocation. “From China, we see these gray zone techniques manifested in their land reclamation in the South China Sea, the construction of their first foreign military installation in Djibouti, and the continuing theft of intellectual property and trade secrets in critical security areas. They have also greatly undermined our supply chain through the Made in China 2025 initiative, which seeks to ensure that the U.S. and others remain reliant on the Chinese industrial base. “Above all, the U.S. is threatened by Russia and China’s advances in emerging technology. This includes hypersonic weapons, artificial intelligence, space capabilities, quantum computing, and directed energy. Without significant resources and focus, we will lose our technological superiority in these areas, and both U.S. national security and the global order will be in serious jeopardy. “Building off of our successes from the last two years, Congress and the Executive Branch must remain committed to investing in research, development, rapid acquisition, and the deployment of capabilities that provide for deterrence in line with the threats of the 21st century. Just as we rose to the challenge in the two World Wars, the Cold War, and following the attacks on September 11, 2001, we must once again evaluate our current posture and chart a course that best protects our national security and interests. “While the National Defense Strategy correctly prioritizes a return to great power competition, we still have great national security threats in the low intensity domain, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. The success of our missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, and Africa can be seen in our ability to prevent extremist groups from projecting attacks into the U.S. homeland. Through the heroic and dedicated service of our men and women in uniform, we have put unyielding pressure on foreign terrorists, and in turn, we have prevented another massive attack like we saw on 9/11. “While we have seen tremendous battlefield success against groups like the Islamic State, counterterrorism and stability operations require a sustained commitment of presence and resources in order to consolidate gains and promote good governance and the rule of law. In the absence of the latter, ungoverned spaces quickly transform into breeding grounds for terror groups. That is why we are in Iraq, that is why we are in Afghanistan, and that is why we should remain in Syria until our objectives are met. “Balancing our approach towards both low and high intensity threats will require us to rely on our allies and partners more than we have in decades as we have a limited supply of resources for our national defense. However, if we are able to leverage the resources of our friends, we will assume less risk as we seek to move more resources towards countering great power threats. Likewise, as we seek to bolster our defense posture towards peer competitors, we will greatly benefit from increased contributions and commitments from our allies and partners. “That means insisting that our treaty allies contribute their fair share to the international security burden, and also ensuring that our allies and partners are investing in weapons systems and military platforms that interoperate with ours while effectively deterring our common adversaries. We cannot and should not abandon those who share our values of democracy and freedom, but rather, work with them to increase defense contributions and build necessary capabilities and capacities. Unlike Russia and China, our network of allies and friends, who have stood shoulder to shoulder with us in the defense of freedom and democratic values, are a source of great strength as well as an integral part in promoting global security. “Mr. President, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to once again acknowledge the most detrimental adversary of our national defense – poor fiscal policy. As then-Secretary Mattis stated when he announced the National Defense Strategy, continuing resolutions and sequestration have hindered our security more than any foe. “These wasteful applications of taxpayer dollars prevent long-term planning, stymie research and development, delay critical procurement, and prevent necessary training and readiness investment. “Mr. President, what we do in this chamber has consequences that reverberate far beyond Washington. When we fail to do our job, we put our warfighters at higher risk and cripple our strategic posture, ultimately endangering our national security. “That is why I have come to the floor today to urge bipartisanship and collaboration amongst both Houses of Congress on defense spending policy. The political climate of today will assuredly prevent progress in some areas of Congress’ work, but I encourage my colleagues to set those differences aside when we consider policies and appropriations for our national defense. “We have a lot of work ahead in order to protect our security and interests, but I am confident that we can come together to solve these issues of critical importance. “Thank, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.” ###
01.08.2019	WASHINGTON - Following President Donald Trump’s address to the nation, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement: “Make no mistake: we have a humanitarian crisis as a result of the 60,000 illegal and inadmissible immigrants a month on the southern border. The President has been abundantly clear that the Democrats need to start working with Republicans – not against them – to reach an agreement on securing our southern border and putting the wellbeing of American citizens first. “Democrats in Washington, D.C. are playing games with the safety and security of each and every town in America. A wall is not just about protecting our southern border, but about stopping human trafficking and the transport of illegal weapons and drugs – in addition to the ability of gang members and terrorists to exploit the holes in our system and take advantage of our good will and American ideals. “As the President said tonight, this is about fulfilling our duty to the citizens we serve. I agree, Mr. President. Let’s work together to secure our border.” ###
01.05.2019	And we’re back! The 116th Congress is now in session, and Senator Joni Ernst will be serving on the following Senate committees in this Congress: Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on Armed Services Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee on the Judiciary Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship Grassley, Ernst Sworn into Senate Leadership For the first time in history, two Iowans are serving in Senate leadership. In case you missed it, in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register, Senator Grassley explains the significance of Senator Ernst’s, and his own, new leadership position. Another prominent Iowan, Douglas Strike, was confirmed by the Senate as the U.S. Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa. The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier details Mr. Strike’s three decades of service and his new responsibilities. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Anniversary December 22, 2018 marked one year since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. According to estimates from the Iowa Department of Revenue, Iowans will save almost $1.8 billion in federal taxes in 2018, and those in Iowa who are earning between $40,000 and $80,000 will receive an average tax cut of $1,128. Senator Ernst penned an op-ed in the Telegraph Herald discussing the impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is having on Iowans across the state. LTE: Senators Aim to Protect Progress in Yemen In case you missed it, Senator Ernst, and her Iowa colleague Senator Grassley, wrote a letter to the editor of The Gazette discussing their stance on the war in Yemen and their opposition to the Yemen Resolution. Ernst and Grassley write: “Peace talks between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels are showing significant progress. We should not put these talks — and long term peace — at jeopardy for the sake of a Resolution that is more about politics than peace.” You can read the full letter, here. Communicating Priorities
01.04.2019	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) will serve on five prominent Senate committees in the 116th Congress, all of which impact the livelihoods of Iowans. “My Senate committees allow me to be a strong voice for Iowans on the issues that most impact the livelihood of folks across the state of Iowa. From defending life and our veterans to supporting our farms and small businesses, I am ready to get back to work,” said Senator Ernst. In the 116th Congress, Senator Ernst will serve on the following committees, representing a broad range of policy issues that will keep the Senator’s schedule packed, as she meets with constituents to understand what matters most to Iowans within these portfolios: Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee on Armed Services Committee on Environment and Public Works Committee on the Judiciary Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship “I look forward to the challenge of this demanding Committee schedule and am grateful to have a voice in almost every issue impacting Iowans,” said Senator Ernst. Senator Ernst will continue to serve on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, where she will continue to address the needs of farmers and rural communities. She will continue her membership on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, where she will hold the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency accountable in the fight to ensure the original intent of the Renewable Fuel Standard is upheld. As the first woman combat veteran elected to the U.S. Senate, Ernst will remain a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, and she will continue to champion commonsense policies for Iowa’s small businesses on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. New as of this Congress, Senator Ernst will serve on the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, where she will work with her colleagues to advance reforms to our justice system that preserve our freedoms, protect the sanctity of life and keep our communities safer. She will also continue her work to push for sensible immigration and border policies that enforce the rule of law while working for Iowa’s economy. Each of these, on their own, are significant committees that require a large amount of time, expertise and staff to support the high-profile state and national significance of each. For example, the Senate Judiciary Committee has broad jurisdiction over the U.S. Department of Justice (including the Federal Bureau of Investigation), a portion of the work of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over the appointment of federal judges and Supreme Court Justices, as well as: immigration, commerce, trade, antitrust law, intellectual property, internet privacy, protecting civil liberties and amending the U.S. Constitution. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), where Senator Ernst chairs the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, has legislative oversight of the U.S. Department of Defense, encompassing the nation’s armed forces, military research and development, nuclear capabilities, space activities, the selective service, strategic national defense and military readiness. ###
01.03.2019	WASHINGTON – Iowan Douglas J. Strike was confirmed by voice vote to serve as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa. Strike was nominated by President Donald Trump after a joint recommendation from Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. “Mr. Strike has a long history of accomplished service, serving and protecting Iowans for three decades. I want to thank my colleagues for confirming him as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa and offer congratulations to Mr. Strike,” Ernst said. “Mr. Strike served as a law enforcement officer in Iowa for over 30 years, equipping him with the knowledge and skills required to successfully carry out this position,” Grassley said. “He will continue to serve the people of Iowa with distinction in this new role.” Strike’s biographical information provided by the White House can be found here and below. Mr. Strike served as Chief of Police for the City of Iowa Falls Police Department from 2001 to 2006.

12.21.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, is calling on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide answers for the agency’s lackluster performance when it comes to suicide prevention outreach. In a letter to VA Secretary Wilkie, Senator Ernst writes, “With approximately 20 veteran suicides every day in the United States, this lack of outreach is simply unacceptable...I am profoundly disappointed to learn that the VA has fallen short in fulfilling this responsibility. We can and must do better for our veterans.” This letter follows a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report detailing a decrease in suicide prevention outreach services at the VA. The outreach fell from 339 in 2016 to 157 in 2017, and through October 2018, there were only 47 outreach efforts. The VA was appropriated $1.7 million for suicide prevention outreach, but has only used around eight percent of their allotment. Ernst asked Secretary Wilkie to respond to the following questions: Do you agree with the GAO’s analysis? If so, do you have an explanation for why this lack of performance was able to continue? Why did the VA not use the full appropriation it was provided? Will the VA commit to increase its suicide prevention outreach efforts? What steps is it undertaking to do so? What safeguards do you have in place to ensure that the program functions better in the future? To read the full letter, click here. ###
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, released the following statement following President Trump’s statement that U.S. troops are being withdrawn from Syria and that ISIS has been defeated: “I am deeply concerned with the administration’s decision to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. Our mission there is to defeat ISIS, and that is yet to be accomplished. We committed to our partners on the ground to see this fight to the end, and we are now turning our back on their good faith efforts and sacrifices. Our departure will only serve to encourage a reemergence of ISIS, embolden Russia, encourage Iran’s malign activity, and deter partners in the Middle East from cooperating with the United States. I have been engaged with White House officials, and I will be seeking a meeting with President Trump to convey my strong opposition to the withdrawal,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA). Background: On December 19, 2018, President Trump tweeted that “We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.” Senator Ernst has reached out to the White House and requested an in-person meeting with President Trump to outline her concerns with a U.S. troop withdraw from Syria. ###
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON – From her efforts to secure $117 million in federal funding for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project to successfully getting E15 year-round to watching the President of the United States sign the VA MISSION Act into law, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spent 2018 fighting for Iowa. “2018 was one for the books! I worked hard, day-in and day-out to deliver real solutions to Iowa. While it is hard to narrow down the year’s work into a few words, watching the VA MISSION Act – bipartisan legislation that improves veterans’ access to health care services – signed into law was one of my proudest moments as a U.S. Senator,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA). Senator Joni Ernst’s Top 2018 Accomplishments: Cedar Rapids: Secured $117 million in federal funds for Cedar Rapids flood mitigation. Regulatory Reforms: Held EPA to fulfilling President Trump’s promise to provide E15 year-round, as well as repealing and replacing the 2015 “waters of the United States rule” (WOTUS). National Security: As a member of the conference committee, she secured a number of provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that help bolster our nation’s security and support our military. Trade Deals: Pushed the administration to open up new markets and finalize trade deals, including the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement to ensure the success of Iowa and America’s agricultural economy. Historic Opioid Legislation: Supported and helped pass historic opioid legislation that included her Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act, which will increase participation in federal prescription drug take-back programs, and her Education Disposal of Unused Opioid Act, which requires Medicare Advantage plans and prescription drug plans to provide information on safe disposals. Making ‘em Squeal: Successfully pushed Senate Leadership to cancel August “recess” and stay in session to work on our nation’s budget and spending bills. Supporting Veterans: Helped secure final passage of the VA MISSION Act, a bipartisan bill signed by President Trump that included Senator Ernst’s bipartisan VETS Act, which will finally allow our rural or homebound veterans in Iowa, and across the U.S., to receive necessary care from the comfort of their homes. Zero Tolerance on Sexual Harassment: Ensured that members of Congress hold themselves to the same standards as the rest of the country, through Senate passage of an anti-sexual harassment bill, the bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) of 1995 Reform Act.

12.20.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) worked hard to get the 2018 Farm Bill, which was signed into law today by President Trump, across the finish line and to secure key provisions that will boost Iowa’s agriculture industry. “The 2018 Farm Bill was a must-do and a big-win for Iowa. The 2018 Farm Bill will strengthen conservation programs, provide critical mental health support to the agriculture community, support our nation’s dairy farmers and maintain a robust crop insurance program,” said Senator Ernst, a member of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee. This Farm Bill, along with the senator’s efforts, are receiving praise from across the state: David Trowbridge, president, Iowa Cattlemen's Association: “The Farm Bill offers crucial certainty for Iowa's cattle producers and farmers. We are encouraged to see ICA's priorities addressed, including authorization and funding of a Foot and Mouth Disease vaccine bank, investment in trade promotion and market access, and reauthorization of key conservation programs. Iowa's cattlemen appreciate the hard work of Congress, especially our own Senator Joni Ernst, to get the Farm Bill over the finish line before the holidays.” Curt Mether, president, Iowa Corn Growers Association (ICGA): “Iowa Corn welcomes the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill before the start of the new year. ICGA is pleased to see there were no cuts to the current crop insurance program and a continuation of the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) … All of these programs are crucial to the success of Iowa’s corn growers and we thank our grower members for your efforts in urging lawmakers to reach a deal before the New Year.” Mike Naig, secretary, Iowa Department of Agriculture: “A new five-year Farm Bill will provide needed certainty and predictability for farmers in what has been a very volatile and challenging time. I commend the efforts by leaders in both the House and Senate, including Sen. Ernst who was a conferee, to finalize the agreement and get it passed.” Craig Hill, president, Iowa Farm Bureau: “We are thankful both the U.S. House and Senate have moved forward with a comprehensive farm bill with strong provisions supporting agriculture, including the reauthorization of critical crop insurance programs, environmental stewardship programs, and Title One provisions that are key to sustainable family farms…We are confident the programs in the new farm bill will help facilitate new market opportunities and provide farmers the tools needed to manage risk.” Gregg Hora, president, Iowa Pork Producers Association: “The Iowa Pork Producers Association applauds Congress on passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. This bill provides guaranteed funding for foreign animal disease prevention and efforts that will help U.S. pig farmers be prepared should an outbreak take place. Iowa pig farmers take much pride in producing safe, affordable protein for consumers in Iowa, the U.S. and around the world. We are thankful for all the hard work Iowa’s Congressional delegation has put toward this effort…” Lindsay Greiner, president, Iowa Soybean Association: “Iowa soybean farmers congratulate members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and the Farm Bill Conference Committee for passing a new farm bill. We also recognize Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst for her leadership on the conference committee in helping craft this important legislation.” Mitch Schulte, executive director, Iowa State Dairy Association: “The Iowa State Dairy Association (ISDA) thanks the House and the Senate for passing a farm bill that includes much needed reforms to dairy programs that will boost producer incomes in a tough economic environment…It is critical for our dairy industry and our representatives to work together during these difficult times. The ISDA thanks Senator Joni Ernst along with the House and Senate for passing a Farm Bill that will have a positive impact on the dairy industry.” Tim Palmer (Truro, IA), president-elect, National Association of Conservation Districts: “…As a fellow Iowan, I particularly appreciate the commitment Senator Ernst made to our home state throughout these farm bill negotiation. Ernst recognizes, as NACD does, that successful implementation of on-the-ground conservation is possible through conservation districts and the locally-led conservation model. Investing in conservation is an investment in the nation’s future, and this agreement continues to make that a priority.” ###
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), joined her colleagues, Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire), Angus King (I-Maine), Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas) and Marco Rubio (R-Florida) in sending a letter to President Donald Trump expressing their concern regarding the consideration to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. “If you decide to follow through with your decision to pull our troops out of Syria, any remnants of ISIS in Syria will surely renew and embolden their efforts in the region. However, ISIS is not the only threat. The brutal dictatorship of Bashar al Assad continues to weigh heavily upon the Syrian people, and we fear that a withdrawal of our troops may embolden Bashar al Assad to take further actions to solidify his power,” the Senators wrote. They continued, “The withdrawal of American presence from Syria also bolsters two other adversaries to the United States, Iran and Russia. As you are aware, both Iran and Russia have used the Syrian conflict as a stage to magnify their influence in the region. Any sign of weakness perceived by Iran or Russia will only result in their increased presence in the region and a decrease in the trust of our partners and allies. Your administration must not repeat the same mistakes that previous administrations have made and concede to these bad actors.” The full text of the letter is below. December 19, 2018 The Honorable Donald J. Trump The President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write today to express our concern regarding your Administration’s consideration to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria. We believe that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States, but also emboldens ISIS, Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia. The United States currently retains a small and limited military presence within Syria. The approximately 2,000 American troops stationed in Syria serve as a vital shield against ISIS cells operating within Northeast Syria. While you believe the threat of ISIS has dissipated, the conditions on the ground paint a very different picture. In addition, our troops provide critical support for our Kurdish partners, who have been crucial in the fight against ISIS. If our Kurdish partners in the region lose the support of the United States, we run the risk of a resurgence of ISIS and the possible capitulation or all out destruction of Kurdish resistance in the region. Furthermore, hundreds of foreign fighters being held in captivity by our Kurdish partners are at risk of being released or worse if our support is withdrawn. If you decide to follow through with your decision to pull our troops out of Syria, any remnants of ISIS in Syria will surely renew and embolden their efforts in the region. However, ISIS is not the only threat. The brutal dictatorship of Bashar al Assad continues to weigh heavily upon the Syrian people, and we fear that a withdrawal of our troops may embolden Bashar al Assad to take further actions to solidify his power. The withdrawal of American presence from Syria also bolsters two other adversaries to the United States, Iran and Russia. As you are aware, both Iran and Russia have used the Syrian conflict as a stage to magnify their influence in the region. Any sign of weakness perceived by Iran or Russia will only result in their increased presence in the region and a decrease in the trust of our partners and allies. Your administration must not repeat the same mistakes that previous administrations have made and concede to these bad actors. In conclusion, we encourage you to reconsider your proposal to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria to ensure that our nation’s strategic interests are secured. Sincerely, Lindsey O. Graham Jeanne Shaheen United States Senator United States Senator Joni Ernst Angus S. King Jr. United States Senator United States Senator Tom Cotton Marco Rubio United States Senator United States Senator ###
12.20.2018	WASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed the bipartisan First Step Act this week, legislation to reduce recidivism and improve fairness in sentencing of federal crimes. “The First Step Act will reduce recidivism, improve fairness in federal sentencing and help low-risk inmates prepare to rejoin society. I also believe the First Step Act will help women, especially mothers, in our justice system by addressing their unique needs,” said Senator Joni Ernst, an original cosponsor of the First Step Act. On Tuesday, December 18, 2018 the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan First Step Act. The legislation was approved by a vote of 87-12. The First Step Act will now go to the United States House of Representatives for a vote, and then, if passed, to President Trump’s desk for signature. The First Step Act aims to improve fairness by: recalibrating certain mandatory minimum sentences; providing greater discretion for judges in sentencing of low-level, nonviolent drug crimes; and, clarifying congressional intent on sentencing enhancements for certain crimes involving firearms. The comprehensive and bipartisan legislation provides opportunities for low-risk inmates to rejoin society, while ensuring that dangerous criminals stay behind bars. Under The First Step Act, each inmate is evaluated using data-driven risk and needs assessment tools and only those who are found to be low or minimum risk may benefit from earned time credits. Conviction for a number of serious offenses disqualifies inmates from earning time credits. Earned time credits created by the bill do not reduce an inmate’s sentence. Rather, they allow the inmate to serve out a portion of the term in pre-release custody. Inmates that are eligible only receive the credits upon successful completion of the evidence-based recidivism reduction and professional development programs. These are created by the Attorney General, in conjunction with an independent review committee selected by the National Institute of Justice. There is an overwhelming trend over the past few decades that shows women, especially mothers, going to prison at higher and higher rates. Women are the fastest growing segment of the prison population, outpacing men by more than 50 percent since 1980, and about two-thirds of incarcerated women are mothers to children under the age of 18. The First Step Act is backed by a number of organizations, including: National Fraternal Order of Police; 172 former federal prosecutors; Sheriffs across the country; National Governors Association, which represents the governors of all 50 states; and, A broad coalition of conservative and progressive groups along with a host of business leaders and faith-based organizations. ###
12.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released audio of her year-end message highlighting her hard work for the people of Iowa over this past year. “2018 was one for the books! I worked hard, day-in and day-out to deliver real solutions to Iowa. I love our state, and I love the people in it. I’m truly blessed by the opportunity to serve as your United States Senator. While it is hard to narrow down the year’s work, I’ve highlighted a number of my accomplishments from throughout the year. May God bless you and yours this holiday season,” said Senator Ernst. To download the full audio recording, click here. The full script is below: Hi, this is your United States Senator, Joni Ernst. 2018 was one for the books! I worked hard, day-in and day-out to deliver real solutions to Iowa. While it is hard to narrow down the year’s work, I’d like to take a moment to highlight some of my accomplishments from throughout the year. First off, I was able to help secure $117 million in federal funds for Cedar Rapids flood mitigation, something the people of Cedar Rapids had been waiting for, for over a decade. When it comes to regulatory reform, there were a number of big wins in 2018. I held the Environmental Protection Agency to fulfilling President Trump’s promise of granting the sale of E15 year-round, as well as repealing and replacing the burdensome 2015 “waters of the United States” rule. Turning to national security, as a member of the National Defense Authorization Act Conference Committee, I secured a number of my provisions in this year’s NDAA that will bolster our nation’s security and support our military, like my legislation to treat and raise awareness of traumatic brain injuries among our servicemembers. On the trade front, as you all know, it’s been a roller coaster ride. I have been pushing the Administration to open new markets and finalize trade deals, like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement, to ensure we provide a pathway to success for Iowa’s agriculture economy. The Senate also took action on the growing opioid crisis, and we passed historic, bipartisan opioid legislation, that’s now law. This bipartisan legislation included two of my bills: one of which increases participation in federal prescription drug take-back programs; and another that requires Medicare Advantage plans and prescription drug plans to provide information on safe disposals. You all sent me to Washington to cut wasteful spending and of course to, “make ‘em squeal,” and I am continuing to deliver on that promise. Earlier this year, I successfully pushed Senate leadership to cancel our August recess and stay in session to work on our nation’s budget and spending bills; one of our fundamental jobs. One of my proudest moments as a U.S. Senator was watching the VA MISSION Act--bipartisan legislation that improves veterans’ access to health care services-- be signed into law. I helped to secure final passage of the bill, and was thrilled to see my VETS Act included, which will finally allow our rural or homebound veterans in Iowa, and across the U.S., to receive necessary care from the comfort of their homes. One last area I’d like to highlight is my work on bipartisan anti-sexual harassment legislation. There is no place for sexual harassment in our schools, workplaces, military or anywhere else. This legislation, which unanimously passed the House and the Senate last week, will ensure members of Congress are held to the same standards as the rest of the country when it comes to sexual harassment. Lastly, I want to say thank you. I love Iowa. I love the people of Iowa, and I am truly blessed by the opportunity to serve as your United States Senator. I will continue to work hard and fight for you every day. May God bless you and yours this holiday season. And may God bless these great United States of America. ###
12.15.2018	WASHINGTON - Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement today after a federal judge in Texas ruled Obamacare unconstitutional: “Too many Iowa families and businesses have been hurt by the painful effects of Obamacare – from rising costs, to losing access to doctors, to hampering businesses’ ability to hire new employees. “Health care reform should be focused on choice, not mandates. Yet, it is important that we protect people with pre-existing conditions, as we repeal and replace Obamacare. To guarantee the availability of coverage in the individual or group market, including people with pre-existing conditions, I cosponsored legislation that would prohibit discrimination against beneficiaries based on health status. I urge my colleagues to join me, and Sen. Tillis, in protecting people with pre-existing conditions by helping us ensure this bill becomes law.” Background: On December 14, 2018, a federal judge in Texas v. United States issued a declaratory judgement, stating that the Affordable Care Act (ACA or “Obamacare”) is unconstitutional. His ruling is based on the elimination of the tax penalty for the Individual Mandate in the ACA that was included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which goes into effect in January 2019. The judge entered a declaratory judgement, not an injunction, which means that individuals are still able to purchase insurance through the health care exchange. Senator Ernst works to ensure that patients with pre-existing conditions are not penalized in our health insurance system, and to ensure that Iowans, especially those in rural communities, continue to have access to the services they need. Senator Ernst cosponsored Senator Thom Tillis’ (R-NC) “Ensuring Coverage for Patients with Pre-Existing Conditions Act,” legislation that guarantees the availability of coverage in the individual or group market, for all Americans, including those with pre-existing conditions, regardless of the outcome in Texas v. United States. The legislation prohibits discrimination against beneficiaries based on health status, including the prohibition against increased premiums for beneficiaries due to pre-existing conditions.
12.15.2018	WEEK IN REVIEW December 10 – December 15, 2018 What a week for our farmers, ranchers and rural communities! The Senate and House passed the 2018 Farm Bill, and it’s now on President Trump’s desk for signature. And, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a replacement rule for the burdensome 2015 Obama-era “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule. PROVIDING CERTAINTY FOR FARMERS Senator Ernst was a proud member of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee, and through her position on the committee, was able to secure key provisions that greatly impact the people of Iowa. For example: ü Strengthening the Conservation Reserve and Regional Conservation Partnership Programs ü Providing critical mental health for our farmers through the senator’s FARMERS FIRST Act ü Supporting our nation’s dairy farmers through a Diary Incentive Pilot Program ü Protecting farmers against adverse changes in market conditions by strengthening the Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Level Program WHAT THEY ARE SAYING ON THE FARM BILL David Trowbridge, president, Iowa Cattlemen's Association: “The Farm Bill offers crucial certainty for Iowa's cattle producers and farmers. We are encouraged to see ICA's priorities addressed, including authorization and funding of a Foot and Mouth Disease vaccine bank, investment in trade promotion and market access, and reauthorization of key conservation programs. Iowa's cattlemen appreciate the hard work of Congress, especially our own Senator Joni Ernst, to get the Farm Bill over the finish line before the holidays." Lindsay Greiner, president, Iowa Soybean Association: “Iowa soybean farmers congratulate members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees and the Farm Bill Conference Committee for passing a new farm bill. We also recognize Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst for her leadership on the conference committee in helping craft this important legislation.” Mike Naig, secretary, Iowa Department of Agriculture: “A new five-year Farm Bill will provide needed certainty and predictability for farmers in what has been a very volatile and challenging time. I commend the efforts by leaders in both the House and Senate, including Sen. Ernst who was a conferee, to finalize the agreement and get it passed. I encourage President Trump to sign the bill into law quickly so farmers can know what federal policy will be as they continue to plan for the 2019 growing season.” Mitch Schulte, executive director, Iowa State Dairy Association: “The Iowa State Dairy Association (ISDA) thanks the House and the Senate for passing a farm bill that includes much needed reforms to dairy programs that will boost producer incomes in a tough economic environment…It is critical for our dairy industry and our representatives to work together during these difficult times. The ISDA thanks Senator Joni Ernst along with the House and Senate for passing a Farm Bill that will have a positive impact on the dairy industry.” Curt Mether, president, Iowa Corn Growers Association (ICGA): “Iowa Corn welcomes the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill before the start of the new year. ICGA is pleased to see there were no cuts to the current crop insurance program and a continuation of the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) … All of these programs are crucial to the success of Iowa’s corn growers and we thank our grower members for your efforts in urging lawmakers to reach a deal before the New Year.” Tim Palmer (Truro, IA), president-elect, National Association of Conservation Districts: “…As a fellow Iowan, I particularly appreciate the commitment Senator Ernst made to our home state throughout these farm bill negotiation. Ernst recognizes, as NACD does, that successful implementation of on-the-ground conservation is possible through conservation districts and the locally-led conservation model. Investing in conservation is an investment in the nation’s future, and this agreement continues to make that a priority.” ROLLING BACK THE 2015 WOTUS RULE Taking the Obama Administration’s flawed WOTUS rule off the books has been one of Senator Ernst’s top priorities. In 2015, she introduced legislation to nullify the rule. With help from many of her congressional colleagues, the lawmakers got this legislation to President Obama’s desk – only for him to veto it. That setback didn’t stop them from pushing forward. The new proposed WOTUS rule will establish clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as “WOTUS.” Iowa’s farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses can now breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that, going forward, a tire track that collects rain water won’t be regulated by the federal government. MAKING ‘EM SQUEAL The U.S. Forest Service has an extensive history of mishandling the repeated claims of sexual assault and harassment within their agency. For example, earlier this year, Tony Tooke, the former chief, was accused of multiple sexual misconduct allegations, resulting in his resignation. Furthermore, multiple women have filed class-action lawsuits against the Forest Service, shedding light on the inadequacy of the agency’s culture. During a recent Senate Agriculture Committee hearing, Senator Ernst worked to get to the bottom of not just why sexual misbehavior was happening but continuing to happen at the U.S. Forest Service. For this reason, this month’s Squeal Award goes to the U.S. Forest Service for allowing taxpayer dollars to subsidize sexual misconduct within its ranks. BRINGING IOWA TO WASHINGTON Every Thursday, Republican Senators take turns hosting lunch for their colleagues highlighting products and traditions from their home states. This week, Senator Ernst hosted and provided “fare from the Iowa State Fair.” The Des Moines Register characterized it by saying, “Joni Ernst hosted a State-Fair themed lunch and it’s the most Iowa thing ever.” Included in the menu, were: Hot Beef Sundaes Iowa Pork Chops Ice Cream from LeMars, IA Loaded Tater Tot On-a-Stick Mexican Street Corn Butter Cows with Rolls COMMUNICATING PRIORITIES
12.14.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), released the following statement following the Senate passage of a congressional anti-sexual harassment bill by unanimous consent: “There is no place for sexual harassment in our schools, workplaces, military or anywhere else. It is critical that Congress have zero-tolerance for this type of behavior. The bipartisan anti-sexual harassment bill passed by the Senate today will ensure that members of Congress hold themselves to the same standards as the rest of the country,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Background: This bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) of 1995 Reform Act will ensure that members of Congress hold themselves to the same standards as businesses and individuals across the country. The legislation ensures that members of Congress, their staffs and all employees of the Legislative Branch are provided with the necessary training on prevention and reporting procedures to combat sexual harassment in the workplace. Additional details on the CAA Reform Act include: The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act would update and strengthen the procedures available to victims of harassment and discrimination and other violations of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. The legislation holds members of the Senate and the House personally accountable by requiring them to pay for acts of harassment, intimidation or reprisal they personally commit against an employee based on any protected class including race, color, religion, sex, national origin, genetic information, age, disability or veteran’s status. The CAA ensures Members who leave office will still be responsible for repayment, including garnishing non- government wages and retirement annuities to ensure full accountability. The bill provides employees with immediate access to a dedicated advocate who will provide confidential consultation and assistance throughout any proceedings before the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, including assistance with drafting of a claim. ###
12.14.2018	WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today announced U.S. Service Academy nominations for 33 high school seniors from across the state of Iowa. “As a combat veteran, and mother of a West Point plebe, it’s truly an honor to nominate these qualified Iowa students for admittance to our U.S. Service Academies. Each of these students has exemplified strong leadership, dedication to academics and commitment to community service. This nomination is an important step in the admissions process, and I’m proud to assist these students in reaching their goal of serving our nation in uniform,” said Senator Ernst. Each year, Senator Ernst nominates Iowa students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. To learn more about the service academy nomination process, click here. Below is a complete list of the students nominated by Senator Ernst for the Class of 2023. U.S. Air Force Academy: James Baker – Bettendorf* Nathan Brush – Clive Mitchell Clements – North Liberty Josiah Cole – Altoona Cory Critchlow – Carlisle Charles Haefner – Cedar Rapids Adam Laubenthal – Davenport Michael McCurry – Cedar Rapids William Rankin – Hull Kassidy Rashid – Burlington Britain Saluri – Des Moines* Hunter Sherry – Boone Josiah Stearns – Windsor Heights Micah Treptau – Lansing Olivia Wong – Ames Gabriel Yingst – Woodward U.S. Naval Academy: Faith Bonilla – Bettendorf Daunte Burns – Dyersville Aiden DeWitt – Dubuque* Abram Dierickx – Lowden Alex Hooker – Webster City Dara Hulstein – Cedar Falls Will Jefferson – Le Claire* William Jones – Council Bluffs* Allison Mitchell – Clinton Kyle Otte – Clive U.S. Military Academy at West Point: James Baker – Bettendorf* Elias Brehm – Dubuque Aiden DeWitt – Dubuque* Jack Gehl – Asbury Anders Grau – United Kingdom Grace Greer – Iowa City Williams Jones – Council Bluffs* Cole Mabry – Iowa City Carson Parker – Story City Grace Ries – Asbury U.S. Merchant Marine Academy: Will Jefferson – Le Claire* Britain Saluri – Des Moines* *The admissions process to the service academies is highly competitive, and Senator Ernst encourages students to apply for more than one academy. This denotes students who are being nominated for both their first and second choice of service academy.
12.14.2018	WASHINGTON – Iowa Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, released the following statement about her vote against “the Sanders-Lee Yemen Resolution” that invokes the 1973 War Powers Resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 54) and her co-sponsorship of the Joint Resolution “Supporting a Diplomatic Solution in Yemen and Condemning the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi” (Senate Joint Resolution 69): “I condemn the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and support a diplomatic solution to the war in Yemen. That is why I cosponsored a resolution that explicitly calls for a diplomatic solution to the war in Yemen, while also holding the Saudi Crown Prince responsible for Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. By cosponsoring Resolution 69, I am supporting peace talks between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels in Sweden, which are showing significant promise – including a ceasefire in the port city of Hodeidah, which was agreed to yesterday. “Some of my colleagues pushed to make the Yemen resolution a referendum on Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi; however, invoking the War Powers Resolution when our troops are not engaged in hostilities sets a bad precedent and could hamstring U.S. strategic goals in the region.” Background: S.J. Res. 54, “the Sanders-Lee Yemen Resolution” uses the War Powers Resolution to justify withdrawing support to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. In her statement about this resolution on November 30, 2018, Senator Ernst explained that she voted against this resolution “because U.S. forces are not directly engaged in hostilities in Yemen, the premise of the resolution is flawed,” and because “members of the coalition in Yemen are strategic allies to the U.S. and greatly assist our counterterrorism and stability operations in the region.” In addition to not directly citing Jamal Khashoggi, S.J. Res 54 also adopted an amendment which defined “hostilities” to include refueling Saudi aircraft, something that the United States is no longer doing; thanks in part, to Senator Ernst’s engagement earlier this year with Secretaries Mattis and Pompeo to request that the United States cease its refueling support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the United States recently announced that support would no longer be provided by the United States, with Saudi Arabia now taking full responsibility for refueling missions connected to the civil war in Yemen. Through her actions, Senator Ernst has supported holding Saudi Arabia accountable and finding a diplomatic solution to the war in Yemen, but believes that invoking the War Powers Resolution in the way it is used in S.J. Res. 54 is setting bad precedent and is not the appropriate vehicle for holding Saudi Arabia accountable. By cosponsoring S.J. Res. 69, Senator Ernst is: Showing that she believes that the Saudi Crown Prince is responsible for Khashoggi’s murder and should be held accountable; Cautioning the Saudi government against closer ties with Russia and China; Admonishing Iran for supplying Houthi rebels; Supporting an end to the refueling of Saudi planes that carry out strikes on civilians; Acknowledging there is no statutory authorization for U.S. involvement in hostilities in Yemen’s civil war; and, Calling for a diplomatic end to the war in Yemen.
12.11.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ proposed rule, released today, to define “waters of the United States” (WOTUS). This rule replaces the Obama Administration’s 2015 WOTUS rule, which gave the federal government authority to regulate water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. “For years, people impacted by Obama’s WOTUS rule have been in a state of regulatory limbo. The proposed WOTUS rule, released by the Trump EPA, provides much needed predictability and certainty by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a ‘WOTUS.’ Iowa’s farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses can breathe a sigh of relief, knowing that, going forward, a tire track that collects rain water won’t be regulated by the federal government. I want to thank the EPA, under Acting Administrator Wheeler’s leadership, for ensuring this WOTUS replacement rule was released quickly, and properly, to provide much-needed regulatory certainty to the people of Iowa.” Background: In 2015, the Obama Administration finalized a rule that expanded the definition of WOTUS, creating confusion and burdensome red tape for the agriculture industry and many others. This harmful rule was developed while former Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack served as President Obama’s Secretary of Agriculture. Understanding the problems the expanded definition of WOTUS posed for Iowa’s farmers and ranchers, Senator Ernst led the fight against this federal overreach in Congress. In September 2015, she introduced S.J.Res.22, a joint resolution of disapproval that would have nullified the Obama Administration’s rule. After passing both the House and Senate, S.J.Res.22 was vetoed by President Obama. Soon after taking office in 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing EPA and Army Corps to develop a replacement for the Obama Administration’s WOTUS rule. New EPA WOTUS rule highlights: Outlines six clearly defined categories of waters that will be considered “waters of the United States” Clarifies that most ditches should not be subject to federal control Clarifies that groundwater, prior converted cropland and storm water control systems in upland areas are not subject to federal jurisdiction Excludes ephemeral features that only contain water during rainfall from federal regulation Restores the balance under the Clean Water Act between waters subject to federal jurisdiction and those subject to state/tribal jurisdiction
12.11.2018	WASHINGTON – After months of hard-work and negotiation, the U.S. Senate passed the 2018 Farm Bill today, with strong bipartisan support. “The 2018 Farm Bill is farmer-focused and welcome news for Iowa. From strengthening conservation programs to providing critical mental health support through my FARMERS FIRST Act, the 2018 Farm Bill provides certainty for our farmers and strong support for our rural communities. I am proud to support the 2018 Farm Bill and would like to thank all the Iowans across the state who provided valuable information and feedback throughout this long process,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Senator Joni Ernst is a member of the Conference Committee and is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy. The 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee released the final text of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Report on December 10, 2018 and the final bill passed the Senate today (December 11, 2018). The 2018 Farm Bill provides much-needed certainty and predictability for Iowa producers, and all of rural America, and is the result of years of bipartisan work across the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. The 2018 Farm Bill includes many of Senator Ernst’s priorities: Strengthening Conservation Programs: Portions of the bipartisan Give Our Resources the Opportunity to Work (GROW) Act of 2018 will revise and strengthen the current provisions of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). And, provisions from the bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act will strengthen the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and incentivize rural and urban partnerships for conservation. Providing Critical Mental Health Support for Farmers: The entirety of the bipartisan Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act was included and will provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources. Supporting Our Nation’s Dairy Farmers: The 2018 Farm Bill includes a proposal for a pilot program that would encourage Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to purchase more milk to improve participants’ diets, especially lower-income families with children. Protecting Farmers Against Adverse Changes in Market Conditions: Provisions from bipartisan legislation that strengthen and improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC)-County Level program are included in the 2018 Farm Bill, specifically provisions that: require payments to be based on the physical location of a farm; prioritize the use of actual county yield data; encourage the Secretary to pro rate base acres and payments where appropriate; and, prioritize the yields compiled by the Risk Management Agency (RMA) as the data for ARC.
12.04.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), today, released the following statement with regard to the ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and China, following President Trump’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping during the G20 Summit in Argentina: “Maintaining and creating new market access is vital to Iowa farmers. I hear from many Iowans about the importance of standing up to China’s unfair trade practices, and making progress on rebalancing the trade imbalance between our two countries. While we are still waiting for more specifics, new purchases of agricultural products will help Iowa farmers and manufacturers.” Background: During the G20 Summit in Argentina November 30-December 1, President Trump and President Xi Jinping discussed the ongoing trade negotiations with China. The U.S. agreed to delay tariff increases on $200 billion of Chinese goods, which were scheduled to rise from 10 percent to 25 percent on January 1. China now has 90 days to work with the U.S. to strike a deal on an array of issues, including: the large trade imbalance between the two countries, intellectual property concerns and forced technology transfers. According to President Trump, China has agreed to purchase more U.S. products, including “a very substantial amount of agriculture, energy, industrial and other products from the U.S. to reduce the trade imbalance.”
12.01.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on the passing of George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States: “I join the nation today in honoring our nation’s 41st president, George H.W. Bush. He was a beloved husband, father and grandfather, a veteran and a true American leader. “Like our forefathers who came before him, George H.W. Bush was committed to furthering the ideals that this country was built upon, in a way that will transcend his life. He showed us that relationships matter, people matter, freedom matters. “When I was deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom, all Kuwaitis, especially the police force, were so appreciative of Americans and viewed George H.W. Bush as their savior. His commitment to sharing the American value of freedom and democracy with the Kuwaiti people helped secure America’s partnerships with the region ever since. “We owe so much of our nation’s enduring peace, security and prosperity to George H.W. Bush, and, I personally am ever grateful for his leadership and service to our country. “My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family during this time.”
11.30.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, issued the following statement with regard to the signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). “President Trump has fulfilled another of his promises in renegotiating our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico—two of Iowa’s major trade partners. The USMCA is a good step for Iowa farmers and manufacturers, and I look forward to working with my colleagues as we consider this important agreement,” said Senator Ernst. Background: On October 1, 2018, the Trump Administration announced the USMCA, a renegotiation of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Today, in Argentina, U.S. President Donald Trump, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signed the agreement. The USMCA now heads to Congress. The new trade agreement modernizes provisions and seeks to rebalance the countries’ trade to better serve the interests of American farmers, workers and businesses. However, the USMCA does not eliminate the steel and aluminum tariffs in place with Canada and Mexico, something that is significantly impacting Iowa’s farmers, especially the state’s pork producers. Specific to agriculture: Food and agriculture will trade more fairly, including dairy: Canada will eliminate its “Class 6” and “Class 7” programs that allow low-priced dairy ingredients to undersell U.S. dairy products in Canada and in third country markets. U.S. farmers will have new access to Canadian agriculture markets: Canada will provide important new access for U.S. dairy products, eggs and poultry. New standards will protect agriculture trade: The new agreement sets unprecedented standards for agricultural biotechnology, establishes protections to reduce intellectual property theft and ensures data can be safely transmitted across border lines.
11.30.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), David Perdue (R-GA) and James Lankford (R-OK) comment on the Joint Select Committee for Budget and Appropriations Reform: “The Joint Select Committee was our chance to make meaningful changes to Congress’ broken budget process – instead, it turned out to be a lost opportunity. This is completely irresponsible. Throughout the process we had bipartisan discussions of ideas that could have fixed the way Congress funds the federal government and addressed our debt. Most of these ideas were met with little disagreement in conversation but suddenly received major pushback when it was time to put the ideas into action. We offered amendments to end Washington’s addiction to continuing resolutions and to hold members of Congress accountable for finishing the budget job on time. This should have been commonsense, but yet again political self-interest stood in the way of significant results. After eight months of work, there is no excuse for settling for the status quo. We are committed to continuing our efforts next year to responsibly fix the federal government’s funding process.” Senators Ernst, Perdue and Lankford introduced amendments that would have achieved the following priorities: Milestones With Consequences: Create a series of milestones for passing a budget and appropriations bills to keep Congress on track to fund the government on time. Coupled with changing the fiscal year, these milestones would provide more certainty for our military and other federal agencies. (Offered by Senator Perdue) No Budget, No Recess: If the Senate has not approved a budget and spending bills on time, then the Senate would be unable to adjourn for over eight hours; no funding would be available for official travel; and, two quorum calls would be held per day to prevent senators from leaving Washington. (Offered by Senators Ernst and Lankford) No Budget, No Travel: If the Senate has not passed a budget and appropriations bills on time, then the Senate is prevented from taking any official travel (Offered by Senator Ernst). Change The Fiscal Year Ending From September 30 To December 31: Matching the fiscal year with the calendar year gives Congress more time to pass a budget and all of the appropriations bills. (Offered by Senator Perdue) Change Budget Committee Membership: Changes the membership of the Senate Budget Committee to be six members of the majority, five members of the minority and the chair and ranking members of the Appropriations and Finance committees. (Offered by Senators Lankford and Bennet) Establish Bipartisan Budget Resolution In Senate: Creates a separate path in the Senate for a bipartisan budget resolution. The resolution would be required to establish fiscal goals for the path of the debt- to-GDP ratio as well as a glide path for health care spending, tax expenditures, discretionary spending, and total revenues. (Offered by Senators Perdue and Whitehouse) Make The Budget A Law: Change the budget from a concurrent resolution to a joint resolution, making it require the signature of the President and carry the force of law. (Offered by Senator Perdue) Require 60 Votes: Raise the vote threshold for final passage of a budget resolution in the Senate from 51 votes to 60 votes, which is 3/5 of all Senators. This forces bipartisanship throughout the entire budget process while retaining the privileged nature of the budget resolution and matches the 60 vote requirement of the appropriations process. (Offered by Senator Perdue) End “Vote-a-rama”: End vote-a-rama by requiring all amendments to be debated on and voted on within 50 hours of consideration. This would expedite the passage of a budget by limiting frivolous messaging amendments. (Offered by Senator Perdue) Eliminate Gimmicks: Eliminate budgeting gimmicks by cracking down on the use of Changes In Mandatory Programs (CHIMPs) in the appropriations process that produce billions in hidden overspending. (Offered by Senator Lankford) Change Reconciliation Process: Reconciliation is a powerful tool to get around the Senate filibuster. This amendment makes it a required part of the budget rather than an optional part. (Offered by Senator Lankford) The Joint Select Committee was established by Congress on February 9, 2018 and is composed of 16 Members of Congress: four Senate Republicans – including Senators Perdue, Lankford, and Ernst – four Senate Democrats, four House Republicans, and four House Democrats. The members had until the ending of the calendar year to agree on changes to the budget and appropriations process and present them to Congress for a full vote. On November 29, the select committee’s product did not receive the votes required to move forward.
11.30.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a rule that sets the renewable fuel volumes under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program for 2019 and biomass-based diesel for 2020. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement. “The release of the final Renewable Volume Blending Obligations (RVO) for 2019 provides farmers and ethanol producers much needed transparency and certainty. However, it is disappointing that the gallons lost through the unprecedented handing out of small refinery waivers was not addressed. After meeting with Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler on Wednesday, I’m hopeful that we’re done with former Administrator Pruitt’s mishandling of the RFS and waiver process. Now that this rule is finalized, the EPA needs to move forward in fulfilling President Trump’s promise of E-15 year-round,” said Senator Ernst. Background: The EPA proposed 2019 volume requirements for conventional, advanced and cellulosic biofuels, as well as the 2020 requirement for biomass-based diesel, on June 26, 2018, and the final rule was issued today.
11.30.2018	WASHINGTON –The U.S. Senate recently passed legislation cosponsored by Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) that would reauthorize the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for another five years. Established in 2003, PEPFAR is the U.S. government’s global effort to combat HIV/AIDS and the largest global health program devoted to a single disease. “For over a decade, PEPFAR has provided access to lifesaving treatment to those suffering from HIV/AIDS. This legislation will ensure that for years to come, the U.S. will continue to take a leading role in the fight against this horrendous epidemic. I urge President Trump to swiftly sign this legislation into law,” said Senator Ernst. Background: The PEPFAR Extension Act of 2018 continues authorization and oversight of PEPFAR through Fiscal Years (FY) 2023 and 2024 to ensure prevention and treatment services remain available to those in need. Specifically, the bill extends provisions through FY23 that: Require more than half of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for bilateral HIV be expended for treatment, care, nutrition and food support for people living with HIV; Require no less than 10 percent of funds appropriated or otherwise made available for bilateral HIV be expended for programs targeting orphans and other children affected by, of vulnerable to, HIV; Limit U.S. contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and Malaria (Global Fund) to 33 percent of funds contributed from all sources; Authorize that any of the U.S. contributions to the Global Fund that were withheld due to the 1/3 cap may be used for bilateral HIV, TB and malaria programs; and, Require the Inspectors General of the Department of State, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Agency for International Development, to coordinate and conduct oversight of PEPFAR programs.
11.30.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, issued the following statement with regard to the signing of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). “President Trump has fulfilled another of his promises in renegotiating our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico—two of Iowa’s major trade partners. The USMCA is a good step for Iowa farmers and manufacturers, and I look forward to working with my colleagues as we consider this important agreement,” said Senator Ernst.

11.29.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pushed for bold changes to the broken budget process this week with a series of common-sense amendments to prevent senators from leaving Washington if they fail to pass a budget and spending bills on time. “We had a real opportunity to make bold and much-needed changes to the way we do business in Congress. The amendments I put forward would hold Washington accountable and prevent the Senate from taking a break before our job of funding the government is done. But once again, here we are, with no real fix to this broken process. I am very disappointed in my Democratic colleagues who chose to preserve their vacations and the dysfunctional status quo instead of working together to fund the government responsibly,” said Senator Ernst. Background: During the Joint Select Committee for Budget and Appropriations Reform business meeting on Tuesday, November 27, Ernst offered four amendments similar to her No Budget, No Vacation Act. All four of the amendments received nine votes in support and six votes in opposition, but they failed to receive support from a majority of each party, and therefore did not pass. A summary of her amendments, is below: Under Senator Ernst’s first amendment, if the Senate has not approved a budget and spending bills on time, then the Senate would be unable to adjourn for over eight hours; no funding would be available for official travel; and, two quorum calls would be held per day. Her second amendment would apply these penalties only if the Senate fails to pass appropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year. Her third amendment would apply these penalties only if the Senate fails to pass a budget by May 1. Her fourth amendment would prevent members from any official travel if they have not passed a budget and appropriations bills on time. Senator Ernst also supported an amendment from Representatives Arrington (R-TX) and Kilmer (D-WA) to create similar penalties in the House of Representatives, and she supported amendments from Senator Perdue (R-GA) to establish milestones throughout the funding process and to connect these milestones to penalties.
11.29.2018	WASHINGTON– U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and 23 additional senators in sending a letter to President Donald Trump urging him to consider the key factors that underpin the continued viability of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START). Those factors include a sustained and vigorous U.S. nuclear weapons modernization program, strict compliance by Russia with its arms control obligations, and a true balance of nuclear capabilities between the parties to the Treaty. The letter, led by Senator Kyl, is cosigned by Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), John Hoeven (R-ND), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Roger Wicker (R-MS). “We remain committed to funding the necessary resources for the U.S. nuclear weapons modernization program and we support the rigorous review of continued viability of the New START the Administration is undertaking. We know you agree that arms control is not an end to itself; it is but a single tool that may be used to advance U.S. national security when carefully considered,” the senators wrote. The full text of the letter is below and attached. November 28, 2018 The Honorable Donald J. Trump President The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Trump: As you review the future of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), we respectfully request that you consider the key factors that underpin its viability: The value of the Treaty depends on a sustained and vigorous U.S. nuclear weapons modernization program, strict compliance by Russia with its arms control obligations, and a true balance of nuclear capabilities between the parties to the Treaty. As to the first point, the Senate declared in the New START Resolution of Ratification, “the United States is committed to proceeding with a robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining and modernizing the nuclear weapons production capabilities and capacities that will ensure the safety, reliability, and performance of the United States nuclear arsenal at the New START Treaty levels.” Regrettably, the infrastructure and weapons capabilities that were pledged at the time the Senate gave its consent to the Treaty have been significantly delayed or reduced in scope. This risks further worsening of asymmetry between the Russian and U.S. nuclear weapon infrastructure capabilities. We believe that continued funding of the U.S. strategic modernization program, including for low-yield warhead options, as proposed in your Nuclear Posture Review (NPR), is critical in the face of dangerous international security developments since the New START was ratified. As to the second point, the Russian Federation is in material breach of its arms control commitments, including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty by developing, producing, and deploying a ground-launched cruise missile and launcher. As your NPR highlights, Russia has been adopting “military strategies and capabilities that rely on nuclear escalation for their success.” Third, in the New START Resolution of Ratification, the Senate called upon the President to pursue “an agreement with the Russian Federation that would address the disparity between the tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of the United States…in a verifiable manner.” We note with regret that despite the best efforts of successive presidential administrations, the Russian Federation has not been amenable to such an agreement. In fact, Russia has increased the role of nuclear forces and their types and variety since 2010. Russia has even adopted an “escalate to deescalate” or “escalate to win” strategy for nuclear employment. The Russian Federation has unveiled new nuclear weapons that are not subject to limitations set forth by the New START, including a new nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered undersea autonomous torpedo. In addition to an extensive nuclear weapons modernization program including all legs of its nuclear triad, the Russian Federation “possesses significant advantages in its nuclear weapons production capacity,” as your NPR points out. The New START does not expire until 2021. We urge you to consider the following as a part of the review of the national security interest of the United States and its allies to extend or replace the Treaty: The status of the modernization of U.S. nuclear weapons and associated infrastructure and the risk of instability created by Russia’s modernization programs; The imbalance posed by Russia’s nuclear weapons capabilities that are limited by arms control with Russia and those that are not, including so-called non-strategic nuclear weapons (where Russia holds at least a ten-to-one advantage over the United States) and the systems Russian President Vladimir Putin unveiled in March of this year; Russia’s systemic abuse of arms control and international norms; and The possibility of having to deal with more than one peer competitor at a time, which calls into question the limits on U.S. warheads. We remain committed to funding the necessary resources for the U.S. nuclear weapons modernization program and we support the rigorous review of continued viability of the New START the Administration is undertaking. We know you agree that arms control is not an end to itself; it is but a single tool that may be used to advance U.S. national security when carefully considered. We look forward to continuing to work with you throughout the review process. Sincerely, Jon Kyl U.S. Senator John Barrasso U.S. Senator Roy Blunt U.S. Senator John Cornyn U.S. Senator Tom Cotton U.S. Senator Mike Crapo U.S. Senator Ted Cruz U.S. Senator Steve Daines U.S. Senator Mike Enzi U.S. Senator Joni Ernst U.S. Senator Deb Fischer U.S. Senator Cory Gardner U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch U.S. Senator John Hoeven U.S. Senator Ron Johnson U.S. Senator John Kennedy U.S. Senator James Lankford U.S. Senator Jerry Moran U.S. Senator Jim Risch U.S. Senator Mike Rounds U.S. Senator Marco Rubio U.S. Senator Pat Roberts U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan U.S. Senator Pat Toomey U.S. Senator Roger Wicker U.S. Senator A link to the letter is as follows: https://www.ernst.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/174cdb50-5fb2-406b-9e55-138f9905f2df/764BF3B190EFC55D0454E2D1E6E1D94A.new-start-letter.pdf
11.27.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators David Perdue (R-GA), James Lankford (R-OK), and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are proposing bold changes to the funding process to ensure Congress does its job and fully funds the federal government on time. The Senators are introducing amendments to create specific milestones for passing a budget and appropriations bills that would keep Congress on track. The proposals will be considered in the bicameral, bipartisan Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform. “In the real world, you are held accountable to make tough decisions and complete the job,” said Senator Perdue, member of the Senate Budget Committee. “Unfortunately, Washington is locked in a cycle of continuing resolutions and last-minute spending deals. This is totally irresponsible. To be successful, this Joint Select Committee must create a politically neutral platform with specific milestones for completing funding and impose severe consequences if Members of Congress don’t get the job done. We won’t fix this broken funding process or the national debt crisis if Congress refuses to hold itself accountable for failure.” “Congress should face consequences if we cannot act in time to pass a budget and fund the government,” said Senator Lankford, member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. “This past summer, the Senate did not take the annual August state work period because the work in Washington was unfinished. This year, only five of the 12 individual appropriations bills were signed into law by the September 30 deadline, leaving seven still remaining for Congress to address. Congress has not been able to pass all 12 appropriations bills since 1995. This amendment should be included in the final text of the bill passed by the Joint Committee.” “The most essential role Congress has is to raise revenue and fund the federal government,” said Senator Ernst. “Yet, since 1974, Congress has passed all of its appropriations bills just four times. And, in the past 20 years, we have only passed a budget resolution 11 times! Congress can do better; we owe it to the American people to complete our work on time. If we fail to meet our deadlines, we should stay at work until we get the job done.” The Joint Select Committee was established by Congress on February 9, 2018 and is composed of 16 Members of Congress: four Senate Republicans – including Senators Perdue, Lankford, and Ernst – four Senate Democrats, four House Republicans, and four House Democrats. The members have until the ending of the calendar year to agree on changes to the budget and appropriations process and present them to Congress for a full vote.
11.27.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Angus King (I-ME), Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Martin Heinrich (D-NM) introduced legislation to help improve veterans’ health care by increasing collaboration among federal agencies and authorizing the Department of Energy (DOE) to develop technologies that solve complex data challenges. “The VA and DOE have a good partnership when it comes to research and development; and, with the bipartisan Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act, we will see greater collaboration between the two agencies to solve complex data challenges and advance veterans’ health care,” said Senator Ernst. “America’s veterans have made immense sacrifices for our nation. Through their service they have earned not only our eternal gratitude, but also the best support that we can possibly provide,” said Senator King. “In order to live up to our duty, we must strive to improve the care they receive, taking steps like utilizing cutting-edge technology and increasing communication between government agencies. By improving our overall knowledge of the healthcare challenges facing our veterans, we can improve the quality of care they receive.” “This legislation will help provide world class care to our veterans by leveraging cutting-edge technologies at our National Labs,” said Senator Gardner. “The Department of Veterans Affairs and our National Labs are already collaborating successfully to benefit our veterans and I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort with my colleagues to make sure this work continues.” “We need to do everything we can to improve health care for our veterans. This is a great example of how our Department of Energy national laboratories like Los Alamos and Sandia can put their high performing computing capabilities to practical use solving complex, big data challenges. I’m hopeful that by using the national labs’ advanced data analytics, this innovative program will identify patterns in the VA’s data and help improve outcomes for significant veterans’ health care challenges like suicide prevention,” said Senator Heinrich. Background: The Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act is a companion bill to H.R. 6398 which passed the House unanimously on September 25, 2018. This legislation will build on the current interagency collaborative efforts—like the Million Veterans Program Computational Health Analytics of Medical Precision to Improve Outcomes initiative—by authorizing a program within the DOE to develop technologies to help solve complex data challenges by analyzing data sets from federal agencies, higher education institutions, non-profits and the private industry. In addition, this bill authorizes a DOE research program to spur development to accommodate for large data sets. The full legislation is available here.
11.27.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined co-founders and co-chairs of the Senate Ukraine Caucus, Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Richard Durbin (D-IL), their caucus colleagues and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member Senator James Risch (R-ID) in condemning Russia’s capture of Ukrainian ships and injuring and detention of Ukrainian sailors. “This is the latest example of Russia attempting to improperly exert influence and control over Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula. The actions taken by Russia over the weekend were dangerous, and once again show that Russia has little regard for the rights of its neighbors. The United States and the rest of the international community must make it clear to Russia that it will not tolerate unjustified aggressive actions like this,” said Senator Ernst. “I join the international community in condemning this unprovoked and unwarranted Russian aggression against the Ukrainian Navy in the Sea of Azov,” said Senator Portman. “Ukraine has the right to use this international waterway and Russia must immediately release the captured Ukrainian ships and sailors. This unwarranted, unprovoked aggression by Russia is in violation of international law. In addition to fueling the war in eastern Ukraine and refusing to cease its illegal occupation of Crimea, Russia has harassed hundreds of international commercial vessels in the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait over the past several months. This most recent incident in the Sea of Azov highlights the urgent need to bolster Ukraine's naval capabilities and demonstrates why Congress authorized increased naval assistance to Ukraine, such as the recent transfer of the two excess Island-class cutters from the United States Coast Guard to the Ukrainian military. I and my colleagues stand with the rest of Senate in solidarity with Ukraine.” “Through cyberattacks, propaganda, military intimidation, and outright invasion, Russia continues to attack Ukrainian sovereignty and international standards. By escalating the tension in the region, Russia’s campaign of aggression in Eastern Europe blazes on. Such blatantly hostile acts must be universally condemned. The United States stands arm and arm with our friends in Ukraine,” said Senator Durbin. “The Kremlin’s latest attack against Ukraine is not simply another assault by the Kremlin on Ukraine’s sovereignty,” said Senator Shaheen. “With this incident, Putin is sending another unmistakable message to the international community of its intent to reshape international norms by force and fundamentally alter the security and stability that has maintained our global order. It should come as no surprise that those who poison their own citizens on foreign soil are willing to escalate the conflict they started in Ukraine. I urge the transatlantic community to come together again to defend Ukraine with new, more biting measures against the Kremlin. I continue to be proud of the Ukrainian people who have never lost their dignity and motivation to succeed, despite these repeated attacks. I urge all Ukrainian lawmakers to avoid straying from this path, particularly during this difficult period.” "Russia’s illegal and unprovoked aggression toward Ukraine cannot be tolerated and demands a serious response by the United States and a community of nations,” said Senator Gardner. “I urge the Administration to urgently outline a series of diplomatic, economic, and defense posture measures to deter the Kremlin, such as additional deployments of US and NATO assets in the European theater, sanctions against senior Russian officials and their families, and deep cuts to Russian diplomatic presence in the United States. I also renew my call on the State Department to designate Russia a state sponsor of terrorism under U.S. law. Putin’s global campaign to test our resolve and undermine the United States and our allies cannot go unanswered.” “Russia’s attack on Ukrainian ships this weekend is unacceptable, and this aggression cannot stand unchecked. I join my colleagues in supporting Ukraine’s efforts to defend itself against these attacks and stand up to Russian aggression. I was proud to help broker the bipartisan deal to impose tough sanctions on Russia and will continue working with members of this committee and Congress to hold Russia accountable,” said Senator Brown. “Russia must swiftly release all Ukrainian crew members and vessels, cease the disruption of Ukrainian and international shipping, and allow unhindered access through the Kerch Strait and in the Sea of Azov. I continue to support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine and its right to freedom of navigation,” said Senator Johnson. “Vladimir Putin is a lawless autocrat who has no respect for the rights of his own people, let alone international laws and standards. The overt aggression against Ukraine in the Sea of Azov is the latest in a long series of attacks that have violated the sovereignty of Ukraine. I stand ready to work with my colleagues and the President to assist our Ukrainian allies and punish Russian aggression,” said Senator Toomey. “Russia’s repeated disregard for Ukraine’s sovereignty has undermined Eastern European security, and this unprovoked attack in the Sea of Azov only serves as further evidence that President Putin seeks to destabilize Ukraine and sow uncertainty. Now more than ever, the United States must assert its leadership on the global stage and hold Russia accountable for its dangerous actions. This incident must not go unanswered, and I proudly stand with our Ukrainian allies in their fight against Russian aggression,” said Senator Peters. “Russia’s most recent attack on Ukrainian ships in the Kerch Strait is another example of Putin blatantly violating Ukraine’s sovereignty. This unprovoked aggression violates international law, and Russia must immediately release all Ukrainian crew members and vessels, and restore access to the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov. This incident is part of a continued pattern of Russian aggression, and the world is watching to see how the United States reacts,” said Senator Murphy. Background On Sunday, Russian ships unlawfully attacked three Ukrainian ships near the Kerch Strait in the Sea of Azov. During the altercation, a Ukrainian ship was damaged, two ships were captured and numerous Ukrainian sailors were injured. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, condemned Russia at an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council in the strongest terms, saying “This is no way for a law-abiding civilized nation to act. Impeding Ukraine’s lawful transit through the Kerch Strait is a violation under international law. It is an arrogant act that the international community must condemn and will never accept. In the name of international peace and security, Russia must immediately cease its unlawful conduct and respect the navigational rights and freedoms of all states.”
11.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement with regard to the United States’ relationship with Saudi Arabia in the wake of the death of Jamal Khashoggi: “While Saudi Arabia is an important partner in the Middle East, it is clear that the Kingdom has been less than forthright about the details surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi on October 2. We remain committed to preserving American interests in the Middle East. At the same time, as a nation committed to human rights and the rule of law, we must hold accountable all who are responsible for this crime and insist on transparency from our friends and partners. I look forward to working with the President, our intelligence agencies, as well as my colleagues in the Senate to ensure we have all the facts moving forward.”
11.16.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) has joined fellow Iowa senator, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Senators Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mike Lee (R-UT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) as a cosponsor of the revised First Step Act, which will reduce recidivism, promote public safety and improve fairness in sentencing of federal crimes. “We need to address the disturbingly high rate of women - especially mothers - in prison and ensure our criminal justice system is addressing their unique needs. The sentencing reforms being championed by Sens. Grassley and Durbin are a way for Republicans and Democrats to work together to reform federal prisons and sentencing in a way that supports families and keeps our communities safe, while also solving the growing challenges states like Iowa face in meeting workforce demands,” said Senator Ernst. Background: The revised First Step Act includes the House-passed, bipartisan legislation on prison and sentencing reform, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act. The comprehensive legislation is focused on reducing crime by helping low-risk inmates prepare to rejoin society by participating in recidivism reduction and professional development programs. The First Step Act also aims to improve fairness by: recalibrating certain mandatory minimum sentences; providing greater discretion for judges in sentencing of low-level, nonviolent drug crimes; and, clarifying congressional intent on sentencing enhancements for certain crimes involving firearms. Under this legislation, any savings generated by the reforms would automatically be reinvested into law enforcement programs to further reduce crime and improve community safety. The First Step Act was endorsed by President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has pledged to hold a vote on the compromise proposal if it has 60 votes in the Senate. It is also supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, Cut50, Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration, National District Attorneys Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police. More details are available in the fact sheet and section-by-section summary provided by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
11.15.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced bipartisan legislation to encourage investment in high-speed internet and protect and expand access to broadband in our rural communities. The Access to Capital Creates Economic Strength and Supports (ACCESS) Rural America Act would provide regulatory relief to rural telecommunications service providers by allowing them to submit streamlined financial reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These small companies—many of which are the sole service providers in their region—could be put out of business by looming regulatory costs. Specifically, this bipartisan legislation would increase the number of investors that triggers SEC public reporting requirements for rural telecommunications companies. This will save these small companies from costly SEC reporting requirements that were never intended for them. “To compete in today’s economy, small businesses and rural communities in Iowa need access to quality broadband. Currently, rural telecom providers throughout Iowa face the threat of costly SEC reporting requirements, making it more difficult to invest in broadband throughout Iowa, and across the country. The bipartisan ACCESS Rural America Act allows these businesses to focus on expanding access to broadband instead of complying with red tape,” said Senator Ernst. “Reliable high-speed broadband is critical to strengthening small businesses and neighborhoods throughout Wisconsin’s rural communities. Unfortunately, rural telecom companies are getting hit with disclosure costs that were never intended for them, creating new challenges to delivering broadband access throughout Wisconsin,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our bipartisan legislation provides the regulatory relief that rural service providers need to build-out high-speed broadband in small communities and continue our efforts to bring broadband access for all – no matter where you live in Wisconsin.” “Northeast Iowa Telephone Company (NEIT), a provider of broadband Internet and other communication services in rural areas of Northeast Iowa via state of the art fiber optic network(s) is pleased that Senator Ernst is sponsoring important legislation to provide significant relief from burdensome Sarbanes-Oxley rules for small telecommunications providers. Passage of this legislation will allow NEIT, and companies like it, to continue expanding broadband service, truly the “Super Highway” of the 21st Century throughout rural parts of the US rather than having to use scarce resources on complying with additional federal regulations for small telecommunications companies who are already subject to significant regulation from other Federal and State Agencies. We look forward to passage of this legislation so that the important work of deploying advanced broadband services that will allow rural customers to compete in the global economy can continue,” said David Byers, Chief Operating Officer at Northeast Iowa Telephone Co. in Monona, IA. “As a community-based communications company in northwest Iowa serving 21,000 customers in 30 communities, Premier Communications is pleased to have the support of Senator Ernst in sponsoring legislation with the purpose of reducing the financial and regulatory burdens of existing Sarbanes-Oxley rules. Without the expansion of the shareholder thresholds, Premier would be forced to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and take on the financial burden of meeting the numerous regulations. With this proposed legislation, Premier will be able to continue focusing on network investments in fiber optics that will serve its rural customers with advanced broadband services and applications rather than allocating precious financial resources in regulation. In addition, we have seen increased economic development opportunities in the rural communities where network investments have occurred and we look forward to continuing that throughout all of our service territory,” said Doug Boone, CEO of Premier Communications in Sioux Center, IA. “Federal Securities and Exchange Commission registration and reporting requirements intended for larger, publicly-traded firms pose significant challenges for, and can impose substantial burdens on, smaller, locally-owned companies with limited resources. NTCA therefore greatly appreciates the leadership of Sens. Joni Ernst and Tammy Baldwin in introducing the ACCESS Rural America Act, which will help relieve these burdens and enable small providers to focus more on their core mission of deploying and operating advanced broadband networks in rural areas,” said Shirley Bloomfield, CEO of NTCA–The Rural Broadband Association. “We are extremely pleased to learn of Senator Baldwin’s effort to support a Sarbanes Oxley relief bill for Senate consideration. Resources expended on SEC registration compliance would directly reduce funds available for broadband expansion and slow or even halt expansion and endanger our business to continue. SEC compliance would be in addition to the rigorous reporting already in place. Resources are continually being spent to educate shareholders on the thresholds and to manage the effects of exceeding the thresholds. We look forward to seeing our Senate working in a bipartisan effort to help incent rural broadband providers deploy network to assist economic development and telemedicine in the rural portions of our great state of Wisconsin,” said John Klatt, President/CEO of Lakeland Communications in Milltown, WI. “Small, rural broadband providers want to focus their energy, efforts and investment toward connecting more rural broadband customers. Unfortunately, the risk of expensive compliance associated with Sarbanes-Oxley regulations has forced some broadband providers to redirect their energy and resources to keeping shareholder counts below a certain threshold. These small, locally owned companies, many of which are more than 100 years old, are seeking reasonable relief from the threat of burdensome SOX regulations, which could cost their companies more than $1 million annually. We fully support the efforts of Senator Baldwin to provide the thoughtful, measured relief of the ACCESS Rural America Act,” said William C. Esbeck, Executive Director of the Wisconsin State Telecommunications Association. “Coon Valley Farmers Telephone Company is the sole provider of TV, phone, and internet services to 1,900 Wisconsinites. We trace our roots back to 1911, when members of our community used their own financial resources to form the company. In return for their investment, they were issued shares. Over generations, those shares have been split among children, to the point where the number of shares outstanding could require us to register with the SEC. These registration costs-which are estimates to be over one million dollars-would devastate our business. Without us, Wisconsinites in our rural community would lose access to high-speed broadband. Senator Baldwin’s bill is a common-sense measure to provide targeted regulatory relief for small businesses in Wisconsin, and it will ensure that we can continue to make investments necessary to provide our communities with broadband,” said Carol Ann Olson, General Manager if Coon Valley Farmers Telephone Company in Coon Valley, WI. The full legislation is available here.
11.09.2018	WASHINGTON – With a town hall meeting in Ames, Iowa, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) completed her fourth 99 County Tour today. “Iowans know what is best for Iowa. The 99 County Tour gives me real, on-the-ground knowledge of how Iowans are feeling about everything from the Farm Bill to tax cuts. And, the 99 County Tour allows me to take that knowledge back to Washington, to make sure that we are always putting Iowa first,” said Senator Ernst. Background: For the fourth year in a row, Senator Ernst visited all 99 counties in Iowa, including: 53 visits to Iowa companies, schools, facilities, farms; 20 town hall meetings; 7 roundtables; 6 main street tours; and 13 other community outreach events. To view a short video that highlights a number of the Senator’s stops across the state, click here.
11.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Following the news of a deadly shooting in Thousand Oaks, Calif., Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), issued the following statement: “Our nation woke this morning to the news of a tragedy in California. This act of violence took the lives of at least 12 innocent people, including Sergeant Ron Helus of the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office – a hero who rushed to protect the innocent, without thought for self. My deepest sympathies and prayers are with the families and friends of the victims and the Thousand Oaks community. May God heal this community from this act of violence.”
11.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement with regard to the resignation of United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions: “Jeff Sessions has always been a strong leader who has served our nation and the state of Alabama well, both in the United States Senate and as the U.S. Attorney General. He should be commended for prosecuting the largest number of violent offenders and firearm defendants in our nation’s history; taking on violent gangs like MS-13 and restoring immigration enforcement to the United States. He also has been on the forefront of the charge against our nation’s opioid epidemic, by increasing prosecutions and stopping illegal drugs at the border. Our nation owes him a debt of gratitude for his service and commitment to the rule of law. “Fellow Iowan Matt Whitaker is a man of integrity and values. As Acting Attorney General, Matt Whitaker is a steady hand that will provide good leadership and judgment, and will ensure that the United States Department of Justice upholds the highest standards of the rule of law.”
11.07.2018	WASHINGTON – Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today sent a letter to Robert Wilkie, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, to better understand why veteran homelessness in Iowa has increased in the past two years. “[Housing] is one of the most basic needs of all individuals. In particular, we should have the right resources and policies in place to assist our veterans. These brave men and women have given so much to our country through their service and sacrifice and they should have the security of a place to live. It is vital for the federal government to partner with states and local communities to find the most effective solutions to combat homelessness, especially among our veterans,” said Sens. Ernst and Grassley in their letter to Secretary Wilkie. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Annual Homeless Assessment Report, showed that the number of veterans who experience homelessness has decreased 5.4 percent since last year, falling to nearly half the number of homeless veterans in 2010. In Iowa, however, veteran homelessness increased in the years 2017 and 2018. Sens. Grassley and Ernst commended the VA for “making inroads to address veterans’ homelessness,” while outlining questions to further understand how federal and state elected officials can work together to help Iowa “experience the type of results happening elsewhere across the nation.” The full letter can be found here.
11.07.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today applauded the recent decision by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) CEO Sarah Hirshland to essentially shut down USA Gymnastics following the way the organization botched the handling of Larry Nassar, the former USA Gymnastics doctor who sexually assaulted hundreds of young women athletes who were in his care. “Like many Americans, I remain horrified about the crimes committed by Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics doctor who abused hundreds of young athletes. The actions of Larry Nassar and the individuals and institutions that facilitated and protected his behavior are reprehensible. Senator Shaheen and I called on the former USOC CEO Scott Blackmun to resign earlier this year, to start the process of holding Olympic leadership accountable for fostering a culture that prioritized winning medals over the welfare of young athletes. I am glad to see that USOC’s current CEO, Sarah Hirshland, is taking action to start rebuilding trust with our country’s athletes and the American people. I also want to applaud the young women who have – and continue – to make their voices heard, calling for change and a new vision for the sport,” said Senator Ernst. Background: The United States Olympic Committee (USOC) filed a complaint against USA Gymnastics on November 5, 2018, seeking to revoke their recognition as a governing body of the USOC, following the way the organization improperly handled the sex abuse scandal involving the former team doctor, Larry Nassar. USA Gymnastics former CEO, Steve Penny, is named as a co-defendant in several civil lawsuits filed by former elite gymnasts and was arrested last month and charged with destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar’s abuses. Since Penny, USA Gymnastics was governed by Kerry Perry, who resigned after about nine months and was criticized heavily by Olympic medalists for failing to support athletes and offer a clear vision on a way forward for USA Gymnastics. USA Gymnastics was also briefly led by former U.S. Rep. Mary Bono. The organization is currently searching for its fourth president and CEO in less than two years. The USOC initiated a Section 8 proceeding against USA Gymnastics and is working to find an organization who can support gymnastics until they can identify a long-term solution to lead the country’s gymnastics. USOC CEO Sarah Hirshland, who is seeking to revoke USA Gymnastics as the governing body of the athletes, has said she is prepared to identify and help build an organization to “ensure that USAG gymnasts have the support necessary to excel on and off the field of play.”
11.05.2018	WASHINGTON - Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after new sanctions on Iran were announced by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin: “I support President Trump’s decision to reinstate sanctions on Iran. As the Ayatollah regime continues to destabilize the region and oppress the Iranian people, it is important for the United States to maintain diplomatic pressure on Iran's ruling elite. By pulling out of the Iran Deal and imposing strict sanctions, President Trump's administration is rightly motivating Iran to change their reckless behavior, end their sponsorship of terrorism and stop their dangerous pursuit of nuclear weapons.”

11.01.2018	… If you want to try to understand the Veteran’s Administration and veteran health care system, there is no one on capitol hill better versed in the system’s problems and positive point. The retired Lt. Colonel in the Iowa National Guard is as good as it gets in [answering] questions and seeking solutions. “We continue to make progress and the VA MISSION Act is part of that, but we’re a long way from getting it right,” said Ernst. The VA MISSION Act, a piece of recent legislation with Ernst’s signature on it, gives veterans the right to be treated in their local hospitals if they don’t think the big VA hospitals are giving them the care they need. It also addresses veteran suicide with peer counselors, life coaches and professional psychiatrists. “No one is better equipped to meet the needs of a troubled veteran than a veteran who has successfully dealt with the same problems,” she said. Rebuilding the military after eight years of the previous administration dismantling it is part of the solution to veteran health care said Ernst. … Retired U.S. Army Col. Chris Downey expanded on Ernst’s remarks on telemedicine by asking about bringing broadband to rural areas. “Broadband is a huge issue for a state like ours,” said Sen. Ernst. “Traditionally, we think of infrastructure as highways and locks and dams, but broadband is an important part of our nation’s infrastructure.” She mentioned the President’s infrastructure plan that includes a push for broadband for rural America. … Ernst said she has also been encouraged about the changes in how the [Environmental Protection Agency] does its business. “We re-authorized the Safe Drinking Water Act without the kind of overreach the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) had on farming and farmers,” she said. “The President’s announcement about E-15 is a huge boost to renewable fuels and Iowa’s corn production.” Asked about moving some agencies out of Washington, D.C., she said the “Swamp Act” has been introduced, [which] would place the U.S.D.A. in Iowa or the Department of the Interior in Wyoming. … Jackie Maddy had a list of concerns, including the $21 trillion national debt…“Instead of legitimate budgets, we do continuing resolutions that force omnibus spending,” said Sen. Ernst. “It is a terrible way to run a business or a country. School boards, cities, counties, states all have to have certified budgets, but the federal government ignores what everybody else has to do.” … To read the article in full, click here.
10.31.2018	U.S. Senator Joni Ernst sought some input from her constituents during several northwest Iowa stops Wednesday — one of them being Rosenboom in Spirit Lake. The senator said the machine and tool company was a priority for her not only because it is a major employer in the Lakes Area, but also because the company is family-owned. "We really rely on our employers as subject matter experts," Ernst said. "They know what works for their businesses, and they know what they would like to see out of the federal government. If there's a way we can go back, research and see if we can find a solution or a path forward, we certainly want to do that." ... Ernst toured the production floor with Rosenboom management and met floor workers during the visit. [Tom] Eggers said the company highlighted its two fully automated manufacturing cells. He said one has been in operation for approximately two years, while the new, larger unit was brought in within the last six months. Ernst said she hoped to understand the federal government's impact — positive or negative — on the local business. One of the challenges which stood out to Ernst was the issue of workforce shortages. "I hear that all across the state of Iowa," she said. "They're trying to overcome some of that with robotics." She said the issue of current federal trade tariffs also bleeds into the robotics issue, as some of the electronic and industrial components are sourced out of China. In addition to reigning in the cost of healthcare and pharmaceuticals for workers, Ernst said she intends to continue supporting vocational training through the federal Carl D. Perkins program. … To read the article in full, click here.
10.27.2018	WASHINGTON –Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement in response to the attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburg, PA. “The attack on the Tree of Life synagogue is an attack on us all and our society cannot accept violence based on hate. My heart is with the families and community of Pittsburgh,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA).
10.27.2018	WASHINGTON –This week, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue announced his intent to relocate two USDA research agencies outside of Washington, D.C. “I’m glad to see USDA is considering moving two of its agencies outside of ‘swampy’ Washington. For too long, our federal agencies have been out-of-touch and unaware of the impact that their policies have on folks in states like Iowa, and across the country. While this proposal doesn’t go as far as my SWAMP Act, relocating these agriculture agencies outside the Beltway is a good step in the right direction and an example that I hope other federal agencies will follow,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Forestry and Nutrition. Background: USDA is considering moving the Economic Research Service (ESR) and National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) outside of Washington, D.C. in an effort to bring the agency closer to stakeholders. Secretary Perdue stated that this move is a “very business-like approach,” and that USDA will be using an outside consulting firm to help select new locations. Senator Ernst has championed an effort to decentralize the federal government. Her Strategic Withdrawal of Agencies for Meaningful Placement (SWAMP) Act would move the headquarters of federal agencies outside of the immediate Washington, D.C. area, and establish a competitive bidding process that allows states, cities and towns across the country to compete to be an agency’s new home. Senator Joni Ernst’s SWAMP ACT: Repeals the section of the U.S. Code that requires federal agencies and departments to be located in Washington, D.C. Prohibits agencies currently headquartered in the Washington, D.C. area from entering into new lease agreements, making significant renovations to their existing locations or beginning construction on new facilities in the area. Exempts the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense and all other national security-related agencies that must be in close proximity to Congress and the White House. Establishes a competitive bidding process to allow states and municipalities to compete for the relocated headquarters.

There is no place in our society for attacks against elected officials, news organizations or citizens. I am thankful for the swift action of the Secret Service, Postal Service and first responders across the country, and stand ready to support law enforcement as we learn more about these acts of violence.” Background: On Wednesday, October 24, 2018, suspicious packages were sent to political leaders, including former Presidents Obama and Clinton, as well as CNN’s office in New York City and other political figures.
10.24.2018	Tuesday, Iowa Senator Joni Ernst visited Holiday Express Trucking Company in Estherville Iowa. Joni toured the facility, as she walked out to the shop she breathed in deep and said "I love the smell of machine shops." … Trucking is very near and dear to Ernst's heart she explained that she drove truck at the beginning of the Iraq war. "We would get our missions assigned and we were running 24 hour ops," said Ernst. "And we would go stage our trucks at a warehouse somewhere in Kuwait, and just depending on where you were on priority our drivers could sit 8-10 hours before they got loaded and of course even loading was an issue because we didn't have enough wrenches or forklifts." Ernst went on to say, she loaded Saddam's Hussein's gold and other [unimaginable] things. Ernst was relating with the trucking company as Sheila Schichtl Safety Manager at Holiday Express Trucking Company laid out all the safety concerns for their truck drivers. … Ernst listened with an open ear and it was made very clear the changes that need to be made when it comes to regulations.

10.19.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement, in regard to the news that Matthew A. Cox, 19, an Iowa National Guardsman died while swimming at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay beach this week: “The passing of Private First Class Guardsman Matthew Cox is a tragedy. It breaks my heart to hear that a fellow Iowan and Guardsman lost his life at such a young age. His service to our nation, including his enlistment in the Iowa Army National Guard and deployment in Cuba, will not be forgotten by me, or the people of Iowa. Pfc. Cox paid the ultimate sacrifice while serving his country, and may God bring his family and friends peace as they grieve his loss.” Background: The Iowa National Guard announced the death of Pfc. Matthew A. Cox on October 18th, 2018, following a search and rescue mission after Pfc. Cox was lost in a strong current at Cable Beach while swimming at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay (NSGB) beach on Tuesday, October 16. Pfc. Cox was born in Des Moines, Iowa. The Iowa Army and National Guard explained, “Cox was active in the Civil Air Patrol, Des Moines Police Explorers and enjoyed farming with his grandparents, Fred and Linda Cox, near Leon, Iowa. He was a member of the 1st Baptist Church in Urbandale, where he was involved in the children's ministries. Cox enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard on October 11, 2017 as a Military Police Soldier with the 186th MP Co. He attended Military Police One Station Unit Training and graduated on June 7, 2018. He deployed to Cuba in July, 2018. His awards include the National Defense Service Medal and the Army Service Ribbon.” Senator Ernst retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel after 23 years in the Army Reserve and the Iowa Army National Guard.

10.17.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a town meeting in Humboldt County as part of her 99 county tour to hear from constituents in the area about the issues most important to them. This town meeting is open to the public. Wednesday, October 24, 2018 Humboldt County Town Hall Meeting 4:30 PM CT Humboldt High School Auditorium 1500 Wildcat Road Humboldt, IA 50548 NOTE: If you are a credentialed member of the media and plan to attend the event, please RSVP to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov.
10.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Claire McCaskill (D-MO) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) introduced legislation to ensure that married couples who work for the same employer are not restricted in the amount of leave they can take under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to care for a newborn, sick parent or servicemember or for the adoption of a child. “The FMLA is in need of modernization, especially when it comes to leave opportunities afforded to new parents and families. Our bipartisan legislation—the FAIR Leave Act—is a win for our growing families and will provide equitable leave for working parents regardless of their employer,” said Senator Ernst. “The amount of unpaid leave afforded to parents of newborns shouldn’t be limited simply because they both work for the same employer. This bill corrects that discrepancy in the Family and Medical Leave Act and will treat parents fairly, whether or not they work for the same employer,” said Senator Cotton. “This commonsense fix will ensure that all Missouri families are granted the leave they deserve in order to take care of their families without fear of losing their job,” McCaskill said. “And it’s especially important this fix will help military families taking care of sick or injured servicemembers.” “Working families are the backbone of North Dakota’s economy, and family and medical leave gives these families the peace of mind they need to look after newborn babies, take care of aging parents, or recover from an unexpected illness. But under the current law married parents are unfairly punished if they happen to work for the same employer,” said Senator Heitkamp. “I’m proud to help introduce this bipartisan legislation to help fix this issue and strengthen leave options. This bill would fix a glitch to make sure everyone taking unpaid leave is able to care for their loved ones, recover from labor and delivery, and bond with their kids, which is such an important part of early development in a child’s life.” Background: The bipartisan Fair Access for Individuals to Receive (FAIR) Leave Act enables eligible spouses working for the same employer to each take up to 12 work weeks (24 total) of unpaid leave in a 12 month period for the following FMLA-qualifying reasons: the birth of a son or daughter; the placement and adoption of a child; or the care of a parent with a serious health condition. The legislation will also allow eligible spouses to each take 26 weeks to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness. The FAIR Leave Act addresses the shortcomings of the FMLA to provide more comprehensive and effective leave for American families. While the FMLA provides unpaid, job-protected leave for specified family and medical reasons, it limits the amount of leave that married couples, working for the same employer, may take for some, but not all, FMLA-qualifying leave reasons. The bipartisan FAIR Leave Act will repeal this provision.
10.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement with regard to the disappearance of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. “Saudi Arabia’s alleged involvement in the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi is deeply concerning. The United States must get to the bottom of this and take appropriate action upon completion of the investigation. A free press and the freedom of speech are at the bedrock of our democracy, and we must hold all nations—especially our allies—to a high standard. I look forward to working with our Intelligence Community, the Department of Defense and the State Department to ensure Congress is fully informed and updated throughout this process.”
10.11.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke with WOWT yesterday about the benefits of selling E15 year-round. A portion of her interview is highlighted below. LAUREN TAYLOR: Iowa Senator Joni Ernst says she is excited and hopes it will stabilize the state's farm industry. SENATOR ERNST: …This will have an increased demand for corn and, of course, providing consumers additional choice at the pump all year-round. What we also see this as is a great move for regulatory reform. That's a lot of regulation on those retailers when they have to switch out their pumps to accommodate the changes for E15 during the summer months. To watch the interview in full, click here.
10.11.2018	WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump nominated Iowan Douglas J. Strike to serve as the United States Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa after a joint recommendation from Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. “Mr. Strike has served and led diligently within the law enforcement community for over 30 years.

We are grateful to President Trump for nominating such a highly qualified Iowan,” said Senator Ernst. “Mr. Strike has served Iowa as a law enforcement officer for more than 34 years, most recently as the Chief of Police for the Iowa Falls Police Department. He has shown great leadership as the President of the Iowa Sheriffs and Deputies Association and as a former board member of the Iowa Chiefs of Police and Peace Officers Association,” Grassley said. “Mr. Strike’s exemplary record will continue to serve the people of Iowa well in this new role. I thank President Trump for carefully considering our recommendations and making such an outstanding selection.” Strike’s biographical information provided by the White House can be found here and below. Mr. Strike served as Chief of Police for the City of Iowa Falls Police Department from 2001 to 2006.

10.11.2018	WASHINGTON- U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Tina Smith (D-MN) sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urging them to investigate and respond to recent cases of AFM, a serious nervous system condition that causes patients’ muscles to weaken and other polio-like symptoms. On October 5th, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) announced that AFM has infected six Minnesota children since mid-September, and on October 10th, another case was discovered in Iowa. In the letter, the senators asked CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield to share the CDC’s plan to address these increased reports of AFM and accurately track diagnoses. “In recent weeks seven children have been diagnosed with AFM in Minnesota and Iowa, including two children who required treatment in the intensive care unit for respiratory support,” the senators wrote. “Because the causes of AFM are unknown, we urge the CDC to provide more information immediately about preventive measures and treatments.” The full text of the letter can be found below: Dear Dr. Redfield, We are writing to understand what steps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is taking to investigate the recent increased reports of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). In recent weeks seven children have been diagnosed with AFM in Minnesota and Iowa, including two children who required treatment in the intensive care unit for respiratory support. The CDC has acknowledged that 362 cases of AFM have been reported since 2014. AFM causes patients’ muscles to weaken and symptoms include sudden muscle weakness in the arms or legs, neck weakness or stiffness, drooping eyelids or a facial droop, difficulty swallowing or slurred speech. These symptoms are similar to polio or the West Nile Virus. Because the causes of AFM are unknown, we urge the CDC to provide more information immediately about preventive measures and treatments. We appreciate the CDC’s ongoing work to address AFM. To better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding the federal government’s efforts toward AFM, we request your response to the following questions: What initiatives are underway to accurately track AFM diagnoses? What initiatives are underway to research the causes of and treatments for AFM? Please describe any collaborative efforts between CDC and other relevant government agencies, including the National Institutes of Health. Please describe how is CDC is coordinating with the health departments of affected states and providing timely information to physicians and hospitals who are on the frontline of AFM? We respectfully request that you provide answers to these questions no later than close of business on October 16, 2018. Sincerely,
10.10.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Bloomberg TV today to discuss the latest with regard to President Trump’s directive on the sale of E15 year-round. A portion of her interview is highlighted below. SENATOR ERNST: This is a big win for not only biofuels but also America’s farmers; those that are growing corn, those that are producing ethanol. Iowa is the number producer of corn and ethanol and so it is good for our economy and provides additional choice at the pump. KEVIN CIRILLI: It was interesting to see that President Trump in remarks yesterday said he is concerned about the price of oil and he wants to see it go down and if that means having to lift something like the ethanol ban that he would be willing to do it. SENATOR ERNST: … Making E15 available year-round, it lessens the regulatory burden on our retailers so that is a really good thing as well. So, again, very excited about this move. I think the President is, one, upholding his campaign commitment, but again, is also making it easier on consumers. To watch the interview in full, click here.
10.10.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan America’s Water Infrastructure Act (AWIA). “The Senate’s passage of bipartisan legislation to address water infrastructure needs will increase access to funding for rural projects and streamline the permitting process to allow communities to better address flooding,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. This bipartisan AWIA legislation makes important improvements to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program, which is responsible for flood control, navigation and other activities related to water resources and infrastructure. AWIA also addresses the ongoing need to improve and maintain our nation’s water infrastructure and authorizes projects that impact ports, mainland waterways, dams, irrigation systems and water storage that will help to ensure American goods are able to be efficiently shipped from coast-to-coast and around the globe. Senator Ernst focused her efforts on making it easier for rural projects to secure federal funding, as well as key policy reforms, including: Reforming the Flawed Benefit-to-cost Ratio (BCR): BCR metrics disadvantage projects in states with low property values when they compete against projects in major cities or coastal areas for federal funding. Ernst has worked with her colleagues on the EPW Committee to develop a process designed to give small and rural communities better access to funding for Corps projects. Under the new process created by this legislation, the Corps will provide funding allocations to each Corps district based on stakeholder input, the local and regional significance of projects, and other criteria. Once this funding is allocated to the district level, only projects within that district can compete for it, and BCR guidelines will not apply. Monitoring Progress on the Cedar Rapids Flood Project: In July 2018, the City of Cedar Rapids received $117 million in federal funding for its flood control project. Senator Ernst’s provision requires the Army Corps to submit to Congress a report on the timeline for implementing the project within 90 days. Streamlining Permitting Processes: In an effort to speed up the construction of improvements to local flood projects, Senator Ernst’s provision clarifying that decisions to approve such proposals can be made at the district level was included in the legislation. Asserting that Corps districts
10.10.2018	WASHINGTON – Today at a Senate Armed Services Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee hearing, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned leaders of the United States Air Force (USAF) on the readiness of the branch. Senator Ernst questioned USAF Secretary Heather Wilson, stating, “You did reference some of the challenges that you’re facing in regards to sustainment of weapon systems of equipment, particularly with regard to the maintenance and the logistics. I was pleased to see that the Air Force does continue to look for ways to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Going back to emerging threats and capabilities, one of the things we spend some time talking about is artificial intelligence (AI). We do continue to hear about the potential benefits of AI and machine learning on issues such as predictive maintenance. Is the Air Force currently utilizing these types of technologies or do you think these emerging technologies present a cost-effective means of improving maintenance and logistics within the Air Force?” Secretary Wilson responded, saying, that the Air Force is testing out Conditions-Based Maintenance Plus, which involves both predictive analytics and sensing on aircraft, and that with this, they are seeing a significant reduction in cost and unscheduled maintenance. To watch the questioning in full, click here. Background: Senator Ernst is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. Today’s hearing included testimony from Dr. Heather Wilson, Secretary of the Air Force; General David Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the Air Force; and, Mr. John Pendleton, Director of Defense Capabilities and Management for the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
10.09.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined President Donald Trump at the White House, as he announced his directive to remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round by expanding the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) waiver to fuel blends up to 15 percent ethanol throughout the year. “As the Renewable Fuel Standard is central to rural America’s growth and development, I want to thank President Trump, Secretary Perdue and Acting Administrator Wheeler for listening to the American farmer, and taking action to support rural communities. “As the nation’s leader in renewable fuels production, today’s action is especially exciting for Iowa. Granting the sale of E15 year-round will mean that Iowans will see an increase in farm income, increased ethanol production and consumption and a boost in our economy. E15 year-round also gives people across the country more choice at the pump. As EPA fulfills the president’s directive on reforming the Renewable Fuel Standard to better serve the American farmer, I look forward to working with EPA on their plans for increased transparency around the RIN marketplace,” said Senator Ernst. Ernst has been tirelessly urging the Trump Administration, specifically the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), to grant the RVP waiver. A few examples are below: Submitted comments to EPA Acting Administrator Wheeler on the proposed volume requirements under the RFS and urged the Agency to follow through on the President’s directive to remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round. Questioned a Council of Environmental Quality (CEQ) nominee about the importance of biofuels for rural communities and the need to uphold the RFS. Pushed for year-round waiver for E15 in a letter to then EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. Penned a letter to EPA asking then Administrator Pruitt to examine the burdensome regulation that makes it more difficult to sell gasoline with ethanol content above ten percent, such as E15 year-round. Awarded the 2018 Fueling Growth Award by Growth Energy for her work to advance renewable fuels like ethanol and to increase consumer choice at the pump. Pushed for legislation that would remove unnecessary regulatory hurdles that keep E15 and higher blends of ethanol from being sold year-round across the country. Questioned USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue on the agency’s efforts to protect the RFS and the 88,000 farms across Iowa and 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry.
10.06.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after Judge Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed to serve as the next associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States: “Over the past several months, Senator Grassley has led a fair and just process for Judge Kavanaugh and the American people. I want to thank him and the Judiciary Committee staff, for their hard work and diligent efforts. Their work is important to the people that they serve – in our home state of Iowa, and across this great country. “We are lucky to live in the greatest country in the world – one where I am proud to serve my state and my country, in the Iowa National Guard and now as a U.S. Senator. As a Senator, I am committed to protecting and upholding the ideals of our country, and I take that commitment very seriously. “Judge Kavanaugh is a highly-qualified justice committed to the rule of law and the United States Constitution. I congratulate Judge Kavanaugh on being confirmed by the U.S. Senate for his lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.” Background: Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on October 6, 2018 by a 50-48 vote.
10.05.2018	Week in Review October 1-8, 2018 What a week! Amidst the hustle and bustle in Washington, the Senate passed a multi-year authorization of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and sent landmark legislation to combat the opioid crisis to the President’s desk for signature. TRADE Some of the best news of the week was President Trump’s announcement of the new free-trade agreement with our neighbors to the North and South, Canada and Mexico. Senator Ernst had the opportunity to attend the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) signing ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House. Senator Ernst joined CBS This Morning to discuss the USMCA. In addition, Ernst spoke with a number of Iowa news outlets, including Dustin Hoffman of Iowa Agribusiness Radio Network, WOI-TV, Omaha World Herald, Siouxland Proud and KCRG about the importance of this trade deal for Iowa agriculture. She also joined Stuart Varney of Fox News to discuss the deal. DEFENSE Senator Ernst also joined a host of media and folks at The Heritage Foundation for the release of their annual Index of U.S. Military Strength. She sat down with The Daily Signal to discuss her initial thoughts of the index as well as her national defense priorities as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. In other defense news, Ernst asked Department of Defense (DoD) Secretary James Mattis to provide information about what the U.S. military is preparing to do in response to the future use of chemical weapons in Syria. The Senator discussed this letter and more with Sirius XM’s Olivier Knox; and the Washington Examiner highlighted the Senator’s letter. VETERAN CARE In addition, Senator Ernst, along with her colleague Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), sent a letter to the Iowa City VA Health Care System seeking answers to ensure Iowa veterans are receiving the care that they need. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reported on this issue and documented both Senator Ernst and Grassley’s efforts to take corrective action. KAVANAUGH SCOTUS NOMINATION An issue that is obviously at the top of everyone’s minds is the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Senator Ernst spoke with WOWT about Senator Grassley’s extraordinary leadership throughout this entire process and reiterated her support for the Judge. In addition, Quad City Times, Brietbart and Nexstar highlighted the Senator’s support of Kavanaugh.
10.03.2018	WASHINGTON – Today the U.S. Senate passed the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, which is a combination of the House and Senate opioid packages. This bill includes Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) Access to Increased Drug Disposal (AIDD) Act and the Education Disposal of Unused (EDU) Opioid Act. “Congress has tackled the ongoing opioid epidemic head-on. As a result of this legislation we will see easier access to treatment and increased flexibility for our communities. I am especially glad to see my AIDD Act and EDU Act included as well as continued funding of state targeted response grants, allowing Iowa to enhance their treatment and prevention efforts. I urge the President to swiftly make this legislation law,” said Senator Ernst. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act reauthorizes 21st Century Cures Act opioid grants. The Iowa Department of Public Health was awarded funding through these grants to build an enhanced, statewide infrastructure to address opioid misuse and increase awareness through statewide prevention efforts and the use of medication assisted treatment. As mentioned, this package includes two of Senator Ernst’s bills, The bipartisan AIDD Act, which will increase participation in federal prescription drug take-back programs to help combat prescription drug abuse; and, The EDU Act, which requires Medicare Advantage plans and prescription drug plans to provide information on the safe disposal of prescription drugs. Background: The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act will clamp down on illicit opioid shipments, increase funding for research of non-opioid pain treatments and encourage the development of non-opioid, non-addictive products. It reforms Medicare and Medicaid treatment and recovery support services for beneficiaries with substance abuse problems, and also increases funding for National Institutes of Health and access to addiction treatment medications.
10.03.2018	WASHINGTON – Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) sent a letter yesterday to the Iowa City Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System seeking answers to ensure Iowa veterans are receiving the proper care they have earned and deserve. “Iowa veterans rightly expect the VA to properly manage crucial medical appointments, especially with follow-ups, lab or imaging tests. I remain concerned about the level of care that our veterans are receiving,” said Senator Ernst. “It’s important to get to the bottom of how many radiology orders were canceled in error and what follow-up was done or not done, and if not, why not. Accountability is the only way to make sure veterans receive the high quality care that they’ve earned,” said Senator Grassley. This letter follows a recent report in USA Today saying the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) is conducting an audit of radiology appointment cancellations at the Iowa City VA Health Care System. Ernst and Grassley asked the Iowa City VA to respond to the following questions: The Iowa City VA claims that cancellation of radiology appointments happened in a “small number of instances.” How many total cancellations occurred? How many of these cancellations were determined to have been made in error? How did the Iowa City VA determine that a radiology appointment was improperly cancelled? Detail of the process the Iowa City VA is using to follow up with a veteran to ensure they are receiving proper imaging care. To read the letter in full, click here.
10.02.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities for the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently wrote a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis asking for information about what the U.S. military is preparing to do in response to the future use of chemical weapons in Syria. Senator Ernst writes, “Like yourself, I find President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, especially against his own civilian population, to be abhorrent and a violation of international law. As the world’s most powerful nation, I believe the U.S. must take a strong stance against such egregious actions, and I commend you for your efforts to deter the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.” She went on to say, “While I have supported previous uses of military force against the Syrian government, I am increasingly concerned about U.S. military action not authorized by the 2001 and 2003 Authorizations for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) or the War Powers Resolution. “I respectfully request additional communication by the Department of Defense (DoD) regarding its decision-making and congressional notification process when considering military action outside of an existing Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF).” To read the full letter, click here. Background: In 2017, the U.S. conducted targeted missile strikes against the Syrian government following the use of chemical weapons by the regime. In April of 2018, the U.S., along with France and the United Kingdom, again struck Syrian government facilities in response to their use of chemical weapons. Recently, U.S. leaders have signaled to Assad that there would be grave consequences, including potential military action, should Syria continue the use chemical weapons. This included a statement from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dunford, that the DoD has prepared military options for the president should Syria use chemical weapons.
10.01.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and Chairman of the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee, issued the following statement in regard to the Trump Administration’s announcement today that the U.S., Canada and Mexico have reached a three-way trade agreement: “This trade deal is welcome news for Iowa farmers and ranchers, who for too long have suffered from the ongoing trade disputes and plummeting commodity prices. President Trump is making good on his promise to get deals done that will boost confidence, provide certainty and unleash optimism across farm country in Iowa and the rest of the U.S. “Mexico, Canada and the U.S. make up one of the most competitive and successful regional economic platforms in the world. I’ve been pushing the Administration to finalize pending trade deals, and they have done just that; I look forward to reviewing the deal in full, and understanding its impact on Iowa’s economy including manufacturing and other industries.” Background: On Monday, October 1, 2018, the Trump Administration announced the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a renegotiation of the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), with modern provisions representing a 21st century, high-standard agreement. USMCA seeks to rebalance the countries’ trade to better serve the interests of American workers, farmers, ranchers and businesses Specific to Agriculture: Food and agriculture will trade more fairly, including dairy and wheat: Canada will eliminate its “Class 7” program that allows low-priced dairy ingredients to undersell United States dairy products in Canada and in third country markets. Canada also will provide equal treatment when assessing the quality of imported wheat. U.S. farmers will have new access to Canadian ag markets: Canada will provide important new access for the full range of United States dairy products, eggs and poultry. New standards will strengthen ag trade: The new agreement sets unprecedented standards for agricultural biotechnology, establishes commitments to reduce trade-distorting policies and enhances rules for science-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures.
09.26.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), along with Senators John Boozman (R-AR) and Orrin Hatch (R-UT), introduced the Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act. “It should go without saying that those hired to treat and care for our veterans should have a proven record of providing quality health care. The Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans bill makes sure that a third party reviews each case where any veteran was treated by a VA provider who was later found to have a revoked license,” said Senator Ernst. “Our nation’s veterans answered the call of duty when we needed them and have earned high quality health care. Ensuring that providers are thoroughly vetted, and that veterans and their families have the information needed to make informed decisions, is crucial to ensuring that the VA delivers the world-class care veterans deserve,” said Senator Grassley. “The VA is undertaking a full review of the care any veteran has received by a physician who previously had their license revoked by a state medical board. I’m pleased to join my colleagues in introducing this bill to ensure that the VA maintains a focus on this critically important issue. This is a commonsense measure to protect the health and wellbeing of our nation’s veterans. After working with the VA as it reviews records of a physician removed for cause in Arkansas, I can attest to the hard work, keen focus and determined effort the VA is making to understand the full impact on patients so it can provide the appropriate care,” said Senator Boozman. “Caring for our veterans is among my top priorities. That’s why today I am pleased to join Senators Ernst and Grassley on the Ensuring Quality Care for Our Veterans Act. This commonsense legislation improves care for our veterans by mandating third-party clinical reviews of providers whose licenses have been revoked. It also holds the VA accountable for the quality of care the agency provides. This bill seeks to protect our veterans, just as they have protected us and our way of life,” said Senator Hatch. Following a December 2017 report in USA Today by Donovan Slack that the VA hired providers with revoked licenses, the VA took corrective action by taking appropriate human resources action and issuing new guidance to prevent health care providers with revoked licenses from being hired in the future. While the VA is taking corrective action, the Act goes one step further by ensuring that every health care provider that was hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with a revoked license undergo a third party clinical review of that provider’s care. If the review determines that a competent practitioner would have managed the veteran’s care differently, the veteran will be notified. Background: The USA Today story found that the VA—including the one in Iowa City—knowingly hired providers who had their licenses revoked or had misconduct allegations. Senators Ernst and Grassley wrote a letter to the VA asking for answers on these hiring practices, specifically about the provider in Iowa City. The VA responded to their letter stating that they were doing a national review of this process to ensure compliance under current law. On December 21, 2017 Senators Ernst and Grassley again pushed for additional information from the VA about the process of the national review, including when results would be made public and if families of veterans treated by these unqualified providers would be notified. In January 2018, the VA responded, indicating that they are still working through their national review of VA providers.
09.25.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Ed Markey, (D-MA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced bipartisan legislation to improve transportation access and help break down barriers for workers and families getting to jobs, local businesses and health care services. The Connecting Opportunities through Mobility Metrics and Unlocking Transportation Efficiencies (COMMUTE) Act provides data to states and local governments to measure accessibility to local businesses and important destinations, and inform investments in transportation systems. “In Wisconsin and across the country, inadequate or unaffordable transportation options can be a significant barrier to employment and hold potential workers back from joining the workforce and helping grow our economy,” said Senator Baldwin. “At the same time, employers, particularly those located just outside metro areas and in rural communities, may be missing out on potential workers. This bipartisan legislation is about investing in better and more efficient transportation so workers and families can get to job hubs, health care services and other important destinations, and keep our Made in Wisconsin economy moving forward.” “I am honored to cosponsor the COMMUTE Act. This pilot program will explore a new method to assess the economic efficiency of transportation and land use, ultimately improving the day-to-day lives of the people of Utah and giving them better access to opportunities. We are fortunate to have such a forward-moving transportation sector in Utah and this legislation will support their innovative work,” said Senator Hatch. “Ensuring our transportation planners are armed with all of the relevant data needed to better connect our communities with employment centers, schools, and medical facilities is an essential component to modernizing and improving our nation’s infrastructure. I thank Senators Baldwin, Hatch, and Ernst for their partnership on this legislation,” said Senator Markey. “Communities need information about how people commute, in order to plan transportation routes that connect people to jobs and other important locations – especially in rural areas. The COMMUTE Act will help communities receive accessibility data, for transportation planning efforts, so that communities can make smart investments, based on real data,” said Senator Ernst. The COMMUTE Act requires the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to develop and provide states and transportation planning organizations with data sets measuring the level of access by all modes of transportation to important destinations. These destinations include jobs and areas with a concentration of available jobs, health care facilities, childcare services, educational and workforce training facilities, affordable housing and food sources. Data tools can help inform transportation planning decisions about improved access to opportunity for residents—particularly for individuals without reliable access to cars. These new tools allow states and transportation planners to assess changes in access, evaluate how transportation dollars are spent and set targets. Making information about where jobs and other important destinations are located and where transportation access can be made more convenient can better inform locally-driven decisions about how to most effectively invest transportation resources and design with access in mind. More information about the legislation is available here.
09.24.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement in regard to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) announcement about an update to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program website: “I’ve been consistently pushing the EPA to provide greater transparency in both the RIN market and the process for granting small refinery exemptions. While this effort by Acting Administrator Wheeler is a step toward improved transparency on the RFS and will help provide clarity for Iowa’s ethanol producers and farmers, I am hopeful the EPA will go a step further and disclose the names of waiver recipients, and the criteria by which they were granted the exemption.” Background: EPA’s updated website, announced under Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler on September 20, 2018, includes the following new data: · The number of small refinery exemptions received, granted and denied for each compliance year; · The weekly average price of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) traded; and · The weekly volume of RINs traded. All of the data on the website is accessible to renewable fuel producers, refineries and other stakeholders involved with the RFS. To access EPA’s new website, click here.
09.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Ernst released the following statement, after the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota granted a request from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds to apply the 2015 stay of the United States Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule to Iowa: “The 2015 WOTUS rule is an egregious example of federal overreach and creates unnecessary and burdensome red tape for farmers, manufacturers and small businesses. Governor Reynolds successfully prevented WOTUS from taking effect in Iowa, while the state continues to fight this harmful rule,” Senator Joni Ernst. Background: On September 18, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota granted Governor Reynolds’ request to stop enforcement of the WOTUS rule in Iowa. This request came after a federal court in South Carolina ruled that WOTUS could go into effect in states not covered by previous stays of the rule. Because Iowa was not a part of the lawsuits that led to the earlier stays, WOTUS could have been enforced in the state following the South Carolina ruling. The 2015 WOTUS rule was a product of the Obama Administration and would give the federal government authority to regulate water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. With legal challenges to the rule still ongoing, it is currently on hold in 25 states. Sen. Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS: Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule. Applauded Senate passage of her resolution of disapproval to scrap the WOTUS rule which passed with bipartisan majority support. Spoke on the floor of the Senate to urge support for her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. Cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and directions for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders. Denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. Introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. Invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. ###
09.18.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the floor of the Senate to express her disappointment over Congress failing to properly fund the government yet again. A full transcript of the Senator’s remarks can be found below, and a video of the floor speech can be found by clicking here. “I rise today disappointed and frustrated. “Once again, we have passed an ill-advised continuing resolution to fund much of the government. Once again, we have passed the buck. Once again, we have failed to do our job. “One of Congress’s most essential roles is to fund a responsible government that runs efficiently and effectively. We have a duty to taxpayers to not just simply give a thumbs up on spending their money, but to debate and consider whether programs are working and serving their needs. “Unfortunately, we have been negligent in this solemn duty. Like myself, Americans are tired of this shortsighted habit of kicking the can down the road. “How did we get to this point? After all, we have worked across the aisle in an open and collaborative way and found a path forward to fund our national defense and the vital departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. We recently passed a similar bill related to Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, Military Construction, and Veterans Affairs. “But, as we’ve seen, a continuing resolution (CR) was attached to this legislation for the rest of the government, including our vital Department of Homeland Security. Worse, this CR doesn’t fund the government fully until the end of the fiscal year. No, it simply punts the ball until December 7th. “That’s it. We’ll be back here before Christmas, and if experience is a guide, multiple times after that, before we can get the government fully funded. “I ultimately chose to vote yes on this CR because of what it means for our national security and servicemembers who risk their lives every day for our security. Also, the CR included the Violence Against Women Act, a bill I could not allow to lapse given that this bill provides services for our most vulnerable. “VAWA addresses the scourge of domestic violence that is so prevalent in our communities. Crimes that often hurt women and children the most, often requiring them to be displaced from the only homes they know. I believe that we can strengthen this Act in several ways by addressing changing circumstances since its last reauthorization 5 years ago and by tailoring its language to better fit the needs of our communities. There are provisions we need to change and work on. But we were not afforded that opportunity. “Tying our nation’s security and the Violence Against Women Act to the CR made it both the carrot and the stick. We are leaving services and programs that the American people rely upon open to partisan delay and political gerrymandering. “The people of Iowa elected me to come to Washington to be their voice and to instill much needed fiscal responsibility. “Rather than pushing, procrastinating, and postponing for another 3 months, we should buckle down and build upon the great progress that we have made this year by getting the remaining appropriations bills across the finish line. “We should debate the Violence Against Women Act in regular order to strengthen it and provide protections for those who need it most. “Mr. President there are items I support in this CR, but we need to do our job. We need to fund the government. If we don’t take action now, we will be back here month after month, year after year doing the exact same thing. Thank you.” ###
09.18.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the U.S. Senate passed the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement: “Iowans, and all Americans, deserve to know the cost of their prescriptions and pharmacists should have the ability to share that information prior to purchase. As a result of this legislation, we will see more transparency in prescription drug costs, and Americans will pay less for their prescription drugs. This is a win-win for Iowa consumers and pharmacists.” Background: The Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act will ban the inclusion of pharmacy “gag-clauses,” which are contract provisions imposed by health insurance plans and pharmacy benefit managers that restrict pharmacists from providing certain pricing information to patients. For example, a prescription drug might cost less by paying out-of-pocket rather than through insurance, but under the “gag-clause” pharmacists are prohibited from disclosing that information.
09.18.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, the U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, which included Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) legislation, Access to Increased Drug Disposal (AIDD) Act. “The U.S. Senate is responding to the opioid crisis in a meaningful and thoughtful way to help those struggling with this crippling epidemic. This a great step toward ensuring that Iowans, and all Americans, have access to treatment opportunities and community-based support programs to combat the opioid epidemic, all while providing much-needed flexibility at the state and local level. The AIDD Act, will help states increase the number of drug take-back programs,” said Senator Joni Ernst. The Opioid Crisis Response Act: funds the 21st Century Cures Act opioid grants through fiscal year 2021; helps expedite research related to substance abuse; provides treatment and recovery support services for patients with substance abuse problems; and, increases access to addiction treatment medications. As part of the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018, Iowa will continue to receive critical funding through the Opioid State Targeted Response Grants. Over the past two years, Iowa has been awarded over five million dollars in grant money and has used the funding to enhance infrastructure to address opioid misuse and increase awareness through statewide prevention efforts. Iowa has also used its grant funding to improve its Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, which is used by health care providers to track prescriptions and prevent misuse of prescription drugs. Senator Ernst’s AIDD Act, which was included in the package, is designed to increase participation in federal prescription drug take-back programs to help combat prescription drug abuse and the growing opioid epidemic. It addresses the cost of participation by creating a demonstration program allowing five states to apply for grant funding from the Department of Justice. The selected states will then issue a report detailing how the grant funding was administered, which entities received funding, and how it impacted participation rates – providing additional insight into how best to improve the program and increase participation nationwide. “Unused and improperly disposed of medication increases the risk of abuse, misuse and diversion. The grants made available through AIDD will help health care settings, such as community pharmacies and clinics with an on-site pharmacy, implement disposal options for patients and their families,” said Dr. Kate Gainer, executive vice president and CEO of Iowa Pharmacy Association. “You’ll find unused meds sitting in medicine cabinets in practically every household in this country, which is why NCPA launched its Dispose My Meds program nearly 10 years ago. And yet, community pharmacies’ ability to take back controlled substances from patients is made difficult by a myriad regulations and costly disposal options. NCPA supports efforts to allow easier and safe disposal of excess opioids. That would go a long way toward stopping misuse, abuse, diversion, overdose, and even deaths. We applaud inclusion of the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act as part of the Senate’s opioid package, and we look forward to continuing to collaborate in promoting the safe storage and disposal of medications,” said B. Douglas Hoey, CEO of the National Community Pharmacists Association. “We are pleased that the Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act is included in the Opioid Crisis Response Act [that passed the Senate today]. The American Pharmacists Association appreciates Senator Ernst’s efforts to provide patients and families with more drug disposal options to help curb the opioid crisis plaguing our communities. Proper disposal of medication is an important component of combating the opioid epidemic by reducing the number of opioids in circulation and limiting access to those for whom the opioids were not prescribed. APhA is grateful for Senator Ernst’s help in reducing cost barriers for pharmacists and pharmacies who want to implement such programs to reduce the number of unwanted and unused drugs in patients’ home and the risk of their misuse or abuse,” said Alicia Kerry Mica of the American Pharmacists Association.

09.14.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Bloomberg TV yesterday to discuss the latest with regard to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). A portion of her interview is highlighted below. KEVIN CIRILLI: Renewable Fuel Standard…what’s the latest on this? SEN. ERNST: We continue to push the president. I specifically push him on E15 year-round, getting the Reid vapor pressure waiver done so we can sell product and open up for consumer choice regardless of what month they are purchasing their fuel in…We would love to see more transparency in the way the renewable identification numbers are used. We’d also like to see more transparency on how the small refinery waivers are being granted by the EPA. All of this should be no-brainer stuff.

09.13.2018	WASHINGTON – Growth Energy presented Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) with the 2018 Fueling Growth award for her work to advance renewable fuels like ethanol, and to increase consumer choice at the pump. “Rural America is the backbone of our country, and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has been a boon for so many farmers producing corn, soybeans and other biofuel feedstocks. The statute is an invaluable economic engine creating jobs, raising incomes, increasing tax revenues and paving the way for new investment. I am committed to advocating for the RFS, and for removing the nonsensical regulation preventing the sale of E15 year-round, to give consumers renewable fuel options at the pump. “I am honored to receive this award for my work on behalf of Iowans who rely on the renewable fuels industry and am grateful for Growth Energy and its members for the unwavering support,” said Senator Ernst. “Senator Ernst has been a fierce ethanol advocate for Iowa in the United States Senate and fighting for E15 year round at the White House. We are grateful for her unwavering support and are thrilled to present her with the 2018 Fueling Growth Award,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. Background: Senator Ernst was presented the 2018 Fueling Growth award on Wednesday, September 12, 2018 by Growth Energy, a leading biofuels trade association in the country. The association represents producers and suppliers of ethanol, including nearly half of American ethanol plants and many of the largest fuel retailers in the country. Senator Ernst has been a leading advocate for the RFS, including urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase volume obligations for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel, and ensure that small refinery exemptions are accounted for in its final rule setting renewable volume obligations under the RFS. She has held administration officials’ feet to the fire over the RFS, including former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, and continues to work with President Trump, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue, and current EPA Administration Andrew Wheeler on protecting the RFS and implementing year-round E15.

09.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the White House announced that President Donald Trump has partially approved Governor Kim Reynolds’ (R-IA) request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration for Lee, Marion, Marshall and Van Buren counties. These areas were recently affected by severe storms and tornadoes on July 19, 2018. Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “I commend Governor Reynolds and her team for their tireless efforts and rapid response in the wake of the recent severe weather. While this is only a partial approval, I am glad to see President Trump approve this disaster declaration and provide Iowa public and non-profit entities with the resources they need to rebuild.” Background: A Presidential Disaster Declaration for Public Assistance puts into motion long-term federal recovery programs. These funds can be used for repair and replacement of disaster-damaged facilities as well as a number of other things, including loans needed by communities for essential government functions and grants for public schools. Governor Reynold’s request for federal funding under the Individual Assistance Program is still under review for Marshall and Polk counties.

09.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement today, in regard to a report from KCRG, about an Iowan’s remains that were identified through DNA testing. Iowan Robert J. Bennett was aboard the USS Oklahoma when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. “Today, I want to honor the bravery and service of Navy Fireman 3rd Class Robert J. Bennett, a native of Monona, Iowa, whose remains have been identified among those killed at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. May Mr. Bennett, and all of the men and women who gave their lives that day as the ultimate sacrifice, rest in peace. “I also want to thank the work of those at the U.S. Department of Defense, who are dedicated to identifying the remains of those who have fallen. Their work helps the families and friends of these servicemembers, and allows us to properly honor these American heroes.” Background: According to KCRG, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced on Monday, September 10, 2018, that they accounted for the remains of Robert J. Bennett. The Agency stated that Mr. Bennett was aboard the USS Oklahoma when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. His remains were among those unidentified after the attack and moved to the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. After DNA testing and thorough evidence, Mr. Bennett’s remains were identified, and now a rosette will be placed next to Bennett’s name on the Walls of the Missing. Also killed on the USS Oklahoma that day was Iowan Father Aloysius H. Schmitt, the first American chaplain of any faith to die in World War II. Lt. j.g. Schmitt was also identified by DNA testing in 2016. On December 7, 2017, he was awarded the Silver Star for helping 12 sailors to safety from a sinking battleship. Senator Ernst’s efforts led to a Naval review of Father Schmitt’s heroic efforts, which ultimately resulted in his noncombat Navy and Marine Corps Medal being upgraded to the combat award.
09.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined her colleagues Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mike Crapo (R-ID) and John Cornyn (R-TX) in urging the Department of Justice to resolve uncertainty surrounding website accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). In a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the senators wrote: “For nearly 30 years, the ADA has protected countless individuals with disabilities, ensuring physical access to ‘any place of public accommodation.’ We support the ADA and all that it stands for. But for the ADA to be effective, it must be clear so that law abiding Americans can faithfully follow the law. Right now it is not clear whether the ADA applies to websites. This leaves businesses and property owners unsure of what standards, if any, govern their online services.” To read the letter in full, click here.
09.12.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, has been recognized as a “Hero of Main Street” by the National Retail Federation (NRF) for consistently supporting public policy priorities important to the retail industry and its millions of small businesses. “I am honored to receive the ‘Hero of Main Street’ award from the National Retail Federation. With 99.3% of businesses in Iowa being small businesses, I understand the importance of protecting the integrity of the retail industry, prioritizing the needs of our small businesses and promoting economic development,” said Senator Ernst. “Retailers and consumers are feeling good about the state of the U.S. economy, and a big part of that is the result of lawmakers who have made economic growth and job creation a top priority,” NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said. “As a Hero of Main Street, Senator Ernst truly understands that the decisions made in Washington have a real impact on local businesses and communities across the country.” Background: The Hero of Main Street award was created by NRF in 2013, and eligibility is based on key votes, bill sponsorship and advocacy to advance retailers’ priorities. Recipients have supported policies that recognize the contributions of the retail industry, and have worked to encourage a “vibrant, sustained and healthy” retail sector.

I congratulate Senator Inhofe and look forward to working with him in his new role as the leader of a committee that is vital to our national defense.”
09.05.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, joined her fellow conferees at today’s public meeting of the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee. The conference committee—made up of nine senators and 47 House members—is tasked with reconciling differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The current Farm Bill expires at the end of September. During her opening remarks, Senator Ernst said, “With the livelihood of farmers and ranchers largely dependent on factors out of their control, completion of this Farm Bill is a must-do and a must-pass, as has been stated already. A Farm Bill can’t, can’t walk beans, a Farm Bill can’t change the forecast, and a Farm Bill can’t restore lost market access, but what it can do is provide our farmers with the tools to navigate this stretch of declining farm income, low commodity prices, and a very turbulent trade climate.” Ernst continued, saying, “We have a real opportunity within this bill to make sure that we are feeding hungry Americans, protecting our natural resources, connecting our country through broadband, putting farmers first, and supporting rural jobs and economic development. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this effort.” To watch Senator Ernst’s remarks in full, click here.
08.27.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement today, in regard to the announcement by President Trump that the United States has reached a two-way trade deal with Mexico: “Mexico, Canada and the United States make up one of the most competitive and successful regional economic platforms in the world. Saddled with low commodity prices and escalating trade disputes, today’s announcement that the United States and Mexico have reached a two-way deal on trade is huge news for Iowa’s farmers and ranchers, and is a monumental step to help restore both market certainty and confidence across rural America. “While I am still reviewing the deal, the President’s fulfillment of a core promise to revamp trade deals brings more certainty to our markets, more money in our pockets, and more confidence to Iowa – and American – farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.” Background: Mexico imports more pork from American producers than any other country and Mexico is a major destination for U.S. corn. Iowa has approximately 87,500 farms, with more than 97 percent of them being owned by farm families. And, Iowa ranks number one in producing many agricultural products, including many of the products that have been directly affected by the ongoing trade negotiations occurring between the U.S. and countries that rely on U.S. agricultural products. For example, Iowa is number one producing: corn, soybeans, eggs, ethanol and biodiesel. In addition, nearly one-third of the nation's hogs are raised in Iowa and Iowa is the number one pork producing state in the U.S. and the top state for pork exports.
08.27.2018	WASHINGTON- U.S. Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa released the following statement on the passing of Senator John McCain of Arizona. "The passing of Senator McCain is a loss for our country that cannot be captured in any statement or words; he personified our country and stood for the values we hold dear. Our country is overwhelmed with grief at his loss. I sincerely appreciated Senator McCain's mentorship and inclusion as a fellow veteran and I will always remember him fondly for his tenacious spirit."
08.23.2018	WASHINGTON– U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced bipartisan legislation today to ensure health insurance coverage for needed treatments and procedures for individuals with a congenital defect, birth abnormality, or disorder. While health insurance plans provide coverage for most treatments and procedures for these conditions, claims for dental and oral-related procedures for congenital defects or birth abnormalities are typically denied. The Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act (ELSA) would close this coverage gap and ensure that health plans cover all medically necessary services to treat a patient’s congenital defect or birth abnormality, including procedures necessary for maintaining overall health and achieving normal body function. Senator Ernst joined Senator Baldwin in introducing this legislation after meeting with the Steele Family of Dallas County, Iowa. At six years old, Allison Steele was diagnosed with Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED), a rare congenital condition that causes the abnormal development of an infant’s skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands. Having been born with misplaced and missing teeth, even with insurance, the Steele family is looking at paying thousands of dollars in out-of-pocket costs to provide Allison with functional teeth. “Those born with congenital anomalies or birth defects should be provided with necessary medical services, and the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act will help correct a gap in health insurance coverage and relieve the financial burden for American families. It’s stories like Allison’s that make this legislation so important, ” said Senator Ernst. Senator Baldwin worked on this legislation after hearing the story of 13 year-old Aidan Abbott of Slinger, Wisconsin who was born with Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED), a rare congenital disease, and who has needed intense dental and oral care such as reconstructive surgeries throughout his life, among other services related to ED. Despite having comprehensive health insurance, the Abbotts were denied coverage for Aidan’s dental work and forced to pay out of pocket for his surgeries. Although most health plans cover care for congenital anomalies, claims are routinely denied or delayed for any oral or dental related procedures due to an individuals’ disorder. “Aidan’s story has inspired my work on this issue to guarantee that individuals born with congenital anomalies have access to the comprehensive health treatments and coverage they need and deserve,” said Senator Baldwin. “Despite covering all of his other medical care, his family’s insurance continues to refuse to cover his dental care needs, forcing them to spend thousands of dollars out of their own pockets. That’s why I’m introducing bipartisan legislation to close this loophole and make sure families like Aidan’s can get the health care they need at a price they can afford.” The bipartisan legislation is supported by the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED), American College of Surgeons, American Dental Association, American Academy of Dermatology Association, American Association of Orthodontists, American Academy of Neurology, Rare and Undiagnosed Network (RUN) and EveryLife Foundation. “Our community is incredibly grateful to our champions Senator Baldwin and Senator Ernst,” said Mary Fete, executive director of the National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias. “ELSA is life changing for individuals who are affected by ectodermal dysplasias and other congenital anomalies. It means that they will receive the medically necessary treatment, including oral health care without fighting a long and often losing battle.” Specifically, the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act would: Ensure that all health plans cover medically necessary services, including reconstructive surgeries and oral-related procedures, as a result of congenital anomalies or birth defects; Stipulate that such coverage include services and procedures that functionally repair or restore any missing or abnormal body part that is medically necessary to achieve normal body functioning or appearance, and clarifies that this includes adjunctive dental, orthodontic or prosthodontic support; and Exclude cosmetic procedures or surgery.

08.23.2018	WASHINGTON – Following a report by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) top watchdog showing nearly half of denied claims involving Military Sexual Trauma were improperly processed, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) called for the VA to better assist veteran survivors of sexual assault and ensure they receive the benefits they’re owed. “Unfortunately, survivors of sexual assault can face a number of obstacles in their recovery,” the Senators wrote in a bipartisan letter to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie. “When they reach out to the VA to receive benefits and treatment, we owe it to them to ensure they do not face the further injustice of an improper denial because VA staff lack proper training on how to handle their claims.” The report by the VA’s Office of Inspector General found that nearly half of denied Military Sexual Trauma claims were not properly processed, which could have resulted in the denial of benefits to survivors who would be entitled to receive them. The report cited multiple factors that led to the improper handling of these claims, including: lack of reviewer specialization, lack of an additional level of review, discontinued special focused reviews, and inadequate training. Ernst and McCaskill have worked together to combat sexual assault in the military and support survivors against retaliation. The 2016 annual defense bill included a plan, which is now law, by Ernst and McCaskill to further curb sexual assault in the military. Ernst and McCaskill’s Military Retaliation Prevention Act targets stubbornly high rates of survivors who report that they have been retaliated against by their peers after coming forward. Those rates of experienced retaliation remain high, even as the number of assaults has dropped and reporting by victims has gone up. Ernst and McCaskill have also teamed up with a bipartisan group of colleagues to address sexual violence on college campuses with the Campus Accountability and Safety Act—legislation to combat sexual assault on college and university campuses by protecting students, promoting equity, and strengthening accountability and transparency for institutions.

08.23.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with her colleagues Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), joined a bipartisan group of 34 other senators urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase volume obligations for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuel, and ensure any small refinery exemptions are accounted for in its final rule setting renewable volume obligations (RVOs) under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The EPA’s June 2018 proposal would raise the biomass-based diesel volume for 2020 to 2.43 billion gallons and increase the advanced biofuel volume for 2019 to 4.88 billion gallons. “While these proposed increases are encouraging, these volumes continue to underestimate the existing potential of the biodiesel and renewable diesel industries in our states,” the senators wrote. “We believe the biodiesel industry can do more and that EPA should demonstrate more confidence in the RFS program’s ability to drive growth. Increasing biomass-based diesel and advance biofuel volumes would encourage investment in capacity and new fuel development. Further, EPA must accurately account for small refiner economic hardship exemptions in the final rule. … It is critical that EPA appropriately account for any small refiner economic hardship exemptions that it reasonably expects to grant during the 2019 compliance year in the final rule, or EPA will not be able to fulfill its duty to ensure RVOs are met.” As the senators noted in their letter, every 500 million gallon increase in biodiesel production supports an estimated 16,000 jobs. The senators continued, “We have made great progress through the RFS in diversifying our nation’s fuel supply while creating and sustaining jobs, strengthening local economies, generating tax revenues, and improving energy security. We urge you to continue to increase annual RVOs for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels and to ensure that, once set, the annual RVOs are fully met.” In addition to Ernst, Grassley, Murray, Blunt and Heitkamp, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OHO), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Bob Casey (D-PA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), John Hoeven (R-ND), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Ed Markey (D-MA), Claire McCaskill (R-MO), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jack Reed (D-RI), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), John Thune (R-SD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

08.22.2018	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced a bipartisan amendment to the Defense and Health and Human Services “minibus III” funding bill to require the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on federal efforts to study the prevalence of traumatic brain injuries among victims of domestic violence. “Research has shown that the traumatic brain injuries experienced by professional athletes and soldiers have devastating, long-term effects on brain health and overall well-being,” said Cortez Masto. “We owe it to the survivors of domestic violence to research the effects and develop treatment methods for abuse related head injuries with the same urgency and resources. These victims should not have to suffer in silence. I have spent my career fighting to protect and support victims of domestic violence. This amendment is the next step in guaranteeing that survivors get the support they need to recover.” “This amendment is part of my ongoing efforts to combat domestic violence,” Ernst said. “The more information available to the public the better, and this amendment provides us with the opportunity to open new avenues for research and increase public awareness of domestic violence and traumatic brain injury.” BACKGROUND: In May of this year, National Public Radio (NPR) published a report which examined the evidence of links between intimate partner violence and traumatic brain injuries. Some estimates suggest that 20 million victims of domestic violence each year could suffer traumatic head injuries. Some researchers suggest these injuries may be comparable to pro athletes who receive numerous, sustained blows to the head. However, there are few studies on the strength of the relationship or the total number of people impacted by this issue. The Traumatic Brain Injury Study Amendment would specifically require the GAO to report on federal efforts to study the impact of traumatic brain injuries among victims of domestic violence, as well as issue recommendations on how to improve education of the public and provide better treatment for survivors. This amendment is supported by the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), National Resource Center on Domestic Violence (NRCDV), National Center on Domestic Violence, Trauma & Mental Health (NCDVTMH), and the Nevada Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence (NCEDSV). Text of the amendment can be found HERE.
08.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Iowa Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst released the following statement today, following the announcement from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, today, with regard to the location of Mollie Tibbetts, a University of Iowa student, who disappeared on July 18: “We are deeply saddened that this bright, young woman’s life was cut short. Our heart goes out to the family and friends of Mollie Tibbetts. No family should ever have to endure such a tragedy, especially one that could have been prevented. We are thankful for the hard work of Governor Kim Reynolds and federal, state and local law enforcement as they continue to find answers for Mollie’s family and the American public and bring the killer to justice. As Governor Reynolds said, ‘our immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community.’ Too many Iowans have been lost at the hands of criminals who broke our immigration laws. We cannot allow these tragedies to continue,” – Sens. Grassley & Ernst. Background Senator Ernst introduced, and Senator Grassley cosponsored legislation, Sarah’s Law, to honor another young Iowan woman, Sarah Root, who was killed in 2016 by an illegal immigrant. Sarah’s Law would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and is charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. It would also amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the federal government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally, violated the terms of their immigration status, or had their visa revoked and is thereafter charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person.
08.21.2018	WASHINGTON – On Monday, the White House announced that President Donald Trump had approved Governor Kim Reynolds’ (R-IA) request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration for 30 counties impacted by flooding and severe weather from June 6-July 2, 2018. The entire Iowa congressional delegation supported the Governor’s request. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement. “I applaud the diligent efforts of Governor Reynolds, as she showed leadership on the ground and worked hard to ensure all Iowans affected by the severe weather have the resources they need to rebuild. I’m thankful to our entire congressional delegation in urging President Trump to expeditiously approve Iowa’s disaster declaration.” Background: The counties included in the declaration are: Adair, Buchanan, Buena Vista, Cerro Gordo, Cherokee, Chickasaw, Clay, Dallas, Delaware, Dickinson, Emmet, Floyd, Hamilton, Hancock, Howard, Humboldt, Kossuth, Lyon, O'Brien, Osceola, Palo Alto, Pocahontas, Polk, Sioux, Story, Warren, Webster, Winnebago, Winneshiek and Wright. A Presidential Major Disaster Declaration puts into motion long-term federal recovery programs, some of which are partially matched by state programs, and designed to help public entities and select non-profits. Funds may be used for emergency work and the repair or replacement of disaster-damaged facilities and may include debris removal, emergency protective measures, repair of damaged public property, loans needed by communities for essential government functions and grants for public schools. Damage assessments in the seven declared counties showed an estimated $16 million worth of damage that could be eligible for assistance. Click here to read the full declaration from the White House.
08.17.2018	WASHINGTON—Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, submitted comments to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler on the proposed volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for calendar year 2019, and the proposed biomass-based diesel volume for calendar year 2020. The Senator stated in the letter, “The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) effectively reduced the RFS volume obligations by over two billion gallons in 2016 and 2017 through small refinery exemptions, decreasing both corn and ethanol demand. The proposed increase to the amount of renewable fuel blended into transportation fuel is encouraging, but does not account for demand destruction.” Senator Ernst continued by urging the Agency to “follow through on the President’s directive and remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round. Granting Reid vapor pressure (RVP) relief for E15 is a no-cost solution that will expand a domestic market for farmers who have been adversely impacted by ongoing trade disputes.” Read the Senator’s full letter here or below. Acting Administrator Andrew R. Wheeler Office of the Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20460 Re: Docket ID No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2018-0167 Dear Acting Administrator Wheeler: On behalf of Iowa and the state’s agriculture industry, thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for cellulosic biofuel, advanced biofuel, and total renewable fuel for calendar year 2019, and the proposed biomass-based diesel volume for calendar year 2020. Agriculture drives Iowa’s economy, and the RFS is critically important to the state’s continued growth and development. A strong and robust RFS encourages consumer choice, investment, and innovation; all while increasing our country’s energy independence. While I am pleased the proposed rule sets the corn ethanol requirement at levels intended by Congress, I remain disappointed that the 2020 biomass-based biodiesel requirement was not increased to accurately reflect current domestic usage and production capacity. Iowa is the nation’s leader in renewable fuels production with 43 ethanol refineries capable of producing more than 4.4 billion gallons annually and 12 biodiesel facilities with the capacity to produce nearly 400 million gallons each year. The industry supports almost 50,000 jobs across the state and accounts for $5.0 billion of Iowa GDP. This underscores the need for honesty and transparency. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) effectively reduced the RFS volume obligations by over two billion gallons in 2016 and 2017 through small refinery exemptions, decreasing both corn and ethanol demand. The proposed increase to the amount of renewable fuel blended into transportation fuel is encouraging, but does not account for demand destruction. I respectfully ask EPA to reallocate waived gallons and establish a clear procedure to ensure obligated parties demonstrate “disproportionate economic hardship” before an exemption is granted. Moreover, EPA should follow through on the President’s directive and remove the outdated restriction on the sale of E15 year-round. Granting Reid vapor pressure (RVP) relief for E15 is a no-cost solution that will expand a domestic market for farmers who have been adversely impacted by ongoing trade disputes. RVP relief would not only boost farm income, but also jumpstart growth and development across rural America during a time of economic hardship. The final rule issued by EPA should follow Congressional intent, both the spirt and the letter of the law. I encourage EPA to uphold its commitment to a strong and robust RFS. Thank you again for the opportunity to comment. Sincerely, Senator Joni K. Ernst
08.02.2018	WASHINGTON- U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) today introduced bipartisan legislation to provide more veterans an opportunity to translate their military training into college credit, which is important to helping increase veteran graduation rates. The Military Learning for Credit Act allows all veterans to use veterans education assistance funds to cover portfolio assessments and fees for standardized examinations that can be translated into college credit at thousands of institutions of higher education. “Our servicemembers and their families deserve the opportunity to use their military training educational assistance for college credit. Allowing all veterans to use veterans education assistance funds to cover portfolio assessments and fees for standardized examinations will reduce the expenses covered by federal funding, while simultaneously increasing veteran graduation rates,” said Senator Ernst. “Our veterans receive intense and thorough training as servicemembers, often during the years when other Americans are attending college. The least we can do is ensure that once they enroll in college, veterans have every opportunity to translate their military training into college credit. Permitting all veterans to take credit exams and receive portfolio assessments for free will save our veterans’ time and money while working toward a degree while also reducing federal funding expenditures through the GI bill. It truly is a win for all,” said Senator Coons. Colleges and universities are actively recruiting veterans and receiving $10 billion a year in funding that veterans use through the GI bill. However, schools are not required to grant any credit for prior military learning—and, research shows many colleges and universities do not. The Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) has found that a student who is able to receive prior learning credits is two and a half times more likely to graduate than a student who has no prior credits. A one-pager on the bill is available here. The bill text is available here.
08.01.2018	Bipartisan Legislation Requires the Department of Defense, Rather than Department of Commerce, to Justify National Security Basis for New Tariffs Under Section 232 WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced the Trade Security Act, legislation that will reform Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to better align the statute with its original intent as a powerful trade remedy tool for the president and Congress to respond to genuine threats to national security. This legislation addresses concerns that misuse of Section 232 will harm jobs and the economy and likely result in a loss of this trade remedy tool, either at the hands of a World Trade Organization dispute settlement panel or as the result of other congressional action. In keeping with the original intent of Section 232, this bill makes common-sense reforms that require the Department of Defense to justify the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232 and increases congressional oversight of this process. The text of the bill is here. A brief summary is below. “We must hold countries that violate our trade laws accountable, but we must do so in a way that protects American jobs and strengthens the U.S. economy,” said Senator Portman. “I have repeatedly expressed concerns about the misuse of the Section 232 statute to impose tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, and its impact on Ohio jobs and the U.S. economy as a whole. This bipartisan legislation maintains this trade tool while properly placing the national security designation at the Department of Defense and expanding the role of Congress in the process. As a former USTR, I know that misusing our trade tools not only hurts our exports and our manufacturers, but also our consumers, so I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.” “We cannot resolve perceived trade imbalances by accusing our allies of being a threat to our national security. If a trading partner is suspected of undermining our national security, that claim needs to be thoroughly investigated by those with relevant expertise in the Department of Defense,” said Senator Jones. “Unfortunately, the current process led by the Department of Commerce has been misused to target important job-creating industries in Alabama like auto manufacturing. I’m proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with Senator Portman that will reform the Section 232 process and help to refocus our efforts on punishing bad actors, rather than hurting American manufacturers, workers, and consumers.” “ When it comes to national security, we must hold bad actors accountable,” said Senator Ernst. “I support the president’s ability to make trade deals and keep our nation secure, but the Department of Defense must justify the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232, and we must increase congressional oversight of this process.” NOTE: The Trade Security Act will reform the Section 232 statute and ensure that (1) any Section 232 actions are based on a national security determination by the Department of Defense; and (2) Congress has a larger role to play in 232 actions. Specifically, this bill will: Bifurcate the existing Section 232 process into an investigation phase, led by the Department of Defense, and a remedy phase, led by the Department of Commerce. Splitting these responsibilities, while guaranteeing consultation between the two departments at all stages of the process, plays to each department’s strengths to ensure that the statute is used for genuine national security purposes. Require the Department of Defense – instead of the Department of Commerce – to justify the national security basis for new tariffs under Section 232 and make the determination about the national security threat posed by imports of certain products. If a threat is found, the Department of Defense would send its report to the president. In the event that the president desires to take action based on the finding of a national security threat, the president would then direct the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the U.S. Trade Representative, to develop recommendations for how to respond to the threat. After receiving the recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce, the president would decide whether to take action. Increase the role of Congress in the Section 232 process by expanding the process whereby Congress can disapprove of a Section 232 action by passing a joint resolution of disapproval. Currently, Section 232 contains a disapproval resolution process limited only to the disapproval of actions on oil imports, which was inserted into Section 232 in 1980 by Congress in response to concerns about the misuse of the statute. This bill would expand the use of that disapproval resolution process to all types of products. The reformed disapproval process will only apply to future Section 232 actions. Require consultation with Congress throughout the Section 232 process.
08.01.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, was one of nine senators appointed to the 2018 Farm Bill Conference Committee, which is tasked with reconciling differences between the Farm Bills passed by the Senate and the House of Representatives. The current Farm Bill expires at the end of September. “I am grateful to Majority Leader McConnell and Chairman Roberts for selecting me to serve on the Farm Bill Conference Committee. Farmers, ranchers and rural communities are the backbone of America’s economy, and we must provide them with the certainty and predictability they deserve. Finding common ground is imperative for producers and consumers across the country, and I am committed to working with my colleagues on a compromise agreement that ensures stability for our farmers,” said Senator Ernst. The Senate Conference Committee includes: Senate Agriculture Chairman Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.), Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.). The bipartisan Senate Farm Bill includes many of Senator Ernst’s priorities including: Bipartisan legislation with Senator Heitkamp (D-ND) to strengthen and improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Level program; Bipartisan Give Our Resources the Opportunity to Work (GROW) Act of 2018, introduced with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Bob Casey (D-PA) to revise and strengthen the current provisions of CRP, the Conservation Stewardship Program and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program; Bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act, introduced with Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), which will strengthen the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and incentivize rural and urban partnerships for conservation; Bipartisan Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act, introduced with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), to provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources; and a Proposal for a pilot program that would encourage Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to purchase more milk to improve participants diets, especially lower-income families with children.
08.01.2018	Says, “RVP parity would not only boost commodity prices, but also be viewed across rural America as the Trump Administration taking concrete action to help during a time of economic hardship” WASHINGTON – Today, during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to uphold the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), provide Reid vapor pressure (RVP) relief for ethanol blends that are E15 and higher and to reallocate biofuel gallons lost to small refinery exemptions. “Over the past year and a half, EPA has taken actions that benefit refiners at the expense of farmers. By retroactively granting an unprecedented number of small refinery exemptions, EPA effectively waived 2.25 billion gallons from refiners’ 2016 and 2017 RFS obligations. Not only do these actions contradict President Trump’s pledge to uphold congressionally mandated volumes, but they have also destroyed corn and ethanol demand, leading to lost income for Iowa’s farmers at a time when farm income is already at its lowest level since 2006,” said Senator Ernst. Senator Ernst continued to question Mr. Wheeler on the RFS, specifically asking for a commitment from the EPA to grant the RVP waiver, which President Trump again expressed support for during his visit to Iowa last week. “RVP parity and the sale of E15 year-round is a no-cost solution that will expand a domestic market for farmers who have been adversely impacted by retaliatory tariffs. RVP parity would not only boost commodity prices, but also be viewed across rural America as the Trump Administration taking concrete action to help during a time of economic hardship. Acting Administrator Wheeler, I encourage you to follow through on the President’s directive and remove this unnecessary and ridiculous restriction,” said Senator Ernst. In response to Ernst’s questions, Mr. Wheeler agreed that the RFS should be implemented consistent with the original intent of Congress. He stressed that the Agency is trying to be “more clear and transparent on granting” small refinery exemptions and indicated the need for a reallocation strategy.

08.01.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, released the following statement after the Senate passed the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The final package includes a number of the Iowa Senator’s measures and now heads to President Trump’s desk. “Congress has done its duty and provided the necessary tools to our servicemembers who sacrifice daily to protect our country and maintain our freedoms. This bipartisan NDAA sustains and strengthens our national security against global threats, and I am pleased to see a number of my priorities included in this year’s bill. I applaud my colleagues for their diligence in passing this necessary and bipartisan legislation, and urge the President to swiftly sign this bill into law,” said Senator Ernst. The Senate, last month, passed the NDAA with Senator Ernst’s support. The final package secured many of Senator Ernst’s provisions to help bolster our nation’s security and support our military, including: A provision to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) artificial intelligence initiatives and research and development are better coordinated with academic research and industry; Bipartisan legislation with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to treat and raise awareness for Traumatic Brain Injuries among servicemembers, specifically in training environments; Authorization of additional research funding for physiological episodes plaguing our servicemembers, along with a provision that authorizes nearly $31 million in funding; Authorization for the creation of a U.S. Army Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence in partnership with an arsenal; A provision requiring DoD to develop a comprehensive space warfighting strategy, examine the feasibility of a declassification strategy to ensure deterrence, and examine the United States’ posture in the space warfighting domain; Efforts to allow the Secretary of Defense to enable servicemembers to obtain professional credentials unrelated to their military career to enable a smoother transition; Authorization for a Defense Institute on Human Factors Modeling and Simulation to maximize the effectiveness of the warfighter in each service branch; Expansion of Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program to include irregular warfare.
07.31.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today met with President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued the statement below: “Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a highly-qualified, well-respected justice. As members of the Senate, it is not often that we get the opportunity to give our advice and consent on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices. It is even rarer that we get the opportunity to confirm someone as highly qualified and well-respected as Brett Kavanaugh. “From my conversation with Judge Kavanaugh—and from his tremendous experience on the bench—I believe he is committed to the rule of law and the United States Constitution. I look forward to confirming Judge Brett Kavanaugh as our next Supreme Court Justice, and I thank him, and his family, for their willingness to serve our nation.”
07.30.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will host a U.S. Service Academy Open House for Iowa students interested in applying to, or learning more about service academies. Academy representatives from the nation’s five service academies will be available to answer questions on the application and nomination process. “I am thrilled to provide the opportunity for Iowa students to visit with service academy representatives and learn more about serving our great nation,” said Senator Ernst. “I hope Iowans who are interested in applying to one of our country’s finest institutions of higher learning will join me for my U.S. Service Academy Open House in Johnston on August 10th.” Each year, Senator Ernst has the honor and responsibility of nominating Iowa students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. However, she cannot nominate students to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, as a congressional nomination is not needed to apply. This event is open to the public.

07.25.2018	WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke on the floor of the Senate in support of the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court. The full transcript of the Senator’s remarks can be found below. “I rise today to voice my support for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. “As the final arbiter of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the sacred duty of ensuring equal justice under the law to the American people. The Supreme Court wields the immense power of judicial review. Alexis de Tocqueville described this power of the Supreme Court when he called it “a more imposing judicial power than was ever constituted by any other people.” “As members of the Senate, it is not often that we get the opportunity to give our advice and consent on the confirmation of Supreme Court justices. It is even rarer that we get the opportunity to confirm someone as highly qualified and well-respected as Brett Kavanaugh. “I am especially impressed by Judge Kavanaugh’s interpretation of the Constitution as it applies to the ever encroaching power of federal agencies. “Even before the people of Iowa sent me to Washington, I was horrified by the impact of increasingly burdensome regulations imposed on hardworking men, women, and businesses across America by unleashed federal bureaucrats. “An excellent example of this is the infamous Waters of the United States rule promulgated by the Obama EPA. The Obama administration’s bloated definition of the waters of the U.S. would have put 97 percent of Iowa under EPA jurisdiction. Even a tire track filled with water on an Iowa farm would have been subject to federal regulation. “Federal agencies have been allowed to implement such destructive regulations in part due to the Supreme Court giving them deference. While a certain degree of deference is needed, I am concerned that a too broad deferential standard separates the people of the United States from Washington bureaucrats. It fails to place an adequate check on executive and administrative power. “Throughout his career as both a highly respected legal scholar and a judge on the esteemed D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Kavanaugh has written critically of widening the scope of this already far-reaching deferential standard. He wrote, in part, that this deference “encourages the Executive Branch to be extremely aggressive in seeking to squeeze its policy goals into ill-fitting statutory authorizations and restraints.” “This could not have been what the founders intended when they developed our Constitution and our government. “I could not agree more with Judge Kavanaugh’s concerns. And I look forward to the Judge’s levelheaded leadership and thinking on the Supreme Court. “In addition, I was proud to hear that Judge Kavanaugh has had the chance to work with Iowans. State Representative Mary Ann Hanusa, who represents the city of Council Bluffs, had the opportunity to work with Judge Kavanaugh when he served as Staff Secretary in the White House. “Representative Hanusa describes Judge Kavanaugh as hardworking, dedicated, and impartial in his duties. All traits that I require in a Supreme Court justice. “Under Chairman Grassley’s leadership, I believe that we will have a thorough, timely, and successful confirmation process, just as we did with Neil Gorsuch. I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan gimmicks and games and support the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh.” Click here or on the image above to watch the speech.

This bipartisan NDAA sustains and strengthens our national security against global threats, and I am pleased to see a number of my priorities included in this year’s bill. As the U.S. faces numerous security challenges, it’s imperative we swiftly pass this year’s NDAA and send it to President Trump’s desk,” said Senator Ernst. The Senate, last month, passed the NDAA with Senator Ernst’s support. The final package, which awaits passage in both the House and the Senate, secured many of Senator Ernst’s provisions to help bolster our nation’s security and support our military, including: A provision to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) artificial intelligence initiatives and research and development are better coordinated with academic research and industry; Bipartisan legislation with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to treat and raise awareness for Traumatic Brain Injuries among servicemembers, specifically in training environments; Additional research funding for physiological episodes plaguing our servicemembers, along with a provision that authorizes nearly $31 million in funding; Authorization for the creation of a U.S. Army Advanced Manufacturing Center of Excellence in partnership with an arsenal; A provision requiring DoD to develop a comprehensive space warfighting strategy, examine the feasibility of a declassification strategy to ensure deterrence, and examine the United States’ posture in the space warfighting domain; Efforts to allow the Secretary of Defense to enable servicemembers to obtain professional credentials unrelated to their military career to enable a smoother transition; Authorization for a Defense Institute on Human Factors Modeling and Simulation to maximize the effectiveness of the warfighter in each service branch; Expansion of Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program to include irregular warfare.

07.24.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), today, issued the following statement after an announcement by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in regard to actions the department is taking to assist farmers in response to the escalating trade war: “In Iowa alone, more than 456,000 jobs are supported by global trade, and these new tariffs are threatening $977 million in state exports. While a trade mitigation package could boost farmer morale in the short term, this is ultimately a short term fix. We need a longer-term strategy to ensure that farmers are able to sell their goods around the globe. I will continue to push the administration to open up new markets and finalize trade deals, steps that will go the distance to ensure the success of America and Iowa’s agricultural economy,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Background: In advance of President Trump’s trip to Iowa this week, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue announced today that USDA will be taking several steps to assist farmers in response to tariffs and the escalating trade war. President Trump directed Secretary Perdue to develop a short-term relief strategy, while the administration continues to work on a longer-term plan to secure free, fair and reciprocal trade deals to open more markets for American products. Specifically, USDA will authorize up to $12 billion in programs, which is in line with the estimated $11 billion impact of the retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural goods. These programs will assist agricultural producers to meet the costs of disrupted markets. Additional information can be found on USDA’s website here. # # #
07.23.2018	It was a busy week in Washington and Iowa last week! From meeting with the Iowa Farm Bureau and Corn Congress to touring opportunity zones with Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and severe weather damage in the Des Moines area, Senator Ernst has been hard at work for the men and women of the Hawkeye State. National News On Wednesday, Senator Ernst joined Dana Perino on The Daily Briefing to talk trade and the Citizens Against Government Waste 2018 Congressional Pig Book. Roll Call also covered some of the Senator’s remarks on the Pig Book and her efforts to Make ‘em Squeal in Washington! Senator Ernst also joined Willie Geist and crew on Morning Joe on Thursday to discuss the Helsinki Summit, trade and her efforts on paid family leave. The Senator stressed that she has the utmost faith in the U.S. intelligence community and their assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Russia has never been a friend to the U.S., and they continue to pose a threat to America and our allies. Iowa News This week, Senator Ernst met with the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Corn Congress attendees, and the Iowa Farm Bureau where the topics were: trade, trade, trade and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). She then talked with NBC News’ Vaughn Hillyard about the importance of meeting with these constituent groups and sent a clear message that we must preserve the RFS and work to get trade deals done soon. On Thursday, Senator Ernst hosted a conference call for Iowa press. Outlets from across Iowa—and even from the Omaha World-Herald—joined the call to discuss opportunity zones, trade, farm bill updates and more. KMA Land’s Mike Peterson reported on Senator Ernst’s comments on the importance of opportunity zones for the Iowa economy: “If there are other entities that have looked for a way to gain foothold in an organization, and for the betterment of that community, that's what we would like to see. So, if we are able to provide those funds in that Opportunity Zone, development [sic.] some of the infrastructure that's within those zones, get those businesses located in those zones, we think it would be so much better, not only for the property tax base, but for employability opportunities.” While James Lynch with the Gazette, touched on other issues like: trade, Russia and the farm bill. Also this week, Senator Ernst issued a strong response to White House trade advisor Peter Navarro telling CNBC that the economic impact of a trade war is a mere “rounding error,” and that the administration is playing a broader “chess board.” Agri-Pulse and Politico Morning Trade reported on Senator Ernst’s remarks: “In Iowa alone, more than 456,000 jobs are supported by trade, and these new tariffs are threatening $977 million in state exports. That is no ‘rounding error.’” On Friday, Senator Ernst toured tornado damage in Marshalltown and Bondurant, and spoke with leaders in the area to ensure Iowans that her office is ready to help. Our Quad Cities covered Governor Reynolds and Sen. Ernst’s tour of the damaged areas. In other news… Early in the week, Senator Ernst, as well as the entire Iowa delegation, invited U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler to visit Iowa and hear directly from those who rely upon the RFS. Speaking of the RFS, at a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing this week, Senator Ernst questioned Mary Bridget Neumayr—a nominee to lead the Council on Environmental Quality—about the RFS and year-round E15. In response to Senator Ernst’s questions, Ms. Neumayr stated that, if confirmed, she will seek to support RFS implementation consistent with the intent of the law, congressional directives and the President’s commitments. She also pledged to engage with the biofuels industry and all key stakeholders when dealing with any issue pertaining to the RFS. On Tuesday, CNN reported that Senator Ernst has been appointed to the Senate North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Observer Group. The Senate NATO Observer Group was re-established by Senators Tillis and Shaheen in 2018 with an expanded mission to closely monitor and inform Senators outside of national security committees about defense spending commitments of Alliance members, the process of upgrading military capabilities, the Alliance’s counterterrorism capability, NATO enlargement and the ability of NATO member states to address non-conventional warfare.
07.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) stressed the importance of biofuels to rural communities and the need to uphold the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) during a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing on the nomination of Mary Bridget Neumayr to be a Member of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ). “The RFS is critical to America’s farmers and this has been in the headlines as of late. It is an issue that’s very important to me and a number of my colleagues and of course our rural communities. In 2016 and 2017, we’ve learned that EPA, under former Administrator Scott Pruitt’s leadership, granted 48 small refinery hardship exemptions of the 53 petitions that had been submitted to the Agency. These waivers effectively reduced the 2016 and 2017 Renewable Volume Obligations by a combined 2.25 billion gallons of biofuels, which has significantly weakened the demand for biofuels, put thousands of our jobs in jeopardy and truly undermined congressional intent of the law,” said Senator Ernst. Senator Ernst continued to press Ms. Neumayr on the RFS, particularly the benefits offering E15 year-round would have on Iowa growers and fuel retailers across the country. While CEQ does not directly engage in the administration of the RFS, Mrs. Neumayr will serve as an adviser in close proximity to the President, who has repeatedly pledged his support for the RFS and rural America. “As you know, E15 is a federally approved blend of 15 percent ethanol and 85 percent regular gasoline. Fuel retailers across the country want to offer E15 year-round, and these retailers have invested millions of dollars in infrastructure to help make this possible. However, we do have an outdated Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) regulation which is blocking them from offering E15 during the summer months – which would be June 1 through September 15. The year-round sale of higher ethanol blends, like E15, would provide benefits not only to farmers, but also to consumers and our environment,” said Senator Ernst. In response to Senator Ernst’s questions, Ms. Neumayr stated that, if confirmed, she will seek to support RFS implementation consistent with the intent of the law, congressional directives and the President’s commitments. She also pledged to engage with the biofuel industry and all key stakeholders when dealing with any issue pertaining to the RFS.

07.19.2018	Says, “Every day, 24-7, 365 days a year, ICE agents are on the front lines, working to dismantle human trafficking networks and protect the most vulnerable” WASHINGTON –Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke on the floor of the Senate in support of a resolution denouncing calls for the elimination of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The full transcript of the Senator’s remarks can be found below. Click here or on the image below to watch. “Today, I rise today to voice my support for the brave men and women of America’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). “Unfortunately, a resolution that would have shown this body’s unanimous support for these courageous individuals was blocked. “While the Border Patrol has the important mission of maintaining security at our borders, ICE agents have the critical mission of enforcing immigration laws inside the United States. These two work hand in hand – our nation cannot have border security without enforcing our laws inside communities and we cannot have secure communities without enforcing our laws at our borders. “But the critical mission of ICE goes far beyond just immigration enforcement, these folks are on the front lines of our homeland security. “Here is just a short list of the types of activities ICE is involved in: Investigating and combatting drug smuggling, Stopping human trafficking, Preventing gang-related crimes, and Working with other law enforcement entities to stop criminal and terrorist networks from operating. “Iowa, along with the rest of the country, has been gripped by an opioid crisis that puts our people and safety at risk. “Additionally, we continue to have a very grave methamphetamine issue that threatens the core of many of our already struggling rural communities. We need ICE to help stop the flow of these drugs into Iowa’s communities- our schools, our workplaces, our children, our families. In 2017 alone, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations seized nearly one million pounds of narcotics. “Abolishing ICE would turn the flow of illegal drugs across the border from a stream, into a monsoon. “I also implore anyone challenging the need for ICE to look at the horrendous toll of human trafficking. Young and innocent women and men, boys and girls, used as human pawns – smuggled across the border with hopes of a better life, only to be sold into sexual slavery, forced into prostitution, or worse. Raped, beaten, subject to sexual diseases, and stripped of all innocence and dignity. “Sadly, human trafficking is a major issue in Iowa. In 2016, for instance, Des Moines was identified as one of the country’s top 100 human trafficking locations. Human traffickers often exploit our immigration laws to transport their victims – and our ICE agents are the ones that help stop them and stop their activities. “Every day, 24-7, 365 days a year, ICE agents are on the front lines, working to dismantle human trafficking networks and protect the most vulnerable. I urge my colleagues to reconsider their objections, and to support not only the resolution but the officers and personnel who carry out the vital mission of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in order to ensure the safety and security of all Americans.”
07.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Ernst released the following statement, with regard to White House trade advisor Peter Navarro telling CNBC that theeconomic impact of a trade war is a mere “rounding error,” and that the administration is playing a broader “chess board”: “Mr. Navarro, America’s farmers are caught in the crosshairs of this game of ‘chess.’ Offhand comments like the ones that Mr. Navarro made in his interview with CNBC today disregard the people whose livelihoods depend on global trade. In Iowa alone, more than 456,000 jobs are supported by trade, and these new tariffs are threatening $977 million in state exports. That is no ‘rounding error.’ Those are real people – Iowans – who are waiting for terms to be negotiated, for new deals to be finalized. We need to lessen the pressure on these hard-working farmers, and let them sell their goods. “Iowans come to me every day to talk about trade, trade, trade and the RFS. And, I have had productive conversations with Ambassador Lighthizer, Secretary Perdue and President Trump about the administration’s hard work to open up new markets for our products and finalize pending deals. Farmers are optimistic, but we can’t take optimism to the bank. Comments like the ones made by Mr. Navarro hurt that progress and hurt our farmers.” Background: On Thursday, July 19, 2018, in a CNBC interview Peter Navarro downplayed the economic effects of tariffs.
07.17.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, U.S. Congressman David Young and the Iowa congressional delegation sent a letter this week to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, inviting him to Iowa to meet with the farmers and rural communities that rely on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). "Renewable fuels are critical to achieving energy independence in the United States and play an important role in Iowa’s economy," the delegation said in the letter. "Across Iowa, cooperatives and renewable fuel plants dot the landscape. We invite you to visit Iowa and look forward to working with you." The delegation letter outlined their concern that EPA granted 48 small refinery "hardship waivers” in 2016 and 2017 under former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s leadership, which resulted in the loss of 2.25 billion gallons of biofuels under the RFS. The delegation also asked Acting Administrator Wheeler to reconsider the proposed rule and to account for any waived RFS obligations so they do not reduce the overall level of renewable fuels blended. Read the text of the letter below. Dear Administrator Wheeler: You hold a very important role as the acting Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It is our expectation you will reinforce the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and bolster our nation’s energy security. We’re encouraged by your statement at your confirmation hearing last year where you said, “The RFS is the law of the land. I fully support the program.” Iowa farmers deserve nothing less. Renewable fuels are critical to achieving energy independence in the United States and play an important role in Iowa’s economy. We remain concerned about the demand destruction of 2.25 billion gallons due to the unprecedented number of small refinery “hardship” waivers granted in 2016 and 2017. The recently released 2019 proposed rule indicates there will be no accounting moving forward of gallons that might be waived under the small refinery waivers in order to maintain the statutory Renewable Volume Obligation. A reduction in demand for renewable fuels pushes commodity prices even lower and farmers are already facing low commodity prices. We strongly urge you to reconsider the proposed rule and work to ensure that the final rule is structured to ensure that any waivers granted do not reduce the overall Renewable Volume Obligation. President Trump directed the EPA to allow for the sale of E-15 year round but unfortunately this hasn’t come to fruition. This is particularly frustrating given the damaging impact that previously granted waivers have already had on RIN prices and renewable fuel demand. As Iowa corn farmers are anxiously awaiting their 2018 crop, a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) waiver would help grow demand and improve the markets. Since its creation, the RFS has helped us reduce our dependency on foreign oil, promoted cleaner air, created good-paying jobs, given consumers cheaper fuel, and spurred economic growth in our rural communities. Across Iowa, cooperatives and renewable fuel plants dot the landscape. We invite you to visit Iowa and look forward to working with you. Sincerely, David Young, Member of Congress Dave Loebsack, Member of Congress Charles E. Grassley, United States Senator Joni K. Ernst, United States Senator Steve King, Member of Congress Rod Blum, Member of Congress
07.17.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), the co-chairs of the Senate North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Observer Group announced the appointment of new members. The Senate NATO Observer Group was re-established by the senators earlier this year with the support of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Senate Majority Leader McConnell appointed Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Marco Rubio (R-FL). Senate Minority Leader Schumer appointed Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Coons (D-DE), Angus King (I-ME), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD). The Senate NATO Observer Group was first established in 1997 to serve as a connection between the Administration, NATO and the U.S. Senate. The Senate NATO Observer Group has been re-established since, in 2002, but was disbanded in 2007 due to a lack of NATO enlargement rounds. The Senate NATO Observer Group re-established by Senators Tillis and Shaheen in 2018 has an expanded mission to closely monitor and inform Senators outside of national security committees about defense spending commitments of Alliance members, the process of upgrading military capabilities, the Alliance’s counter-terrorism capability, NATO enlargement and the ability of NATO member states to address non-conventional warfare. “During a time when NATO members face increasing conventional and non-conventional threats from our adversaries, it is vital for all members to work towards strengthening our alliance and advancing our shared strategic objectives,” said Senator Tillis, co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group. “I’m excited to welcome the new members of the Senate NATO Observer Group, which demonstrates strong, bipartisan support for maintaining America’s commitment to NATO.” “NATO is where our transatlantic community’s security interests and values converge, and the Senate NATO Observer Group will help ensure the continuity of effort between the Senate, NATO headquarters and our Allies in an increasingly complex world,” said Senator Shaheen, co-chair of the Senate NATO Observer Group. “As our community of democracies continues to come under attack by those who wish to reshape the rules-based international order, often by force, this link will be critical to educating lawmakers and citizens alike on the importance of having Allies in difficult times. For this reason, I am pleased to welcome our new members, whose participation and dedication underscores the Senate’s – and the United States’ – commitment to NATO.” “NATO has been crucial to American security and prosperity for 70 years. At a time of renewed international threats, we must demonstrate clear, bipartisan support for the most successful alliance in history, said Senator Coons. “I am honored to join the NATO Observer group, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen the transatlantic alliance to meet the challenges of the 21st century.” “The NATO Observer Group is important during this critical time, as we continue to see evolving aggression against our NATO allies by America’s adversaries and to ensure NATO is able to push back against Russia’s grey zone operations,” said Senator Ernst. “I am honored to join this group and want to extend my thanks to Ambassador Hutchison and General Scaparrotti for their support.” “The alliance between the United States and NATO remains strong, but with emerging threats across the world it is important that we are working in unison to provide the necessary tools and resources to maintain a strong defense and alliance,” said Senator Gardner. “I appreciate the opportunity to serve in the NATO Observer group, and I fully support efforts to examine ways that we can further strengthen the most successful military alliance in history.” “After the President spent his week in Europe dividing our allies and embracing Putin, it is clear that the Senate must play a larger part in strengthening our relationships with NATO allies – and that is exactly what the Senate NATO Observer Group can do,” said Senator King. “The President has the Constitutional authority to conduct foreign policy, but Congress also has the responsibility to conduct oversight to ensure that our NATO commitments, and those of our allies, are being upheld – and given Russia’s recent history of using military force in attempts to change international borders, and more subtle tactics to undermine democratic political institutions, those international commitments to the continued strength of NATO are vital to America’s national security. The reestablishment of the Senate NATO Observer Group will help ensure that we are prepared to stand with our friends in the face of evolving threats to national security – particularly Russian efforts to sow discord in the alliance, threaten its neighbors, and interfere in democratic elections – and reaffirms America’s commitment to this critical alliance.” “The United States and our NATO partners continue to face new and emerging threats from our adversaries,” said Senator Rounds. “By re-establishing the NATO Observer Group, the Senate will be able to obtain timely information on the important decisions being made and the threats we face. I look forward to being a part of this group as we work to further strengthen our strong bond with our NATO allies, promote peace and combat global security concerns.” “I am proud to join the NATO Observer Group, especially at a time when Vladimir Putin is seeking to undermine the alliance by pitting member states against each other and influencing foreign elections in favor of anti-NATO candidates,” said Senator Rubio. “It is in America’s national security interest for NATO to be strong and unified. Vladimir Putin must know that his aggression in Ukraine and continued meddling in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, will not go unchecked.” “NATO was founded in the aftermath of the unspeakable horrors of World War II with a clear mission: an attack on any one country in the Alliance was an attack on all,” said Senator Van Hollen. Time and time again, we have banded together to fight for freedom, democracy and the rule of law – and in our darkest hour, after the September 11 attacks, our allies stood with us without hesitation or equivocation. In our current political climate, the need to affirm our commitment to NATO is more important than ever, and I’m proud to join this effort.”
07.16.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement, today, following President Donald Trump’s press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin: “I have the utmost faith in the U.S. intelligence community and their assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Russia has never been a friend to the U.S., and they continue to pose a threat to America and our allies. “We need to be cautious in how we approach our dealings with Russia. I hope that President Trump, today, delivered a strong message behind closed doors that Russia will continue to be punished for their illegal annexation of Ukraine in 2014, their abhorrent support for the murderous Bashar al-Assad regime in Syria and their aggressive actions in U.S. domestic policy. I am also hopeful President Trump discussed Russia’s role in the Balkans, as Iowa’s sister state, Kosovo, continues to be threatened by Russia’s hybrid warfare tactics in Serbia.”
07.13.2018	DES MOINES, IOWA – Senator Joni Ernst joined Senator Chuck Grassley and Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator Linda McMahon today for a women’s small business roundtable hosted by Governor Kim Reynolds. The event, which focused on how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has benefited small businesses was hosted at Saxton, Inc., a commercial interior design company in Des Moines. “Over the past year, we have taken significant steps to help our small businesses succeed. The repeal of burdensome regulations, coupled with tax reform, has helped fuel economic growth and has contributed to high levels of consumer and business confidence. But, we still have a lot of work to do: we need to continue to cut red tape for our job creators, make the tax cuts permanent, and work with Iowa’s small businesses on paid family leave,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Small businesses are the backbone of Iowa’s economy, making up 99 percent of businesses. Saxton, where the women’s small business roundtable was hosted, is owned and operated by President Kim Augspurger. Additional Background on Small Businesses and Iowa: Tax Reform: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a number of provisions to provide relief for small businesses, including lower individual tax rates and a new deduction on pass-through business income. Regulations: Senator Ernst introduced the Prove It Act to improve transparency and strengthen the voices of small businesses in the rulemaking process by giving the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy (the small business watchdog for federal rules and regulations) an opportunity to ask agencies to prove their regulatory analysis when proposing a rule that may be economically harmful to small businesses. Paid Family Leave: Senator Ernst is working on a proposal that would create a voluntary, budget-neutral paid leave program, an issue that is imperative to millions of mothers, fathers and families across the country. Access to Capital: Small banks are essential to small businesses. Despite only accounting for 14 percent of banking assets in the United States, banks of approximately $1 trillion or less provide 48 percent of small business lending. Unfortunately, the regulatory burden that Dodd-Frank placed on community banks and credit unions has stifled their lending. Senator Ernst supported the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which will help small business lending by easing regulations on small financial institutions.
07.11.2018	WASHINGTON – In U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s opening statement in a hearing today on the importance of paid family leave, Senator Ernst discussed how paid family leave benefits children and families and how she knows firsthand that being a working parent is never an easy task. She illustrated how difficult it can be for working moms and dads to raise newborns by sharing a story of an Iowa couple working day in and day out to provide for their growing family: “The issue of paid leave is incredibly important. Millions of mothers, fathers, grandparents and families across the country struggle with the realities of childbirth and infant care, while also working hard to put food on the table and raise strong and healthy families. It is long overdue that Congress not just have a conversation on these matters, but get serious about a path forward … “Jessica is the epitome of what it means to be an Iowan. She’s been working since she was sixteen and done everything from working at a call center, to waitressing … Money, at times, has been tight and both Jessica and her husband had to decide between working and meeting rent and taking time to care for their newborn … Jessica’s experience is a similar story in households across the country. As a nation, we can do better for our families. “As a conservative, I want to craft a paid leave policy that can not only attract consensus, but is viable for families, employers and the economy, recognizing that working parents by definition are an essential part of many businesses …We need to find a solution that doesn’t make our economy worse off or decrease the jobs available to working parents.” Senator Joni Ernst testified before the Senate Finance Committee Subcommittee on Social Security, Pensions and Family Policy. President Trump highlighted paid leave during his State of the Union address and his Administration was the first to budget for a national paid leave program. Ivanka Trump has been working closely with Congress on this issue to develop a dialogue and a path forward. For the past several months, Senator Ernst has been working with Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mike Lee (R-UT) on the issue of paid leave by exploring how new parents could elect to receive a paid leave benefit through Social Security. Her full testimony can be watched here or by clicking the image below.
07.09.2018	WASHINGTON – Following President Donald Trump’s nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement: “Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a highly-qualified, well-respected justice committed to the rule of law. He deserves a respectful and timely confirmation and I stand ready to offer advice and consent to Judge Kavanaugh as he moves through the confirmation process. “With Iowa’s Senior Senator, Chuck Grassley, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we have a phenomenal leader overseeing the process to make sure it is smooth and done in a timely manner. Senator Grassley moved Neil Gorsuch’s confirmation through the process superbly, allowing plenty of time for both parties to participate and we did have a successful confirmation. Judge Kavanaugh deserves the same quick, yet comprehensive, process and I believe Senator Grassley will ensure the Supreme Court vacancy is filled in a way that respects the rule of law, as well as the individual being put forth for confirmation. “I look forward to the next several months, where the Senate will have the opportunity to confirm Justice Kennedy’s successor, Judge Brett Kavanaugh.”
07.09.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst joined Margaret Brennan on “Face the Nation” to discuss how tariffs are affecting Iowa and her expectations for President Trump’s upcoming trips to Brussels and Helsinki. A highlight of the discussion includes: SEN. ERNST: America's farmers and ranchers are always the first to be retaliated against in these types of trade negotiations, and the tariffs that have been imposed and the retaliation stemming from that puts us in a very vulnerable position as our markets go down. So I would just encourage the president, of course we want great deals, and I know he'll be able to negotiate those, but we would like to see a number of these trade agreements wrapped up in short order. The sooner the better. MARGARET BRENNAN: Well- do you hear of any progress? I mean, it sounds like the president is only talking about escalation and- and are you asking the president to send any kind of financial aid to some of these farmers? SEN. ERNST: Well- no. And matter of fact, we push back on financial aid. Here in the Midwest we believe in trade not aid. We don't want another welfare-type program going to our farmers. They want to produce and they want to sell their goods to- to markets. So that's what we strive for. But I did speak with Ambassador Lighthizer, our U.S. trade rep, yesterday, and I did get encouraging news from him. I think there are a number of agreements that we're very close on. And he is working on a number of new free trade agreements. So I am encouraged - I would ask that we stay strong. But at some point we have to close the deal. And I- as I said, I would like to see the president do that sooner rather than later. To watch the full video click here, or the video above.

07.05.2018	WASHINGTON –Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) announcement that it will award 117 million dollars in federal funding to the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project. This funding comes more than 10 years after record-breaking flooding in the city caused approximately $5.4 billion in damages. “Over the past ten years, the City of Cedar Rapids has worked tirelessly to develop and advance this project which will protect its residents and businesses from future flooding events. Hundreds of millions of state and local dollars have already been committed, but what has been missing is this critical federal share of the project. “In addition to efforts by the city and state governments, for years, I have pushed the Corps to review its flawed benefit-cost ratio (BCR) metrics, which disadvantage projects in rural states, and find a way to fund projects like this. I am proud to see our combined efforts pay off today—this funding will not only protect the city, but also give businesses the certainty they need to confidently invest in the Cedar Rapids community.” Senator Ernst’s efforts to secure funding for Cedar Rapids: September 2016: Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Chuck Grassley send a letter to the USACE demanding answers on why flood mitigation projects in the Cedar Rapids region have not been completed. October 2016: Senators Grassley and Ernst send a letter to USACE seeking insight into a flawed policy that has led to the downgrading of flood control projects in Iowa cities. November 2016: Senator Ernst meets with head of USACE to discuss prioritization of Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project. February 2017: In Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) hearing, Senator Ernst pushes for improving metrics USACE uses to prioritize flood mitigation projects. March 2017: In EPW committee hearing, Senator Ernst questions Lt. General Todd T. Semonite, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of USACE, on the status of Cedar Rapids Flood mitigation project funding. May 2017: Senator Ernst highlights for Lt. General Semonite and EPW Committee the domestic and global economic impact of Cedar Rapids goods and their dependence on support from USACE. December 2017: Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, R.D. James, commits to reevaluating and improving the current BCR metrics in EPW hearing. January 2018: At EPW hearing, Senator Ernst again pushes for a commitment from Lt. General Semonite to work to modify the BCR metrics. January 2018: Senators Ernst, Grassley and Congressman Blum (IA-01) sit down with Director of Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney to find a path forward to ensure Iowa receives long overdue federal resources. February 2018: Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and Congressman Blum send a letter to Lt. General Semonite and Secretary James requesting further information on how the USACE makes certain project funding decisions. March 2018: Senator Ernst follows up with Secretary James on letter she sent regarding the status of Cedar Rapids flood project funding. May 2018: America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 passed out of the EPW Committee and included an Ernst provision addressing the flawed BCR metrics and calling for prioritization of the Cedar Rapids flood control project.
07.03.2018	WASHINGTON – In letters today to Postmaster General Megan Brennan and the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) requested issuance of a Forever Stamp to honor the service and sacrifice of Gold Star Families. Ernst and Blumenthal introduced bipartisan legislation in 2016 and 2017 to establish the stamp. U.S. Representative Elizabeth Esty (D-CT) introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. Although Congress may approve the issuance of specific stamps, the Postmaster General also has the authority to issue a stamp. “For more than 80 years, Gold Star Families have personified the very essence of grit, resolve, and perseverance, while working tirelessly to improve the lives of others who share their unique sacrifice. Permanently honoring Gold Star Families with a Forever Stamp would have widespread national appeal and significance, reaching Americans beyond the population personified by such a stamp,” Ernst and Blumenthal wrote to the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed into law legislation establishing the first Gold Star Mothers stamp. The original Gold Star Mothers stamp became available on September 21, 1948. The first sheet of stamps was presented to Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan of Waterloo, Iowa, who lost five sons when an enemy torpedo sank the USS Juneau on November 13, 1942. Because the Gold Star Mothers stamp was designated as a special series commemorative stamp, rather than a permanent stamp, it was eventually discontinued. This is the only time that a special series commemorative stamp was issued pursuant to legislation. Full text of the letters is copied below. A link to the letter to Postmaster General Megan Brennan can be found here. Link to the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee can be found here. July 3, 2018 The Honorable Megan Brennan Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer United States Postal Service 475 L’Enfant Plaza, SW Washington, DC 20590 Dear Postmaster General Megan Brennan: As you consider recommendations from the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee for new Forever Stamps in 2021 and beyond, we request that the United States Postal Service (USPS) use its authority to issue a Forever Stamp to honor Gold Star Families. As Postmaster General, you have the unique opportunity to pay tribute to the families of fallen servicemembers in your selection of the appropriate subject to honor with the issuance of a Forever Stamp. We ask that you use this authority to issue a Forever Stamp to recognize to Gold Star Families. Enclosed please find our letter to the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, which details our request. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to working together to memorialize the extraordinary service and sacrifice of our Gold Star Families. Sincerely, July 3, 2018 Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee 475 L’Enfant Plaza SW, Room 3300 Washington, DC 20260-3501 Dear Members of the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee: As you consider recommendations for new Forever Stamps in 2021 and beyond, we request that the United States Postal Service (USPS) use its authority to issue a Forever Stamp to honor the service and sacrifice of Gold Star Families. Specifically, we ask that the Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee pay tribute to the families of fallen servicemembers by prioritizing a Forever Stamp for Gold Star Families in your recommendations to the Postmaster General. We understand that your Committee adheres to twelve criteria to determine the eligibility of subjects for commemoration on all U.S. stamps and stationary. Gold Star Families are exemplary candidates for this special recognition. For more than 80 years, Gold Star Families have personified the very essence of grit, resolve, and perseverance, while working tirelessly to improve the lives of others who share their unique sacrifice. Permanently honoring Gold Star Families with a Forever Stamp would have widespread national appeal and significance, reaching Americans beyond the population personified by such a stamp. There are few Americans more worthy of recognition than the men and women in uniform who died defending our country and the family members who honor their legacy. After nearly two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 7,000 Americans have perished in combat. A Gold Star Families Forever Stamp would serve as a constant reminder of the brave men and women who fought throughout history to keep our country safe, and pay tribute to military families. There is precedent for approving such a stamp. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed legislation into law to establish the first Gold Star Mothers stamp to commemorate those who lost loved ones during World War II. Unfortunately, this stamp was designated as a special series commemorative stamp, rather than a permanent stamp, and was eventually discontinued. Honoring Gold Star Families should not come with an expiration date. Although USPS has not yet re-issued a similar stamp, there is no better time to recognize the families who have tragically lost a loved one in combat. A forever stamp for Gold Star Families is a simple, straightforward cause that is worthy of USPS recognition. Thank you for your consideration on this matter. We look forward to working with you to ensure the legacy of Gold Star Families will be honored in years to come. Sincerely,
06.29.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a town meeting in Page County as part of her 99 county tour to hear from constituents in the area about the issues most important to them. This town meeting is open to the public. Friday, July 6, 2018 Page County Town Meeting 11:00 AM CT Shenandoah High School Auditorium 1000 Mustang Drive Shenandoah, IA At the end of the event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with press.

06.28.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators and combat veterans Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), along with U.S. Representatives Diane Black (R-TN) and Steve Cohen (D-TN), today introduced bipartisan legislation to award the U.S. Army Ranger Veterans of World War II with the Congressional Gold Medal. “Each time I greet veterans visiting the World War II Memorial as part of an honor flight, I am reminded that the greatest generation is getting smaller every day. We cannot let another year go by without recognizing the sacrifices and heroic actions of these brave Army Rangers. While we can never say thank you enough for the impact and influence of the World War II Army Rangers, awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to these veterans is a small token of appreciation from a grateful nation,” said Senator Ernst. “U.S. Army Rangers bravely wore the uniform of this great nation and participated in some of the most important battles of World War II,” Senator Duckworth said. “The impact and influence of these elite soldiers and the sacrifices they made to protect their fellow Americans cannot be overstated, and I’m proud to join Senator Ernst and Representatives Black and Cohen in pushing for these veterans to be awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.” "I am proud to honor the brave volunteers of the Ranger Battalions who fought in some of the most important battles of World War II and trained at our own Camp Forrest in Tennessee. The service and sacrifices of America’s greatest generation helped make our nation the safest and most prosperous nation in the world. The Rangers played an integral role in seizing key terrain ahead of our allied forces and greatly contributed to America's success; they are heroes and their stories inspire us. We must do all we can to honor and thank them for their service," said Representative Black. “I’m proud to sponsor the U.S. Army Rangers Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act and to pay tribute to the service of the battalions of Ranger light infantry commandos, many trained in Tennessee, that helped liberate North Africa, Europe and the Philippines in some of the bloodiest battles of the war. As the World War II generation grows smaller each day, it is right to acknowledge its sacrifices and give those remaining the thanks of a grateful nation,” said Representative Cohen. Read the full text of the bill here. Background on U.S. Army Rangers in World War II: In World War II, the U.S. Army formed six all-volunteer Ranger Battalions and one provisional battalion. The initial concept of Ranger units drew both from the British method of using highly trained “Commando” units and the American military tradition of light infantry for scouting and raiding operations that went back to the 1700s. These brave soldiers participated in some of the most important battles of World War II. Army Rangers served in some of the most important battles throughout World War II, including at the D-Day landing, the Sicily campaign and in the Philippines, where they liberated more than 500 prisoners of war from a Japanese prisoner of war camp.
06.28.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, applauded today’s final passage of the 2018 Farm Bill in the United States Senate. The bipartisan legislation includes many of Senator Ernst’s priorities to bring certainty and predictability to Iowa’s farmers and ranchers, and ensure the needs of rural communities are met. “Farmers, ranchers and rural communities are the people that Americans rely on, day in and day out, to put food on our tables, clothes on our backs and fuel in our cars. And, in trying times, it is essential that we provide farmers and ranchers with the certainty and predictability they need and deserve.” “Low commodity prices, trade tensions and unpredictable weather have taken a toll on many folks back home. Several pieces of my legislation, including reforms to conservation and commodity programs, were incorporated in the Farm Bill. Additionally, I was glad to see my bipartisan measure to increase support and access to mental health resources for farmers and ranchers was included in the Farm Bill. I look forward to working with members of the House of Representatives to send a strong, bipartisan Farm Bill across the finish line and to the President’s desk in short order.” Several Ernst measures were included in the 2018 Farm Bill, including her: Bipartisan legislation with Senator Heitkamp (D-ND) to strengthen and improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Level program; Bipartisan Give Our Resources the Opportunity to Work (GROW) Act of 2018, introduced with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Bob Casey (D-PA) to revise and strengthen the current provisions of CRP, the Conservation Stewardship Program and Environmental Quality Incentives Program; Bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act, introduced with Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), which will strengthen the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and incentivize rural and urban partnerships for conservation; and the Bipartisan Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act, introduced with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), to provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources. Proposal for a pilot program that would encourage Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients to purchase more milk to improve participants diets, especially lower-income families with children. Members of the U.S. House and Senate will now negotiate their approved versions of the 2018 Farm Bill in Conference Committee.
06.26.2018	“With flooding across our state, Governor Reynolds and local first responders are working hard to get communities resources they need. I share Governor Reynolds commitment to Iowans affected by flooding and encourage people to follow the advice of local first responders,” Senator Joni Ernst.

To do that: Monitor newspaper, radio and TV reports of current and predicted weather conditions; Keep a NOAA Weather radio turned on and charged up to get alerts around the clock; Set mobile devices to alert with the latest weather information. Make it easy by downloading and using a free FEMA app, which provides real-time weather alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations anywhere in Iowa or the nation. The app also provides valuable safety tips to help families prepare for, and recover from, more than 20 natural and man-made hazards, including how to make a family communication plans, a customizable checklist of emergency supplies and maps of open shelters and disaster recovery centers. Plan for the Worst: Severe weather can strike suddenly so have a plan to stay safe and take life-saving action if needed. The plan should include: Actions to take if it’s necessary to shelter-in-place; Where each person/pet will go to get out of danger; How each person/pet will get to a place of safety; How family and friends will communicate with one another if evacuation to or from different locations becomes necessary. For more information on creating an emergency plan, visit www.Ready.gov or www.beready.iowa.gov. Be Ready: Gather essential items in one place if evacuation is needed. Those should include: Wallets, purses, car/house keys, eyeglasses, cash, credit cards; Medicine and basic first-aid supplies; Daily living supplies for infants/young children, family members who are elderly or have access and functional needs, and pets; Important information such as numbers for bank accounts, insurance policies (health, auto and property) and credit cards; Important phone numbers of relatives, employers, schools and medical professionals such as pharmacies, physicians and veterinarians; Chargers for mobile devices; One or more changes of clothes. Include long pants, socks, boots and/or sturdy shoes; Bottled water and high-protein, non-perishable food such as a peanut butter, tuna and nuts. Talk through the emergency plan with all family members so that everyone knows what to do. If there is time, consider making a more complete emergency supply kit for homes and cars. To learn how, visit www.Ready.gov or www.beready.iowa.gov. Know What to Do: Understand severe weather terms and know what to do for each. Watch means a specific type of threat (flooding, tornadoes) could be forming; Warning means take action. Life/property threatening conditions are occurring or imminent. Heed emergency instructions. If told to evacuate, go immediately! Move immediately to higher ground if flash flooding is possible. Don’t wait to be told. DO NOT DRIVE THROUGH FLOOD WATER, even if you know the road. Turn around, don’t drown! Abandon mobile homes. They offer little to no protection, even if tied down. Don’t touch downed power lines or objects in contact with downed lines. Report electrical hazards, downed lines and gas leaks to the police and utility companies. Don’t re-enter damaged structures without first checking to see if they are safe.
06.26.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement in regard to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for conventional, advanced and cellulosic biofuels for 2019, and the biodiesel target for 2020 that was announced today: “As the state that leads the nation in renewable fuels production, Iowa farmers deserve honesty and transparency from the EPA on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The proposed uptick in the amount of renewable fuel that refiners blend into transportation fuel is encouraging, but does not make up for about 1.5 billion gallons lost by Administrator Pruitt’s decision to hand out an unprecedented number of small refinery waivers.” Background: The EPA proposed 2019 volume requirements for conventional, advanced and cellulosic biofuels, as well as the 2020 requirement for biomass-based diesel, on June 26, 2018, with the final rule expected in November 2018. The proposal comes the same day that a Reuters article reported, “[EPA] has consistently ignored recommendations from the Department of Energy to reject or limit waivers to oil refiners seeking exemptions from the nation’s biofuels law,” and that “Under EPA chief Scott Pruitt, an appointee of President Donald Trump, the agency has issued more than two dozen such exemptions in recent months.” The proposed requirements released by the EPA include: 2019 2020 Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) 381 n/a Biomass-based diesel (BBD) (billion gallons) 2.1 2.43 Advanced biofuel (billion gallons) 4.88 n/a Renewable fuel (billion gallons) 19.88 n/a
06.26.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst joined U.S. Congressman David Young and the Iowa congressional delegation in sending a letter to President Donald Trump expressing their continued concerns that retaliatory tariffs will harm Iowa's farmers. The letter asked the President to act expeditiously to save Iowa's rural economy. “Mr. President, these tariffs have real consequences on states like Iowa, rural communities across the nation and on America’s farms. We encourage you to act expeditiously to save our rural economies,” the delegation said. In March, the Iowa congressional delegation told the President that agriculture is the first industry that will be hurt in any trade dispute. Markets for soybeans, corn and pork are trading significantly lower than before the President started imposing tariffs. Read the full text below. A digital copy is available HERE. Dear President Trump: As members of Congress representing the great State of Iowa, we wrote in March warning of retaliatory measures targeting our agriculture exports. We remain concerned about the impacts of these retaliatory tariffs from our major trading partners on Iowa agriculture products coming to fruition. We strongly urge you to quickly resolve our trade differences and avoid a trade war. Farmers are currently experiencing a five year, 52 percent downturn in our agricultural economy and these tariffs are taxes Iowa families cannot afford. Soybean futures are currently trading at their lowest in nine years and are down under nine dollars a bushel. Corn prices have fallen sharply since the start of June and are down over four percent from last year. Pork futures are down as much as 18 dollars per animal on an annualized basis. Farmers are facing tight margins and low commodity prices, which makes the latest tariffs catastrophic for Iowa’s economy. Iowa ranks second in the nation for agricultural exports. Iowa is first in the nation in pork ($2.0 billion), corn ($1.75 billion), feed grain ($1.32 billion) and second in soybean exports ($3.11 billion). Canada, Mexico, and China are top destinations for Iowa pork, soybeans, corn, and beef. China is one of the world’s fastest-growing beef import markets and recently began buying American beef again last year. In the first six months after the ban was lifted, China purchased $31 million of U.S. beef and USDA estimates over 1 million tons will be sent to China in 2018. The U.S. exported $24.1 billion worth of agricultural products to China in 2017. Mr. President, these tariffs have real consequences on states like Iowa, rural communities across the nation, and on America’s farms. We encourage you to act expeditiously to save our rural economies. Sincerely,
06.21.2018	Military Lawyers Are Not Trained In Immigration Law; DoD Decision Would Exacerbate Shortage of Military Justice-Trained JAGs Senators: Pulling 21 Trial Counsel From Military Courtrooms To Prosecute Immigration Cases Is An Inappropriate Misapplication Of Military Personnel WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Kirsten Gillibrand, Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Vice Chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations, and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) today wrote to Secretary of Defense James Mattis urging him to reverse his recent decision to send military Judge Advocates (JAGs) to the Southern border to prosecute immigration cases. The Defense Department’s actions would leave active duty posts empty and would involve calling up reservists for this mission despite the DoD’s own recent admission that JAG Corps caseloads are full. When asked about an extension of Special Victims’ Counsels to support survivors of domestic violence and child abuse earlier this year, the Department of Defense stated that expanding the duties of the JAG Corps without adding more personnel would risk “a significant reduction in the quality of services currently provided.” Despite this response, the Defense Department is now sending twenty-one JAGs to the border. “We are…deeply troubled by the Department’s decision to send twenty-one active and reserve JAGs to the border on temporary orders to prosecute immigration cases,” the Senators wrote. “Clearly, the military needs more, not fewer, lawyers available for its critical military justice practice. Instead, we have now learned the services will be diverting these valuable resources to support a non-military mission. Pulling twenty-one trial counsel from military courtrooms to prosecute immigration cases is an inappropriate misapplication of military personnel. We urge you to maintain these resources within the military justice system.” The new Defense Department action would divert military resources and legal personnel away from the already heavily burdened military justice system. The DoD did not make it clear what would happen to the caseloads of the active duty JAGs who are being assigned to this new role. JAGs are not trained in the highly complex and nuanced field of immigration law, and the Defense Department also did not make clear the scope of any new training provided to the military before sending them to the border. The full text of the Senators’ letter is available here and below: The Honorable James Mattis Secretary of Defense 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-1000 Dear Secretary Mattis, We are writing regarding the Department of Defense’s decision to provide uniformed Judge Advocates (JAGs) to support Department of Justice prosecutions unrelated to our military’s missions. For years, Congress has worked with the Department on reforming the military justice system and providing the services with the resources to support the critical mission of promoting justice and maintaining good order and discipline within the armed forces. We are, therefore, deeply troubled by the Department’s decision to send twenty-one active and reserve JAGs to the border on temporary orders to prosecute immigration cases. Over the past several years, Congress has enacted legislation that will allow the DoD to maintain a pool of trained and experienced military litigators for its most serious criminal cases. Those who have trial experience are desperately needed to serve as prosecutors, special victims counsel and defense counsel. In fact, just last month, the Department made clear that while it realized the benefits of expanding the services of special victims counsel to those who experience domestic violence or child abuse, “this effort would require additional resourcing and end strength and risks a significant reduction in the quality of services currently provided.” Clearly, the military needs more, not fewer, lawyers available for its critical military justice practice. Instead, we have now learned the services will be diverting these valuable resources to support a non-military mission. While JAGs currently serve as Special Assistant United States Attorneys throughout the country, this occurs in districts with military installations and involves working on cases with a clear military nexus such as theft from a commissary or civilian DUIs on a military base. However, unlike those situations, these twenty-one JAGs are being directed to practice wholly outside of their training, within the vast and complex immigration arena. Pulling twenty-one trial counsel from military courtrooms to prosecute immigration cases is an inappropriate misapplication of military personnel. We urge you to maintain these resources within the military justice system. Sincerely,
06.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Iowa’s U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley met with U.S. Ambassador to China and former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad yesterday in Washington, D.C. The discussion included issues such as the relationship between the United States and China, security in East Asia and ongoing developments regarding North Korea. One topic of concern was trade between the United States and China, and the impact tariffs will have on Iowa agriculture. Another focus of the meeting was production of the deadly drug fentanyl in China and its increasing consumption in America as the country faces a growing opioid, heroin and fentanyl epidemic. “Ambassador Branstad has done a wonderful job representing our country in China, particularly as it relates to the agricultural and trade issues that so strongly affect Iowans,” Ernst said. “I was also pleased to get his input on the situation with North Korea, and the work our government is doing in the region to combat the production of the deadly and highly addictive drug fentanyl that devastates the lives of so many in the U.S. I thank Ambassador Branstad for his time to update Senator Grassley and me on his efforts, and look forward to continue working with him to ensure Iowans’ and Americans’ interests are protected.” “It’s always a pleasure to meet with my longtime friend and colleague Ambassador Branstad. He brings a steady hand and commonsense leadership to the complicated issues that face U.S. agriculture and so many other priorities,” Grassley said. “His efforts benefit Iowa and the nation and I look forward to continuing to work with him as we confront challenges in the East Asia region.” Ernst's tweet about the meeting is available here. Grassley’s Instagram post is available here and his tweet is available here.
06.20.2018	WASHINGTON – During a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) said that EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt has made “questionable decisions” and continues to renege on his commitment to uphold the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). In light of the fact that “EPA has also been under intense scrutiny due to some of the questionable decisions that have been made at the Agency,” Senator Ernst pushed for a commitment from the two EPA nominees appearing before the committee to uphold commitments they make to Congress, both during their confirmation hearings, as well as in subsequent communications with elected officials. “Unfortunately, there have been instances where I’ve been made promises by the EPA, even in writing, only to have them reneged upon. I’m told one thing, and then find out in a press report that the EPA is doing exactly what they told me they wouldn’t do,” said Senator Ernst. Pruitt had previously stated that he would not consider attaching Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to exported ethanol, only to later express a willingness to pursue the idea if packaged with a rule allowing the year-round sale of E15. During the hearing, Senator Ernst stressed that she values integrity and secured commitments from EPA nominees William Charles McIntosh and Peter C. Wright to cooperate with Congress, uphold ethical standards, and understand the courses of action they can take if they witness impropriety at the Agency. “Excessive and unnecessary spending, unacceptable uses of agency resources, the list goes on and on. It is important to understand what the courses of action are if you do witness additional impropriety,” said Senator Ernst. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of the nominees here or by clicking on the image below.
06.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Following China’s decision to impose 25 percent tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the United States’ announcement levying tariffs on Chinese imports worth $50 billion, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on the escalating trade dispute: “Farmers need trade, not aid. These tariffs are nothing more than a tax on Iowa farm families and the escalating trade war is putting the livelihoods of our rural communities in the crosshairs. “With farmers facing increased financial pressure from low commodity prices and high production costs, it’s becoming harder and harder for producers to turn a profit. These aggressive trade actions will continue to have damaging consequences, including an impact on our commodity prices and farm futures, and increasing anxiety among the agricultural and business communities in Iowa. “With China vowing to retaliate, farmers, ranchers and rural communities stand to lose the most. And, while I recognize and support President Trump’s desire to hold China accountable – this should not be done at the expense of rural America. “China is already investing more in other countries to supply their growing demand for agricultural products. We should focus on access to new markets and completing new trade deals, to provide farmers certainty. We should also focus on reducing the trade deficit, rather than imposing tariffs that have already proven dangerous to our exports.” Background: On Monday, June 18, the administration moved to identify $200 billion in additional imported goods from China to be penalized with 10 percent tariffs. This follows the announcement on June 15, 2018, by the Chinese Commerce Ministry that it will respond to $50 billion of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports by targeting U.S. exports with its own retaliatory tariffs starting on July 6, 2018. The $50 billion in Section 301 tariffs announced by the Administration only complicate the U.S.-China trade relationship and further put U.S. producers at risk of permanently losing market access to China. Chinese tariffs target U.S. agricultural exports, including soybeans, corn, poultry, beef and pork. On the day the $50 billion tariffs were announced, the top article on the front page of The Des Moines Register, “China tariffs on U.S. soybeans could cost Iowa farmers up to $624 million” read: U.S. and Iowa agriculture is caught in the crossfire, with farmers selling $14 billion in soybeans to China last year, its top export market . . . China already has smacked farmers with an additional 25 percent tariff on pork, and Mexico plans a 20 percent tariff on ham and pork shoulders. Those moves could cost Iowa pork producers $360 million over the year, an ISU economist estimates, less than initially calculated, thanks to some pork price recovery. For additional information on Senator Ernst’s continued efforts to caution the administration on the negative effects of tariffs on Iowa’s agricultural economy and our country’s national security, please see here.
06.19.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Angus King (I-ME) introduced bipartisan legislation, the Properly Reducing Overexemptions for Sports (PRO Sports) Act, to strip multi-million dollar professional sports leagues of their tax-exempt status, saving roughly $100 million in taxpayer dollars over 10 years. “Professional sports leagues – which are raking in millions of dollars from television rights and membership dues – shouldn’t also be scoring a hole-in-one with their taxes,” said Senator Ernst. “The PRO Sports Act amends the tax code to revoke this unnecessary exemption, saving approximately $100 million in taxpayer dollars over 10 years. Senator King and I are cutting this wasteful spending and protecting taxpayer dollars.” The PRO Sports Act would revoke the 501(c)(6), tax-exempt status of professional sports leagues with over $10 million in gross receipts. While some leagues have voluntarily ended their tax-exempt status in recent years, others continue to use this loophole while bringing in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. “Sports leagues like the NHL and the PGA Tour provide entertainment for millions of Americans, but that doesn’t mean these league-specific brands should be able to utilize Section 501(c)(6) of the tax code to be tax exempt,” said Senator King. “This bill would help close loopholes that allow leagues to boost their profits at the expense of taxpayers – it’s just common sense.” Read the full text of the bill here.
06.19.2018	WASHINGTON – After the Senate passed the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, released the following statement: “It’s our job to provide our men and women in uniform with the support, protection and preparation they need to effectively defend our nation. Each year, through the bipartisan NDAA, we work to address the needs of our servicemembers, as well as bolster our nation’s security against evolving threats posed by our adversaries around the globe. I am glad to see several of my priorities included in this year’s bill to help members of our military best protect themselves and our country.” The final FY19 NDAA package secured 30 of Iowa Senator Ernst’s provisions to strengthen our nation’s security and support our military, including: Bipartisan legislation with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to track, treat and prevent traumatic brain injury among servicemembers; Additional research funding for physiological episodes plaguing our Air Force airmen and Naval aviators, along with a provision that provides for an additional $31 million in funding; Support for the continued assistance to Iowa’s sister-state, the Republic of Kosovo, and the Kosovo Security Force’s gradual transition to a multiethnic army; Full funding for our missile defense and anti-tunneling coordination with Israel; A provision to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) artificial intelligence initiatives and research and development (R&D) are better coordinated with academic research and industry; A pay raise for troops, and a limit on the president’s ability to deny troops their mandated pay raise; Increased reporting to counter Russia’s information and intelligence operations in Serbia; A provision encouraging DoD to invest in R&D and procurement of wearable and mobile solar power capabilities; Encouragement for the Defense Department to take steps to maintain secure, domestic sources of high purity aluminum; A provision to direct the creation of a U.S. Army Advanced Manufacturing of Excellence in partnership with an arsenal; Efforts to recognize the importance of DoD contracts with military paint training programs that use advanced technology in preparation and training; Direction that the Secretary of Defense should establish a Defense Institute on Human Factors Modeling and Simulation to maximize the effectiveness of the warfighter in each service branch; An increased focus on producing domestic explosives for the U.S. military, and a need to stockpile explosives that must be purchased from foreign sources; and Protection of the rank of Chief Military Chaplains across each service branch.
06.13.2018	WASHINGTON – On the ten year anniversary of the historic Cedar Rapids flood, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) recognized how the community came together to help rebuild, and called on the federal government to better collaborate and reform metrics to ensure that rural areas have the same access to federal funding as coastal areas. “Ten years ago, the Cedar Rapids community was devastated by flooding. Folks were forced to evacuate, leaving their homes and their businesses under water. The loss to the Cedar Rapids community was $5.4 billion dollars. “What we saw after the flood embodied the people of Iowa. We saw resilience, kindness and generosity. The community came together to rebuild and help others in need. Now, it is time for the federal government to do their part to help the Cedar Rapids community, with funding so Cedar Rapids can protect itself from future floods. Federal agencies should also better collaborate to reform the flawed benefit-cost ratio (BCR) so that rural communities have the same access to funding as coastal areas. The value of life is the same, whether it’s in California or Iowa.” said Senator Joni Ernst. Senator Ernst’s leadership efforts to help the Cedar Rapids Community: September 2016: Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) demanding answers on why flood mitigation projects in the Cedar Rapids region have not been completed. October 2016: Senators Grassley and Ernst send letter to USACE seeking insight into flawed policy that has led to the downgrading of flood control projects in Iowa cities. November 2016: Senator Ernst meets with head of USACE to discuss prioritization of Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project. February 2017: In Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) Hearing, Senator Ernst pushes for improving metrics USACE uses to prioritize flood mitigation projects. March 2017: In EPW committee hearing, Senator Ernst questions Lt. General Todd T. Semonite, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of USACE, on the status of Cedar Rapids Flood Mitigation Project funding. May 2017: Senator Ernst highlights for Lt. General Semonite and EPW committee the domestic and global economic impact of Cedar Rapids goods and their dependence on support from USACE. December 2017: Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, R.D. James, commits to reevaluating and improving the current BCR in EPW hearing. January 2018: At EPW hearing, Senator Ernst again pushed for a commitment from Lt. General Semonite to work to modify the BCR metrics. January 2018: Senators Ernst, Grassley and Congressman Blum (IA-01) sit down with Director of Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney to find a path forward to ensure Iowa receives long overdue federal assistance. February 2018: Senator Ernst, Senator Grassley, and Congressman Blum sent a letter to Lieutenant General Semonite and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James requesting further information on how the Army Corps makes certain project funding decisions. March 2018: Senator Ernst follows up with R.D. James on letter she sent regarding the status of Cedar Rapids flood project funding. May 2018: America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 was passed by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and included Ernst provisions addressing the flawed BCR metrics and calling for prioritization of the Cedar Rapids flood control project.
06.13.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), released the following statement after the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry approved the 2018 Farm Bill. “Timely passage of the Farm Bill is critical to providing certainty and predictability to Iowa’s farmers and ranchers,” said Senator Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy. “Our farmers and ranchers feed and fuel the world, and the input I have received from folks across the state was invaluable in crafting this bill. I’m glad that several pieces of my legislation, including reforms to conservation and commodity programs, were incorporated in the Farm Bill that address the concerns of farmers and strengthen key programs on behalf of our farmers.” Several Ernst measures were included in the 2018 Farm Bill, including her: Bipartisan legislation with Senator Heitkamp (D-ND) to strengthen and improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Level program; Bipartisan Give Our Resources the Opportunity to Work (GROW) Act of 2018, introduced with Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Bob Casey (D-PA) to revise and strengthen the current provisions of CRP, the Conservation Stewardship Program and Environmental Quality Incentives Program; Bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act, introduced with Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), which will strengthen the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and incentivize rural and urban partnerships for conservation; and the Bipartisan Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act, introduced with Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), to provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources.
06.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, delivered remarks from the Senate floor urging her colleagues to support the inclusion of her bipartisan Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, legislation to reform the outdated system that provides former U.S. Presidents with post-presidency benefits, in the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks here or by clicking on the image below. Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks as delivered: “Madame President, “I came down to the floor to make amendment #2400 pending. But it is my understanding that we’re almost at an agreement on the hotline. “This bill has cleared committee by voice vote and my colleagues on the Republican side for the hotline. However, my minority counterparts have had months to look at this bill, but it remains held up on the hotline. “The bill passed the House with unanimous support and has been included in the House NDAA bill. “I’m calling on my colleagues across the aisle to clear this bill, or else I will fight for a vote on it in the NDAA. “My legislation, the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, would establish a cap on former presidents' monetary allowances, which are currently unlimited and fund resources like office space, staff salaries, cell phone bills and more. “It would then reduce the allowance dollar-for-dollar by each dollar of income a former president earns in excess of $400,000. “The national debt is over $20 trillion – we cannot afford to generously subsidize the perks of former presidents to the tune of millions of dollars. “The reality is that post-presidential life already provides fruitful opportunities on its own, with former presidents raking in tens of millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements and more. “Again, I’m calling on my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill, which would save taxpayer dollars that can used for more worthwhile causes, like our military. “And I thank the Senior Senator from Missouri for cosponsoring this legislation and making it a bipartisan bill. “Thank you Madame President.” Senator Ernst first introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Presidential Allowance Modernization Act on May 21, 2015. After passing both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with unanimous support, it was ultimately vetoed by President Obama. Senator Ernst reintroduced the legislation in September 2017.
06.06.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) attended the presidential signing of the VA MISSION Act, bipartisan legislation that improves veterans’ access to health care services. The Senator, a combat veteran, released the following statement applauding the new law, which includes her bipartisan legislation with Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI), the Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act: “Today, we reached an important milestone in providing our veterans with the quality of care they earned and deserve. Those who have selflessly defended our nation will now have greater access to hospital care, life-saving medical services and extended care services, right in their own community. I am also extremely proud to see my bipartisan VETS Act become law, which will now allow our rural or homebound veterans in Iowa, and across the U.S., to receive necessary care, including critical mental health care, from the comfort of their homes. As a veteran, and a proud American, I applaud this successful effort to ensure our veterans are receiving the care they have earned.” Watch Senator Ernst’s remarks from the Senate floor last month in support of the VA MISSION Act here.
06.06.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered an opening statement at the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and Data Security hearing entitled “Preventing Abuse in Olympic and Amateur Athletics: Ensuring a Safe and Secure Environment for our Athletes.” Senators Ernst and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) have called for a special Senate committee to investigate the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics regarding how a team doctor, Larry Nassar, was able to sexually abuse gymnasts for decades. Click here or on the image below to watch. The full transcript of the senator’s remarks can be found below. “Thank you very much Chairman Moran, Ranking Member Blumenthal, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you, truly, for giving us the opportunity to testify today. “I want to thank Senator Shaheen, for joining me to discuss the importance of ensuring a safe environment for our athletes. “Like many Americans, I was horrified to hear of the crimes committed by Larry Nassar, the USA Gymnastics doctor who abused hundreds of young athletes. “The actions of this man, and the individuals and institutions that facilitated and protected his behavior, are reprehensible. They also point to wider cultural issues within the amateur athletic community. “It was a failure at all levels, and symptomatic of broader problems facing our society on sexual assault, rape, harassment and abuse. “These types of failures are the reason I have worked with my colleagues in Congress on reforms to ensure sexual misconduct across society is reported, responded to and taken seriously, and ideally, prevented. “You see, I was previously a volunteer counselor at a crisis center that provided shelter and support to survivors of abuse and sexual assault. “I heard stories of women fleeing domestic abusers, suffering not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually. “I also took calls on our hotline from people that had been raped and sexually abused. “Abuse like this is not something you can just simply forget – it stays with you, and these survivors’ lives have been forever altered. “It is through this lens that I come to the issue before us today. I want to focus on three key points that Congress should consider when investigating this tragedy: “First, we must take survivors’ stories seriously and ensure they are heard. “Like you, Senator Shaheen and I have heard the terrible accounts from victims of Dr. Nassar. “One of the most horrific parts of their stories is that when these athletes reported the abuse to those they trusted –people within their university, their gymnastics club, Olympic leadership or people that their parents paid to grow them into strong and healthy athletes – they were shut down, they were ignored, and told there was nothing to see here. “One athlete upon reporting her abuse was told that, quote: she was fortunate to receive the best medical care possible from a world-renowned doctor, end quote. “Another reported that she was told she, quote: must be misunderstanding what was going on, end quote. “Officials even created false excuses to cover up Nassar’s absence for his shameful behavior. “This breaks my heart and angers me, as these men and women, and often times, children, carried this burden for so many years with no help from those they trusted. “Even more maddening is that these organizations rake in millions of dollars a year and enjoy tax-exempt status. “Second, we have to examine the underlying factors that allowed this abuse to occur. “Answering questions like who knew what? What disincentives existed within the Olympic community that caused people to choose inaction when bad things happened? “There were some half-hearted attempts to institute accountability once the Olympic house started to crumble – but this was too late and the damage was done. “Where I’m from, when people see something going wrong, they say something. We don’t pass the buck and we don’t “wait and see.” We listen, we act and we help one another. “There are people within the Olympic community that felt it was not their responsibility to report abuse, or claim that liability prevented them from acting. “Ethics, morals, and a sense of human dignity demand for people to do better. “Instead, abusers were given more responsibility, more money, more prestige, more autonomy and more cover. “Let’s be clear – this problem is not limited to Larry Nassar. There has developed a culture in the Olympics, which prioritizes winning medals over the health and welfare of the athletes. “USOC recognized this in their open letter in January where they stated that “we must change the culture of the sport.” “Third, we must take decisive action to address deficiencies in the system. “Today’s hearing will give witnesses an opportunity to explain themselves and hopefully get some honest answers. “When Senator Shaheen and I called on USOC CEO Scott Blackmun to resign, we viewed that as the beginning of a long sentence on holding Olympic leadership accountable. “I am concerned, that despite the stated intention to change the culture of Olympic sport, too much of the old culture persists. “The Committee has done much work to address these issues, including the Safe Sport Authorization Act, which I cosponsored. I think the law sets a good framework that will be beneficial to our athletes and provide guardrails to protect them. “Additionally, Senator Shaheen and I introduced legislation in January calling for a special committee to investigate these matters. “In conclusion, these athletes represent our great nation on the world stage. They are called to embody American ideals of sportsmanship, hard work and integrity. “This negative underbelly of Olympic sport jeopardizes these ideals and makes a mockery of the hard work athletes put in to succeed. “Many children grow up admiring Olympic athletes, dreaming that one day they, too, could be on the winner’s podium to accept a gold medal for their country. “I want that dream to live on for generations to come, but there is much work to be done first. “Thank you Chairman, Ranking Member, I appreciate the opportunity.”
06.05.2018	WASHINGTON –U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement, today, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the U.S. Senate will remain in session during the planned August state work period, also known as “recess”: “It is my firm belief that we should stay in Washington until we get our job done. If that requires us to stay in session 24-hours a day, seven days a week, then that is what we should be doing.” Senator Ernst, along with Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford and Georgia Sen. David Perdue recently introduced “No Budget, No Vacation” Act to emphasize the need to stay and pass a budget and appropriations bills before the end of the fiscal year.
06.05.2018	Senators’ Bill would Strengthen Congressional Oversight and the Public’s Ability to Evaluate How Federal Agencies are Tackling Problems Identified by Inspectors General In 2017, Inspectors General at Federal Agencies Found over $20 Billion in Potential Taxpayer Savings WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Heidi Heitkamp today announced that their bipartisan bill to help ensure that federal agencies are acting on recommendations made by inspectors general (IGs) that save taxpayers money and make government more efficient passed out of the U.S. Senate. Ernst and Heitkamp’s legislation would require all open recommendations from IGs at federal agencies that have remained unimplemented for more than a year to be posted to a single, searchable website. Congress and the public could then better monitor the problems that have been identified at the federal agencies where IGs conduct audits to combat waste, fraud, and abuse— and identify whether adequate steps have been taken to resolve those problems. “Our Inspectors General provide critical oversight of our federal agencies, and the government should be held accountable for enacting their recommendations to safeguard against fraud, waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars,” said Ernst. “I am thrilled to see Senator Heitkamp’s and my bipartisan legislation pass the Senate to make recommendations made by the Inspectors General more accessible and transparent for all Americans.” “Good government in a democracy means being open, transparent, and accountable to the public— and each year, inspectors general work hard to review federal programs and report on ways to cut unnecessary spending, improve security, and maintain ethical standards. While inspectors general find billions in potential taxpayer savings each year, the general public may have a tough time tracking down whether an agency has made a good-faith effort to resolve issues identified by inspectors general,” said Heitkamp. “Our bipartisan bill passing in the Senate marks an important step in holding agencies accountable and pressuring them to address fraud, waste, and abuse in the federal government.” Ernst and Heitkamp introduced this legislation in November following the October launch of Oversight.gov— a federal website that hosts thousands of IG reports. The legislation was also cosponsored by U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK). IGs serve as federal watchdogs within government agencies that investigate and provide recommendations on how agencies can improve operations and address fraud, waste, and abuse. IGs cover a wide variety of issues ranging from cybersecurity issues and grant administration to federal hiring practices and human management practices. In 2017, for the third consecutive year, the IGs identified in their recommendations over $20 billion in potential taxpayer savings.
05.31.2018	WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) joined Senator Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) in submitting an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast v. Gee. A Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in the case currently prohibits states, including Mississippi, from eliminating taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood through Medicaid. “States should be able to fund health centers that provide the best and most comprehensive care, without being forced to use taxpayer money for organizations that provide abortions, like Planned Parenthood,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “It is critical the Supreme Court take up this case and ensure rulings from a Court of Appeals do not infringe upon a state’s right to provide quality care to women, while also protecting our most vulnerable: the unborn.” “Congress gave states broad authority to determine which organizations can participate in their Medicaid programs,” Wicker said. “This ruling undermines congressional intent and state laws to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. I hope the Supreme Court will take up this case and rule in favor of states’ rights and the unborn.” Two-dozen U.S. Senators signed the amicus brief led by Wicker including: Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., Bill Cassidy, R-La., John Kennedy, R-La., John Cornyn, R-Tex., Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., Roy Blunt, R-Mo., John Barrasso, R-Wyo., Mike Rounds, R-S.D., Pat Roberts, R-Kan., Deb Fischer, R-Neb., John Boozman, R-Ark., Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, Ted Cruz, R-Tex., Jerry Moran, R-Kan., Thom Tillis, R-N.C., Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Tim Scott, R-S.C., James Risch, R-Idaho, Steve Daines, R-Mont., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. In the amicus brief, the senators challenge the Fifth Circuit’s ruling based on their interpretation of congressional intent in the Medicaid Act and state sovereignty in granting Medicaid provider status. They argue the Supreme Court should hear the case because circuit courts have offered contradictory opinions in similar cases. For a PDF copy of the amicus brief, click here.
05.27.2018	WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI) and Joni Ernst (R-IA), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Motorcycle Caucus, joined thousands of veterans to observe Memorial Day at the annual Rolling Thunder First Amendment Demonstration Run. The motorcycle ride brings together over one million riders and spectators combined to honor servicemembers killed in action (KIA), those still missing in action (MIA) and prisoners of war (POW). Both Peters and Ernst serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee and are former servicemembers: Peters is a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve and Ernst is a former Lt. Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. “Generations of American military men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice while serving our country, and we owe them and their families our deepest gratitude,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. “I was honored to join Senator Ernst and veterans from around the country at Rolling Thunder to pay tribute to the fallen and those who have yet to return home from their service.” “Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. As a nation, we can never repay what was given, or ever say thank you enough. I am proud to join my colleagues at Rolling Thunder today to honor these Americans, and those who were killed in action or became prisoners of war,” said Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). “America’s POW/MIA mission is very important to the VFW and our nation’s veterans, service members and families. It is a promise to those serving in uniform today that no matter what, we will travel to the ends of the Earth to return you home to your families,” said VFW National Legislative Service Director Carlos Fuentes. “The VFW thanks Senators Peters and Ernst for their leadership in making certain the brave men and women who have make the ultimate sacrifice are never forgotten.” Rolling Thunder began in 1988 as a response to the Vietnam War era. Led by Vietnam veteran Ray Manzo (CPL, USMC), a group of veterans organized the first run to raise awareness of the significant numbers of American servicemembers missing in action or left behind as prisoners of war. According to the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), there are more than 82,000 Americans still missing from WWII, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Cold War, and the most recently concluded Gulf Wars. Longtime motorcyclists, Peters and Ernst launched the bipartisan Senate Motorcycle Caucus in 2017 to facilitate discussions on a range of issues on behalf of both motorcycle riders and manufacturers.
05.25.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) has released a video recognizing the important step the United States Senate took yesterday when they unanimously approved the bipartisan Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act. Click here or on the image below to watch. The full transcript of the senator’s remarks can be found below. Hi, this is Joni Ernst, a senator representing the great state of Iowa. Yesterday, the United States Senate took a very important step forward when we unanimously approved bipartisan legislation to protect victims of workplace harassment and discrimination in Congress. There is no place for sexual harassment on our college campuses, in our workplace, our gyms, our military – or anywhere else. Victims are coming forward and making their voices heard, and it is critical that we take action now to protect and defend them. It is critical that Congress has zero tolerance for this type of inappropriate behavior in our society. Earlier this year, I joined all 21 of my fellow female Senate colleagues to urge Senate leadership to bring critical legislation, such as the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act, to the floor. This bipartisan legislation takes the necessary steps to provide victims with greater protections and options, holds members of Congress personally liable for their wrongdoings, and protects taxpayer dollars. I am proud to join my colleagues to ensure that members of the Senate, their staffs, and all employees of the legislative branch, are provided with the necessary training on prevention and reporting procedures to combat sexual harassment in the workplace. While this is an important step forward, we have a long road ahead to rid society of such inappropriate and disgusting behavior. We must remain committed to doing our part to combat and prevent sexual harassment, assault, and abuse in all facets of our society. Thank you.
05.25.2018	WASHINGTON – Sens. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Mike Lee (R-UT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Pat Toomey (R-PA), David Perdue (R-GA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Rand Paul (R-KY), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), and Ben Sasse (R-NE) introduced the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act Thursday, a bill that would formally rescind the $15 billion in unneeded spending identified by the White House on May 8, 2018. “Rescinding these dollars now ensures that Congress doesn’t use them as a budget gimmick later,” Sen. Ernst said. “This rescissions bill is a common-sense initiative to ensure that the federal government is a better and more effective steward of hard-working Americans’ money.” “Yes, a $15 billion spending reduction is a drop in the bucket compared to a $15 trillion debt,” Sen. Lee said. “But we have to start cutting spending somewhere. Because if we don’t, if we continue to allow federal government spending to grow faster than the economy as a whole, at some point economic reality will force us to do so in a much more painful manner later.” “Our country doesn’t have a revenue problem, it has a spending problem,” Sen. Johnson said. “While these cuts won’t solve our debt problems – far from it – they are an important step in the right direction by eliminating unnecessary and excessive spending throughout the federal government.” “This proposal will help end the deception where Congress over funds popular programs like CHIP only to shift the excess money to unrelated programs when the American people aren’t looking,” Sen. Toomey said. “It is a modest but important step in the direction of honest budgeting and protecting taxpayers.” “We are past the tipping point in this debt crisis,” said Sen. Perdue. “Today, most of the money we spend on our military, our veterans, and domestic discretionary programs is borrowed money. This will get worse and it’s time for Washington to come to grips with this reality. President Trump has—that’s why his team is proposing to cut these unused and expired government programs. These are simple cuts, arguably the easiest we could make, and they should be supported by every member in Congress.” “Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to cut one penny from every dollar through a budget bill I proposed last week. I am hopeful they will support cutting half a penny from every dollar through this rescissions package,” Sen. Paul said. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act 1974 empowers the president to send a rescission message to Congress specifying the accounts, programs, and amounts to be rescinded. The funds are then locked down for 45 days allowing Congress to either approve, modify, or ignore the president’s rescission request. According to Senate rules, all rescission legislation must go to committee where the committee then has 25 days to act before the legislation can be discharged to the floor. By introducing this legislation today, that 25-day window for discharge will run out before the 45-day window for congressional action. An online version of this release can be found here.
05.24.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) secured 30 specific provisions to strengthen our nation’s security and support the people who defend our nation in the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bipartisan FY19 NDAA bill passed the Senate Armed Services Committee today and is headed to the full Senate for consideration. “From providing the necessary equipment and resources, to ensuring our servicemembers are in top condition, this year’s NDAA improves military readiness,” said Senator Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. “I am pleased to see the NDAA include many of my efforts to address aggression and threats by our adversaries around the globe.” The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the NDAA with Senator Ernst’s support and 30 of Senator Ernst’s measures, including: Bipartisan legislation with Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) to track, treat, and prevent traumatic brain injury among servicemembers; Additional research funding for physiological episodes that are plaguing our Air Force airmen and Naval aviators, along with a provision that provides for an additional $31 million in funding; Support for the continued assistance to Iowa’s sister-state, the Republic of Kosovo, and the Kosovo Security Force’s gradual transition to a multiethnic army; Full funding for our missile defense and anti-tunneling coordination with Israel; A provision to ensure that the U.S. Department of Defense’s (DoD) artificial intelligence initiatives and research and development (R&D) are better coordinated with academic research and industry; A 2.6 percent pay raise for troops, and limits the president’s ability to deny troops their mandated pay raise Increased reporting to counter Russia’s information and intelligence operations in Serbia; A provision encouraging DoD to invest in R&D and procurement of wearable and mobile solar power capabilities; Encouragement for the Defense Department to take steps to maintain secure, domestic sources of high purity aluminum; A provision to direct the creation of a U.S. Army Advanced Manufacturing of Excellence in partnership with an arsenal; Efforts to recognize the importance of DoD contracts with military paint training programs that use advanced technology in preparation and training; Direction that the Secretary of Defense should establish a Defense Institute on Human Factors Modeling and Simulation to maximize the effectiveness of the warfighter in each service branch; An increased focus on producing domestic explosives for the U.S. military, and a need to stockpile explosives that must be purchased from foreign sources; and Protection of the rank of Chief Military Chaplains across each service branch.
05.24.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Senate approved bipartisan legislation to fundamentally reform the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 by: updating and strengthening the processes available to victims; providing immediate protections for staff; and, holding members of Congress financially accountable. “There is no place for sexual harassment on our college campuses, in our workplace, our gyms, our military – or anywhere else,” said Senator Ernst, a co-sponsor of the legislation, praising its passage. “It is critical that Congress has zero tolerance for this type of inappropriate behavior in our society. This bipartisan legislation takes the necessary steps to provide victims with greater protections and options, holds members of Congress personally liable for their wrongdoings, and protects taxpayer dollars. I am proud to join my colleagues to ensure that members of the Senate, their staffs, and all employees of the legislative branch, are provided with the necessary training on prevention and reporting procedures to combat sexual harassment in the workplace.” The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act will update and strengthen the procedures available to victims of harassment and discrimination, and other violations of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. The bipartisan bill was proposed by Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN). This spring, Senator Ernst joined all 21 of her Democratic and Republican women Senators to call on Senate leadership to help survivors of all forms of sexual harassment and discrimination in the congressional workplace. Specifically, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 Reform Act: Fundamentally reforms the current system by overhauling the antiquated dispute resolution process; eliminates the mandatory 30-day counseling period, 30-day mediation phase, and the 30-day “cooling off” period; and eliminating mandatory mediation Provides immediate protection for staff, as well as access to a dedicated advocate for consultation and assistance throughout proceedings Extends protections of the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 to unpaid staff including interns, detailees and fellows, as well as staff working at legislative branch commissions like the Helsinki Commission, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, the Stennis Center for Public Service Leadership, and the Congressional-Executive Commission on China. Requires Office of Congressional Workplace Rights (OCWR) to establish an electronic system for taking in claims by victims, tracking those claims throughout the process, and generating reports on various details of claims Holds members of the Senate and the House personally accountable by requiring them to repay awards and settlements stemming from acts of harassment they personally commit, while ensuring members who leave office will still be responsible for repayment, including garnishment of nongovernment wages and retirement annuities to ensure full repayment Requires public reporting by the OCWR of awards and settlements, and all awards and settlements to be automatically referred to the respective Committees on Ethics for investigation or further action when there is a claim against a member or senior staff Requires the Committees on Ethics to review within 90 days settlements of harassment claims against a member of the House or Senate
05.24.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators James Lankford (R-OK) and David Perdue (R-GA), introduced the No Budget, No Vacation Act. This bill would prohibit Senators from traveling during August recess until the budget and appropriations process is completed. “Hardworking Iowans know that you don’t take a break until the job is done,” said Senator Ernst. “Unfortunately, it seems like the same cannot be said for Congress, who adjourns for a month-long recess at the start of every August, whether or not they have passed a budget. This cycle of continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills is unacceptable. We cannot continue to allow our debt to skyrocket and our military to suffer because Congress starts smelling jet fumes. Members of Congress should stay in Washington until we have completed one of our most fundamental roles: funding the federal government.” If both the House and Senate have not approved a budget and all appropriations bills by August 1st, members of Congress would not be able to depart Washington for the August state work period, commonly referred to as “recess.” “The current budget process has been in place since the 1970s but has only worked four times as it was intended. To avoid yet another massive Omnibus spending bill, we must finish our budget and appropriations work. With a $21 trillion federal debt, Congress must do a better job to eliminate waste and reform the budget process so that we spend taxpayer dollars efficiently and appropriately on behalf of the American people. There is serious and difficult budget work that must be done; we should keep working and negotiating until the task is complete. I am proud to join my colleagues in proposing a range of enforcement incentives that will motivate Congress to push through the gridlock, and actually do its most basic constitutional function of funding the federal government,” said Senator Lankford. “The primary role of Congress is to responsibly fund the federal government, and for too long this has not happened,” said Senator Perdue. “Congress has only funded the government on time four times in the last 44 years, and the last time was in 1996 – more than 20 years ago. This cannot continue. The American people expect Congress to do its job, and to do it on time. We agree. If Congress doesn’t meet its funding deadlines, it should stay in DC around the clock until the job is done.” Congress’ dysfunctional budget process by the numbers: $21 trillion: The U.S. is currently $21 trillion in debt. $1 trillion: The U.S. deficits are projected to exceed $1 trillion in coming years $4 billion in waste: Our reliance on continuing resolutions has forced the Department of Defense to ground or underfund dozens of programs and has, for example, resulted in $4 billion in waste for the Navy since 2011. 20 shutdowns: Since 1976, funding battles have shut down the government 20 times, costing billions in retroactive pay and lost economic output. 11 budgets in 20 years: Congress has passed a budget resolution only 11 times in the past 20 years, and has passed all appropriations bills only four times since 1974. 5 Continuing Resolutions: Since 1999, Congress has passed an average of five continuing resolutions per year, creating constant uncertainty for federal agencies, grantees and others who rely on federal funding. This month, Senator Ernst joined several colleagues in calling on Majority Leader McConnell to keep the Senate open nights, weekends, and through the August state work period to avoid last-minute funding battles. The Senator also suggested this at the most recent Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Reform. In June of last year, Senator Ernst joined a group of her colleagues in sending a letter to Leader McConnell requesting the Senate work through the August state work period. Additionally, that following October, Iowa Senators Ernst and Chuck Grassley called for the Senate to remain in session for the scheduled October state work period to continue working.

05.23.2018	WASHINGTON - Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senator Ben Sasse and a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing the Transporting Livestock Across America Safely Act. Currently, overly strict trucking regulations from the Department of Transportation require mandatory rest time that put livestock at risk, especially during summer or winter months. This bipartisan legislation would give American agriculture the flexibility to safely transport livestock. “The transport of agricultural commodities, particularly livestock, poses unique challenges not faced by other segments of the trucking industry,” said Sen. Ernst. “The Transporting Livestock Across America Safely Act addresses these realities and the shortcomings of the current hours of service regulations by giving truckers the flexibility they need to get cattle, hogs, and other live agricultural commodities to their destination.” “Nebraska’s economy runs on agriculture,” said Sen. Sasse. “Our ranchers and haulers are professionals who make the well-being of livestock their top priority and that includes safe transportation. The Department of Transportation’s current regulations endanger livestock during hot summers and cold winters — which Nebraskans know well — causing significant stress on the animals and concern for the drivers. This bipartisan bill is good for our ranchers, good for our haulers, and good for our livestock.” Ernst and Sasse were joined by Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), Doug Jones (D-AL), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Tina Smith (D-MN), and Jon Tester (D-MT). Background: On December 18, 2017, the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) required commercial vehicle drivers to install an electronic logging device (ELD) in their truck to track compliance with Hours of Service (HOS) rules. FMCSA exempted livestock haulers from this requirement until March 18, 2018 and a congressional delay has extended it through September 30, 2018. Currently, for livestock and insects, HOS rules require that haulers turn on their ELD after they cross a 150-air mile radius of the origin of their load (such as cattle). After crossing a 150-air mile radius, haulers must start tracking their on-duty time and can only drive 11 hours before taking a mandatory 10-hour rest time. The inflexibility of these regulations will be costly for haulers and place the well-being and welfare of insects, cattle, hogs, and other livestock at risk. The current law does not allow flexibility for livestock and insects to reach their destination given the vast geography of production and processing facilities, most often spanning from coastal states to the Midwest. Extended stops for a hauler, which would be necessitated by these HOS regulations, are especially dangerous for livestock during summer or winter months; high humidity and winter temperatures with below freezing windchills cause significant stress on livestock. The Transporting Livestock Across America Safely (TLAAS) Act addresses these problems and eases the burden of these far-reaching HOS and ELD regulations for haulers of livestock or insects. Specifically, the Transporting Livestock Across America Safely: Provides that HOS and ELD requirements are inapplicable until after a driver travels more than 300-air miles from their source. Drive time for HOS purposes does not start until after 300-air mile threshold. Exempts loading and unloading times from the HOS calculation of driving time. Extends the HOS on-duty time maximum hour requirement from 11 hours to a minimum of 15 hours and a maximum of 18 hours of on-duty time. Grants flexibility for drivers to rest at any point during their trip without counting against HOS time. Allows drivers to complete their trip – regardless of HOS requirements – if they come within 150-air miles of their delivery point. After the driver completes their delivery and the truck is unloaded, the driver will take a break for a period that is 5 hours less than the maximum on-duty time (10 hours if a 15-hour drive time).
05.23.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded the Senate’s passage of the VA MISSION Act, bipartisan legislation that improves veterans’ access to health care services: “We can and we must do better for our veterans. Today, the Senate took a step in the right direction toward ensuring those who have sacrificed for our freedom have access to the quality and timely care they deserve. “I am also proud to see my bipartisan VETS Act included in this legislation, which will finally allow our rural or homebound veterans in Iowa, and across the U.S., to receive necessary care from the comfort of their homes. Additionally, after concerning discoveries of improper hiring at the Iowa City VA, I filed an amendment that requires third-party clinical reviews of patient care by a health care provider that was hired illegally. This review is critical in determining if there was any malpractice, and ensuring that patient safety and peace of mind for our veterans is a top priority, as it should be. I plan to introduce this amendment as standalone legislation in coming weeks. “As a veteran, I applaud this bipartisan effort to ensure those who defend our nation receive what they deserve: the care and respect they have earned.” The bipartisan bill included Senator Ernst’s Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine (VETS) Act, which expands telehealth services available to veterans in rural and underserved areas. Watch Senator Ernst remarks from the Senate floor in support of the VA MISSION Act here.
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON – Ahead of tomorrow’s vote in the Senate on the VA MISSION Act, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, delivered remarks on the Senate floor calling on her colleagues to join her in supporting the legislation, which includes her bipartisan Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine (VETS) Act. Watch Senator Ernst’s remarks on the Senate floor here or by clicking on the image below. Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks as delivered: “Thank you Mr. President, and thank you Chairman Isakson very much for your work on this bill. “As a veteran, as a spouse of a veteran, as the mother of a young lady who will enter into the service this summer, and as the grandmother to a young man who will begin his enlistment this fall, I thank you for the work that you have done. I appreciate your service as well, thank you so much. “We can and we must do better for our veterans. “I spoke those words during my very first speech given here on the Senate floor just over three years ago. “I also spoke about the need to fulfill the promises made to our veterans who have sacrificed everything for our country. “At that time, the average wait for a mental health appointment at the VA was 36 days. “There were, on average, 22 veteran suicides every single day in the United States. “It underscores the troubles within the VA, and the urgency to act immediately to help our veterans get the quality and the timely care that they have earned and that they deserve. “That’s why I introduced, on that very day, my first bill, the Prioritizing Veterans Access to Mental Health Care Act. “My bill would have eliminated the distance and the wait time requirements for veterans seeking mental health care under the current Choice Program. “Every veteran should have the choice to receive care in the community, but they should not be burdened by bureaucratic red tape or strict guidelines that serve as roadblocks to receiving this type of care. “To illustrate how burdensome, and sometimes ridiculous, these guidelines are, I want to share a letter I received from a veteran in Ames, Iowa. They wrote: “Quote: I am a disabled veteran who currently receives healthcare at the Des Moines VA Hospital. I live 39.7 miles from the Des Moines VA Hospital, which means I do not meet the 40 mile VA Choice criteria. While I have not had a bad experience at the Des Moines VA—it is burdensome to travel approximately 40 miles when I have had surgeries that require a family member to transport me. I am unable to utilize a non-VA facility in my own backyard. End quote. “The frustration evident in this veteran’s letter has been present in hundreds of letters and stories. And I’ve received many, many, many of those over the years. “I’m frustrated too. Those who are willing to lay down their lives for our country shouldn’t have to jump through hoops to receive the care that they have earned. “I am thrilled that this week, the Senate has the opportunity to do better for our veterans. “Just last week, the House passed the VA MISSION Act, which improves how veterans access community care. “Under the VA MISSION Act, the VA remains the coordinator of a veteran’s care. The VA would still be in charge of scheduling those appointments, ensuring that a veteran is going to follow-up visits, and also ensuring that no veteran experiences a delay or a gap in their care. “The VA MISSION Act also makes significant improvements to accessing community care. A veteran will no longer be bound by strict distance and wait time requirements just as I expressed from that veteran who lives in Ames, Iowa. “Instead, that decision rests with the veteran and their provider. If a veteran and their provider determine that it is in the veteran’s best medical interest, the VA will be required to offer access to community care. “The VA MISSION Act ensures that veterans have a say and a choice in their care. “This legislation also includes my bipartisan Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Support Act, also known as the VETS Act, which I introduced with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. VA providers will now be able to practice across state lines expanding telehealth services, which can include critical mental health care and care desperately needed, to veterans in rural and underserved areas. “The Act will also expand VA caregiver benefits to pre 9/11 veterans, create a commission to evaluate how to modernize VA facilities, increase resources to hire more providers, which is very important, and ensure prompt payment to community providers. “I am also pleased to report that this bill has bipartisan support and the support of over 30 veteran service organizations. “Funding for the Choice Program is expected to run out at the end of May, so in a matter of weeks. The men and women who have put their lives on the line for freedom of every American deserve better than the status quo. “And again I say: we can and we must do better for our veterans. “The VA MISSION Act is a positive step forward towards getting veterans the care they need, and that is why I will be voting in support of it and I urge my colleagues to do the same and cast their vote in favor of the VA MISSION Act. “Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.”
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON, DC – Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Lankford (R-OK), Roy Blunt (R-MO), and Steve Daines (R-MT) today applauded the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) proposed regulation that would change how Title X grants are awarded. In this change, the health of mothers and babies are prioritized. It also clarifies the policy that abortion is not a family planning method. Specifically, HHS today filed a rule-making proposal with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to restore Title X family planning regulations that prohibit grantees from co-locating with abortion clinics, or from promoting, or referring clients for abortions. This proposal comes after the senators and 37 of their colleagues requested HHS Secretary Alex Azar to update the Title X regulations. The HHS proposed rule would restore the Reagan-era regulations to protect taxpayer dollars and ensure the complete separation of abortion activities from federally-funded family planning activities. The policy changed under President Clinton to require that grantees be willing to refer for abortion and allow abortion clinics and Title X clinics to share facilities. “Regardless of our differences of opinion on when life begins, we should all agree that no taxpayer should be forced to fund abortion providers with their hard-earned tax dollars,” said Lankford. “Each administration has the authority to determine how Title X funds will be distributed and I applaud this administration’s proposal to redirect federal funding from abortion providers to health care for mothers and babies.” “President Trump took a significant step forward today to protect the sanctity of life,” said Ernst. “The clarification and separation between family planning and abortion has been restored – protecting taxpayer dollars and, most importantly, our unborn children. The redirection of these Title X funds to other entities, such as federally qualified community health centers, which continue to outnumber Planned Parenthood agencies in Iowa, will provide better and more comprehensive care for women and families, regardless of a person’s ability to pay.” “Taxpayers should not be forced to fund abortion because of misguided regulations that blur the line between family planning and abortion,” said Blunt. “I applaud the Trump administration for taking steps to restore the legally-mandated separation between family planning and abortion. The new rule will be critical to ensuring the integrity of the Title X program and directing resources toward community health centers that provide more comprehensive health care services for women.” “Abortion is not family planning,” said Daines. “Now these taxpayer funds will go toward saving lives, not ending them, including at Montana’s 17 community health centers. I applaud President Trump for taking action to protect the unborn, and fighting for those who do not have a voice.” This new HHS rule-making proposal also requires Title X clinics to provide better protection for victims of sexual assault by requiring clinics to document their compliance with state reporting laws. Planned Parenthood receives about $450 million in total federal funding every year. In March, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) released an extensive report that detailed the amount of federal tax dollars spent from 2013-2015 by three abortion providers including Planned Parenthood Federation of American (PPFA), Marie Stopes International (MSI), and International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). The largest amount of that funding was $170 million from Title X programs. In January 2017, Lankford, Blunt, and Daines joined Senator Ernst to introduce the “Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act,” a bill that would redirect taxpayer funds from Planned Parenthood to other eligible women's health care providers that don't perform abortions.
05.22.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, praised the Committee’s passage of the America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which included a provision directing the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite completion of the Cedar Rapids flood control project. “For too long, rural infrastructure projects have taken a back seat to urban and coastal ones,” said Senator Ernst. “Streamlining permitting processes and reforming the rigid and flawed benefit-to-cost ratio guidelines will give projects in Iowa and other rural states a better chance to receive the critical funding they deserve.” This bipartisan legislation authorizes, and makes important improvements to, the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works program, which is responsible for flood control, navigation, and other activities related to water resources and infrastructure. In developing this legislation, Senator Ernst focused her efforts on policies that will make Corps projects in Iowa more likely to receive federal funding, and that will allow communities to more readily address their flood control needs. Reforming the Flawed Benefit-to-Cost Ratio (BCR): The Iowa Senator has been a vocal critic of the current BCR metrics, which disadvantage projects in states with low property values when they compete against projects in major cities or coastal areas for federal funding. Ernst worked with her colleagues on the Committee to develop a process designed to give small and rural communities better access to funding for Corps projects. Under the new process created by this legislation, the Corps will provide funding allocations to each Corps district based on stakeholder input, the local and regional significance of projects, and other criteria. Once this funding is allocated to the district level, only projects within that district can compete for it, and BCR guidelines will not apply. An additional provision in the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to conduct a study on potential reforms to the current BCR metrics. Prioritizing Cedar Rapids Flood Control Project: Senator Ernst also included language in the bill that directs the Corps to expedite completion of the Cedar Rapids flood control project, which despite being authorized in 2014, has yet to receive federal funding due to its low BCR. Streamlining Permitting Processes: In an effort to speed up the construction of improvements to local flood projects, Senator Ernst’s provision clarifying that decisions to approve such proposals can be made at the district level was included in the legislation. Asserting that Corps districts, rather than Corps headquarters in Washington, D.C., have the authority to approve these projects will help communities address their needs in a more timely fashion.
05.21.2018	‘As you near the conclusion of NAFTA negotiations, we urge you to closely consider the parameters and negotiating objectives outlined in TPA and work closely with Members of Congress from both parties to ensure that any agreement has the broad support necessary to be enacted into law.’ ‘In our view, a take-it or leave-it strategy could have negative unintended effects that jeopardize American jobs and economic growth. When discussing NAFTA modernization legislation with Congress, we ask the Administration employ a strategy that emphasizes collaboration, rather than conflict.’ WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with 31 of her Senate Republican colleagues, sent a letter to the United States Trade Representative, Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, urging the Administration to work closely with Members of Congress to ensure the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has the Congressional support necessary to be enacted into law as negotiations on the agreement near conclusion. “As you near the conclusion of NAFTA negotiations, we urge you to closely consider the parameters and negotiating objectives outlined in TPA and work closely with Members of Congress from both parties to ensure that any agreement has the broad support necessary to be enacted into law,” the Senators wrote. “In our view, a take-it or leave-it strategy could have negative unintended effects that jeopardize American jobs and economic growth. When discussing NAFTA modernization legislation with Congress, we ask the Administration employ a strategy that emphasizes collaboration, rather than conflict.” Co-signatories include John Cornyn (R-TX), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), James Lankford (R-OK), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), John Boozman (R-AR), Pat Toomey (R-PA), John Barrasso (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Todd Young (R-IN), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Thune (R-SD), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Tim Scott (R-SC), John Hoeven (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Bob Corker (R-TN), John McCain (R-AZ), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Jim Risch (R-ID), Mike Lee (R-UT), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Cory Gardner (R-CO). Text of the letter is below. The Honorable Robert E. Lighthizer United States Trade Representative 600 17th Street N.W. Washington, D.C. 20508 Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: Since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) came into force in 1994, our economy has diversified and transformed through technological advances and growing industrial capabilities. To meet the needs of today’s North American economy, we agree that NAFTA should be modernized. We applaud the Administration’s ongoing efforts to update NAFTA and offer any support or assistance needed to reach an agreement that strengthens the American economy. As negotiations near conclusion, we will also take this opportunity to highlight the consultative and procedural requirements for fast-track congressional consideration and approval of a free trade agreement (FTA) set forth in The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA). As you know, TPA helps ensure that the executive branch will consider congressional input and priorities before concluding the negotiation of a FTA. Specifically, these requirements include that the Administration meet upon request with any Member of Congress regarding negotiating objectives, consult closely with the Senate Committee on Finance and House Committee on Ways and Means, and keep fully apprised any designated congressional advisers. As a result of these consultative requirements, and other provisions set forth in statute, TPA also provides for expedited congressional consideration of negotiated FTAs, allowing for simple majority votes in both Houses of Congress without the consideration of any amendments. However, we are concerned that the necessary congressional support under TPA could be endangered if provisions counter to congressional priorities and objectives set forth in TPA are included in an updated NAFTA agreement. As you near the conclusion of NAFTA negotiations, we urge you to closely consider the parameters and negotiating objectives outlined in TPA and work closely with Members of Congress from both parties to ensure that any agreement has the broad support necessary to be enacted into law. We are concerned about recent media reports suggesting that you may be considering an ultimatum strategy to pressure Congress into accepting an updated NAFTA, including through threats to withdraw from the original agreement. In the past, you have suggested that your goal is to achieve overwhelming bipartisan support for a modernized NAFTA. We believe this goal is only achievable through a strategy to constructively engage Members of Congress as required by TPA and without attempting to force a choice between negative outcomes. In our view, a take-it or leave-it strategy could have negative unintended effects that jeopardize American jobs and economic growth. When discussing NAFTA modernization legislation with Congress, we ask the Administration employ a strategy that emphasizes collaboration, rather than conflict. We thank you for your tireless efforts to improve NAFTA and look forward to continuing our work to strengthen America’s economy through free and fair trade. Sincerely,
05.18.2018	Bill Text | One Pager Washington, DC - United States Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) today introduced the bipartisan Blast Exposure and Brain Injury Prevention Act of 2018. The legislation would improve research on traumatic brain injury (TBI) among servicemembers and strengthen the Department of Defense's (DOD) capacity to track and prevent blast pressure exposure. Since 2000, more than 370,000 servicemembers have received a first-time diagnosis of traumatic brain injury, in many cases due to the use of improvised explosive devices (IED) in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. "Traumatic brain Injury (TBI) is a nearly invisible, yet very serious physical trauma with long-term effects that has become prevalent among hundreds of thousands of servicemembers in recent years," said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. "As a grateful nation, it is our job to ensure the safety and health of our men and women in uniform as they defend our country. The Blast Exposure and Brain Injury Prevention Act addresses the serious threat posed by TBI in combat and in training, and will provide the Department of Defense with greater guidance to treat, but most importantly prevent, TBI." "America owes our brave men and women in uniform the very best care we can give them," Senator Warren said. "We know that many servicemembers exposed to blasts during combat and training later experience long-term brain injury. We need to better understand how to prevent and treat blast exposure in order to give our servicemembers the care they need and deserve." While TBI is often associated with blunt physical injuries to the head, recent research has shown that the blast wave produced by even minor explosions can result in TBI-even if the individual does not exhibit outward physical signs of head injury. Blast overpressure - the pressure caused from a shock wave that exceeds normal atmospheric values - causes harm to the brain not just by moving the brain around inside the skull, but also by damaging the brain at the sub-cellular level. Exposure to blast pressure may result not only from battlefield IEDs, but also from smaller concussive events such as firing artillery and other heavy-caliber weapons, which military personnel may do multiple times a day, over multiple days at a time, while training to use these weapons. Although research has demonstrated that exposure to blast pressure can damage the brain, scientists' ability to longitudinally track these effects and understand variation in health outcomes is constrained by the limited data collected on soldiers' exposure to blast pressure events during their military service. The Blast Exposure and Brain Injury Prevention Act of 2018 would address these issues by improving research on traumatic brain injury, speeding the development of therapies to treat TBI, and enabling the DOD to better track and prevent blast pressure exposure. Specifically, the legislation directs the DOD to submit a plan for accelerating research on therapies for TBI and PTSD, and to include detailed documentation of blast exposure - during both combat and training - in military service records. The bill would also require the DOD to review and update its guidance on blast exposure during training, and establish a research and development program to improve the efficacy of personal protective equipment.
05.17.2018	Program established by legislation Ernst helped champion in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the U.S Department of Treasury announced all 62 of the opportunity zones submitted by Governor Kim Reynolds were selected to be designated Opportunity Zones, a new program that promotes investment in low-income areas. Opportunity Zones were created by the Investing in Opportunity Act, included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and will provide low-income communities with support and spur economic growth: “I am thrilled to see the Investing in Opportunity Act at work in my home state of Iowa,” said Senator Ernst. “I am hopeful that the Opportunity Zones nominated by Governor Reynolds and chosen by the Department of Treasury will soon see the private-sector investment and economic development they have needed to get their community growing again. This is a great step in the right direction, and I am excited to see communities across our state benefit from this outstanding program.” For more details or to apply, visit www.iowaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunityzones or contact OpportunityZones@iowaeda.com.
05.16.2018	Following a vote in the U.S. Senate to reinstate Obama-era net neutrality rules, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement: “The Obama administration’s net neutrality rules are another example of regulatory overreach by the federal government, and I continue to support the Federal Communications Commission’s decision to repeal them. Overregulation can hurt any industry by stifling investment and limiting competition, and in this case, by slowing broadband deployment, especially to rural areas. “There is bipartisan interest in legislation to address how to best govern the internet, and I feel such an effort is the proper path forward. This is an inappropriate use of the CRA, which was designed to roll-back burdensome regulations, not reinstate them.”
05.15.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators David Perdue (R-GA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Steve Daines (R-MT), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) in a press conference expressing their willingness to work nights, weekends, and through the August state work period to complete necessary funding bills and confirm President Trump’s nominees before the end of the fiscal year. Watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks here or by clicking on the below image. Below are Senator Ernst’s remarks as delivered: “Thanks so much Senator Perdue, and good morning everybody. “As far as I know, being a member of Congress is the only occupation where you can neglect some of the most important duties and then take a month-long vacation right before the deadline. “Besides providing for our national defense, one of the most fundamental responsibilities of Congress is to fund the government. Yet, since 1974, we have passed all of our appropriations bills just four times. “However, every August – right before the end of the fiscal year on September 30th – Congress heads off to whatever destination, on vacation, heading home, they pack their bags, they leave for a month-long vacation, and leave behind mountains of work to get done. “Right now, we have less than 12 weeks to finish 12 appropriations bills before the end of this fiscal year. We have countless nominations, as Senator Perdue noted, and we have a number of other important “must-pass” legislative initiatives. “If we take another August off, we will likely find ourselves once again relying on these horrible continuing resolutions, which have a devastating effect on our military and create billions in waste across our federal government. “Our constituents deserve better than this cycle of governing from crisis-to-crisis. Congress hasn’t passed a budget and regular appropriations bills, if they haven’t by August, we shouldn’t be able to leave on vacation, or go home, or go wherever. “We should be working nights. We should be working weekends. We should be working through August and any other state work period to pass these appropriations bills and to get our nominations done in a timely manner. “Senator Perdue, thank you so much for getting this group together. Thanks to my colleagues for joining in on this issue. We must get our work done. We have made a commitment to our constituents, and we need to see that through.”
05.14.2018	WASHINGTON – On the 70th anniversary of Israel’s founding, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement recognizing the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel: “This is a historic day for the United States and our most trusted ally in the Middle East, Israel. I am pleased President Trump followed through on a decades-old promise made by the United States to relocate the U.S. Embassy to Israel’s capital, Jerusalem. Given the growing threats our two nations face in the Middle East and beyond, it is critical that we continue to protect and strengthen our relationship, and to stand with the people of Israel.”
05.11.2018	WASHINGTON – As bilateral trade negotiations continue with China and the Section 301 Committee prepares for its public hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and Senate Committee on Armed Services, submitted a letter to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to be included in the record urging the Ambassador to reconsider tariffs on Chinese imports that pose a serious threat to both our agricultural economy and national security, and have already negatively impacted U.S. exports. The Senator stated that, “As Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I recognize the complex threats we face when protecting our nation's intellectual property, both for our economy and security” and agreed that “the President is right to increase pressure on China to change its ways.” However, Senator Ernst believes “the United States should foster more dialogue to expand international market opportunities for our country’s goods,” reducing the trade deficit, rather than imposing tariffs that have already proven dangerous to our exports. Senator Ernst urged Ambassador Lighthizer and the Trump Administration to “reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets.” Senator Ernst has continually cautioned the administration on the negative effects of tariffs on Iowa’s agricultural economy and our national security. Read Senator Ernst’s full letter here or below. The Honorable Robert E. Lighthizer United States Trade Representative 600 17th Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20508 Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: As the United States continues bilateral trade negotiations with China and the Section 301 Committee prepares for its public hearing on May 15, I write to urge you to reconsider the tariffs on Chinese imports and pursue policies that enhance American competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets. As Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I recognize the complex threats we face when protecting our nation's intellectual property, both for our economy and security. Furthermore, I believe the President is right to increase pressure on China to change its ways. At the same time, the United States should foster more dialogue to expand international market opportunities for our country's goods and agriculture around the globe and use these contributions to reduce the trade deficit. Already, we are seeing the danger these tariffs pose on the United States' exports. Recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture revealed that Chinese importers have curbed shipments of soybeans and cut orders of pork. The data also showed that sales of soybeans have fallen from 8.3 million bushels during the first week of April, when the trade dispute began, to just 290,000 bushels during the final week of April. With South American countries like Brazil and Argentina eager to gain and aggressively pursue global market share for key agricultural products, China is an increasingly important market from which U.S producers can't afford to lose access. Furthermore, the Administration's action could hurt global supply chains and lead to higher consumer prices. Experiencing a sixth consecutive year of declining farm income, hardworking farmers and ranchers are already struggling to remain profitable and make ends meet. It's my hope that the Trump Administration will reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets. The Administration must pursue trade policies that make the U.S. a partner of choice for nations that may otherwise turn to less free and democratic nations for trade. I look forward to continuing the dialogue about these concerns as the Administration negotiates toward a solution with China. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst
05.11.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators David Perdue (R-GA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Dean Heller (R-NV), Ron Johnson (R-WI), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Roger Wicker (R-MS) in asking Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to expedite floor consideration on funding bills and President Trump’s nominees, even if the Senate must work nights, weekends, and through the August state work period to make substantial progress before the end of the fiscal year, September 30. “We stand ready to break through the confirmation backlog and get the government funded before we break in August, well before the September 30 deadline,” said the senators. “We stand ready to work Mondays and Fridays, nights as well as weekends, to ensure the funding process is not used to jam the President with a bad spending deal. We, and the American people, expect Congress to work tirelessly to restore American greatness. The President has outlined an agenda that will unleash economic growth, strengthen our military, and rebuild our infrastructure. We play a critical role in advancing this agenda, so together let’s make Congress work again.” The senators outlined their request in a letter sent to Leader McConnell on Thursday, May 10, 2018.

05.09.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the bipartisan, bicameral Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Reform held a hearing on bipartisanship in budgeting and received testimony from several witnesses on ways to reform Congress’ dysfunctional budget process. During the hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pointed to Congress’ inability to pass a budget resolution and appropriations bills, yet members still return to their home states for a month long state work period, or “recess”, in August before the start of each fiscal year. The Senator stated that if members of Congress do not have their work done, they should not be able to go on “vacation” and asked witness Mr. William Hoagland, Senior Vice President of the Bipartisan Policy Center, to provide his insights on the effect this may have on incentivizing Congress to complete their work on time. Additionally, as our deficit approaches one trillion dollars, Senator Ernst asked Mr. Hoagland and another witness, Mr. Donald Wolfensberger, a fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center, to provide insights from their time as congressional staffers during a rare budget surplus. Mr. Hoagland stressed that the budget agreement was reached in a bipartisan manner, which required both parties to compromise. In June of last year, Senator Ernst joined a group of her colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell requesting the Senate work through the August state work period. Additionally, that following October, Iowa Senators Ernst and Chuck Grassley called for the Senate to remain in session for the scheduled October state work period to continue working.

05.09.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, today introduced bipartisan legislation to spur much needed attention to maintaining America’s competitiveness in artificial intelligence (AI), in support of U.S. national security and economic interests, as well as to maintain a competitive advantage over other nations in the use of this cutting-edge technology. This bill establishes the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence to provide necessary recommendations to the President and Congress concerning AI, machine learning, and associated technologies. Specifically, the Commission will be tasked with completing a yearly report that will consider competitiveness of the U.S. in AI in the realms of national security, economic security, public-private partnerships, and investment. Additionally, the report will explore the means for maintaining a technological advantage, developments in foreign investments in AI, how to recruit leading talent in AI and STEM fields, and the risks associated with U.S., foreign countries, and non-state actors’ advances in the military employment of AI. “Our nation has made extraordinary advancements in technology in the 21st century, and we must ensure the United States is prepared to take advantage of the next major technological boon: artificial intelligence,” said Senator Ernst. “Through the establishment of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence we will better understand how to best utilize AI, from the front-lines to the factory lines. The Commission will also provide necessary insight into how near-peer competitors around the globe, like Russia and China, are also advancing in the AI field and what we must do to remain competitive in the realms of national and economic security.” “Artificial Intelligence has the potential to profoundly change many aspects of our lives,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “As AI grows into an important tool for our national security, and a driver of economic growth, comprehensive public awareness and oversight is increasingly important. The commission proposed in this bill will provide guidance on how we cultivate AI to help ensure we stay ahead of countries like China in this space, while also building guardrails to make certain the U.S. government responsibly uses AI.” The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence will be comprised of 15 members appointed by Congress and executive branch leaders from the fields of defense, commerce, science, and intelligence.

05.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, issued the following statement after President Trump announced that the United States will withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly referred to as the “Iran nuclear deal”: “I have stated time and time again that the loophole-ridden JCPOA did not go far enough in its efforts to permanently dismantle Iran’s nuclear program. The agreement, negotiated by then-President Obama, lacks basic oversight and enforcement, and allows a dishonest Iran to continue its destabilizing activity and potentially restart its nuclear weapons program at the sunset of the JCPOA. “Iran continues to pose a serious threat, not only on the global stage as they are allowed to advance their unfettered ballistic missile capacities, but also in the Middle East. We know that Iran continues to support and finance terrorist organization proxies that destabilize the region, endangering American servicemembers and our partners. “I am encouraged by the President’s decision to withdraw from the JCPOA today, and have full confidence that the President and Secretary Pompeo will work with Congress to develop a comprehensive strategy that permanently addresses the threat that a nuclear-capable Iran poses to U.S. and international security.”
05.08.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement following today’s meeting at the White House on the future of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): “Today, the President outlined his intention to direct the sale of E15 year-round, a move that will help put Iowa’s corn farmers, ethanol producers, and our rural communities on a promising path forward. “While I am still assessing the full implications of the President’s notion to attach Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to exported ethanol, an idea Administrator Pruitt committed to not pursue in a letter last October, I am pleased that the President did not move forward with a RIN cap that would have destroyed demand, hurting both farmers and biofuel producers. Allowing E15 year-round will drive up domestic ethanol production and consumption to help maintain already low RIN prices. Additionally, I am encouraged the administration will be taking a closer look at the “hardship” waivers that have been abused by EPA to undermine the RFS. “I will continue working with this administration to ensure the commitments made today protect Iowa’s 88,000 farms and the 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry.”
05.01.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Roy Blunt (Mo.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), James Lankford (Okla.), and Steve Daines (Mont.) led 37 of their Senate colleagues in sending a letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, urging the agency to restore Title X Family Planning regulations that bar grantees from co-locating with abortion clinics, or from promoting, counseling, or referring clients for abortions. “Section 1008 of the Public Health Service Act clearly states that no federal funds appropriated for Title X for family-planning services ‘shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.’ However, the program’s current regulations (42 CFR 59) undermine the law,” the Senators wrote. “We ask that you restore the regulations issued on February 2, 1988 (53 FR 2922), which clarified that Title X programs may not promote, counsel, or refer clients for abortion or co-locate or combine family planning services with abortion activities.” The Senators continued, “We applaud the states that have acted on Congress’ 2017 legislation overturning an Obama-era Title X rule (P.L. 115-23) by redirecting these funds from abortion entities like Planned Parenthood towards community health centers that provide more comprehensive health services for women, but not abortion. Nevertheless, we urge the administration to do more. ... These new regulations should ensure program integrity by requiring a robust and complete separation of abortion activities from federally funded family planning activities. Any programs failing to achieve this standard should not receive federal funding.” The full text of the letter is available here. U.S. Representatives Ron Estes (Kan.), Vicky Hartzler (Mo.), Chris Smith (N.J.), and Diane Black (Tenn.) led a similar companion letter with 149 of their colleagues in the House.
04.30.2018	Washington, D.C. - The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship today honored Anfinson Farm Store from Cushing, Iowa as the Small Business of the Day for National Small Business Week. This business, which was nominated by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), will be recognized in the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate. “Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and in Iowa they make up 99 percent of all employers in the state,” said Senator Ernst. “In celebration of National Small Business Week, I wanted to highlight Anfinson Farm Store that has been a staple of the Cushing, Iowa community for a century. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Anfinson Farm Store will be receiving significant tax relief and John Anfinson, the owner, is planning to invest his extra dollars in their most important resource: their employees. The $1,000 bonuses and 5 percent pay increases for all 7 of their full-time employees, along with the $400,000 in new equipment with one-year expensing, is not only helping the business, but the community. I am proud that small businesses like Anfinson Farm Store, and all our small businesses, call Iowa home and wish them continued success in the years ahead.” Anfinson Farm Store has been run by the Anfinson family for about 45 years in Cushing, Iowa. The business started in 1918 as a general store and this year will celebrate 100 years of operation. After passage of the Republican tax plan, the family run business announced bonuses of $1,000 for employees and raised wages five percent for all full-time employees. "Congratulations to Anfinson Farm Store for receiving this recognition," said Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. "Our nation relies on its 30 million small business owners to keep our economy moving forward, and I'm glad we can highlight their individual and collective achievements this week." For over 50 years, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation announcing National Small Business Week, which recognizes the critical contributions of America’s entrepreneurs and small business owners. As part of National Small Business Week, the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship takes the opportunity to highlight the impact of outstanding entrepreneurs, small business owners, and others from all 50 states and U.S. territories. As chairman, Risch honors America’s small businesses and entrepreneurs in the Senate regularly.
04.30.2018	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) penned a bipartisan letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt today outlining the benefits of selling E-15 year round. The letter comes after President Donald Trump delivered remarks earlier this month in support of a year-round waiver for E-15. In their letter, the senators make two specific requests. First, they ask the EPA Administrator to provide an expected timeline for an administrative Reid Vapor Pressure or RVP waiver. Second, they request the agency allow for the sale of E-15 during the upcoming summer driving season in the meantime. A copy of the bipartisan letter to Administrator Pruitt is below. April 30, 2018 The Honorable Scott Pruitt Administrator Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20460 Dear Administrator Pruitt: We write today regarding President Trump’s recent commitment to allow for 15 percent ethanol blends (E15) to be sold year around. We also seek information and a transparent timeline from you on the regulatory pathway forward to address the Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) issue in the wake of the president’s announcement. Collectively, we are long-time supporters of the effort to address the RVP issue and make E15 available year around across the United States. Allowing an open marketplace with more fuel options for consumers encourages competition and drives down consumer fuel costs. Moreover, E15 lowers evaporative and tailpipe emissions when compared to 10 percent ethanol fuel, improving the environment. Resolving this issue also provides a pathway to increase farm income at a time when producers are struggling with a depressed farm economy, low commodity prices, and tight margins. Congress never intended the RVP waiver to effectively be a market cap on the amount of ethanol blended in gasoline. Rather, this provision was intended to provide a pathway for ethanol to grow and thrive in the fuel marketplace when it was passed in 1990. The current interpretation is outdated and has created an untenable regulatory barrier to E15 as a readily available option for motorists. As the fuel marketplace has changed over the past 28 years since the RVP waiver for 10 percent ethanol blends was first approved, this provision needs to change as well. First, we ask you to provide an expected timeline of the rulemaking process to clarify how the agency will make this change to allow higher ethanol blends access to the market place. Additionally, we ask that you provide immediate clarity to allow higher ethanol blends to be sold in the interim while the outdated regulation is being changed. Doing this will fulfill the president’s commitment to allow consumer’s access to these fuels year-round, expand consumer choice, and eliminate confusion at the pump. Should you require any further information, please let us know. We look forward to your timely response. Click here to read the senators’ letter.
04.26.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the United States Senate confirmed Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo to be Secretary of State. Prior to the vote, the Iowa senator delivered remarks from the Senate floor urging her colleagues to join her in supporting Director Pompeo to be our nation’s top diplomat. Watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks here or by clicking on the image below. “Mr. President, “I rise today in support of the President’s nomination of Director Mike Pompeo to serve as Secretary of State. “Director Pompeo has a very long record of public service that has prepared him for this very, very important positon. “Let’s start at the beginning, Director Pompeo was top of his class at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and he served honorably in the United States Army. He is also a graduate of Harvard Law School. “In Congress, Director Pompeo was a leader on issues of national security and foreign relations. “And then finally, and most recently, as Director of the CIA, Director Pompeo has been a successful leader in the world’s best intelligence profession, to work and resolve some of our nation’s most sensitive and difficult problems. “Now I’ve heard on the floor of the Senate here recently a number of my colleagues that have called into question whether he should serve as our nation’s top diplomat. “He served in the military, he has served as Director of the CIA, and what I want to do is go back to the time that he spent at the United States Military Academy at West Point. And what I would like to do is just remind the body that in the military we serve in many missions, but one of them does include diplomacy. “Now as the President of the Senate understands, that as military members, whether you’re a Marine or a soldier, that often times during conflicts, you stand shoulder to shoulder with members of other countries. “You must have an understanding of the cultural affects and the cultural differences between our nations, and you work to resolve problems. “Whether it’s with the indigenous populations or whether it’s within the military ranks, we serve as diplomats. “Now at West Point, I know that Director Pompeo learned this lesson very well. Many of us, whether you go through a military academy or whether you are going through a reserve officer training corps program at a university like I did at Iowa State, you learn about, what we call, the instruments of national power. “And those instruments of national power are called ‘D.I.M.E’. It’s an acronym D-I-M-E. “ ‘D’ stands for diplomacy. We learn that again as members of the military and as officers in our nation’s military. So diplomacy. “The second thing, the ‘I’, is information. The ‘M’, of course, is military and military action. And the ‘E’ stands for economic actions, such as sanctions. “But within the realm of diplomacy, what we are taught is that we work with ambassadors, we work through embassies. We are taught about the realm of negotiations, and treaties, and various policies that affect different nations around the globe. “We’re engaging in international forums. And again working in the defense space, of course, we have many opportunities to engage with leaders from other countries. “Diplomacy, it is the very basis of the instruments of national power that we all learn. “So I know that Director Pompeo in his capacity, whether he was serving at the CIA or way back many years to when he served in the United States Army, quite admirably, and back at the academy when he was first taught those instruments of national power, or D.I.M.E., that he is well-versed in working with many nations in very, very difficult circumstances. “So again, Director Pompeo has a very long record of public service. “Now, Director Pompeo, also has very strong relationships and he values those relationships. “His relationship with Secretary of Defense Mattis will prove invaluable as he works to ensure peace through strength. Additionally, I am confident he will inspire and lead the men and women of our State Department to achieve results for our nation, and those results will be centered around diplomacy. “Director Pompeo understands the threats that we face as a nation every day. “During a time when the threats against the United States continue to grow around the globe, it is important, important, for President Trump to have his full diplomatic and national security team in place. “We must do this. Diplomacy, diplomacy. “Director Pompeo is also the right person to serve as our top diplomat. He will rise to meet the challenges and foster those relationships that we need around the world to keep our nation free, secure, and prosperous. “Again, I will go back to the instruments of national power, D-I-M-E, the first is always diplomacy. Director Pompeo understands that and I’m glad that we as a body will be taking up his confirmation vote today. “I would urge my colleagues to support this eminently qualified man as our next Secretary of State. “Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor and notice the absence of a quorum.”
04.26.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony on the Department of Defense (DoD) budget posture from Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Under Secretary of Defense David Norquist, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford, Jr. At the hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, questioned the witnesses on the DoD’s efforts to ensure our military remains competitive and equipped to combat threats posed by near-peer adversaries, like Russia. Watch Senator Ernst's questioning here or by clicking on the image below. On Countering Russian Aggression: Senator Ernst cited recent reports that the USS Harry Truman Carrier Strike Group will break with tradition and remain in the European theater to counter Russian aggression and asked Secretary Mattis to speak on the need to “make our military less operationally predictable” and “make our adversaries counter us in the multi-domain.” Secretary Mattis pointed to the National Defense Strategy, which now focuses on “large power, great power, competition” and the Secretary’s efforts to make our military strategically reliable, but operationally unpredictable to our adversaries. On Operational Unpredictability: “I think anything we can do to keep our adversaries off-kilter, we need to do that,” stated Senator Ernst. On Expanding the Competitive Space: The Senator pointed to Russia’s success in “competing with the United States below the threshold of actual conflict, in what we call the Gray Zone.” Senator Ernst asked Secretary Mattis to detail what “expanding the competitive space” to counter Russian aggression would look like. Secretary Mattis cited the cyber and space domains as areas of focus and maintaining a hardline on Russia’s acts of aggression. On Combating Russian Threats at Every Level: “We are going to have to able to compete across diplomatic, economic, information, energy lines, and we are engaged in that on a routine basis,” responded Secretary Mattis.

For centuries, our nations have worked as allies to combat global threats, and today, it is no different. As recently demonstrated by the joint strikes against Assad’s regime in Syria, our relationship with the French is vital to national security and global stability, and we are grateful for President Macron’s words before Congress today.”
04.24.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a town meeting in Benton County as part of her 99 county tour to hear from constituents in the area about the issues most important to them.

04.24.2018	WASHINGTON – At today’s Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hearing on The State of Rural America, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue on the agency’s efforts to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and the 88,000 farms across Iowa and 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning here or by clicking on the image below. On Protecting the RFS: Senator Ernst thanked Secretary Perdue for his advocacy and continued support for renewable fuels, but highlighted Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Pruitt’s “actions that are destroying demand for biofuels, moves that will ultimately kill the RFS.” The senator specifically pointed to the “25 or so small refinery hardship waivers” granted by the EPA to some refineries that “are neither small, nor experiencing hardship.” On How Small Refinery Waivers “Demand Destruction” for Biofuels: Senator Ernst asked Secretary Perdue what he will do to “ensure the EPA is not deliberately circumventing the statute and the President’s 15-billion gallon promise to rural America?” The Secretary agreed that the waivers have circumvented the 15-billion gallon obligation, and that while these issues do not fall within his authority, the Secretary cited his efforts to communicate to the Administrator and Administration the concerns raised by farmers and biofuel producers through the “power of persuasion.” On Commitments Made: “And I do appreciate that, and the power of persuasion that we do have, and of course letting the Administration and Administrator Pruitt know how displeased we are in that area, especially when he made the commitment to me specifically to uphold the intent and the letter of the law. And I do believe that he is trying to work his way around that,” responded Senator Ernst. On Support for the Sale of E15 Year-Round: The Senator also recounted the President’s support for the sale of E15 year-round, which would “address refiner concerns over RIN prices, while increasing biofuel demand.” The senator asked Secretary Perdue if he had spoken with Administrator Pruitt regarding the E15 waiver and how to move forward with this effort. Secretary Perdue reiterated his support for the E15 waiver and pledged to continue to push for the President to “make good on that commitment to do that.”
04.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of 66 senators, led by Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), in sending a letter to the President of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, demanding the release of wrongfully imprisoned American Pastor Andrew Brunson. Pastor Brunson has been imprisoned in Turkey since October 7, 2016. Last month, he was indicted on bogus charges related to terrorism and espionage, and faces up to 35 years in prison. In the letter to President Erdogan, the Senators noted that the indictment “is an absurd collection of anonymous accusations, flights of fantasy, and random character assassination…It is an insult not only to an unjustly imprisoned individual, but to the traditions of Turkish jurisprudence.” The senators also warned that measures may be necessary “to ensure that the Government of Turkey respects the right of law-abiding citizens and employees of the United States to travel to, reside in, and work in Turkey without fear of persecution.” Pastor Brunson’s trial began on April 16 in Izmir, Turkey, and was attended by Senator Tillis and Sam Brownback, the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. The Turkish Court postponed the next hearing until May 7, ordering Pastor Brunson to remain in prison. In addition to Senators Ernst, Tillis, and Shaheen, the letter was signed by Senators Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D-DE), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Bob Corker (R-TN), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Dean Heller (R-NV), John Hoeven (R-ND), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Doug Jones (D-AL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), John Kennedy (R-LA), Angus King (I-ME), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), James Lankford (R-OK), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bill Nelson (D-FL), David Perdue (R-GA), Rob Portman (R-OH), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Tina Smith (D-MN), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Jon Tester (D-MT), John Thune (R-ND), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Mark Warner (D-VA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN). The full text of the letter is below, which can also be viewed here. April 20, 2018 Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan President The Republic of Turkey Mr. President, It has now been over a year and a half since Turkish authorities detained Pastor Andrew Brunson, a law-abiding American citizen resident in Turkey since 1993, for alleged involvement in terrorism. Pastor Brunson’s detention and formal arrest followed the Turkish government’s imposition of a State of Emergency after a violent coup attempt in July 2016 rightly opposed by Turks across the political spectrum. The United States has condemned the coup and respects the legitimate efforts of the Turkish government to ensure its perpetrators face justice and the Turkish nation is protected from any repetition of the coup attempt. The Senate supports the ongoing efforts to strengthen law enforcement cooperation between U.S. agencies and their Turkish counterparts, including with regard to investigating alleged participants in the coup plot. However, we are deeply disturbed that the Turkish government has gone beyond legitimate action against the coup plotters to undermine Turkey’s own rule of law and democratic traditions. Under the State of Emergency, tens of thousands of Turkey’s own citizens as well as some citizens of the United States and other countries have been arrested, dismissed from employment or otherwise seen their lives destroyed on vague charges and dubious evidence. These actions by the government of Turkey are inconsistent with the commitment to law and justice that have historically been hallmarks of Turkish democracy. That the Turkish government has consistently ignored bipartisan expressions of concern from the Congress has also been cause for concern. Nonetheless, we chose to respect the working of the Turkish judicial system and await a just outcome. On March 13th, 2018 Turkish authorities issued an indictment alleging and purportedly detailing Pastor Brunson’s offenses. It is an absurd collection of anonymous accusations, flights of fantasy, and random character assassination. It is an insult not only to an unjustly imprisoned individual, but to the traditions of Turkish jurisprudence. That a Turkish court could accept such a document as the basis for prosecution removes any shred of doubt that Andrew Brunson, like other American citizens as well as Turkish employees of the U.S. Government detained under the State of Emergency, is being used as a political pawn by elements of the Turkish government bent on destroying the longstanding partnership between two great nations. Moreover, the suggestion in the indictment that the actions of Pastor Brunson to explain his religious convictions to others was somehow meant to undermine the Turkish state brings a new and deeply disturbing dimension to the case. It should trouble all Turks justly proud of Turkey’s centuries-old tradition of welcoming believers of all faiths. The United States Government, and millions of Americans deeply concerned by the Brunson case, have been patient, in the hope that justice would be done and Pastor Brunson would be reunited with his family. The signatories of this letter have concluded that other measures will be necessary to ensure that the Government of Turkey respects the right of law-abiding citizens and employees of the United States to travel to, reside in, and work in Turkey without fear of persecution. Sincerely,
04.19.2018	**UPDATE** Since the press release was sent, the FARMERS FIRST Act has received additional support from: American Agri-Women National Farmers Union National Young Farmers Coalition WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), a member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, introduced the bipartisan Facilitating Accessible Resources for Mental Health and Encouraging Rural Solutions For Immediate Response to Stressful Times (FARMERS FIRST) Act to provide our nation’s agricultural community with critical mental health support and resources. A 2016 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found agricultural workers have a higher suicide rate than any other occupation. To assist these farmers in crisis, Senators Ernst and Baldwin’s bipartisan legislation would provide seed funding through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to state departments of agriculture, state extension services, and non-profits to establish helplines, provide suicide prevention training for farm advocates, create support groups, and reestablish the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network. In addition to these resources, the bill would establish a Farm and Ranch Stress Assessment Committee to better understand how agricultural workers’ mental health impacts rural development and provide recommendations for addressing mental health care needs within the agriculture community. “Farmers are the backbone of our rural economy and leaders in our rural communities. Washington has been slow to recognize the challenges that farmers are facing and the daily stressors that they experience during difficult years,” said Senator Baldwin. “The FARMERS FIRST Act will make sure that when there is a crisis on the farm, farmers know they are not alone and there are resources available to help them find a path through tough times. This bipartisan reform will provide funding for local resources and expand access to stress reduction strategies and suicide prevention programs that will help tackle this problem and save lives.” “The incredibly high rate of suicide within the agricultural community underscores the urgent need to act to address this crisis,” said Senator Ernst. “We must do more to ensure those who work tirelessly from sunrise to sundown to feed and fuel our world have access to the mental health resources and supports they need. With more than 88,000 farms and over 150,000 farmers in Iowa, our agricultural community is the backbone of our state, I am glad to partner with Senator Baldwin to improve the quality and timeliness of mental health care for the hardworking folks in our agricultural communities.” Additional co-sponsors include Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Cory Gardner (R-CO). The bipartisan FARMERS FIRST Act also has growing support from more than ten agriculture-focused organizations. “Farmers are facing uncertain times and need adequate services to deal with this mounting stress in the industry. The resources provided by Senators Baldwin, Ernst, Moran, and Heitkamp’s FARMERS FIRST Act provide tools farmers need to manage these difficulties, allowing them to connect with all the resources at their disposal. I thank the Senators for introducing this vital legislation,” said National Corn Growers Association Executive Vice President Jon Doggett. “The National Farm Medicine Center shares the goals of FARMERS FIRST Act co-sponsors in wanting to increase access to mental health care for the farm and ranch populations, who are subject to such unpredictable and unfavorable economic and environmental stressors,” said Josie Rudolphi, PhD, National Farm Medicine Center. “The continued slump in milk prices is creating both economic and emotional stress for dairy farmers, which is why we support the continuation of the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) and the FARMERS FIRST Act, sponsored by Senators Baldwin and Ernst. We hope to see it move forward as part of the 2018 Farm Bill,” said Jim Mulhern, National Milk Producers Federation. “For those in rural areas seeking mental health services, they face two giant obstacles: availability and accessibility. In 55% of all American counties, most of which are rural, there is not a single psychologist, psychiatrist or social worker. The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) could help support agricultural workers and their families in rural communities by providing at-home resources for mental health services. As rural communities and economies struggle to come back from the Great Recession, many in the agriculture industry who have experienced little recovery are at higher risk of substance abuse and suicide. We applaud the bipartisan work of our rural health advocates in introducing legislation to provide a key resource for those at risk,” said Jessica Seigel, National Rural Health Association. "With the current situation of farmers working below their cost of production, we are seeing a resurgence of financial and emotional stress and an increasing rate of farmer suicide, similar to the farm crisis of the 1980’s. There is a desperate need for the Federal Government to develop pricing formulas that insure farmers and farm workers have a living wage, since financial stress is the driving force in farmer depression and suicide. Re-establishing the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network can provide help for farmers who are suffering and contemplating suicide as their only way out,” said Jim Goodman, NFFC board president and organic dairy and beef farmer from Wonewoc, WI. “With net farm income cut in half over the last five years, rural stress levels are dangerously high. We cannot afford to lose one more farmer. This bill is a crucial first step to create a strong safety net for America’s family farmers,” said Farm Aid executive director Carolyn Mugar. “We urge Congress to come together and act immediately in a positive and preventative way to get help to the countryside. Farmers and the future of our food depend on it." “Farmers and ranchers are among the hardest-working class of citizens. With net farm income plummeting more than 50 percent in the last six years, the job has become even tougher. The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) is intended to help ranching families in tough times overcome their challenges. The United States Cattlemen’s Association (USCA) thanks Senator Joni Ernst and Senator Tammy Baldwin for supporting U.S. producers. We look forward to working with Congress in the drafting of the upcoming Farm Bill to address the underlying causes contributing to declining farm income and to advance policies that strengthen the bottom lines of U.S. cattle producers,” said Kenny Graner, President, U.S. Cattlemen’s Association. “The Rural & Agriculture Council of America (RACA) appreciates Senators Joni Ernst and Tammy Baldwin making resources available for ranching and farming families who may need it during this period of declining farm income. The Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN) is intended to help rural America overcome tough times. This bill is not a means to an end, but rather, it provides for much needed resources and tools. RACA will continue working with Congress and the Administration to promote policies that bolster the incomes of rural American families,” said Chris Skorupa, Vice President, Rural & Agriculture Council of America. “Last fall, we traveled across Kansas and Iowa to report on the suicide crisis on America’s farms. We are proud supporters of The FARMERS FIRST Act, introduced by Senator Baldwin and her co-sponsors, Senators Ernst, Heitkamp, and Moran. This bi-partisan effort will re-authorize and fund the Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network (FRSAN), which will provide life-saving assistance to America’s farmers and farmworkers. We extend our gratitude to the farmers, family members, and advocates who—from fields, pickup trucks, and around kitchen tables—bravely shared their stories with us,” said Debbie Weingarten and Audra Mulkern, Female Farmer Project. “NASDA applauds the bipartisan introduction of this bill to help individuals deal with the extreme stresses facing agriculture by providing resources for tools like stress hotlines and web services,” said National Association of State Departments of Agriculture CEO Dr. Barbara P. Glenn. “State departments of agriculture are on the front lines with producers helping tackle these issues and the FRSAN will create needed coordination of these efforts.” The FARMERS FIRST Act has been endorsed by: American Soybean Association Female Farmer Project National Association of State Departments of Agriculture National Corn Growers Association National Cotton Council National Family Farm Coalition National Farm Medicine Center National Milk Producers Federation National Rural Health Association Rural and Agricultural Council of America U.S. Cattlemen’s Association Read the full text of the bill here.
04.18.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, Iowa’s U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, along with Congressmen Steve King (IA-04), David Young (IA-03), and Rod Blum (IA-01), sent a letter to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma urging CMS to repeal guidance that hinders states (like Iowa), with failing individual health insurance markets, from applying for waivers to pursue additional, innovative health care coverage options for individuals. The Iowa members stated that “section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows states to waive certain parts of the law to pursue innovative models of health coverage for their citizens.” In 2015, CMS issued guidance to clarify this section, however “this sub-regulatory guidance has hindered, not helped, states’ efforts to design and implement innovative models of health coverage, as evidenced by the Iowa Stopgap Measure which was submitted and then withdrawn in 2017.” Additionally, they pointed to the inflexibility of this guidance as the reason Iowa was forced to withdraw the 1332 waiver it submitted and “without the necessary approval of the waiver request by CMS, Iowa’s individual market has continued to collapse.” And, they urged Administrator Verma to “immediately rescind this guidance so that states like Iowa can truly innovate and bring stability and affordability to their markets.” Read the full letter here or below. April 18, 2018 The Honorable Seema Verma, Administrator Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 7500 Security Boulevard Baltimore, MD 21244 Dear Administrator Verma: Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) allows states to waive certain parts of the law to pursue innovative models of health coverage for their citizens. While states may waive certain parts of the law, states must follow four guardrails which are outlined in the statute. Specifically, section 1332 states that a waiver application will be granted only if: (1) a comparable number of the state's residents will be covered, (2) coverage is at least as affordable, (3) coverage is at least as comprehensive, (4) the plan will not increase the federal deficit as compared to existing law. In 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued guidance that sought to provide clarification for states as they pursued 1332 waivers. In practice, however, this sub-regulatory guidance has hindered, not helped, states’ efforts to design and implement innovative models of health coverage, as evidenced by the Iowa Stopgap Measure which was submitted and then withdrawn in 2017. Iowa decided to withdraw the 1332 waiver because of the inflexibility of this guidance. Unfortunately, without the necessary approval of the waiver request by CMS, Iowa’s individual market has continued to collapse. We urge you to immediately rescind this guidance so that states like Iowa can truly innovate and bring stability and affordability to their markets. It is our belief that CMS has the authority to rescind this guidance. However, should you feel that statutory change is necessary, please indicate what part of the law requires statutory intervention as well as the rationale you have for the need for such a change. Please respond to our offices no later than May 2, 2018. Sincerely, Charles E. Grassley United States Senator Joni K. Ernst United States Senator Steve King Member of Congress David Young Member of Congress Rod L. Blum Member of Congress
04.17.2018	WASHINGTON –Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry, joined Ranking Member Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and fellow Agriculture Committee members U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) to urge the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to review the proposed purchase of National Beef Packing Co. by a Brazilian meat company. “The security, safety, and resiliency of our food system is integral to the overall security of our nation,” wrote the Senators. “In light of recent acquisitions of U.S. food and agriculture companies such as Smithfield by Shuanghui in 2013 and the acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina in 2016, it has become increasingly clear that growing foreign investment in U.S. agriculture requires a thorough review process to safeguard the American food system.“ On April 9, Brazil’s Marfrig Global Foods SA announced its intent to purchase a majority stake in the Missouri-based National Beef Packing Co., which is the fourth largest processor of U.S. beef. The proposed aquisition follows a 2017 corruption scandal in Brazil’s food safety system that revealed unacceptable safety and quality issues with Brazilian beef intended for the American market, including shipments from Marfrig. These issues ultimately resulted in the U.S. completely halting imports of fresh beef from Brazil. The Senators also asked the Treasury Department to include both the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in CFIUS reviews of foreign acquisitions of major U.S. agriculture assets. Despite the growing trend of outside investment in the U.S. food system, the USDA and FDA do not have formal representation on CFIUS. Last year, Grassley and Stabenow introduced the Food Security is National Security Act of 2017 to give top U.S. agriculture and food officials permanent participation in these reviews. The full text of the letter is below. A PDF of the letter is available here. The Honorable Steven Mnuchin Secretary of the Treasury U.S. Department of the Treasury 1500 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20220 Dear Secretary Mnuchin: As members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, we write to you regarding the proposed purchase of a majority stake in National Beef Packing Co. LLC, a beef processing company based in Kansas City, Missouri and the fourth largest beef processor in the United States, by Marfrig Global Foods SA, a Brazilian meat processing and distribution company. The security, safety, and resiliency of our food system is integral to the overall security of our nation. In light of recent acquisitions of U.S. food and agriculture companies such as Smithfield by Shuanghui in 2013 and the acquisition of Syngenta by ChemChina in 2016, it has become increasingly clear that growing foreign investment in U.S. agriculture requires a thorough review process to safeguard the American food system. As such, we respectfully request that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, exercise its authority to review this transaction to assess any potential ramifications the transaction may have on the security and safety of our food supply, and by extension, our nation. Other recent acquisitions of U.S. food and agriculture companies have undergone similar reviews by CFIUS. While this Committee has not reached any conclusions regarding the proposed purchase of National Beef by Marfrig, any foreign acquisition of an important U.S. agricultural asset should be reviewed closely for potential risks to our food system. For instance, we are concerned that this proposed transaction comes following the 2017 corruption scandal in Brazil’s food safety system that revealed unacceptable safety and quality issues with Brazilian beef intended for the American market, including shipments from Marfrig. These issues ultimately resulted in the USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service completely halting imports of fresh beef products from Brazil in June 2017. Additionally, CFIUS does not formally include the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current review process. As USDA and FDA are the primary divisions of the federal government tasked with overseeing our food and agriculture sectors, we ask that you include representation from these departments in reviewing this foreign investment and any other transactions involving critical U.S. agricultural assets. The increasing trend of foreign investment in our food system should be met with careful scrutiny from the relevant experts in order to safeguard the security of our nation's food supply. Thank you for your consideration and your attention to this matter. Sincerely, Debbie Stabenow, Ranking Member Charles E. Grassley, United States Senator Sherrod Brown, United States Senator Joni K. Ernst, United States Senator
04.17.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the bipartisan, bicameral Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Reform held its first open hearing entitled “Opportunities to Significantly Improve the Federal Budget Process.” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the committee and combat veteran, stressed the need for a solution to fix the broken budgeting and appropriations process in Congress, which hamstrings our military and ability to reign in reckless spending. Watch Senator Ernst’s opening statement here or by clicking on the image below. Below are Senator Ernst’s opening remarks: “Thank you, Mr. Co-Chairman. I truly am thrilled to have the opportunity to serve on this committee. “The most fundamental role of Congress – as laid out in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution – is to raise revenue and fund the federal government. “Unfortunately, Congress has consistently failed to execute this responsibility in a timely or an effective manner. “As noted before, since 1974, Congress has only passed all of its appropriations bills 4 times. Over the past 20 years, we’ve passed a budget resolution only 11 times. And since 1999, we are averaging 5 continuing resolutions per year. Five per year. “Unsurprisingly, our dysfunctional process has also yielded dysfunctional outcomes: growing deficits and $21 trillion in debt. “This ineffectiveness is not only bad governance – it is a threat to our national security. Our reliance on continuing resolutions has a devastating effect on our military. “As a result of our continued reliance on CRs, only three of the Army’s 31 Brigade Combat Teams are capable of deploying immediately to conflict. During continuing resolutions, the Army has $400 million less per month in their operating accounts. “Richard Spencer, the Secretary of the Navy, has said that inefficiencies stemming from continuing resolutions have resulted in $4 billion in waste for the Navy since 2011. “Our constituents deserve better than this cycle of governing crisis-to-crisis and I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan manner to put in place reforms to get our budget and appropriations process working again. “Again, I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to spend this time with my colleagues working towards, again, a bipartisan fix to this very devastating situation. “So, again, thank you Mr. Co-Chair and I will yield.”
04.17.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) joined a group of 13 bipartisan senators in a letter led by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt requesting the agency cease issuing so-called “hardship” waivers exempting obligated parties from the Renewable Fuel Standard, provide topline information about the waivers already issued, disclose whether or not the agency redistributed the waived volume obligations among the non-exempted obligated parties and outline the agency’s plan to make the waiver process more transparent. Senators Ernst, Grassley, and Klobuchar were joined by Sens. Debbie Stabenow (R-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). “We are writing to you regarding the actions the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken to undermine commitments President Trump made on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to our constituents,” the senators wrote. “Recent reports indicate dozens of small refiner waivers have been secretly granted to large, multibillion-dollar companies under the guise of the small refinery hardship exemption provision in section 211(o)(9) of the Clean Air Act. This is extremely concerning to us.” In their letter, the senators cited the confirmation hearing testimony of Pruitt, in which he stated, “Any steps that the EPA Administrator takes need to be done in such a way as to further the objectives of Congress in that statute, not undermine the objectives of Congress in that statute.” The senators also noted Pruitt’s October 2017 letter, in which he stated, “I reiterate my commitment to you and your constituents to act consistent with the text and spirit of the RFS. I take seriously my responsibility to do so in an open and transparent manner that advances the full potential of this program…” News reports indicate that EPA has already issued 25 “hardship” waivers to large, multibillion-dollar refining companies making billions of dollars in profits since 2016. The senators state that such action would “represent a clear violation of your commitments and clearly undermine the President’s long-standing support of the RFS.” The senators requested that EPA: Cease issuing any refinery waivers under the RFS; Provide a full list of the refiners that have received a refinery waiver in 2016, 2017 or 2018; Provide a detailed report to Congress describing EPA’s justification for providing the waivers and if the volumes were redistributed to other obligated parties; and Describe EPA’s commitment and plan to consider future small refinery waivers only during the annual RVO rulemaking process and commitment to provide full notice and opportunity for comment on any future small refinery waiver requests. The full text of the senators’ letter can be found here or below. April 12, 2018 The Honorable Scott Pruitt Administrator Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20460 Dear Administrator Pruitt: We are writing to you regarding the actions the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has taken to undermine commitments President Trump made on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to our constituents. Recent reports indicate dozens of small refiner waivers have been secretly granted to large, multi-billion-dollar companies under the guise of the small refinery hardship exemption provision in section 211(o)(9) of the Clean Air Act. This is extremely concerning to us. During your confirmation hearing for the post of Administrator of the EPA, you said, “Any steps that the EPA Administrator takes need to be done in such a way as to further the objectives of Congress in that statute, not undermine the objectives of Congress in that statute.” You also wrote to a number of Senators in October 2017 and said, “I reiterate my commitment to you and your constituents to act consistent with the text and spirit of the RFS. I take seriously my responsibility to do so in an open and transparent manner that advances the full potential of this program…” According to recent reports, the EPA has already issued 25 “disproportionate hardship” waivers to large, multi-billion-dollar refining companies reporting billions of dollars of profits since 2016. Such action would represent a clear violation of your commitments and clearly undermine the President’s long-standing support of the RFS. These waivers fall well outside the bounds of the letter or spirit of this provision in the law, which sought to provide flexibility for the smallest of U.S. refiners, and only in cases of genuine hardship. Worse, EPA’s actions are already hurting biofuel producers and farmers across the United States at a time when farm income is at the lowest levels since 2006 and retaliatory trade measures from China threaten to deepen the crisis. In 2015, 37 Senators wrote to the EPA requesting that the agency issue a strong Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO), citing the RFS’s success in driving economic development, strengthening agriculture markets, and creating hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs in rural communities. Early reports indicate that the small refinery waivers you have granted could effectively cut biofuel demand by 1.5 billion gallons, thus effectively lowering President Trump’s commitment to seeing 15 billion gallons of ethanol blended to 13.5 billion. Additionally, once these select refiners are no longer responsible for complying with these 2016 requirements, they are able to sell excess Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) back into the market, increasing supply and lowering the price. This further reduces incentives for blending, slashing demand for biofuels and feedstocks, and hurting farmers and biofuels companies. These waivers could cripple the market for years to come, holding back homegrown biofuels while creating a windfall profits for large oil refiners -- the exact opposite of this administration’s promise to voters. Perhaps most concerning, these lucrative waivers have reportedly been issued behind closed doors, outside of the public process, while the EPA has simultaneously been working with refineries to pressure President Trump to sign off on a RIN cap that would wreak further havoc on the RFS. We request that you take the following actions immediately: Cease issuing any refinery waivers under the RFS; Provide a full list of the refiners that have received a refinery waiver in 2016, 2017 or 2018, including the name, location, refining capacity, date waiver was issued, and number of gallons waived; Provide a detailed report to Congress within two weeks of receipt of this letter that describes your justification for providing each of these waivers. Specifically, please include whether the volumes were redistributed to other obligated parties. If the volumes were not redistributed, please explain why they were not and the reason EPA decided to undercut the RVOs against the President’s commitment; Respond in writing describing your commitment and plan to consider future small refinery waivers only during the annual RVO rulemaking process and commitment to provide full notice and opportunity for comment on any future small refinery waiver requests. We appreciate your timely response to these matters. Sincerely, Charles E. Grassley Amy Klobuchar Joni K. Ernst Debbie Stabenow Deb Fischer Richard J. Durbin John Thune Tina Smith Roy Blunt Claire McCaskill Tammy Duckworth Heidi Heitkamp Joe Donnelly
04.13.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a combat veteran, issued the following statement on the Trump administration’s decision to strike against Syria following Syria’s use of chemical weapons: “Tonight, the United States and our allies executed a strong and unified response to the Assad regime’s recent attacks, making clear that their horrific crimes and use of chemical weapons against their own people will not be tolerated. The evidence produced is indisputable: Bashar al-Assad is a war criminal, and he will be held accountable for his actions. “Russia and Iran are complicit in these chemical weapons attacks on innocent populations. The Trump administration has shown decisive and precise global leadership. We must remain unified with our allies to put a stop to these continued attacks on the Syrian people once and for all.”
04.12.2018	Pruitt’s EPA Again Admits RFS Compliance Doesn’t Hurt Small Refiners Secret EPA ‘Hardship’ Waivers for Multibillion Dollar Oil Companies Threaten to Break Trump Pledge to Support Biofuels WASHINGTON – In response to a January letter sent by Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Thune (R-S.D.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), EPA again confirmed that oil refiners aren’t negatively impacted by compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), stating that it stood by its previous conclusion that “all obligated parties, including merchant refiners, are generally able to recover the cost of the RINs they need for compliance with the RFS obligations through the cost of the gasoline and diesel fuel they produce.” Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits were created as a voluntary alternative compliance mechanism for refineries that choose not to blend biofuels as required by law since 2006. In its response, EPA also reiterated that the agency led by Administrator Pruitt “was not persuaded by arguments that merchant refiners are put at a distinct disadvantage when compared to integrated refiners.” Grassley, Thune, Blunt, Fischer and Ernst issued the following joint statement regarding the response letter from EPA, as well as further reports of EPA receiving applications for and in many cases granting “hardship” waivers meant for “small refiners” to multibillion dollar oil refining corporations. “EPA’s response to our letter should put to bed any argument that the Renewable Fuel Standard is hurting small refiners. Every time Administrator Pruitt says that the Renewable Fuel Standard needs to be reformed, he’s arguing against his own EPA. All along, this has been nothing more than an attempt to expand market share by killing the Renewable Fuel Standard. “Since EPA has concluded RIN credit prices aren’t hurting refiners, it makes no sense for the Administration to consider a cap or a waiver for the credits, which would devastate the farm economy and destroy the jobs of thousands of biofuels workers. Unfortunately, EPA’s push for a RIN cap or waiver is only one part of a broader attack on the Renewable Fuel Standard. “Recent reports of EPA granting ‘hardship’ waivers meant for ‘small refiners’ to multibillion dollar oil refining corporations raise an embarrassing question. Is it the Administration’s position that companies making billions of dollars in profits are experiencing hardship? “The problem with these secret waivers is that we have no way of knowing the justification. EPA is hiding behind poor excuses about proprietary business information to shield big oil companies from public scrutiny. Topline information about the companies that received the waivers and why they were granted should be publicly available. This looks like just another backdoor attempt by Administrator Pruitt to destroy the Renewable Fuel Standard and circumvent congressional intent. “It appears these waivers are being issued retroactively, effectively gutting the overall renewable volume obligations assigned to refiners. If these waivers weren’t approved by the White House, that means Administrator Pruitt is going behind President Trump’s back to break the president’s repeated pledge to support a 15 billion gallon annual volume obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard. “It’s not only unfair to refiners who follow the law of the land, but to all the farmers and biofuels workers across the country who are counting on President Trump to keep his word. These waivers aren’t getting too much attention nationally, but the farmers we talk to in our home states are upset with EPA about this issue. “President Trump’s announcement that he will direct EPA to allow the sale of E15 year-round is welcome news, but EPA’s practice of giving away secret hardship waivers to the country’s biggest oil refining companies needs to stop.” In a Senate Appropriations agriculture subcommittee hearing on April 11, USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue told Blunt he agrees with concerns outlined in an April 9 letter from the senators to President Trump that EPA is misusing secret “hardship” waivers to exempt some of the country’s largest oil refining corporations from complying with the Renewable Fuel Standard. “I concur with your opinion,” Perdue said. “As you know, we have a statutory volume of 15 billion gallons, and those waivers reduce that gallon for gallon…That is demand destruction.”
04.12.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, issued the following statement after her meeting at the White House to discuss the importance of our agricultural economy: “We had a productive meeting today with President Trump and Secretary Perdue to discuss ways to support our agriculture industry and help secure greater certainty for our farmers. “In light of the growing concerns I’ve heard from Iowans regarding tariffs, I immediately brought up the importance of renegotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Iowa farmers aren’t looking for another subsidy program, rather they want new and improved market access, which is critical to rural economies. I’m so pleased that the President asked his administration to reengage in these discussions with other TPP countries, and is continuing his work to negotiate a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) deal. There is a growing demand for U.S. agricultural products around the world, and American farmers and manufacturers should be able to compete in these markets. “Additionally, I was glad to hear the President support the sale of E15 year round. My colleagues and I previously offered legislation to break down the barriers that have impeded retailers and consumers from accessing E15 during the summer months, ultimately lowering the cost at the pump for folks across the country. “Moreover, we must continue pursuing policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reducing our access to foreign markets. I remain committed to working with the Trump administration toward a stronger trade agenda on behalf of Iowans.”
04.11.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, held a subcommittee hearing entitled “United States Special Operations Command’s Efforts to Transform the Force for Future Security Challenges.” The Chairman heard from Lt. General Kenneth E. Tovo, USA, Commanding General, U.S. Army Special Operations Command; Lt. General Marshall B. Webb, USAF, Commander, U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command; Rear Admiral Timothy G. Szymanski, USN, Commander, Naval Special Warfare Command; Major General Carl E. Mundy III, USMC, Commander, Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command; and Lt. General Scott A. Howell, Vice Commander, Headquarters U.S. Special Operations Command, on the current capabilities and readiness of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). Chairman Ernst opened the hearing by highlighting how the “National Defense strategy re-oriented the way the Department of Defense prioritizes its efforts in an increasingly complex and dangerous global security environment.” The Chairman cited a “rising China and an increasingly belligerent Russia” among other adversaries as the Department’s new top priorities along with maintaining a hardline on counterterrorism efforts. Watch Chairman Ernst’s opening statement here or by clicking on the image below. The Chairman asked the commanders to describe the most pressing capability gaps within their respective components, or between the components within USSOCOM, that could impact their ability to effectively implement the National Defense Strategy. The commanders identified lack of training time, air systems advancements, interoperability between the components, and gaining the necessary personnel as challenges they currently face. Watch Chairman Ernst’s first round of questions and the commander’s responses here or by clicking on the image below. Chairman Ernst also asked the commanders to share their experiences with the Preservation of the Family and Force (POTFF) program, which provides mental health care services, special gyms, personalized training, and civilian transitional services to meet the unique needs of our USSOCOM service members and their families. The commanders agreed with the Chairman that this important program has proven invaluable for their operators.

04.11.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), introduced the Access to Increased Drug Disposal (AIDD) Act of 2018. The bipartisan AIDD Act is legislation designed to increase participation in the federal prescription drug take-back programs to help combat prescription drug abuse and the growing opioid epidemic. The Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010, allowed the Drug Enforcement Agency to authorize retail pharmacies and other entities licensed to handle controlled substances to collect unused prescription drugs from the public and dispose of them. This arrangement is commonly referred to as a drug take-back program. However, following a study into drug take-back programs requested by Senators Ernst and Grassley, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found low voluntary participation among pharmacies due to high costs and confusion over compliance with federal regulations. The AIDD Act would address the cost of participation by creating a demonstration program allowing five states to apply for grant funding from the Department of Justice. The selected states would then issue a report detailing how the grant funding was administered, which entities received funding, and how it impacted participation rates – providing additional insight into how best to improve the program and increase participation nationwide. “Last year, over 200 opioid-related deaths were reported in Iowa alone, a tragic 12 percent increase from 2016,” said Senator Ernst. “As communities across Iowa and the nation are struggling to combat the ever-worsening opioid epidemic, we cannot let burdensome costs discourage voluntary participation in a program of such critical and timely importance. The bipartisan AIDD Act is a meaningful step toward improving participation in drug take back programs and part of an all-of-the above strategy for protecting Americans from this crisis.” “From rural America to the coasts and everywhere in between, the opioid epidemic ruins lives, families and entire communities,” said Senator Grassley. “There’s no quick fix that will solve the problem overnight, but critical preventive measures like take-back programs can go a long way to help stem the progression and spread of addiction,” said Grassley. “Nearly half of people who report misusing prescription drugs say they got them from a friend or family member’s medicine cabinet. Take-back programs can help stop this, but the federal government needs to step up. By providing grants to alleviate this financial burden, the bipartisan Access to Increased Drug Disposal Act encourages program participation and advances the national fight against opioid addiction.” “This commonsense, bipartisan measure will support efforts to remove unused and unwanted drugs from medicine cabinets before they do unexpected harm,” said Senator Blumenthal. “The diversion of prescription drugs from licensed distributors like pharmacies to the illegal drug trade has led millions of Americans down the path of addiction and death. Despite this troubling trend, only three percent of pharmacies and other eligible entities participate in critical drug take-back programs. Our bill will incentivize licensed distributors to participate in these proven programs.” The AIDD Act is supported by the American Pharmacy Association, Iowa Pharmacy Association, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores, and the National Community Pharmacists Association.
04.04.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, issued the following statement on the Trump administration’s decision to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border. “As a former National Guardsman and Chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee with jurisdiction over our nation’s homeland defense efforts, I support the President’s decision to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border, just as former presidents have done. The National Guard represents some of the best men and women we have, equipped and trained to tackle these challenges and assist the U.S. Border Patrol. “The reality is, the border remains unsecured – meaning that drugs and crime continue to flow into the United States while illegal immigration and human trafficking flourish. We must act. “Earlier this year, I co-sponsored the Secure and Succeed Act to implement the President’s framework for immigration and border security—and most importantly put into place the necessary resources and policies to secure our border to keep Americans safe. This legislation also provided a path forward for our DACA recipients which I have said time and again is greatly needed. Unfortunately, the Senate hasn’t gotten enough votes to move forward, and has left a gaping hole in the security of our border. “The security of our borders is fundamental to our nation’s security. Given the lack of action, the President’s decision represents an immediate, commonsense step towards protecting Americans. President Trump understands how these additional assets can be helpful until Washington can move forward with a border security solution that will protect our families and communities.”
04.04.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, issued the following statement regarding the promise of retaliatory tariffs by the Chinese government in anticipation of U.S. tariffs on technology-related products: “Soybean farmers are perhaps the most vulnerable to Chinese retaliation as nearly one in every three rows of soybeans grown in the U.S. is exported to China – valued at $14 billion every year. Already, soybean prices have dropped dramatically since China’s promise to slap a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans, among other commodities and goods. Although China has a growing appetite for American agricultural products, its plan to retaliate on soy, beef and pork will have a damaging effect on Iowa’s farmers and the state’s economy. “There is a real danger that increased tariffs on U.S. exports will harm Iowa producers and undermine the rural economy. The administration’s action could hurt global supply chains and may lead to higher consumer prices. Hardworking Iowans and American farmers and ranchers are already struggling to make ends meet. “I recognize the complex threats we face when protecting our nation’s intellectual property both for our economy and security. As the President’s National Security and National Defense Strategies state, strengthening our relationships abroad and fostering new strategic partnerships are critical to protecting U.S. national security and interests. “The President is right to increase pressure on China to change its ways. At the same time, the U.S. should foster more dialogue to expand international market opportunities for U.S. goods and agriculture around the globe and use these contributions to reduce the trade deficit. “It’s my hope that the Trump administration will reconsider these tariffs and pursue policies that enhance our competitiveness, rather than reduce our access to foreign markets. The administration must pursue trade policies that make the U.S. a partner of choice for nations that may otherwise turn to less free and democratic nations for trade. I spoke with the President today directly about these issues and look forward to weighing in on these concerns as the administration enters the public comment phase for their proposed tariffs.”
03.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will host a U.S. Service Academy Open House for Iowa students interested in applying to, or learning more about service academies. Academy representatives from the nation’s five service academies will be available to answer questions on the application and nomination process. Each year, Senator Ernst has the honor and responsibility of nominating Iowa students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. However, she cannot nominate students to the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, as a congressional nomination is not needed to apply. “I am thrilled to provide the opportunity for Iowa students to visit with service academy representatives and learn more about serving our great nation and the process of applying to one of our nation’s finest institutions of higher learning,” said Senator Ernst. “I hope Iowans who are interested in attending a service academy and want to learn more will join me for my U.S. Service Academy Open House in Cedar Rapids on April 30th.” This event is open to the public. Details are as follows: Monday, April 30, 2018 5:00 PM CT – 7:00 PM CT Cedar Rapids Public Library Beems Auditorium 450 5th Avenue SE Cedar Rapids, IA Participants: U.S. Senator Joni Ernst U.S. Air Force Academy Representative U.S. Merchant Marine Academy Representative U.S. Military Academy Representative U.S. Naval Academy Representative U.S. Coast Guard Academy Representative Members of the public interested in attending should RSVP to Brenda Safranski at Brenda_Safranski@ernst.senate.gov.

03.28.2018	WASHINGTON—All twenty-two Democratic and Republican women of the U.S. Senate today called on Senate leadership to bring legislation that would update and strengthen the procedures available to survivors of all forms of sexual harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces before the full Senate. The House of Representatives passed bipartisan legislation in February aimed at preventing sexual harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces and helping the survivors of these acts seek justice. A recent survey found that four out of ten women congressional staffers believe that sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill and one out of six women in the same survey responded that they have been the survivors of sexual harassment. “Everyone deserves to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination,” the senators wrote. “Survivors who have bravely come forward to share their stories have brought to light just how widespread harassment and discrimination continue to be throughout Capitol Hill. No longer can we allow the perpetrators of these crimes to hide behind a 23-year-old law. It’s time to rewrite the Congressional Accountability Act and update the process through which survivors seek justice.” The bipartisan letter to Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) led by U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Patty Murray (D-WA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). It was also signed by Ranking Members Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), as well as Members of the Rules Committee Working Group Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-NV). Signers also included Joni Ernst (R-IA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Tina Smith (D-MN), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Maggie Hassan (D-NH). The full text of the letter is below: Dear Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer: We write to express our deep disappointment that the Senate has failed to enact meaningful reforms to the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995. We urge you to bring before the full Senate legislation that would update and strengthen the procedures available to survivors of sexual harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces. Everyone deserves to work in an environment free from harassment and discrimination. In November, with your leadership, the Senate took an important first step in the effort to end harassment and discrimination in congressional workplaces with the passage of S. Res. 330, which requires anti-harassment and discrimination training for all Senators and staff at least once each Congress. While this training requirement was a significant step to address workplace harassment, there was broad, bipartisan agreement at that time that more had to be done to support survivors. Although the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA) implemented meaningful reforms when it became law in 1995, it continues to require survivors to endure an antiquated dispute resolution process, including a month-long counseling session, forced mediation and a 30-day “cooling off” period before a victim can make a decision whether to pursue justice in a courtroom or continue with administrative procedures. The time has come to rewrite the CAA to provide a more equitable process that supports survivors of harassment and discrimination. The Senate’s inaction stands in stark contrast to the bipartisan effort in the House of Representatives that led to the passage of bipartisan CAA reform legislation in February. The House bill includes a number of important provisions, such as eliminating waiting periods before a victim can take their case to court, increased transparency for awards and settlements, and a requirement that Members of the Senate and House pay for an award or settlement stemming from a case of sexual harassment or discrimination that they personally commit. When the Senate considers CAA reform legislation, we will also have the ability to address an inequity that now exists between House and Senate staff. The House of Representatives passed H. Res. 724 that provides House staff who are survivors of harassment or discrimination access to free legal representation. Senate staff who face similar harassment or discrimination must pay personally for legal representation or represent themselves through complicated legal proceedings. Therefore, the Senate must act quickly to provide Senate staff with the same resources as their House colleagues. Inaction is unacceptable when a survey shows that four out of 10 women congressional staffers believe that sexual harassment is a problem on Capitol Hill and one out of six women in the same survey responded that they have been the survivors of sexual harassment. Survivors who have bravely come forward to share their stories have brought to light just how widespread harassment and discrimination continue to be throughout Capitol Hill. No longer can we allow the perpetrators of these crimes to hide behind a 23-year-old law. It’s time to rewrite the Congressional Accountability Act and update the process through which survivors seek justice. Sincerely,
03.28.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry today issued the following statement on the Trump administration’s announcement regarding the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS): “I’m pleased to see that the Trump administration maintained the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement. KORUS is critical to both the U.S. and Korea as over $144 billion in goods and services moved between us in 2016. Korea is one of our top trading partners, representing our 7th largest goods export market. Continuing this agreement is mutually beneficial. “An updated KORUS will ensure American farmers and ranchers are able to continue enjoying important trade access to South Korea. At a time when farmers are already struggling with historically low commodity prices and declining farm income, I encourage the administration to engage countries and work to advance international market opportunities for agricultural products moving forward.” Last September, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the Trump administration urging the President to maintain the trade agreement with South Korea.

03.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Strategic Withdrawal of Agencies for Meaningful Placement (SWAMP) Act, legislation that would move the headquarters of federal agencies outside of the immediate Washington, D.C. area, and establishes a competitive bidding process that allows states, cities, and towns across the country to compete to be an agency’s new home. This legislation is the Senate companion to H.R.4863, which was introduced by Congressman Luke Messer (IN-06). Currently, the headquarters of nearly all executive branch agencies are clustered in and around Washington, D.C., concentrating hundreds of thousands of jobs in the region. The SWAMP Act aims to distribute agency headquarters over geographically diverse areas and among the people most impacted by the effects of agency decisions. This legislation will help to ensure agencies focus on the stakeholders, and not on bureaucracy within the D.C. beltway while also bringing good, stable government jobs to new parts of the country. “Every day, out-of-touch federal government agencies and bureaucrats in Washington D.C. make important decisions and rules that directly impact the lives of folks across the United States,” said Senator Ernst. “As we saw with the Waters of the U.S. Rule issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers, these decisions are often nonsensical or, in this case, have harmful impacts on the people these agencies serve. The SWAMP Act seeks to get the federal government outside of the Washington beltway, so these federal agencies can see and hear first-hand the impact their policies have on the folks who know their states, businesses, and needs the best.” "With the election of President Trump, the American people sent a strong message that they wanted a government that better serves them, not Washington bureaucrats,” said Congressman Messer. “There’s no reason why the Department of Agriculture has to be in the District of Columbia when it could be located in Indiana, Iowa or another heartland state. Our legislation would help deliver on President Trump’s promise to drain the swamp and at the same time allow more communities across the United States to benefit from added jobs and increased economic growth. I appreciate Senator Ernst’s efforts on this issue as we work to deliver a better, more effective government for all Americans.” The SWAMP ACT: Repeals the section of the U.S. Code that requires federal agencies and departments to be located in Washington, D.C. Prohibits agencies currently headquartered in the Washington. D.C. area from entering into new lease agreements, making significant renovations to their existing locations, or beginning construction on new facilities in the area. Exempts the Executive Office of the President, the Department of Defense, and all other national security-related agencies that must be in close proximity to Congress and the White House. Establishes a competitive bidding process to allow states and municipalities to compete for the relocated headquarters. Read the full text of the SWAMP Act here.
03.21.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act to ensure those who serve as political appointees at federal agencies cannot “burrow” into the bureaucracy by transitioning their temporary positions into life-long career roles. A political appointee is an employee who is hired by the sitting administration to help achieve the administration’s established policy goals. While most political employees leave federal service at the end of the administration, some try to convert into career employees, typically targeting high paying, senior level jobs. This practice is known as “burrowing” and can unfairly allow a political appointee to use his/her political position and influence to jump in front of other qualified and deserving career employees. According to a 2017 study by the Government Accountability Office, 467 political appointees became career employees between 1998 and 2016. “The bipartisan Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act works to end ‘burrowing’ and enact commonsense restrictions on this Washington-insider practice,” said Senator Ernst. "The American people do not need appointees from past administrations, who have become entrenched in the Washington bureaucracy, wielding their influence and clogging the gears of the federal agencies trying to serve our country. While political appointees do play a vital role in achieving the policy goals of an administration, they should not be allowed to immediately become career employees when their administration leaves town.” The Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act: Prohibits political appointees from employment in a career or life-time civil service role for two years after leaving the administration. Requires any political appointee within the last five years seeking a career position to observe the two year “cooling off” period. Requires the head of a government agency to submit a written request to the Office of Personnel Management if they are seeking to hire a former political appointee to a career position following the two year period. The agency head must then prove that the hire was necessary for the agency to meet its mission. Read the bill text of the Political Appointee Burrowing Prevention Act here.
03.21.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today applauded Senate passage of H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act. This legislation clears the way for victims and states' attorneys general to sue internet companies that enable sex trafficking. “Human trafficking is a horrendous crime that has no place in a civil society,” said Senator Ernst. “We simply cannot allow the dark corners of the internet to continue harboring this illicit activity. The passage of the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act is an overdue step in the right direction to hold those who have facilitated such shameful human markets accountable.” Senator Ernst is a co-sponsor of similar legislation known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA).
03.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, sent a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Attorney General Jeff Sessions following recent and troubling reports citing nearly 600 cases of juvenile sexual assault involving children of military families attending schools operated by the Department of Defense (DOD). In a letter to Secretary Mattis, Ernst, a combat veteran, requested information on the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) schools’ efforts to protect students from sexual violence. Additionally, in a letter to Attorney General Sessions, Ernst asked about the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) role in pursuing these cases to hold offenders accountable. The Iowa Senator also stated in her letter to Secretary Mattis that she was “troubled by these reports, not only because they involve claims of sexual assault involving juveniles, but also because they undermine the special trust placed in Department-operated schools by the military families who rely on these schools to provide a safe educational environment for their children.” Senator Ernst asked the DOD to provide answers to her questions concerning how many incidents of sexual assault have been reported, how many allegations were investigated, what services were made available to victims, and what structure is in place to report and respond to incidents of sexual assault at its schools. In her letter to Attorney General Sessions, Senator Ernst cited a recent report that alleges “when cases are forwarded to federal authorities, they are rarely prosecuted”, continuing that while “many factors contribute to the decision as to how a case should be handled by prosecutors, I am nevertheless concerned that there is insufficient attention given to cases involving children attending schools operated by the Department of Defense.” Senator Ernst questioned the Attorney General on the DOJ’s procedure for handling these cases and how many cases have been pursued by the department since 2007. Read the full text of Senator Ernst’s letter to Secretary Mattis here, and her letter to Attorney General Sessions here.
03.19.2018	WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI), Ranking Member of the Federal Spending Oversight and Emergency Management Subcommittee, and Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Mick Mulvaney seeking clarity on Trump Administration officials’ compliance with federal travel spending policies. The letter follows recent media reports and official investigations of excessive travel expenditures using taxpayer funds among high-ranking officials at several federal agencies. “It is our duty to provide oversight and ensure that taxpayer money is spent responsibly, without waste, fraud, or abuse,” wrote the Senators. “We owe it to the American people to ensure with the utmost vigilance that tax dollars are being spent appropriately.” Inspectors General for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of Treasury, Department of the Interior and Department of Veterans Affairs have opened investigations into travel expenses incurred by agency leaders. Federal Travel Regulations (FTR) require that all federal agencies make travel arrangements in the most cost-effective manner, and that federal employees, including Cabinet appointees, travel by “common carrier,” such as a commercial airline, whenever possible. The letter requests information from OMB on oversight practices and travel spending policies to ensure taxpayer dollars are being used responsibly and effectively when paying for official government travel. The full text of the letter if copied below and available here: March 19, 2018 The Honorable Mick Mulvaney Director Office of Management and Budget 725 17th Street, NW Washington, DC 20503 Dear Mr. Mulvaney: We are writing to gain a better understanding of how Administration policy regarding travel of executive branch officials has been enforced and overseen following the issuance of the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) travel memorandum on September 29, 2017. Given recent media reports of Cabinet members incurring excessive expenses in their taxpayer-funded travel, it appears that there could be a continued lack of compliance with both the Federal Travel Regulation (FTR) and Administration policy. The Inspectors General for the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Veterans Affairs have investigated or are currently investigating the travel expenses and practices of their highest-ranking officials. In order for Congress to better understand the current state of compliance with federal statutes and regulations, we respectfully ask for answers to the following questions on or before April 6, 2018: How has OMB increased its oversight of Cabinet-level travel since the publication of the September 29, 2017 memorandum? Has OMB promulgated any policies, circulars, memoranda, or other guidance since September 29, 2017, regarding official travel by members of the Cabinet? If so, please provide a copy of each of these documents. Has OMB reviewed guidance pertaining to the use of government-owned, rented, leased, and charted aircraft? If so, what were the results of that review? What changes, if any, were made to existing controls? Has the White House Chief of Staff developed a process by which to approve all travel on Government-owned, rented, leased, or chartered aircraft in cases that are not exempt from situations defined in Circular A-126 or for non-full-time required use travelers? Please provide an accounting of all travel approved by the White House Chief of Staff since September 29, 2017. Some Cabinet-level officials have reportedly been uncooperative in providing information necessary for the Inspectors General to thoroughly investigate agency travel expenses and practices. Has OMB provided any formal or informal guidance to any agency with respect to agency participation in IG travel inquiries? If so, please provide a copy of the guidance. It is our duty to provide oversight and ensure that taxpayer money is spent responsibly, without waste, fraud, or abuse. As you have said yourself about past issues with Administration travel, “just because something is legal doesn’t make it right.” We owe it to the American people to ensure with the utmost vigilance that tax dollars are being spent appropriately. We thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
03.16.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Congresswoman Ann Wagner (MO-2) led 28 of their colleagues in a letter to United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, urging the United States Mission to the United Nations (USUN) to ensure this Administration’s commitment to pro-life values is upheld in all international negotiations. The members applauded President Trump’s executive action to protect life through enacting the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance plan (PLGHA), and called on Ambassador Haley’s team to “fight to keep sexual and reproductive health terms out of international agreements”, and instead replace these terms “with explicit health programming items, such as maternal health and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention.” In closing, the members pledged to Ambassador Haley their “support and assistance in promoting a U.S. foreign policy that protects the lives of the most vulnerable.” Read the full text of the letter here.
03.15.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with fellow members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, including Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Bob Casey (D-PA), today introduced the Give Our Resources the Opportunity to Work (GROW) Act of 2018. This bipartisan legislation refocuses conservation spending on marginal cropland to benefit soil health, water quality and wildlife habitat, while protecting rural economies and ensuring greater farmland access for beginning young farmers and ranchers. “As I travel across Iowa each year, I hear concerns from producers about how the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has strayed from its congressional intent of targeting and removing environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production,” said Senator Ernst. “Rather, large parcels, sometimes whole farms, of productive farmland are being enrolled into CRP as a result of low commodity prices and high yearly rental payments. As a result, many beginning young farmers are having difficulty accessing farmable acres, which is hampering our efforts to engage the next generation. By revising and strengthening the current provisions of CRP, the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP) and Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), the GROW Act will restore the intent of these programs while helping farmers and ranchers protect soil and water resources.” “This bipartisan bill is good for farmers, it’s good for taxpayers, and it’s good for water quality and the environment,” said Senator Brown. “Conservation of America’s natural resources is critical for successful farming operations, increased agricultural productivity and quality food and energy production,” said Senator Grassley. “Healthier farmland equals a healthier America. The next Farm Bill must address preserving our soil and water and ensure that farm programs accomplish the goals we give them. I’m happy to join this effort by Senator Ernst to make sure we spend our conservation dollars in the most efficient way to maximize the goals of programs like CRP while minimizing distortions in land markets.” “The next Farm Bill must focus our limited conservation dollars on the most environmentally sensitive lands, help farmers and ranchers achieve better soil health and water quality and improve access to land and USDA resources for young and beginning farmers,” said Senator Casey. “This bill does just that. I’m pleased to join with my colleagues from Iowa and Ohio on a bipartisan bill that will strengthen the farm economy while improving the health of the environment.” Specifically, the GROW Act: Makes most prime farmland and class I, II, III land ineligible for CRP enrollment Maintains CRP right-sized at 24 million acres and precludes whole farm enrollment into the program. Levels the playing field for beginning farmers looking to access farmland by limiting general sign-up CRP rental rates. Protects rural economies by reforming how much county cropland can be enrolled in CRP. Establishes a new CLEAR (Clean Lakes, Estuaries, and Rivers) option within continuous CRP (CCRP) to better promote water quality. Maintains annual enrollment for CSP and funding for EQIP. Directs USDA to submit a report on land access, tenure and transition. The full text of the GROW Act can be found here.

03.12.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Jon Tester (D-MT) and Johnny Isakson (R-GA), introduced the bipartisan Credentialing, Educating, and Relevant Training Initiative for Your Heroes (CERTIFY Heroes) Act, which allows eligible servicemembers to use tuition assistance for licensing, credentialing, and certification programs by entities other than institutions of higher education. “Our servicemembers face unique challenges as they transition to civilian life and begin looking for work,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “Across Iowa, many of the in-demand and skills-based jobs don’t require a four-year degree, but adequate training and certification is essential. The CERTIFY Heroes Act would allow our servicemembers to use their military tuition assistance toward job training or certification programs to better ensure a smooth transition from the military to civilian life, and put them on a career path towards long-term, sustainable success.” “Investing in the future of our servicemen and women is a no brainer,” said Tester, Ranking Member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “The folks who serve our nation in uniform develop unique and specialized skillsets over the course of their military careers. Our bill helps give them more flexibility to get the training and certification they need to put their skills to work as civilians.” “The jobs of the 21st century evolve quickly, and today’s workers never stop learning,” said Senator Isakson, Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee. “This commonsense measure will help our servicemembers transition more smoothly to civilian life and ensure they have the training they need to be successful in their next career, including careers that require certification other than a four-year degree. We’re committed to helping our servicemembers succeed at every stage – on active-duty, in the reserves or as a veteran.” Bipartisan companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representatives Steve Womack (AR-03), John Carter (TX-31), Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05), Steve Russell (OK-5), and Sanford Bishop (GA-02). Read the bill text for the CERTIFY Heroes Act here.
03.09.2018	WASHINGTON, DC – The nonpartisan Government Accountability Office released an extensive report that details the amount of federal tax dollars spent from 2013-2015 by three abortion providers including Planned Parenthood Federation of American (PPFA), Marie Stopes International (MSI), and International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). The report was requested by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), and more than 120 Members of the Senate and House in 2016. In addition to $1.2 billion in Medicaid reimbursements from 2013-2015, GAO reported PPFA spent $288 million in federal funds. The largest amount granted was $170 million from Title X programs, followed by $21 million from Title V Maternal Child Health Services block grants, and $18 million from Teen Pregnancy Prevention program. USAID also dispersed $14 million and $110 million to IPPF and MSI, respectively. Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) offer a wider variety of health services than PPFA and its affiliates. In the two years documented by this study, FQHCs served 25 million individuals compared to 2.4 million individuals at Planned Parenthood. The co-chairs of the Senate Values Action Team (VAT) issued the following statements in response to the report: “This GAO report sheds light on the outrageous amount of money tax-payers are forced to pour into clinics that provide abortions in the United States and around the world,” said Lankford. “Regardless of our differences of opinion on when life begins, I hope we can all agree that no taxpayer should be forced to fund some of the world’s largest abortion providers with their hard-earned tax dollars. Every human life has dignity from conception to natural death. We should use tax dollars to support FQHCs which provide necessary health care to protect all lives.” “This report once again illustrates the absurd amount of taxpayer dollars funding the nation’s single largest provider of abortion services, Planned Parenthood, and its international affiliate organizations,” said Ernst. “More than $1.5 billion in tax payer’s dollars should not go to an organization with such blatant disrespect for human life. That is why I introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect those dollars to federally qualified health centers that provide actual comprehensive care and family planning services for women. We have made great strides to protect life under the Trump administration, but there is more work to be done, and we remain committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society.” “For more than 40 years, the health care funding appropriated by Congress has carried Hyde Amendment protections, owing to the recognition that no American should be forced to fund abortions,” Blunt said. “I will continue supporting efforts in Congress to redirect these funds to community health centers. There are 16 community health centers for every Planned Parenthood location, and they offer more health care services for women.” “The GAO report shows once again that Americans are forced to send billions of their hard-earned dollars to a business that was caught on camera agreeing to traffic in baby body parts,” said Daines. “This is a tragic example of government’s lack of accountability and abuse of taxpayer dollars.” VAT is dedicated to advancing pro-life and pro-family policies in Congress. Lankford, Ernst, Blunt, and Daines were original co-sponsors of the Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act, which would redirect taxpayer funds from Planned Parenthood and its affiliates to other eligible women’s health care providers that do not perform abortions, and the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which prohibits funding for abortion.
03.08.2018	Washington, D.C. – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Congressmen Diane Black (R-TN-06), Pete Olson (R-TX-22) and Chris Smith (R-NJ-04), responded to the release of the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report on the taxpayer funding levels of three abortion providers: Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA), Marie Stopes International (MSI), and International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF). The study, led by Senator Ernst and Congressmen Black and Olson, was requested by more than 120 Members of the House and Senate. GAO found that these three organizations spent $410 million in federal funding between 2013 and 2015, and received $1.2 billion combined federal and state funds under federal health programs that require shared funding. In short, more than $1.5 billion in tax dollars went to abortion providers over a three-year period. GAO found that four of the five Planned Parenthood affiliates spending the largest amount of funds from federal programs during this period were later subject to referrals to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for possible criminal misconduct regarding fetal tissue transfer. The DOJ confirmed that an investigation is ongoing. Senator Ernst and Congressmen Black, Olson, and Smith issued the following statements on GAO’s report findings: “This report once again illustrates the absurd amount of taxpayer dollars funding the nation’s single largest provider of abortion services, Planned Parenthood, and its international affiliate organizations,” said Senator Ernst. “More than $1.5 billion in tax payer’s dollars should not go to an organization with such blatant disrespect for human life. That is why I introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and redirect those dollars to federally qualified health centers that provide actual comprehensive care and family planning services for women. We have made great strides to protect life under the Trump administration, but there is more work to be done, and we remain committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society.” "I spent my entire career as a nurse fighting for the dignity of every human being, and I have witnessed the emotional, physical and psychological effects abortion has on mothers. All of us in the healthcare field took an oath to fight for life, and abortion destroys that. Industry giants like Planned Parenthood perform more than 320,000 abortions every year, and this GAO report exposes that these atrocities are done at the expense of taxpayers. No matter our views on abortion, or the party label beside our name, we must ensure that our money is spent responsibly and with integrity," said Congressman Black. "Abortion is not family planning. Abortion is family destruction, and the fact that $1.5 billion in taxpayer dollars is funneled to this industry is sickening. The American people deserve better." “I thank the GAO for helping to shed a light on how American taxpayer money goes to organizations that promote or perform abortions. I remain committed to defunding Planned Parenthood and protecting the unborn, and we deserve full transparency on tax dollars for these organizations. The numbers are clear and the taxpayers deserve better. I thank Rep. Black and Sen. Ernst for joining me in this effort on behalf of American taxpayers and the unborn,” said Congressman Olson. “An audit, released today by a government watchdog, GAO, demonstrates the abortion industry’s push to integrate abortion into primary healthcare services. Thankfully, under President Trump’s Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy, international abortion groups, like MSI and IPPF, must agree to not perform or promote abortion in order to receive taxpayer dollars. This reform ensures that US international aid funds life-affirming care for both women and children. A similar protection should become the standard for all government funding; abortion businesses like Planned Parenthood – responsible for killing more than 7 million unborn children – must no longer be subsidized by the American taxpayer,” said Congressman Smith. In 2016, Senator Ernst introduced legislation to redirect federal funds from Planned Parenthood Federation of America and its affiliate organizations to other eligible women's health care providers. Congressman Black is the author of the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, which would place an immediate moratorium on all federal funding to Planned Parenthood until it certifies that it will no longer perform elective abortions or give funding to entities that do. The bill would also reallocate federal funding to more than 13,500 clinics nationwide that provide primary care to low-income and under-served populations that do not perform abortions. Additionally, Senator Ernst and Congressman Black’s bicameral legislation to overturn an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration, and restore state choice about how to best distribute Title X grant money was signed into law by President Trump on April 13, 2017.

03.08.2018	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following message after the White House announced new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, which could have negative consequences on rural communities throughout the nation, America’s farmers, and our national security. Watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks here or by clicking on the image below: Below are Senator Ernst’s full remarks: “Good afternoon. “I want to quickly address the tariffs on steel and aluminum put forward by the White House today. “As Iowans know, free and fair trade is not just a lofty Washington principle. It is at the core of Iowa’s economy and sustains our families and farms. Trade’s impacts are felt head-to-toe in Iowa. “For example, companies like Des Moines Steel Company, which provide valuable products, made with steel, is used for everything from home and office projects to mailboxes and race cars. The “Real Steel Guys” have been in business for over two decades creating good-paying jobs that put food on the table for countless Iowa families. “Household names like John Deere, Rockwell Collins, Vermeer, Lennox, and Arconic all share a similar story – creating jobs and economic opportunity for countless Iowans and Americans – using steel and aluminum inputs to feed their manufacturing processes. “These are just a few examples…. “But I also urge the White House to reconsider the impact that such tariffs will have on Iowa farmers and the 88,000 farms across the state. “For one, you cannot build a grain bin out of a paper bag or plow a field with a toothpick. You see, our farmers rely on steel and aluminum for the products and equipment that make farms work. Imported products like these are used to keep farm operations moving and making money. Higher prices on such products drastically increases the cost of doing business. “These tariffs could also set off a brushfire of retaliation measures against American exports. Experts warn that these tariffs will cause nations like China – for example, the largest buyer of U.S. soybeans – to look elsewhere to meet their demands. “This threat of retaliation is a reality. History has shown that retaliatory tariffs are often targeted at agriculture. Our farmers are deeply fearful, and I share their sentiment. “With already low commodity prices, farms are barreling toward crisis. There are other countries that are ready, willing, and able to fill the food product demands of China and other nations that seek to buy U.S. agricultural exports. Iowans cannot afford a trade war. “I couldn’t agree more when President Trump has said that the U.S. should be its own boss when it comes to driving our trade policies. But America must understand its customers and be sensitive to what drives them to buy what the United States is selling. We simply cannot afford to be the overpriced boutique when the store down the street is selling the same goods at a discount price. We will lose every time. “I agree with President Trump on many things. I support his vision for a strong America that can compete globally. I share his heart for bringing more jobs back to American workers. These are good goals that we must work toward. “Strong, fair trade is a step in that direction. It favors American families and businesses and is right for the United States. So I am urging the President to reconsider this proposal, not just for its impacts on Iowa, but for the negative consequences this proposal could have on rural communities throughout the nation, America’s farmers, and our national security. “Thank you.”
03.08.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities Chairman Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with U.S. Senators John Barrasso (R-WY), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Dan Sullivan (R-AK), sent a letter to President Trump today expressing concern over how his proposed aluminum and steel tariffs could impact our national security and strain relationships with our international allies and partners. The Senators stressed that, “As outlined in both the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, maintaining relationships with allies and partners is vital to international stability and the national security of the United States. Our military and intelligence communities benefit from these alliances and partnerships, and in today’s strategic environment it is of utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive relationships with international partners that share our nation’s concerns and interests with emphasis on addressing the most critical challenges facing the U.S. and global steel industry.” They continued, offering that “In lieu of imposing broad, global aluminum and steel tariffs that could adversely impact our relationship with several key allies, we ask that the administration consider alternative approaches to address these issues.” The full letter can be found here or below. March 8, 2018 The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20500 Mr. President, We write today to express our concern regarding proposed aluminum and steel tariffs and the impact on national security of such actions. While we recognize and appreciate the administration’s commitment to strengthening the economy of the United States, imposing broad tariffs on both aluminum and steel could risk straining relationships with international allies and partners. In your recently released National Security Strategy, you list “Reinforcing Economic Ties with Allies and Partners” as a priority stating, “[w]e will strengthen economic ties as a core aspect of our relationships with like-minded states and use our economic expertise, markets and resources to bolster states threatened by our competitors.” Strengthening alliances and attracting new partners is also made a top priority in the National Defense Strategy released by Secretary of Defense James Mattis. As outlined in both the National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, maintaining relationships with allies and partners is vital to international stability and the national security of the United States. Our military and intelligence communities benefit from these alliances and partnerships, and in today’s strategic environment it is of utmost importance that we continue to foster constructive relationships with international partners that share our nation’s concerns and interests with emphasis on addressing the most critical challenges facing the U.S. and global steel industry. As such, we remain concerned that imposing tariffs risks alienating key international partners that contribute to our ability to defend our nation and maintain international stability. In lieu of imposing broad, global aluminum and steel tariffs that could adversely impact our relationship with several key allies, we ask that the administration consider alternative approaches to address these issues. Thank you for your attention in this matter. We share your commitment to the defense and prosperity of this great nation and its citizens. Sincerely,
03.07.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — Today, U.S. Congressman David Young (IA-03) and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Congressmen Rod Blum (IA-01), Dave Loebsack (IA-02) and Steve King (IA-04) sent a letter to President Trump urging him not to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum that could harm Iowa’s farmers and manufacturers. Members of the Iowa delegation stated concerns that sweeping new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum “could set into motion a chain of retaliatory measures, hurting Iowans from the family farm to the family-owned manufacturing plant. Tariffs are a tax on families and hardworking Iowans cannot afford a trade war.” The members emphasized Iowa’s “diverse industries which play a vital role in supporting not only Iowa’s economy, but the entire U.S. economy. Iowa is the second largest agricultural export state, and shipped $10 billion of exports abroad in 2015 alone. Strong, fair trade favors American families and businesses and allows them to export their goods, which is critical for the farmers, manufacturers, and insurers in our state.” Read the full text of the letter here or below. March 7, 2018 The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Trump: As Members of Congress who represent Iowa, we understand the importance of free and fair trade to Iowa’s strong agricultural economy. We urge you to carefully consider and analyze the economic costs and benefits of your plan to impose new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. We are concerned such a move could set into motion a chain of retaliatory measures, hurting Iowans from the family farm to the family-owned manufacturing plant. Tariffs are a tax on families and hardworking Iowans cannot afford a trade war. Iowa is comprised of diverse industries which play a vital role in supporting not only Iowa’s economy, but the entire U.S. economy. Iowa is the second largest agricultural export state, and shipped $10 billion of exports abroad in 2015 alone. Strong, fair trade favors American families and businesses and allows them to export their goods, which is critical for the farmers, manufacturers, and insurers in our state. We are extremely worried the proposed tariffs will have a negative impact on our agricultural economy. Many experts have warned tariffs will cause corresponding retaliation by our trading partners. This is concerning because the easiest target for retaliation is our agriculture exports. For example, the United States enjoys a large agricultural trade surplus with China and recently began exporting U.S. beef, which is a good indication of China’s interest in expanding agricultural imports. Iowa’s major exports to China include soybeans, corn, and pork – 60 percent of Iowa’s soybeans go to China. As farmers have already faced several years of low commodity prices, any hit to demand would be devastating to their financial situations. Besides the impact such tariffs could have on Iowa agricultural exports, imported steel and aluminum products are used to keep farm operations going while manufacturers use these products as inputs in their industrial processes. While we recognize there is excess global capacity for steel and aluminum, the overall impacts must be part of the administration’s calculus when best deciding how to engage. We urge you, Mr. President, to reconsider this proposal given the consequences this will have on states like Iowa, rural communities throughout the nation, and on America’s farms. Sincerely,
03.07.2018	Washington, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) along with Senators Tom Cotton (R-Arkansas), Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri), Pat Toomey (R-Pennsylvania), and David Perdue (R-Georgia) today introduced the Preserving Access to Cost Effective Drugs (PACED) Act, which restores the power of the Patent and Trade Office and federal courts, and the International Trade Commission to review patents regardless of sovereign immunity claims made as part of sham transactions. Under current law patent holders can pay Indian tribes to take “ownership” of their patents, which allows the tribes to claim sovereign immunity and avoid review in the case of a dispute. This could lead to widespread patent abuse and increases costs for consumers. “Congress cannot look the other way as some pharmaceutical companies attempt to stifle competition and prevent Americans from accessing affordable generic drugs,” said Senator Ernst. “Failure to act could incentivize other industries to use similar tactics to block competitors. Through the Preserving Access to Cost Effective Drugs Act, we can speed up the entry of safe and affordable generic drugs into the market while maintaining the integrity of the U.S. patent system.” “It’s far past time that we crack down on patent abuse, which is raising costs for our seniors. This bill will make sure unscrupulous patent holders can’t game the system and block their competitors from entering the market. That’ll go a long way to help seniors get the drugs they need,” said Cotton. “We watched a company brazenly try to exploit a potential legal loophole to game the system in an effort to protect their bottom line—and keep Missourians from access to cheaper generic drug options in the process. That should be illegal, and our bipartisan bill would make it so by ending this astounding assertion of sovereign immunity to avoid patent review, before any other companies follow suit,” said McCaskill. “Sham transactions involving the transfer of patent ownership from a pharmaceutical company to a tribe for the sole purpose of shielding the patent from challenges are a clear abuse of our patent system and set a dangerous precedent for other consumer products. The PACED Act will improve our patent system and protect patients and consumers from higher drug prices by eliminating this egregious loophole,” said Toomey. “Gaming the patent system is not good for consumers or businesses,” said Senator Perdue. “I’m disappointed this legislation even has to be offered due to a few bad actors trying to do an end run around the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.” Background: By avoiding review, pharmaceutical firms can prevent generics from coming to market and raise the cost of drugs. Similarly, if non-practicing entities, often referred to as “patent trolls,” can skirt a review or use a tribe as a straw plaintiff, it becomes harder for businesses to defend themselves against dubious patent claims. This legislation would do nothing to prevent pharmaceutical firms from partnering with Indian tribes for research, development, and licensing of drugs. The PACED Act is supported by the following organizations which represent hundreds of companies across the U.S.: R Street, The Electronic Frontier Foundation, Engine, American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, Public Knowledge, America’s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), Association for Accessible Medicines, United for Patent Reform, High Tech Industry Alliance, Patients for Affordable Drugs Now, BlueCross BlueShield Association, Blue Shield of California.
03.06.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned the Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats on the national security implications of proposed tariffs on steel and aluminum, and stressed the critical role strong trade partnerships play in the defense of our nation and allies. Senator Ernst highlighted the priorities from the administration’s National Defense Strategy, which emphasizes the need to strengthen current alliances and partnerships while fostering new strategic relationships in order to combat growing threats. Ernst asked Director Coats what message the potential steel and aluminum tariffs would send to our allies, as well as potential future strategic partners who are looking to engage with the US. The Iowa Senator recently returned from a delegation visit to South Korea, Japan and China, where she helped affirm the United States’ commitment to security in the Asia Pacific. Given the growing high-end threat environment in this region, Senator Ernst believes it is vital for the US to remain the partner of choice, rather than engage in economic and trade actions that may risk our ability to maintain alliances and build coalitions.

03.05.2018	Washington, DC— Today, US Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Chris Murphy (D-CT), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Nelson (D-FL), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Udall (D-NM), Dean Heller (R-NV), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Doug Jones (D-AL), and Angus King (D-ME) in introducing the Students, Teachers, and Officers Preventing (STOP) School Violence Act of 2018, legislation that funds school security improvements and invests in early intervention and prevention programs to stop school violence before it happens. The legislation authorizes the Department of Justice to make grants for the purposes of training students, school personnel, and law enforcement to identify signs of violence and intervene to prevent people from hurting themselves or others. In addition to prevention efforts, the legislation funds evidence-based technology and equipment to improve school security and prevent school violence. This includes the development of anonymous reporting systems, and commonsense security infrastructure improvements. The legislation also provides funds for school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams to help schools intake and triage threats before tragedy strikes. Following tragedies like Columbine, Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook, and now Parkland, the federal government has funded short-term school safety initiatives focused on crisis response, active shooters, and physical infrastructure. While these are important investments, we have not yet seen sustained strategies to STOP violence in our schools before it happens. Our students, educators, and local law enforcement need the tools and support to take proactive and continuous steps toward improving school safety and security. “Our children’s safety, well-being, and future must always come first,” said Ernst. “This bipartisan bill will provide our schools with additional resources to prevent senseless and tragic violence. The STOP School Violence Act will empower our states and local communities to take the steps they deem necessary to deter future threats and ensure our students, teachers and faculty can focus on what is most important at school – learning and growing.” “By providing critical resources to schools to strengthen their security infrastructure and train teachers, administrators, and law enforcement officers to intervene, we can save countless lives,” said Hatch. “As I noted on the Senate floor last week, putting these kinds of critical resources closer to students in Utah has led to incredible success, stopping 86 attacks in schools since 2016. I believe we can replicate that success on a national level with this commonsense, noncontroversial proposal.” “This bipartisan legislation would provide tools and resources to law enforcement, teachers, and students to help prevent acts of violence in our schools before they start—but, it’s just one part of the solution,” said Klobuchar. “I believe we also need to pass a number of other safety measures related to guns, including universal background checks.” “The tragedy in Parkland was the direct result of a failure to communicate between law enforcement, the F.B.I., and Broward County Schools,” Rubio said. “The Stop School Violence Act, which was designed by Sandy Hook Promise, would help fix these shortcomings on a national level by driving collaboration between law enforcement and schools to help identify and stop dangerous and violent individuals before they act. This law has broad bi-partisan support in Congress. We should pass it as soon as possible.” “Thanks to the hard work of my friends Nicole Hockley and Mark Barden and their organization Sandy Hook Promise, this is a solid bill that’ll help schools recognize the signs of troubled young people and get them the help they need. But even they would tell you that stopping there would be a failure. If we are going to do something meaningful about these school shootings, we need to support programs that work, but also address how easy it is for kids to get their hands of powerful weapons,” said Murphy. “I applaud Chairman Hatch for his leadership on this school safety legislation,” said McConnell. “Americans are united in wanting schools to ensure the safety and security of our children. We use a variety of security measures to protect workplaces and government buildings across America. We ought to be able to do the same to protect our children. I look forward to the Senate considering this legislation.” “This bipartisan bill arms teachers and students with knowledge and resources to stop school violence before it starts,” said Blumenthal. Preventive measures like training teachers and students to recognize warning signs, and developing anonymous reporting systems are critical to ending school shootings and ensuring student safety. We must take every step possible to protect our children from gun violence.” “Students should not only feel safe at school, but they should be safe at school. We can go a long way in stopping school violence by making our schools less vulnerable to violent attacks and training our teachers, school administrators, and law enforcement in threat assessment and early intervention techniques. I’m glad to join Senator Hatch and this bipartisan group in a bill that will do exactly that,” said Grassley. “This is a commonsense bill that will better protect our schools from future tragedy and save lives.” “Providing our schools with the necessary training, technology and equipment is important to ensure our students and faculty have the necessary tools to help prevent school violence,” Nelson said. “What happened in Parkland last month must never happen again and this bill, like many other bipartisan proposals I’ve supported, is a commonsense measure that will help advance the conversation and congressional efforts around school safety and comprehensive gun reform.” “Those tasked with protecting the lives of our schoolchildren should have access to the latest evidence-based safety training,” said Cornyn. “Preparing students, staff, and law enforcement to stop violence before it happens is critical for ensuring our schools are safe places to learn, and this legislation would help broaden the reach of these lifesaving programs.” “We need to take action to protect our schools and stop the next Parkland or Aztec shooting from ravaging another American community,” Udall said. “This bipartisan legislation will provide key resources to schools and law enforcement to identify warning signs, strengthen school safety infrastructure, and take other concrete steps to stop school violence. I’m also glad to see that this bill includes important provisions to ensure that Tribes and Bureau of Indian Education schools have the tools they need to keep students and teachers safe in Native communities. This legislation is just one piece of a larger effort we must undertake to protect our communities from violence, including enacting common-sense measures to keep guns out of the hands of those who seek to hurt innocent people." “Every child deserves to feel safe in the classroom, and this bill is a positive step toward assuring Nevada’s kids – and their parents – that we are committed to supporting a coordinated effort to stop school violence,” said Heller. “This bill provides critical federal resources to implement early intervention programs, strengthen school security, and help train students, school personnel, and local law enforcement to identify threats and preempt attacks. I thank Chairman Hatch for his leadership, and I look forward to working with him to send this legislation to the President’s desk.” “No student should be afraid to go to school and no parent should be afraid to send them,” said Stabenow. “The commonsense measures in this bill are the first of many steps we need to take to keep our children safe.” “Schools and law enforcement need more resources to prevent violence and keep children safe,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Students should be focused on learning, not fearing for their safety. This bill makes schools more secure and save lives.” “We can’t witness so many horrific shootings at schools and accept that we can’t do more to prevent them,” Heitkamp said. “The STOP School Violence Act is a bipartisan proposal that would help make schools safer by providing additional resources and funding based on evidence based proposals, and it’s part of an important conversation about common sense ways to protect our kids and keep our communities safe.” “School violence—in any form—is a real tragedy and occurs too often among children and students today. What’s worse is knowing that many acts of violence in our schools could be prevented if students, teachers, administrators, and law enforcement all had the guidance and training they need to proactively improve school safety,” Capito said. “The STOP School Violence Act will provide resources to help build a coordinated response to school violence and put a stop to these tragedies before they happen.” “Now is the time for Congress to work together to advance commonsense solutions that will make our schools and communities safer,” said Baldwin. “I’m urging my Congressional colleagues to support this bipartisan investment in early intervention and prevention, and to work together to find common ground on gun safety reforms to protect our children and save lives.” “There is no one, simple fix for addressing acts of violence, but a focus on prevention is an imperative. In the aftermath of tragedy, we find ourselves looking back, identifying the signals for help that were overlooked. We need a more proactive approach to address the growing violence that we see in our society,” said Murkowski. “This legislation aims to help schools implement evidence-based programs that stop school violence before it happens. By equipping individuals with the tools, knowledge, and skills needed to identify warning signs, as well as implementing anonymous reporting systems for how to notify the proper authorities with potential threats, we are taking a step in the right direction. By being proactive, we all can be part of the solution and keep our students and teachers safe.” “We must make sure schools have the resources they need to train law enforcement, students and faculty to detect signs of violence, and make sure the appropriate steps can be taken to stop it before it occurs,” Brown said. This is one commonsense step we can take right now to boost safety in communities everywhere, and it must be part of a comprehensive, bipartisan conversation about other steps we can take to prevent these tragedies.” “We have no higher responsibility than to protect our children,” said Jones. “This commonsense legislation is a first-step towards ensuring tragedies like Parkland, Florida are prevented by providing faculty and law-enforcement with the tools they need to identify warning signs and stop attacks from happening in their schools.” “It is essential that we take steps to secure our schools so that students are protected and have a safe environment in which to learn,” said Collins. “This bipartisan legislation would help local communities fund new training, reporting systems, and security infrastructure to help enhance school safety.” Statements of Support: Dominick L. Stokes, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association Vice President for Legislative Affairs “This bill is extremely important in order to keep children attending schools safer. School is supposed to be a safe haven for our children to learn while parents are working. Since 2013 there have been over 300 school shootings. In 2018 we have seen 11 school shooting across the country. This bill with help implement better ways to protect our children at school by adding money and resources to protect them by reauthorizing the grant program for school security.” Robert Boyd, Executive Director at Secure Schools Alliance “There’s no question that the STOP Violence Act proposed by Sen. Orrin Hatch will save lives,” said Robert Boyd, executive director for the Secure Schools Alliance. “While many state and federal legislators are now racing to create legislation to address deficiencies in school security programs, Sen. Hatch was working on this legislation before the tragic events in Florida, and we applaud him for that. The Secure Schools Alliance and our partners are proud to support this critical legislation, which we will call Hatch grants.” STOP School Violence Act of 2018 The Student, Teachers, and Officers Preventing School Violence Act of 2018, or the STOP School Violence Act, reauthorizes and amends the 2001-2009 bipartisan Secure Our Schools Act to offer Department of Justice grants to states to help our schools implement proven, evidence-based programs and technologies that STOP school violence before it happens. The bill permits grants to fund evidence-based programs and practices to: Training to students, school personnel, and local law enforcement to identify and warning signs and intervene to stop school violence before it happens; Improve school security infrastructure to deter and respond to threats of school violence, including the development and implementation of anonymous reporting systems for threats of school violence; Develop and operate school threat assessment and crisis intervention teams; and Facilitate coordination between schools and local law enforcement. The bill would authorize $75 million for FY 2018, and $100 million annually for the next ten years, which may be partially offset from a DOJ research program called the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative.
03.02.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) are demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding their national review of all VA health care provider licenses in order to certify that no doctors have been hired illegally. Ernst and Grassley’s call for answers follows a disturbing report that shed light on illegal hiring practices at VA hospitals, including the Iowa City VA. The VA has since failed to meet the February 2018 review deadline they established in their response to Senators Grassley and Ernst. “Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our nation and it is unacceptable that the VA has failed to ensure that the doctors treating our veterans are certified to do so,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “I’m calling on the VA to make it a top priority to complete the national license review and make the results public, as they stated would be finished last month. These findings are critical to ensure an unqualified and improperly licensed doctor is never allowed to practice at the VA again.” “Ensuring qualified, professional staff are caring for our nation’s veterans is crucial, and we need to know the men and women who have served this country are receiving the best possible care,” said Senator Grassley. “The hiring practices at VA directly impact the lives of veterans from Iowa and every state. The VA has an obligation to our veterans and the public to share the findings of their internal review.” Senators Ernst and Grassley have repeatedly pushed for answers from the VA following a disturbing report that shed light on hiring practices at VA hospitals, including the Iowa City VA. While steps were taken to remove the doctor in question, the Iowa Senators sent a follow-up letter with additional questions to ensure this type of malfeasance would not be allowed to happen again within the VA. In a response letter received by the Senators on January 25, 2018, the VA stated that they would be conducting a national review of provider licenses and that it would be “completed by the end of February 2018.” Senators Ernst and Grassley have yet to receive the findings of the review.
03.01.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement following today’s meeting at the White House with industry leaders to discuss the importance of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to Iowa: “Rural America is the backbone of our country, and as I made clear again today, the RFS is working for corn farmers, ethanol and biodiesel producers, and our rural communities. I’m encouraged that President Trump agrees the year-round sale of E15 will bring down Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) prices. RINs drive corn demand and biofuels production in Iowa, helping promote innovation and growth across our state’s agriculture sector. While no decision was reached today, I remain fully committed to protecting the RFS and will not support anything that will harm the 88,000 farms in Iowa or the 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry.” This follows a recent report that highlights the importance of the renewable fuels industry and the RFS, which created $2.4 billion in household income and supported almost 50,000 jobs across Iowa in 2017.
03.01.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, raised questions at a hearing entitled, “The Administration’s Framework for Rebuilding Infrastructure in America.” The Senator questioned Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James on a letter she sent him regarding the Cedar Rapids flood project. She also asked U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao about the administration’s path forward for rural broadband deployment.

03.01.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and combat veteran, applauded news that the first shipment of weapons provided by the United States is expected to arrive in Ukraine in the coming weeks. Senator Ernst has long called for this action, and worked to include her provision included in the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to assist Ukraine in combating pro-Russian rebels through lethal and non-lethal support. “Ukraine is a critical ally to the United States, and I am so pleased to see our country provide this long-overdue assistance in Ukraine’s fight to push back against growing Russian aggression. I have continually stressed the importance of supporting our partners around the globe. Providing lethal aid to Ukraine shows that the United States is serious about protecting the interests of our nation and our allies.” The NDAA, which was signed into law in December 2017, included an Ernst provision that authorized increased funding of lethal and non-lethal support for Ukraine.
02.28.2018	WASHINGTON – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) has been named to serve on the bipartisan, bicameral Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform, which will focus on fixing the broken budgeting process. Following the announcement, Senator Ernst issued a statement: “Washington’s budget process is simply not working. Time and again, Congress has funded our government from one short-sighted, band-aid bill to another, failing to balance the budget, recklessly spending taxpayer dollars, and jeopardizing many vital programs to our nation. I am looking forward to getting to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to fix our broken budget process so that we can find a fiscally responsible path forward.” Joint Select Committee on Budget and Appropriations Process Reform Members: Senate Members: Sen. Roy Blunt (R-MO) Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) Sen. Brian Schatz (D-HI) Sen.

02.28.2018	The Senators previously called on Blackmun to resign in light of reports he was aware of sexual abuse allegations against Larry Nassar. Shaheen and Ernst’s bipartisan resolution to establish a special committee to investigate the USOC and USA Gymnastics has growing bipartisan support. (Washington, DC) – U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statements in response to the U.S. Olympic Committee’s (USOC) announcement that CEO Scott Blackmun will resign: “Scott Blackmun’s resignation is long overdue,” said Senator Shaheen. “The U.S. Olympic Committee must now bring on new leadership determined to deliver answers and accountability regarding how Larry Nassar was able to freely abuse young girls for decades, as well as answers to questions about abuse in other Olympic programs. It’s clear that the culture at the U.S. Olympic Committee desperately needs to change so that it prioritizes the health and safety of U.S. athletes. In the meantime, Senator Ernst and I will continue to urge the Senate to establish a special committee to investigate the U.S. Olympic Committee and its governing bodies, so that our athletes will get the answers they deserve and so we can ensure the safety of future Olympians.” “The culture of silence and negligence has plagued the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for far too long,” said Senator Ernst. “Scott Blackmun’s resignation was greatly needed. Now the USOC has the opportunity for new leadership and to help us get to the bottom of how this organization repeatedly failed to protect our young athletes from Larry Nassar and hold persons in positions of power accountable. I will continue pushing for these answers with Senator Shaheen as well as urging our colleagues to move forward and create a special committee in the Senate to investigate the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.” Shaheen and Ernst called on Blackmun to resign earlier this month following reports that he was aware of sexual abuse allegations against ex-team USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar in 2015. The Senators have called for a special committee to investigate the USOC and USA Gymnastics regarding how Nassar was allowed to sexually abuse female gymnasts over decades. Their bipartisan resolution to establish the special committee has growing bipartisan support with 17 cosponsors including Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Tina Smith (D-MN).
02.27.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In addition to U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) visit to South Korea and Japan, the Iowa senator traveled to China on Saturday, February 24th to meet with U.S. Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China and former Governor of Iowa, Terry Branstad. They discussed the importance of maintaining a strong trade partnership between the U.S. and China. “Ambassador Branstad and I had an important and productive discussion about fostering a stronger trade partnership for our agricultural exports. Fair and reciprocal trade will advance both the United States’ economic and national security interests in the region,” said Senator Ernst. “As the United States’ largest agricultural export market, a strong trade relationship between the two nations is vital. We are committed to continuing our dialogue to advance U.S. interests in the region.” Additionally, as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, Senator Ernst discussed with Ambassador Branstad ways the United States can engage with China and other nations in the region to de-escalate tensions with North Korea. Ernst added, “The diplomatic relationship between China and the United States is critical, especially as we work with our partners in the region to deter current and future acts of aggression by North Korea. I am thankful for the Ambassador’s leadership on behalf of our nation in these areas, and look forward to continuing to work with him and the Trump administration to ensure that the United States remains a leader in the region.” Senator Joni Ernst visits with Ambassador Terry Branstad in Beijing, China.

02.27.2018	The following are Senator Ernst’s opening remarks: “During today’s meeting, Senator Grassley and I made clear that we will not support anything that will harm the 88,000 farms in Iowa or put the 50,000 jobs tied to the renewable fuels industry across my state in jeopardy. “In fact, yesterday a report released confirmed what many across the Midwest already know: a strong and robust RFS encourages consumer choice, investment, and innovation; all while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. “In Iowa alone, the renewable fuels industry and RFS creates $2.4 billion in income and supports almost 50,000 jobs. “The ‘RINs reform and the export RINs concept’ plans that my colleagues have proposed will undermine the 15 billion gallon volume obligation for ethanol and have a profound impact on biodiesel production. The bottom line is that these changes will come at the expense of farmers in Iowa and across the Heartland. “Iowans won’t have the wool pulled over their eyes, and we made this very clear in today’s meeting. “I do agree with Senator Grassley that protecting domestic energy production does not need to result in hurting biofuels production. “It’s clear that this is going to be a very tough road ahead. However, Senator Grassley and I will continue working tirelessly to protect and defend the RFS which helps grow our economy. “Also, I wanted to quickly say that I am thrilled to see Bill Northey’s confirmation in the Senate. His long-overdue confirmation to this essential role within the USDA is great news for our state and our country. “His experience as a farmer and as Iowa’s Secretary of Agriculture makes him the ideal candidate. I’m glad to see my colleagues recognized what folks in Iowa already know: Bill Northey knows agriculture. He has worked with diligence and dedication to help farmers and ranchers across Iowa, and will continue to serve as a powerful voice for agriculture and conservation across the country."
02.26.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on a report released today that highlights the major importance of the renewable fuels industry and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which created $2.4 billion in household income and supported almost 50,000 jobs across Iowa in 2017: “This report confirms what many across the Midwest already know: a strong and robust RFS encourages consumer choice, investment, and innovation; all while reducing our dependence on foreign oil. In Iowa alone, the renewable fuels industry and RFS creates $2.4 billion in income and supports almost 50,000 jobs. The biofuels industry is on the leading edge of the energy sector, and I will continue working tirelessly to protect and defend the RFS which helps grow our economy.” Read the report here.
02.25.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, led a delegation of House and Senate members to South Korea and Japan. The delegation included Sen. Ernst and Sen. Sullivan of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Congressman Kelly of the House Armed Services Committee. While in South Korea, the delegation met with Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Defense Minister Song Young-moo, General Brooks and United States Forces Korea leadership, and visited the DMZ. In Japan, the delegation visited with Japanese Foreign Minister Kono, Lt General Martinez and United States Forces Japan and 7th Fleet leadership. In both countries, the delegation discussed the importance of missile defense and countering North Korea as well as China’s growing influence in the region. Top: Sen. Inhofe and delegation meet with United States Forces and General Brooks in South Korea. Bottom: Sen. Inhofe and delegation visiting with the Command Triad of the USS Stethem in Japan. “North Korea’s aggression over the past year has shown that they are not only a threat to the United States, but they are especially threatening to our regional partners, like South Korea and Japan,” Inhofe said. “Our timely visits to South Korea and Japan were a good opportunity to speak with our allies about North Korea’s blatant nuclear ambitions and affirm our commitment to not engaging in direct negotiations with Pyongyang until they take meaningful steps to denuclearize. I look forward to continuing our conversations about countering North Korea and continuing positive U.S. military cooperation in the region. “As a result of these visits, my concern about the long term threat of communist China is growing,” Inhofe continued. “Their influence in the region is growing and sinister. The strength of our alliances in East Asia are now more important than ever, and I look forward to working with the Trump administration to advance our ties even farther.” Sen. Joni Ernst stated: “As the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I valued the opportunity to assess our capabilities in the region and reinforce our commitment to Indo-Pacific security to address threats from global adversaries, such as North Korea. The threats our nation and our allies face continue to evolve, and this trip underscored the need to continue to strengthen our partnerships in the region, diplomatically, economically, and militarily. I look forward to building off the progress made on this visit in Congress and in my subcommittee.” Rep. Trent Kelly stated: "Our tour of U.S. Military installations in South Korea and Japan was productive. It was an opportunity to meet with U.S. troops and our allies about our collaborative efforts to counter North Korea. To see in person the important role that all parties have in this strategic region of the world was invaluable. I will continue to work to ensure that we maintain strong missile defense capabilities and the highest levels of readiness across our military so that we can sustain the working relationships with our allies in deterring aggression." Inhofe views the progress of repairs to the U.S.S. John McCain. Sen. Inhofe and the delegation especially appreciated the opportunity to visit with U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and Japan and hear from regional commanders. Sen Inhofe: “I was especially grateful to visit with U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and Japan to discuss their deployment and mission in the Pacific. These men and women play an important role in strengthening alliances and maintaining security in a tense region. I appreciated hearing candidly from their commanders how we can best support the mission in South Korea and Japan and ensure we are equipping our service members for success.”
02.23.2018	Legislation Ernst helped champion was enacted into law through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst applauded the Reynolds Administration’s announcement today encouraging local communities, cities, and counties to apply to be considered Opportunity Zones, a new program that promotes investment in low-income areas. Opportunity Zones were established through the Investing in Opportunity Act, legislation that Senator Ernst helped champion that was enacted into law through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. “I am thrilled that Iowans across the state will have the opportunity to apply for this greatly-needed program,” said Senator Ernst. “This program, implemented through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, includes much-needed tax relief for low and middle-income earners. I applaud the Reynolds Administration for utilizing this opportunity in Iowa, which will incentivize private investment in struggling communities, spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas, and bring hope and opportunity back to many distressed rural communities in Iowa.” For more details or to apply, visit iowaeconomicdevelopment.com/opportunityzones or contact OpportunityZones@iowaeda.com.
02.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined 25 of her colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump supporting his recent comments about re-engaging in Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade negotiations. The senators wrote, “Reducing barriers to trade and investment, protecting American intellectual property rights, and leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses, manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, and ranchers is of utmost importance, and we ask that you prioritize engagement with the TPP so that the American people can prosper from the tremendous opportunities that these trading partners bring.” They continued, emphasizing that an “improved TPP would therefore bolster and sustain the economic growth America has experienced over the past year facilitated by the regulatory reductions and reforms enacted by your Administration and the substantial tax cuts that you signed into law.” The letter was sent prior to President Trump’s scheduled meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the White House later this week. The two leaders are expected to discuss trade and ways to promote economic growth for both nations. Ernst joined Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT), Pat Roberts (R-KS), John Cornyn (R-TX), Mike Rounds (R-SD), James Lankford (R-OK), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), James Risch (R-ID), John Barrasso (R-WY), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Todd Young (R-IN), Roger Wicker (R-MS), John McCain (R-AZ), and Richard Burr (R-NC). The full text of the senators’ letter to President Trump can be found here and below. Mr. President: We write in support of your recent comments expressing interest in re-engaging with the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) to bring about a stronger agreement for the United States. Reducing barriers to trade and investment, protecting American intellectual property rights, and leveling the playing field for U.S. businesses, manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, and ranchers is of utmost importance, and we ask that you prioritize engagement with the TPP so that the American people can prosper from the tremendous opportunities that these trading partners bring. As you know, increased economic engagement with the eleven nations currently in the TPP has the potential to substantially improve the competitiveness of U.S. businesses, support millions of U.S. jobs, increase U.S. exports, increase wages, fully unleash America’s energy potential, and benefit consumers. Increasing access to a region and market that has a population of nearly 500 million can create widespread benefits to the U.S. economy. An improved TPP would therefore bolster and sustain the economic growth America has experienced over the past year facilitated by the regulatory reductions and reforms enacted by your Administration and the substantial tax cuts that you signed into law. Further, TPP can serve as a way to strengthen ties with our allies in the region, counter the influence of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and increase pressure on the PRC to adopt substantive and positive economic reforms. Re-engaging on TPP would also provide another platform to modernize trade with Canada and Mexico. We recognize that such an endeavor requires the confirmation of your qualified nominees within the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, Department of Commerce, and other trade-related federal agencies. We are committed to securing their expeditious consideration on the Senate floor. In summary, we encourage you to work aggressively to secure reforms that would allow the United States to join the agreement. We share your commitment for free trade agreements that benefit the American people, and we stand ready to work closely with you toward achieving a TPP agreement that meets this objective.
02.16.2018	WASHINGTON – Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst will host a reception for Iowans visiting the nation’s capital during spring break for many Iowa schools. What: Spring Break Reception for Iowans When: Wednesday, March 14, 2018, from 8 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. ET Where: 325 Russell Senate Office Building Staff members from both offices are also available to help with U.S. Capitol building tours and other arrangements for those planning a trip to Washington, D.C. “I always say Washington is an island surrounded by reality. So any chance I get to visit with Iowans is refreshing and brings a healthy perspective,” Grassley said. “My staff is also very good at giving tours of the U.S. Capitol and can help with the logistics of visiting other popular sites. I encourage Iowans to get in touch with requests and questions.” “One of my favorite parts of serving in the Senate is having the opportunity to visit with Iowans from around the state. I am looking forward to seeing all of the families who will be visiting our nation’s capital for spring break at our reception,” Ernst said. Tour tickets are limited, and requests in advance give the best chance for accommodation. More information on help with tours is available here on Grassley’s website and here on Ernst’s website.
02.15.2018	WASHINGTON – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) introduced The Families of Fallen Servicemembers First Act. When servicemembers perished during government shutdowns in 2013 and 2018, their families were initially denied military death benefits. This legislation would provide a permanent appropriation of funds to immediately pay military death benefits to survivors of servicemembers killed during any future government shutdown. The longstanding purpose of the military death gratuity payment is to assist families of deceased servicemembers in meeting their financial needs during the period immediately following a servicemember's death and before other survivor benefits become available. The benefits covered by this legislation include: · Death gratuities for survivors of deceased military service members · Funeral and burial expenses · Authorized funeral travel, including to dignified transfer ceremonies · A temporary continuation of a basic allowance for housing (BAH) for dependents Representatives Gerry Connolly (D-VA) and Tom Rooney (R-FL) introduced the same bill in the House of Representatives. “We have a duty as Americans to support those who serve and their families,” said Senator Coons. “In the words of President Lincoln, we must meet our sacred commitment to those ‘who have borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphan.’ I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill into law and ensure that these benefits are never subject to Congressional inaction.” “When our servicemembers make the ultimate sacrifice protecting our freedoms, we must make certain no grieving family is subjected to delayed benefits due to Congressional stalemate,” said Senator Moran. “No Congressional disagreements should prevent our heroes’ families from quickly receiving the benefits they are owed. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and see it signed into law.” “In 2013 when the government shutdown, more than a dozen brave servicemembers were killed in action and I was outraged when their military death benefits were denied,” Senator Manchin said. “That’s why I’m joining my colleagues in introducing this bill to make sure that when the government shuts down, military death gratuities would never lapse and would always be immediately paid. These days, government shutdowns are all too common here in Washington and the families of these servicemembers should never pay the price.” “Our men and women in uniform fight tirelessly to defend our nation and preserve our values,” said Senator Ernst. “It is essential that we ensure the families of our servicemembers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country are provided with benefits and assistance they need without delay – regardless of the debate happening inside the halls of Congress. While nothing can ever relieve the families of the pain, we can ensure they receive the promised assistance, and that their loved one is buried with honor.” “Providing for our service members and their families should be above partisan fights in Congress,” said Senator Cortez Masto. “There should never be any question of our commitment to honor our troops, particularly those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. That is why I am proud to ensure that their families receive the necessary support and financial assistance they need during such a tragic time as the loss of a loved one. A government shutdown should not stand in the way of military family members getting the support they deserve.” “Our brave servicemen and women sacrifice so much to defend our country and keep Americans safe and free—selflessly putting their lives on the line every day,” Senator Capito said. “There are many consequences of a government shutdown, but it’s unacceptable that we would put ourselves in a position to deny military benefits to the families of fallen service members. This bipartisan legislation will ensure that whether the government is open or not, these families receive the benefits they’ve been promised for their loved one’s sacrifice.”
02.15.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after legislation she co-sponsored to provide a permanent status for DACA-eligible recipients and enhance border and entry security, known as the Secure and Succeed Act, did not advance in the Senate: “I am deeply disappointed our legislation did not move forward in this critical and timely debate today. This legislation provides a way forward for our DACA recipients, provides immediate and significant investments in our border, and it recognizes that you cannot view immigration in a silo – it is a bulky issue that represents many legal, economic, and security concerns. Many of these issues are deeply interconnected. Addressing DACA and the border without some of the other issues plaguing our system is a half solution. We must pass legislation that considers all of the serious and pressing issues in this debate.” Earlier today on the Senate floor, Senator Ernst again urged her colleagues to support the Secure and Succeed Act.
02.15.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — President Trump signed into law the bipartisan Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a cosponsor of the legislation, issued the following statement applauding the signing: “We must do all we can to protect our young athletes and make clear that sexual assault and abuse will not be tolerated. This new law will strengthen mandatory reporting of sexual assault allegations within our amateur sports organizations and require these organizations to develop and enforce policies to prevent these crimes from happening in the first place. I am glad to see this bipartisan legislation signed into law by the president, and I will continue my efforts to combat sexual assault, abuse, and harassment across our society.” Additionally, Senator Ernst joined Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) last week in unveiling a Senate Resolution to create a special committee in the Senate to investigate the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics regarding how team doctor Larry Nassar was given unsupervised access to female gymnasts, allowing him to sexually abuse them over decades.
02.14.2018	Bipartisan Legislation Would Exempt Ag Producers from Reporting Requirements for Animal Waste Emissions WASHINGTON, D.C. –U.S. Senator Ernst (R-Iowa) joined Senators Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Pat Roberts (R-Kansas), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Tom Carper (D-Del.) in introducing the Fair Agricultural Reporting Method (FARM) Act. The bill, which has a number of other bipartisan cosponsors, would protect farmers, ranchers, and livestock markets from burdensome EPA reporting requirements for animal waste emissions. These requirements were not intended to affect animal agriculture and instead were meant to address dangerous industrial pollution, chemical plant explosions, and the release of hazardous materials into the environment. “Today, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in a commonsense approach to protect livestock producers from burdensome EPA reporting requirements. Agriculture is driving Iowa’s expanding economy, and by exempting agricultural operations from these requirements, the FARM Act provides the relief Iowa’s farmers and ranchers deserve while promoting continued growth across the state,” said Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW). “Nebraska agriculture producers should be able to focus on doing their job of feeding the world without unnecessary distractions. These reporting requirements were designed to apply to industrial pollution and toxic chemicals, not animal waste on a farm or a ranch. Our legislation makes it clear that agriculture is exempt from these requirements and ensures producers in this country can continue to operate as they have been since 2008,” said Senator Fischer, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the EPW Committee. “Hoosier farmers who live and work on the land every day know firsthand the importance of protecting the environment. Requiring farmers to spend their time and money on reports that will go unused by EPA would be burdensome and needless. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan legislation to restore the common sense approach to regulating our livestock farmers,” said Senator Donnelly, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “Ranchers and farmers in Wyoming, and across the country, need clarity from Washington. The FARM Act is a commonsense bill to protect our farmers and ranchers from burdensome and unnecessary regulations. These reporting requirements were never intended to be applied to agricultural operations. Even the Obama administration agreed that air emissions from farms shouldn’t be regulated as pollution. I am thankful to Senator Fischer for partnering with me to help get America’s ranchers and farmers some much needed relief,” said Senator Barrasso, the Chairman of the EPW Committee. “Treating farms, ranches and small livestock operations like Superfund sites is not what Congress intended when it passed CERCLA. These programs were enacted to clean up land that has been identified by the EPA as hazardous or contaminated and make certain America’s communities can safely manage hazardous substances. They were not intended to be imposed on family farming operations, who are working to use the best science in order to produce enough food and fuel for a growing global population. Our bill codifies this intent into law to prevent activist interest groups from attempting to redefine congressional intent related to CERCLA in the future,” said Senator Rounds, a member of the EPW Committee. “I’ve heard from Kansas farmers and ranchers that, unless Congress acts, they will be subject to another burdensome and unnecessary regulation that costs time, money, and paperwork. In fact, more than 100,000 operations across the nation would be forced to abide by this reporting requirement that was never intended to affect agriculture. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to act swiftly on this legislation and to get these producers the help they need,” said Senate Roberts, the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee. “North Dakota’s farmers and ranchers work hard every day to keep our rural communities strong, especially in times of hardship like drought and low commodity prices,” Heitkamp said. “The last thing they need is uncertainty and overly burdensome regulations, so this bipartisan effort would give more clarity to livestock producers and support the men and women who are the backbone of our farm economy,” said Senator Heitkamp, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. “I am honored to support this common-sense fix for our poultry farmers in Delaware. I believe that strong environmental protections must be balanced with an approach that makes sense for farmers who live and work on the land. I have heard from many farmers in my state about this issue, and I am pleased this will provide them relief,” said Senator Coons, co-chair of the Senate Chicken Caucus. “Farmers in Delaware and across the country, who work hard to comply with reporting requirements, deserve certainty for their businesses that support our local economies and to clearly know what is expected of them. I am pleased to join this bipartisan group of senators as we work together toward a solution that provides both needed clarity for our hardworking farmers, as well as the necessary data to protect our environment and keep the public informed. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to move the FARM Act through Congress,” said Senator Carper, top Democrat on the EPW Committee. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) are laws on the books that require entities to notify authorities when they release large quantities of hazardous materials. In 2008, the EPA published a final rule exempting most livestock operations from the laws’ reporting requirements. In April 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled EPA did not have the authority to create this exemption for agriculture, creating confusion and uncertainty for America’s ag producers. The FARM Act would: Maintain the exemption for certain federally registered pesticides from reporting requirements within CERCLA. Exempt air emissions from animal waste on a farm from reporting requirements under CERCLA. Provide agriculture producers with greater certainty by reinstating the status quo producers have been operating under since EPA’s 2008 final rule. Click here to read the full text of the FARM Act.
02.14.2018	Legislation would Strengthen Congressional Oversight and the Public’s Ability to Evaluate Online How Federal Agencies are Tackling Problems In 2017, Inspectors General Found over $20 Billion in Potential Taxpayer Savings WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced that their bipartisan bill to hold federal agencies accountable to act on recommendations that save taxpayer money and make government more efficient passed out of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Their legislation would require all open recommendations from inspectors general (IG) at federal agencies that have remained unimplemented for more than a year to be posted to a single, searchable website. Congress and the public could then better monitor the problems that have been identified at the federal agencies where IGs conduct audits to combat waste, fraud, and abuse – and identify whether steps have been taken to resolve those problems. “The federal government spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year to have inspectors general review and analyze federal programs. Yet, it can be difficult to track and monitor a federal agency’s efforts to resolve issues identified by inspector general recommendations,” said Heitkamp. “Our bipartisan bill would make it easier to hold agencies accountable and pressure them into addressing recommendations that will help eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in our federal government. Taxpayers deserve the ability to understand how their dollars are being used and how federal agencies are improving their operations, and today’s progress means we are one step closer to providing the improved ability to track open recommendations in a straightforward and transparent manner.” “This is an important step toward holding our federal agencies accountable and working to eliminate waste and abuse of taxpayer dollars,” said Ernst. “I’m pleased to see the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs pass this bipartisan effort, and hope the Senate will act quickly so we can implement these commonsense practices to ensure transparency across our government agencies and support their efforts to enact critical Inspectors General recommendations.” Heitkamp and Ernst introduced this legislation in November following the October launch of Oversight.gov—a federal website that hosts thousands of IG reports. The launch responded to Heitkamp’s repeated calls for greater transparency and accountability across federal agencies – including in bipartisan legislation she introduced last year that would have required IGs to post unimplemented recommendations on their websites. IGs serve as federal watchdogs within government agencies that investigate and provide recommendations on how agencies can improve operations and address fraud, waste, and abuse. IGs cover a wide variety of issues ranging from cybersecurity issues and grant administration to federal hiring practices and human management practices. In 2017, for the third consecutive year, the IGs identified in their recommendations over $20 billion in potential taxpayer savings. Heitkamp and Ernst, along with U.S. Senator James Lankford (R-OK), have been consistently working with the IG community on the implementation of this bill to help improve transparency and accountability across the federal government. As members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in 2015, Heitkamp, Lankford and Ernst held a subcommittee hearing on how federal departments and agencies implement recommendations from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the offices of inspectors general. Before the introduction of this legislation, Heitkamp met with U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz to discuss ways to improve Congressional oversight of his agency’s recommendations.
02.13.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a group of Senate and House members today, led by Senator Steve Daines (R-MT), in introducing legislation to expand the Child Tax Credit to cover all families, including pregnant moms. The Child Tax Credit for Pregnant Moms Act builds on the Child Tax Credit provisions included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by supporting families and pregnant mothers with the many costs that accompany caring and planning for the care of a newborn baby. “This is about putting more money into the pockets of pregnant moms. Whether they are stocking up on diapers or taking time off work for their child’s prenatal care, pregnant mothers begin to provide for their child and plan for the future as soon as they hear the good news,” said Daines. “All mothers and all children deserve the same attention under the law. My bill recognizes this and will bring fairness to pregnant mothers as they grow their families.” “Pregnancy is an exciting time for moms as they prepare for the arrival of their little one, but it also means new expenditures,” said Ernst. “By extending the Child Tax Credit to expecting mothers, we can help alleviate some of the financial stress so they can focus on preparing to welcome their newborn to the world.” “Parenting costs don’t just begin after a baby is born,” said Lankford. “As anyone with children knows, expecting parents have many expenses to prepare for the arrival of their newborn. It makes sense to expand the Child Tax Credit to cover the costs of that child whether they are incurred before or after birth. I hope it is brought for a vote in Congress – it is an easy way to help families who are planning for the care of a newborn baby.” “It's simple: expectant mothers and fathers deserve the same financial assistance and tax credit benefits to begin planning for a new child as parents blessed with children already born,” Rep. Meadows said. “The work, care, and costs associated with motherhood begin long before a child is born, and this legislation gives moms and their families an opportunity for a better start. I want to thank my friend Sen. Daines for his leadership on this important issue and look forward to working with my Congressional colleagues on passing this legislation that helps all families.” "Expanding this tax credit will provide more resources to expectant mothers and help with the growing costs of having a child," Rep. Messer said. “I was raised by a single mom who worked full-time at a factory. This kind of credit would have made a big difference for us, and it will make a big difference for many other Hoosier families." Additional Senate cosponsors include Deb Fischer (NE) and James Lankford (OK). U.S. House Representative Mark Meadows (NC) is sponsoring a companion bill with Representatives Luke Messer (IN) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA).
02.12.2018	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Sen. Joni Ernst, today released the following joint statement regarding the nomination of C.J. Williams to serve as a District Judge on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa based in Cedar Rapids. Williams was one of four Iowa lawyers recommended by Grassley and Ernst following a process they established that invited all Iowa lawyers to submit their names for consideration for a recommendation and where all applicants were interviewed and considered by an independent review panel convened by the senators. “Judge Williams is highly qualified to serve in this lifetime appointment,” Grassley and Ernst said. “Judge Williams’ experience, commitment to the law as written and impartiality to those who have come before him will make him an excellent addition to the court. We look forward to his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and are eager to introduce him to our colleagues.” If confirmed, Williams would fill the federal judgeship that was left vacant when Judge Linda R. Reade, of Cedar Rapids, took senior status last fall. The nomination will be considered by the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Grassley chairs. Nationwide, there are 94 district courts in the federal court system. In Iowa, there are two districts housing a total of five district court judges. Federal judges are nominated by the President, confirmed “with the advice and consent” of the U.S. Senate, and serve lifetime appointments. Williams is a U.S. magistrate judge in the Northern District of Iowa, presiding over all pretrial matters in criminal and civil cases, along with presiding over the trials by agreement of the parties. Previously, he was an assistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Iowa, serving as the Senior Litigation Counsel. He also was a trial attorney for Lathrop & Gage L.C. in Kansas City, Missouri, and for the U.S. Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. Williams received his J.D. from the University of Iowa’s College of Law with High Distinction and his L.L.M. from the University of Missouri-Kansas City’s School of Law and is a graduate of the University of Iowa. Please find more information from the White House on the nomination of Williams here.
02.11.2018	WASHINGTON – A group of U.S. Senators tomorrow will introduce a common-sense proposal aimed at providing legal certainty for undocumented children brought to the United States by their parents and preventing others from falling into the same legal limbo in the future. Their proposal, which mirrors the White House framework announced by President Trump, provides a generous opportunity for approximately 1.8 million DACA or DACA-eligible immigrants to earn citizenship while strengthening our nation’s border security and enforcement measures to reduce illegal immigration. The Secure and Succeed Act, sponsored by Senators Grassley, Cornyn, Tillis, Perdue, Lankford, Cotton and Ernst, appropriates $25 billion for real border security such as physical and virtual fencing, radar and other technologies. It also provides for additional personnel for border control and ends key loopholes in current law that allow dangerous criminals to enter our country. The legislation prospectively limits family-based immigration to the nuclear family and reallocates the Diversity Visa lottery. Their proposal generously grandfathers all pending family-based visa applications in order to reward those who chose to follow the law and immigrate legally. The allotment for the Diversity Visa lottery will be reallocated to reduce this backlog and the employment-based visa backlog. ”This legislation is a reasonable approach to shielding children illegally brought to our country through no fault of their own while also taking the meaningful steps to ensure nobody finds themselves in the same situation in the future. This is a rare opportunity to fix a real problem and protect the country in a thoughtful and compassionate way. We simply have to correct the loopholes in current law that allow dangerous criminals to enter and remain at large in our country. Our proposal is supported by the President, who’s come a long way to reach a compromise. This is the only Senate proposal that has any chance of passing the House and being signed into law. If my colleagues are serious about actually finding a real and permanent solution to the DACA crisis, they should be ready and willing to support this compromise,” Grassley said. “This proposal provides a common-sense, permanent solution for nearly two million people who find themselves in limbo. The Secure and Succeed Act gives us the opportunity to help these individuals and build the trust of the American people by securing our borders and enforcing our immigration laws,” Cornyn said. “This is a common-sense compromise that accomplishes a number of goals that both parties have long supported. It offers a fair and compassionate solution for DACA youth to earn naturalization, and it effectively secures our borders to help prevent future illegal immigration and stop drug and human trafficking. It also provides a path forward for modernizing our broken immigration system so it can be more merit-based and reflective of the changing economic and labor needs of our nation. This legislation is the only proposal that the President supports, and the open amendment process will give Senators the opportunity to improve the baseline proposal and get it signed into law,” Tillis said. “President Trump has been very clear on what he will sign into law, and this is it. This is a great deal and the only solution that fully addresses the four pillars in the President’s framework. Now it is up to Republicans and Democrats in both chambers. If people really want to solve the DACA situation, secure our border, and fix the flaws in our current system that incentivize illegal immigration, they should be eager to support this plan,” Perdue said. “We have a unique opportunity to finally get something done on the four immigration areas that leaders in Congress and the President agreed must get done - DACA, border security, the visa lottery, and family sponsorship reform. It’s important to do this in a way that prevents repeating this conversation again ten years from now. I call on my colleagues to put aside partisanship and posturing to have an honest debate about decades-long immigration issues and practical solutions that can pass both Houses of Congress and be signed into law. There are many immigration proposals being floated in the Senate that the House will not pass and the President won’t sign. Too many families are counting on us to do the right thing. Now is the time to get this done,” Lankford said. “This is the only bill that has a chance of becoming law, and that’s because it’s the only bill that will truly solve the underlying problem. It will protect those eligible for DACA but also make sure we don’t end up back here five years from now. By addressing our border security needs and limiting family sponsorship to the nuclear family, it goes far beyond the other half measures that have been proposed. This bill is generous, humane, and responsible, and now we should send it to the president’s desk,” Cotton said. "We must ensure a path forward for those who were brought here through no fault of their own as children, while also enforcing our laws, putting an end to illegal immigration, and strengthening our border security. This framework is a step toward addressing the legal, economic, and security concerns that are present in the current debate and the unique challenges that the DACA-eligible population faces, and I urge my colleagues to support this proposal,” Ernst said. The Secure and Succeed Act includes the four reform pillars agreed to during a bipartisan meeting with congressional leaders and President Trump in January: legal status for DACA recipients; increased border security; an end chain to migration; and an end to the diversity visa lottery.

02.08.2018	Washington, DC - United States Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) today introduced the Women Veterans Peer Counseling Enhancement Act to ensure the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Peer Support Program is equipped with an adequate amount of peer counselors to help address the mental health needs of women veterans. Representatives Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) and Elizabeth Esty (D-Conn.) originally introduced the companion legislation in the House of Representatives on December 13, 2017. The VA Peer Support Program currently employs more than 1,000 peer counselors in VA health care facilities and Community Based Outpatient Clinics around the nation who are trained to help veterans manage and overcome mental health conditions, substance use disorders, homelessness, and other challenges. Peer counselors are veterans themselves and can relate in profound ways to the mental health challenges facing veterans. Women veterans rely on the VA Peer Support Program and face significant mental health challenges. A 2016 VA report on veterans' mental health found that the "risk for suicide was 2.5 times higher among female veterans when compared with U.S. civilian adult women." The VA has also observed that women veterans "who experienced military sexual trauma, who have mental health conditions, and/or who are at risk of becoming homeless face numerous barriers in seeking and accessing assistance, including through VA." There's a demonstrable need for the VA to increase peer counselors with experience in issues affecting women veterans - but only about 16% of peer counselors are women. "Our veterans make incredible sacrifices to keep our nation safe, and we owe them a debt of gratitude for their service. Too often, women veterans face especially tough barriers to getting the mental health support services they need and are entitled to," said Senator Warren. "By increasing the number of VA peer counselors, our bill will help make sure that women veterans have better access to the care they deserve." "According to a VA report, the risk of suicide among female veterans is more than twice as high as female civilians," said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. "While we have been working to ensure female veterans receive the care they deserve, we must do more. Providing additional peer counselors who understand the unique struggles of a female veteran is another way we can better help our servicemembers transition back to civilian life. I am proud to join in this bipartisan and bicameral effort, and it's my hope that Congress will act quickly." "The VA's existing peer-to-peer counseling program has seen great success. This bill would build upon its proven record by creating a more representative program of the veteran population and focus on the mental health needs of female veterans. I appreciate the support of Sen. Warren and Sen. Ernst in pushing for this important legislation in the Senate," said Representative Coffman. "Supporting the women who put their lives on the line for our country is something we should all embrace," said Representative Esty, ranking member of the House Veterans Affairs Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee. "The peer-to-peer counseling program helps to ensure that the women who served in uniform, who often face higher risks for serious mental health challenges, will receive the care and support they deserve. I'm grateful for Sen. Warren, Sen. Ernst, and Rep. Coffman's efforts to further this important, bipartisan cause." The Women Veterans Peer Counseling Enhancement Act directs the VA Secretary to: Ensure that the VA hires a sufficient number of peer counselors providing mental health counseling services to women veterans. Emphasize the availability of peer counseling for women veterans who suffered sexual trauma while serving in military, endure post-traumatic stress disorder or other mental health condition, or are at risk of homelessness. Conduct outreach to inform women veterans about the VA's Peer Support program and the types of assistance offered under the program. Work with community organizations, state and local governments, school systems, business groups, legal aid groups, and other appropriate entities to support women veterans' transition to civilian life. The Women Veterans Peer Counseling Enhancement Act is endorsed by The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans, and Wounded Warrior Project.
02.07.2018	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today delivered remarks from the Senate floor urging confirmation of Iowan Bill Northey to be U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation. The Iowa Senator stressed the need to move forward with Mr. Northey’s placement at USDA to allow the extremely qualified nominee to “work on matters that truly are important, not just to Iowans and the Midwest, but to all of America.” Watch Senator Ernst full remarks here or by clicking on the image below. Senator Ernst previously questioned Mr. Northey at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, which unanimously approved his nomination in October of 2017.
02.07.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, today held a hearing on the Department of Defense’s (DoD) role in countering weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and defending the homeland against threats posed by near-peer competitors like China and Russia, as well as escalating threats posed by North Korea and Iran. Chairman Ernst opened the hearing by highlighting the troubling “increase of the proliferation of WMDs by rogue states and terrorist organizations that pose a direct and growing threat to our national security.” The Chairman pointed to the chemical warfare threats posed by North Korea, ISIS, and Syria and the need for a global strategy to combat these growing threats. Additionally, Ernst touched on the importance of readiness for a potential WMD attack on the homeland, and asked for an update on DoD’s capability to respond to such an attack. Watch Chairman Ernst’s opening statement here or by clicking on the image below. Chairman Ernst began by asking Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and Global Security Kenneth Rapuano which WMD threat concerned him most across all inner-agencies, to which he responded, “If we’re looking at the near term, clearly North Korea. North Korea is a primary concern and focus of the department”. Assistant Secretary Rapuano also touched on the DoD’s concerns regarding the evolving capabilities of Iran’s missile and weapons programs, and the rapid advancements in accessible biotechnology and biological agents that can present their own threats. The Chairman also followed up with both witnesses on the capabilities of terrorist groups, such as ISIS or al Qaeda’s ability to produce biological or chemical weapons. Watch Chairman Ernst’s first round of questions here or by clicking on the image below. Chairman Ernst then asked Assistant Secretary Rapuano to provide additional details on the DoD’s strategy for countering WMDs. Secretary Rapuano outlined the Department’s different “layers” of strategy used to deter and respond to attacks ranging from sanctions to military actions. The Assistant Secretary also provided additional details on the DoD’s course of action if there were an attack on the homeland, which includes National Guard and Title 10 military that are equipped to respond in the event of an attack. Watch Chairman Ernst’s second round of questions here or by clicking on the image below. In Chairman Ernst’s final round of questions, she discussed with Assistant Secretary Rapuano the DoD’s collaboration with other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and their efforts to protect livestock in the United States against diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease. The Assistant Secretary agreed that these are critical commodities to our economy and population’s needs; and assured the Chairman they are working in conjunction with USDA to combat these types of threats.

02.07.2018	(Washington, DC)— In a joint press conference today in the U.S. Capitol, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) unveiled their resolution and growing bipartisan support to establish a special committee in the Senate to investigate the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and USA Gymnastics regarding how team doctor Larry Nassar was allowed to sexually abuse female gymnasts over decades. “There’s now significant bipartisan support for establishing a special committee charged with the sole focus of investigating the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics,” said Shaheen. “There are many disturbing questions that remain unanswered as to how Larry Nassar was able to freely abuse young girls for decades. Because the U.S. Olympic Committee operates under a federal charter and its athletes compete under the American flag, the Senate has a responsibility to deliver answers and accountability. Today, Senator Ernst and I are urging Senate leadership to take up this legislation so that this special committee can begin this urgent work.” “We are introducing this bipartisan resolution to establish a special committee entirely focused on investigating how this abuse was allowed to go on for decades, why leaders of the USOC and USA Gymnastics failed to protect these women, and the path forward to put an end to this type of outrageous abuse,” said Ernst. “I’m so proud of the courageous young athletes who stood up and fought to ensure Larry Nassar can never lay his hands on another athlete. Now Congress has an opportunity to stand up for the brave survivors who came forward, for our athletes, for our children. I am proud to stand with Senator Shaheen and our colleagues to fight to stop this abuse once and for all.” The text of the resolution can be read here. The resolution is also cosponsored by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Steve Daines (R-MT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Tim Scott (R-SC), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Richard Burr (R-NC), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Tina Smith (D-MN). It also has the endorsement of the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence. Specifically, the resolution establishes a special committee of the Senate that is tasked with: Investigating the USOC and national sports governing bodies, including USA Gymnastics, and determining the extent to which these organizations were complicit in the criminal or negligent behavior of their employees relative to sexual abuse; Identifying and recommending solutions to the systemic failures at the USOC and national sports governing bodies, including USA Gymnastics, that allowed for pervasive sexual abuse to continue for decades; Identifying actions that must be taken by the USOC and national sports governing bodies, including USA Gymnastics, to ensure increased transparency and protections for children, athletes and their families; and Making findings and recommendations on any additional actions that may be necessary to hold the USOC and USA Gymnastics accountable. On Friday, Senators Shaheen and Ernst called on USOC CEO Scott Blackmun to step down in light of press reports that Blackmun was aware of sexual abuse allegations against ex-team USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar in 2015. This news came a week after Blackmun published a letter to Team USA, pledging an independent investigation to uncover “who knew what and when,” while failing to admit his own supposed direct knowledge of allegations that were brought to his attention.
02.07.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, introduced Dr. Howard Hill, the President of the National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) and a hog farmer from Cambridge, Iowa, at today’s hearing. The hearing, entitled “The Impact of Federal Environmental Regulations and Policies on American Farming and Ranching Communities” focused on the need to reform environmental regulations that have negatively impacted America’s rural communities and agricultural economy. As Senator Ernst noted, Dr. Hill has a background in veterinary medicine, and has served on the board of directors and co-chaired the NPPC’s Environmental Policy Committee. Watch her introduction of Dr. Hill here or by clicking on the image below. Watch the hearing and testimonies here.
02.06.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of senators in calling on Senate leadership to immediately reauthorize funding for community health centers. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (N.Y.), the senators expressed their strong support for community health centers, which provide access to cost-effective primary and preventive care for families across the country. “Community health centers serve a vital function, providing affordable health care to our nation’s most vulnerable citizens,” wrote the senators. “They provide quality medical, dental, vision and behavioral health care to more than 27 million patients, including 330,000 of our nation’s veterans and 8 million children, at over 10,000 sites nationwide. … Without extension of the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), community health centers will lose seventy percent of their funding. This will result in an estimated 2,800 site closures, the loss of 50,000 jobs, and approximately 9 million Americans losing access to their health care.” As the senators note in their letter, the CHCF expired on September 30, 2017. The failure to reauthorize the fund has jeopardized access to care for millions of Americans, and made it difficult for community health centers to adequately plan for everything from staffing needs to securing loans for capital projects. In addition to Ernst, the senators who signed on to the letter include: Roy Blunt (Mo.), Debbie Stabenow (Mic.), Tammy Baldwin (Wis.), Michael Bennet (Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (Conn.), Cory Booker (N.J.), John Boozman (Ark.), Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Maria Cantwell (Wash.), Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Ben Cardin (Md.), Tom Carper (Del.), Bob Casey (Pa.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Thad Cochran (Miss.), Christopher Coons (Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.), Mike Crapo (Idaho), Steve Daines (Mont.), Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Tammy Duckworth (Ill.), Dick Durbin (Ill.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Deb Fischer (Neb.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Kamala Harris (Calif.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Martin Heinrich (N.M.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.), Dean Heller (Nev.), Mazie Hirono (Hawaii), John Hoeven (N.D.), James Inhofe (Okla.), Johnny Isakson (Ga.), Doug Jones (Ala.), Tim Kaine (Va.), John Kennedy (La.), Angus King (Maine), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) Patrick Leahy (Vt.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Ed Markey (Mass.), Claire McCaskill (Mo.), Robert Menendez (N.J.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Jerry Moran (Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Chris Murphy (Conn.), Bill Nelson (Fla.), Gary Peters (Mich.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Jack Reed (R.I.), James Risch (Idaho), Bernie Sanders (Vt.), Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.), Tina Smith (Minn.), Jon Tester (Mont.), Thom Tillis (N.C.), Tom Udall (N.M.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Mark Warner (Va.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), and Roger Wicker (Miss.). A PDF of the letter is available here and the full text is below. February 5, 2018 The Honorable Mitch McConnell The Honorable Charles Schumer Majority Leader Minority Leader United States Senate United States Senate Washington, DC 20510 Washington, DC 20510 Dear Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer: We write to express our concern over funding for community health centers, which expired on September 30, 2017. We strongly urge you to reauthorize this funding immediately. Community health centers serve a vital function, providing affordable health care to our nation’s most vulnerable citizens. They provide quality medical, dental, vision and behavioral health care to more than 27 million patients, including 330,000 of our nation’s veterans and 8 million children, at over 10,000 sites nationwide. By offering preventative care, treating chronic conditions, and working to fight the opioid epidemic, community health centers are not only greatly improving the health and well-being of those they serve, they are also saving significant taxpayer dollars. Without extension of the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), community health centers will lose seventy percent of their funding. This will result in an estimated 2,800 site closures, the loss of 50,000 jobs, and approximately 9 million Americans losing access to their health care. Moreover, community health centers operate as small businesses and require a level of predictability to operate and respond to the needs of their communities. Since the expiration of the CHCF, community health centers have not been able to adequately plan for everything from staffing needs to securing loans for capital projects. In addition, the expiration of the National Health Service Corps and Teaching Health Centers Graduate Medical Education program threatens the ability of health centers to meet their workforce needs. For more than fifty years, community health centers have experienced strong bipartisan support. In fact, twenty bipartisan senators cosponsor legislation which reauthorizes funding not only for community health centers but also for the National Health Service Corps. We look forward to working with you to reach a bipartisan agreement to fund the community health center program and enable our community health centers to continue providing high quality and affordable care to those in need.
02.06.2018	WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) introduced bipartisan legislation along with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.) to restore veterans’ Second Amendment rights. Under current practice, once the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assigns a fiduciary to help a veteran manage benefit payments, the VA will report that veteran’s name to the National Criminal Instant Background Check System (NICS), commonly known as the national gun ban list. Once on the gun ban list, a veteran is outlawed from owning or possessing firearms, resulting in some veterans who are perfectly safe to own firearms being denied their constitutional rights. In order for veterans to get their names removed from the list, he or she must prove that they are not dangerous. That is a higher standard than the government must live by in order to place names on the list in the first place. If veterans have to prove they are not dangerous in order to get their firearms back, then the government ought to prove they are dangerous in order to take them away. “This improper application of existing regulations to service men and women is not only unfair, but arguably unconstitutional. Our veterans shouldn’t need to jump through hoops to be granted their constitutional rights, all the while the government isn’t subject to the same standards,” Grassley said. “I’m working to correct this outrageous and, frankly, unjustifiable process quickly and to prevent future injustices for our veterans.” “Our service members have sacrificed so much to protect our rights, and it’s critical that we ensure their rights are being protected,” Ernst said. “It’s absurd that our veterans are subject to this unjust scrutiny, and that they have been required to fight for what should be a constitutionally protected Second Amendment right. We must correct this injustice and I’m pleased to work with my colleagues to protect our veterans’ rights.” “As a law-abiding gun owner, hunter, card-carrying life member of the NRA and Second Amendment advocate, I have always strongly supported a West Virginian’s right to bear arms and that includes our veterans. Our veterans have put their lives on the line in defense of our freedoms and should not be subject to a different standard than the Americans they defended,” Manchin said. The Veterans’ Second Amendment Rights Restoration Act of 2018 would restore veterans’ constitutional rights by shifting the burden of proof from the veteran back to the government, requiring that before the VA reports a veteran’s name to the DOJ for placement on the NICS, the VA must first find that a veteran is a danger to self or others. The finding must also be done either through an administrative process managed by a board of three former judicial officers or administrative law judges or through a judicial process. The legislation puts the veteran in control of choosing the forum. Veterans already on the NICS list would be afforded the same legal avenues of redress to challenge their classification and undertake the same administrative or judicial route to remove their names from the NICS. Importantly, this bipartisan legislation does not impede the VA’s ability to report truly dangerous individuals to the NICS and would not automatically remove all veterans from the NICS. In addition, all existing federal firearm prohibitions laws would still be in effect. By ensuring that veterans have due process before their constitutional right to own firearms is stripped while still providing a means to report truly dangerous individuals to the NICS, this legislation both protects veterans’ Second Amendment rights and public safety. The Military Order of the Purple Heart, the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars are supportive of this legislation. The bill text is here. A summary of the bill is here.
02.06.2018	Washington, DC – In their continued efforts to secure the previously authorized funding for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and U.S. Representative Rod Blum (IA-01) sent a letter to Lieutenant General of the Army Corps of Engineers Todd Semonite and Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works R.D. James requesting further information on how the Army Corps makes certain project funding decisions. In their letter, the Iowa Members of Congress again highlighted the flawed benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) formula, which prioritizes projects in areas with higher property values and has kept projects in rural areas, such as the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, from receiving funding, despite two major flood events in the past decade. While the Cedar Rapids community has been able to rebuild, the lawmakers stressed that “assistance from the Corps remains vital to completing the project and protecting against another catastrophic flood event. “ They continued “As you are aware, the Corps has the discretion to fund projects with low BCRs if construction of the project would address a ‘significant risk to human safety.’ In the past several years, projects with BCRs below 3 have received funding through annual appropriations because of this discretion. To our knowledge, in FY 2017, the Corps funded five low BCR projects using this exception: (1) American River Watershed (Folsom Dam Modifications), CA – 2.2 BCR; (2) Santa Ana River Mainstem, CA – 2.1 BCR; (3) American River Watershed (Folsom Dam Raise), CA – 1.8 BCR; (4) Yuba River Basin, CA – 1.7 BCR; and (5) Raritan River Basin, NJ – 1.3 BCR.” The Cedar Rapids project has a BCR of 1.2. Ernst, Grassley and Blum added “As representatives of a rural, Midwestern state, we are troubled that all five of these projects are located in coastal states. We would like to know how the Corps determines which projects receive human safety exceptions.” They also reminded Semonite and James that “In recent testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, you both acknowledged the importance of the project and that the current BCR metrics put rural states and their cities—like Cedar Rapids—at a severe disadvantage.” This letter follows a recent meeting that Ernst and Grassley and Blum had with the Director of Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney, to discuss a path forward to ensure Iowa receives its long overdue authorized assistance for flood mitigation. Read their full letter here or below. Dear Secretary James and General Semonite, In 2008, Cedar Rapids, Iowa experienced a record-breaking, devastating flood event that caused approximately $5.4 billion in damages. To protect against future flood events, the city developed an extensive flood mitigation project, to which the State of Iowa and the city have committed approximately $400 million in funding. The private sector has also dedicated a large amount of its own resources to this project. To supplement these significant state, local, and private contributions, the 2014 Water Resources Reform and Development Act authorized approximately $73 million in federal funding for the project. In 2016, Cedar Rapids faced its second highest flooding event where approximately $6 million in emergency funding will have been spent on protection and recovery. This project was also listed in the 2016 water resources bill as one of nine projects to be expedited by the Corps. To date, no Corps construction funds have been budgeted for the project due to its low benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) of 1.2. The community has been able to rebuild its downtown area and improve flood protection infrastructure using state and local dollars and federal disaster funds, but assistance from the Corps remains vital to completing the project and protecting against another catastrophic flood event. Each year, millions of dollars are spent to implement emergency temporary protection measures and billions of dollars are spent to pay for emergency recovery efforts after each disaster. It would be a wiser course of action to build a permanent flood reduction structure once and spend millions, instead of spending billions over time in temporary emergency measures. This issue is of major importance to the City of Cedar Rapids and the State of Iowa. The delegation has had numerous discussions with the Corps and the Office of Management and Budget over the years where we have expressed how vital it is for this project to receive funding. In recent testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, you both acknowledged the importance of the project and that the current BCR metrics put rural states and their cities—like Cedar Rapids—at a severe disadvantage. As you are aware, the Corps has the discretion to fund projects with low BCRs if construction of the project would address a “significant risk to human safety.” In the past several years, projects with BCRs below 3 have received funding through annual appropriations because of this discretion. To our knowledge, in FY 2017, the Corps funded five low BCR projects using this exception: (1) American River Watershed (Folsom Dam Modifications), CA – 2.2 BCR; (2) Santa Ana River Mainstem, CA – 2.1 BCR; (3) American River Watershed (Folsom Dam Raise), CA – 1.8 BCR; (4) Yuba River Basin, CA – 1.7 BCR; and (5) Raritan River Basin, NJ – 1.3 BCR. As representatives of a rural, Midwestern state, we are troubled that all five of these projects are located in coastal states. We would like to know how the Corps determines which projects receive human safety exceptions. Please answer the following: Are there specific metrics the Corps uses to make this determination or is this a subjective, case-by-case process? What information is considered in making these determinations? Does the Corps consider the repeated costs of personal, local, city, state, and federal recovery efforts when determining human safety exceptions? Do human safety exceptions consider that flooding in communities often has a disproportionate impact on lower income individuals and neighborhoods that are least able to protect themselves from the loss of economic productivity and private property, which often causes long-lasting social disruption? Can you provide documentation of the data, stakeholder input, studies, etc. that were used to make the decisions to apply human safety exceptions to the five projects listed above? Who is involved in the decision-making process for human safety exceptions? Who makes the final determination whether to apply the exception? What low BCR projects are currently being considered for human safety exceptions? Is the Cedar Rapids project one of them? Thank you for your time and attention to this issue. We appreciate your willingness to work with us in finding a solution to this important funding matter. Sincerely, _________________________ Joni K.

02.02.2018	(Washington, DC)— Today, U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) called on U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) CEO Scott Blackmun to step down in light of press reports that Blackmun was aware of sexual abuse allegations against ex-team USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar in 2015. This news comes a week after Blackmun published a letter to Team USA, pledging an independent investigation to uncover “who knew what and when,” failing to admit his own supposed direct knowledge of allegations that were brought to his attention in July 2015. “While Larry Nassar will never be able to hurt another child, there are still many questions that remain about how he was able to commit these heinous crimes for so long,” said the Senators. “Reports detailing USOC leadership’s knowledge of abuse allegations against Nassar, which included Scott Blackmun, are deeply disturbing. If these reports are true, this goes far beyond negligence and raises serious questions of culpability at USOC, in which the most appropriate action would be for Scott Blackmun to resign. Just as Mr. Blackmun called on accountability from USA Gymnastics, so must he accept his share of responsibility. His inaction also further underscores the immediate need for a special committee in the Senate to complete a comprehensive investigation so that those at USOC and USA Gymnastics who were in positions of power and failed to intervene and protect American athletes, are held accountable.” According to the Wall Street Journal, USOC officials – including Blackmun – were aware of abuse allegations against Nassar, as well as an internal investigation against the ex-Team USA doctor. Throughout the investigation, Nassar continued to see patients. USOC’s role in the Nassar sexual abuse scandal has raised questions about the culpability of those in power of the federally charted institution that is responsible for American athletes. The Senators’ call for resignation follows a recent announcement that they will soon introduce a bipartisan resolution to establish a special committee to investigate the USOC and USA Gymnastics regarding how Larry Nassar was allowed to sexually abuse female gymnasts over decades.
02.02.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a town meeting in Hamilton County as part of her 99 county tour to hear from constituents in the area about the issues most important to them. This town meeting is open to the public. Saturday, February 10, 2018 Hamilton County Town Meeting 3:00 PM CT South Hamilton High School Auditorium 315 Division Street Jewell, IA At the end of the event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with press. NOTE: If you are a credentialed member of the media and plan to attend the event, please RSVP to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov.
01.31.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded Congress’ passage of S.534, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017. Ernst, a co-sponsor of the legislation, issued the following statement: “There can be no tolerance when it comes to sexual assault; we must do all we can to ensure young athletes are safe and protected. “This bipartisan bill would strengthen mandatory reporting of sexual assault allegations and require amateur sports organizations to develop and enforce policies to prevent these horrendous crimes from happening in the first place. I’m so pleased that Congress has come together to pass this important legislation, and it’s my hope the president will sign it as soon as possible. “We must also look into the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics’ role in the case of Larry Nassar, which is imperative to holding the appropriate parties accountable and working to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” Last week, Senator Ernst joined Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in calling for a Senate investigation of the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics regarding how team doctor Larry Nassar was given unsupervised access to female gymnasts, allowing him to sexually abuse them over decades.

01.30.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) tonight issued a statement following President Donald J. Trump’s State of the Union address: “Tonight, we heard a message of optimism from President Trump through his vision to continue keeping America safe, keeping America strong, and of course, remaining a proud America. “Already, under the Trump administration, we have seen tax reform signed into law for the first time in decades, which is helping to grow the economy and putting more money into the pockets of Iowans, while also eliminating an unnecessary tax break for Members of Congress through my SQUEAL Act. In addition, this administration has implemented our efforts to improve access to timely and quality care for our veterans; protected our citizens through Sarah’s Law; improved the readiness and strength of our military; and begun scrapping the Water of the United States (WOTUS) rule. “But there is a lot more work to be done. “As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I was pleased to hear the President discuss keys parts of his administration’s National Security Strategy which preserves peace through strength, protects the American way of life, sets America on a path to defeat any enemy, and prioritizes the need to continue working by, with, and through our allies to maintain global security. I’m also relieved to hear that President Trump will undo the Obama administration’s attempt to close Guantanamo Bay detention facility. The facility has housed many responsible for planning the attacks upon our nation on 9/11, and continues to imprison some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists. President Trump’s decision is an essential step in the right direction toward preserving our safety and security. “In addition to our national defense, the federal government has an important role to play in developing and maintaining our country’s infrastructure. Having a robust and efficient transportation infrastructure is vital to the economy, and I appreciated hearing from the president on this very issue tonight. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I look forward to working with this administration on a path forward to repair and modernize our aging infrastructure. “Another important topic before Congress is immigration reform and securing our borders. As I have said previously, the framework the president laid out is a good starting point for discussions in Congress. A path forward should be reflective of the legal, economic, and security concerns that are present in the current debate and the unique challenges that DACA recipients face. At the same time, we must also make sure that we are enforcing our laws and strengthening border security. In the time ahead, I look forward to continuing to review these ideas, and working with the administration and my colleagues in Congress to address them. “We also heard President Trump talk about trade, which plays an important role in Iowa’s economy. Iowans’ strong work ethic and ingenuity place our manufacturers, famers, and service providers in a position to compete in the global market – provided they are operating on a level playing field. I will continue to work with this administration toward trade deals that promote fairness by reducing trade barriers, enhancing transparency, and cutting red tape. “There has been a great deal of progress over the last year, and I look forward to building on these efforts with the administration on behalf of Iowans throughout 2018.”
01.30.2018	Washington D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined 35 of her colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump highlighting that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) benefits the United States and outlining how President Trump can improve the agreement. “NAFTA supports 14 million jobs, representing thousands of jobs in each of the 50 states,” the senators wrote. "Despite all of its benefits, however, we can do better and there are opportunities to improve the agreement. Modernizing NAFTA to increase market access, expand energy exports to maximize domestic energy production and including provisions on intellectual property and e-commerce will make this agreement even more beneficial to the United States.” Co-signatories include Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Rand Paul (R-KY), John Cornyn (R-TX), John Boozman (R-AR), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), John Thune (R-SD), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Rob Portman (R-OH), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), John Hoeven (R-ND), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jim Risch (R-ID), Todd Young (R-IN), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tim Scott (R-SC), Roger Wicker (R-MS), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), John Barrasso (R-WY), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Bob Corker (R-TN). The letter reads in full: Mr. President: We write today to reaffirm the benefits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and congratulate you on efforts to modernize the agreement and put America first. You have the opportunity to unleash the American economy like no President has done before and fuel historic growth. NAFTA has driven U.S. trade with Canada and Mexico to approximately $1.3 trillion annually. Whether manufacturers, farmers, or insurance providers, a wide range of industries in the U.S. have benefitted from this agreement and American consumers are reaping those benefits, too. Canadians and Mexicans buy nearly $500 billion worth of U.S. manufactured goods each year, translating to $37,000 in export revenue for every American factory worker, and U.S. agricultural exports to the two countries have quadrupled under the agreement from $8.9 billion in 1993 to $38.1 billion in 2016. NAFTA supports 14 million jobs, representing thousands of jobs in each of the 50 states. Despite all of its benefits, however, we can do better and there are opportunities to improve the agreement. Modernizing NAFTA to increase market access, expand energy exports to maximize domestic energy production and including provisions on intellectual property and e-commerce will make this agreement even more beneficial to the United States. Mr. President, your leadership has jump-started our economy. The recent tax reform bill is already leading to economic success across all industries and the stock market is at record highs. The next step to advance the economy requires that we keep NAFTA in place, but modernize it to better reflect our 21st century economy. We look forward to working with you and your Administration to make that modernization a reality and bring Americans even greater economic success.
01.30.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, questioned Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt on his efforts to roll back harmful rules and regulations. The Senator also addressed the EPA’s role in securing consumer access to E15, gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, year-round. Senator Ernst asked Administrator Pruitt about the status of the Reid vapor pressure waiver to eliminate restrictions on E15 ethanol blends. Administrator Pruitt stated the process to determine the agency’s legal authority over this matter continues, but agreed this is an important issue for Iowa stakeholders. Additionally, the Iowa Senator recalled a previous conversation with Administrator Pruitt last August where they discussed moving functions of the EPA and other federal agencies out of Washington, D.C. to regions across the nation where the decisions are felt firsthand. Ernst stressed that decentralizing decision makers would help prevent harmful regulations, like the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, from even being considered. Administrator Pruitt stated his support for looking at the benefits of locating “operational units” in each state to better serve the unique needs of an area. Watch Senator Ernst and Administrator Pruitt’s exchange here or by clicking on the image below. In her second round of questioning, Senator Ernst stated that as she travels on her 99 county tour of Iowa, businesses and manufacturers have said they are seeing tremendous economic growth due to the rolling back of regulations. Ernst asked how the agency will continue working to return power to the states and maintaining the current economic growth trend. Administrator Pruitt agreed that rules not rooted in statutes cause uncertainty for those affected by regulation, and that he will continue working to achieve “clarity, certainly, confidence” for the American people.

01.29.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Senate failed to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, legislation that would prohibit abortion after about five months post-fertilization, the point in development that science has shown unborn children can feel pain: “At five months, we know that babies can yawn, make faces, wiggle their ten fingers and ten toes, and feel pain. At just five months gestation, Micah Pickering from Newton, Iowa proved that a baby this small is so full of life. “The United States is only one of seven countries that allows abortions after about five months, putting us in the company of countries like China and North Korea. I am deeply saddened by the outcome of today’s vote and that some of my colleagues chose to stand with North Korea instead of innocent life. I cannot believe this is who we want to be as a nation. “I will continue to fight for these babies until they are given the life full of opportunity that they too deserve.” Senator Ernst has been a strong voice of the pro-life movement, and just last year, championed legislation that was signed into law by President Trump that overturned an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration, and restored decisions about the best eligible Title X providers to the states. The Iowa Senator has also led the fight to safeguard taxpayer funds for women’s health care by redirecting them from Planned Parenthood, which is the nation’s single largest provider of abortion, to other eligible entities like community health centers, which provide greater health care services but do not provide abortions. Senator Ernst delivered remarks from the Senate floor today urging her colleagues to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Watch her full remarks here.
01.26.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) responded to a December 21st letter she sent with Senator Grassley (R-IA) further inquiring into the hiring practices at the Iowa City VA: “While I am grateful the VA has taken concrete steps to fix their hiring practices, I am unsatisfied with the lack of transparency about their internal review on this matter to the public, the patients, and their family members. The public needs to know the extent of the VA’s illegal hiring of providers, and patients and their family members should be notified if they were under the care of a provider hired illegally. These are commonsense requests that will improve the quality of care for our veterans. As a result, I am looking into options that will push the VA to take the appropriate steps to increase transparency moving forward.” On December 4th, 2017, Senators Ernst and Grassley wrote VA Secretary Shulkin expressing concern and seeking information in response to a disturbing report that shed light on hiring practices at VA hospitals, including the Iowa City VA. In their December 21st response, the VA stated that the Iowa City VA doctor in question is no longer a VA employee and that they have “issued a new policy to ensure full compliance with the law and a national review to verify that this policy is being implemented correctly.” While the Iowa Senators were pleased to hear that actions to correct these missteps are taking place, they sent a follow up letter with additional questions. The response was received on January 25, 2018.

01.25.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), applauded the announcement to bring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act up for a vote on Monday, January 29th, 2018. Ernst, an original co-sponsor of the legislation that prohibits abortion after five months post-fertilization, issued the following statement: “I am so pleased that the Senate will have the opportunity to vote and protect our society’s most vulnerable. Next week, I will be voting yes in honor of my friend Micah Pickering, a five year old from Newton Iowa, who was born at just five months gestation and proved that these babies can survive outside of the womb. “There should be no disagreement when it comes to protecting the life of an unborn child that has reached the point of development at which he or she can feel pain. The United States is only one of seven countries that allows abortions after 20 weeks, putting us in the company of countries like China and North Korea. It’s my hope that my colleagues will choose to stand with life and not North Korea.” This month, Senator Ernst joined her fellow pro-life colleagues in a letter to Senator McConnell requesting a Senate vote on this legislation. Additionally, ahead of the annual March for Life earlier this month, the Senator delivered remarks on the Senate floor on the importance of protecting and celebrating life.
01.25.2018	Washington, DC—This afternoon, U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) welcomed support from Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) to establish a Senate investigation of the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics regarding how team doctor Larry Nassar was given unsupervised access to female gymnasts, allowing him to sexually abuse them over decades. Yesterday, in a letter to Senate leadership, Shaheen called for a select committee to be established before the Winter Olympic Games begin in February and called for an equal number of male and female members. Today, Senators Shaheen and Ernst announced their intention to introduce a bipartisan resolution to establish this select committee: “The U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics helped create the perfect environment for a child predator,” said Shaheen. “The criminal justice system has worked and Larry Nassar will be put away for the rest of his life, but it’s clear that not all responsible parties have been held accountable. We need to hold open public hearings and investigate how this sexual abuse was allowed to happen. I’m very encouraged to have Senator Ernst as a partner in this effort. Together, we’ll be urging broad bipartisan support for a Senate resolution to establish a select committee to conduct a thorough investigation to deliver answers and accountability.” “Larry Nassar’s reprehensible crimes are on full display and while some justice has finally been served, there are a great deal of questions that still remain,” said Ernst. “The reality is, from what we know, this happened to over a hundred athletes over several decades, on the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics’ watch. A Select Committee dedicating its complete attention to USOC’s and USA Gymnastics’ role in this tragedy is imperative to holding the appropriate parties accountable and working to ensure this doesn’t happen again.” In her letter, Senator Shaheen specifically called for a select committee so that it can be solely focused on this inquiry. A select committee will also allow for equal representation of male and female senators, as no current standing committees have parity. In addition, Senators Shaheen and Ernst are cosponsors of legislation introduced by Senator Dianne Feinstein that requires amateur athletic associations, including USA Gymnastics, to report abuse to authorities. They have urged the House to follow the Senate in passing this important legislation.
01.25.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst joined Senator Jim Inhofe and a bipartisan group of senators in a meeting with Karim Sinjari, Minister for the Interior of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq. “The Kurdistan region shares our democratic values and is a beacon of religious liberty in the Middle East. They are also a vital partner for the United States as we continue the fight against ISIS and Islamic extremism. I appreciated Minister Sinjari for taking the time to update us today about the current situation and challenges in Iraq as well as the KRG’s continued counterterrorism efforts,” Inhofe said. Senator Ernst (R-IA) added: “I enjoyed meeting with Kurdistan Interior Minister Karim Sinjari to discuss current events, including the war against ISIS. For years, the Kurdish Peshmerga forces have been a critical and reliable partner to the United States in our fight against terror. While significant progress has been made militarily, there is more to be done. It is my hope that the United States can continue to work with both the Kurdish Peshmerga and the Iraqi Security Forces to eradicate ISIS and restore stability to the region.” Senators Enzi (R-WY), Gardner (R-CO), Johnson (R-WI), Reed (D-RI) and Shaheen (D-NH) also attended the meeting, which included a discussion about the current security situation in Iraq and the increasing role Iran plays in the region.
01.23.2018	WASHINGTON – U.S. Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), John McCain (R-Ariz.), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) today introduced a bill to make permanent the temporary moratorium on congressional earmarks, which has been in effect since 2010. The Earmark Elimination Act would create a point of order against any provision contained within a bill that matches the definition of an earmark. An earmark is defined as any congressionally directed spending item, tax benefit, or tariff benefit targeted to a specific recipient or group of beneficiaries. This point of order would only apply to the earmark, not the entire bill. If the point of order is raised, the earmark would be stricken unless a two-thirds vote of the Senate waived the earmark point of order. “Earmarks cannot and should not be part of our legislative process – period,” said Ernst. “I was sent to Washington to cut wasteful spending and protect taxpayer dollars. This legislation prohibits Congress from reverting back to its reckless behavior and slipping special interest spending into legislation. I am glad to join my colleagues in this bipartisan effort to permanently ban earmarks, promote transparency, and better safeguard taxpayer dollars.” “It’s time to stick a fork in congressional pork with a permanent ban on earmarking,” said Flake. “Republicans were beaten like a borrowed mule in the 2006 elections largely because of the corruption associated with earmarks. Let’s not test the voters again by leaving the door open for a return to the pork barrel politics that sent members of Congress to prison and saddled taxpayers with a bridge to nowhere, a teapot museum, and countless other wasteful pet projects.” “Earmarks are the Washington swamp creature that just never seems to die—emerging from the lower depths every few years in an effort to waste taxpayer dollars on politicians’ pet projects,” said McCaskill. “Our bipartisan bill would ban their return by permanently ending the practice of pork-barrel patronage so we can ensure Missourians’ taxpayer dollars are protected from waste, and projects are prioritized on merit." "For years, earmarks fueled overspending in Washington and undermined the integrity of our legislative process. We cannot afford to allow Congress to ever resume this practice and play pork-barrel politics with taxpayer dollars,” said Toomey. “Now is the time to get rid of earmarking for good.” “The practice of congressional earmarks breeds corruption, leads to egregious overspending, and places the needs of special interests before those of the American people. Lifting the current moratorium on earmarks would only accelerate the erosion of public trust in Congress and send taxpayer dollars to unnecessary pork-barrel projects,” said McCain. For decades, I have fought the often lonely battle against earmarks, and I’m proud to join my colleagues today to introduce legislation that would make permanent the ban on this corrupting practice.” “Earmarks probably would make it easier for party leaders to pass some bills. But increasing the power of an already untrusted and unpopular party elite is not what Americans want or need,” said Lee. "Earmarks can’t bring back the trust Congress has squandered. Only transparency and accountability can do that." “Instead of debating whether earmarks should be revived, Congress should be pushing to ban earmarks permanently,” said Portman. “At a time of record debt, it is more important than ever to eliminate unnecessary pet projects and wasteful spending. I am happy to join Senator Flake on this important legislation.” “Our nation is currently more than $20 trillion in debt and faces projected deficits totaling at least $100 trillion over the next 30 years. Earmarks only exacerbate this problem and further mortgage our children’s future by funding unnecessary insider pet projects,” said Johnson. “Members of both parties have wisely abstained from this wasteful spending since 2011, and this bill would ensure it doesn’t return.” “We should remember why we stopped doing earmarks in the first place: their abuse eroded the public’s faith in Washington and helped foster a culture of mindless and wasteful spending. Bringing them back will not make Washington work again. Only elected officials faithful to the American people and Constitution can do that,” said Rubio. “I applaud my Senate colleagues for working in a bipartisan fashion to propose legislation to strengthen the current earmark moratorium, on the principle that spending decisions should be merit-based and made in the public eye.” “I share the belief of Nebraskans that Washington must bring spending under control. A return of earmarks in the legislative process would be a step backwards in our work toward this effort,” said Fischer. “That’s why I’m proud to help introduce this bipartisan bill to ensure Nebraskans’ hard-earned money is used responsibly and wisely.” To view a full-text PDF of the bill, click here.
01.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Earlier today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered remarks from the Senate floor on the Senate Democratic Leadership’s government shutdown. Watch Senator Ernst’s remarks here or by clicking on the image below.
01.22.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after Senate Democratic Leadership voted to end their shutdown: “I am pleased that Senate Democrats ended their completely unnecessary shutdown and voted to reopen the federal government and ensure that our men and women in uniform receive the certainty and compensation they deserve. “The reauthorization of CHIP is also critical to the approximately 80,000 Iowa children who depend on the program for access to important health care services, especially in rural and underserved areas. “However, simply put, our federal government cannot continue ‘operating’ from one short-sighted, band-aid funding bill to another. It’s my hope that the House acts quickly to pass this legislation, and that my colleagues and I can work together in the weeks ahead to establish plans to responsibly fund our government long-term, while also finding a solution for DACA recipients.”
01.20.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement regarding Senate Democrats’ decision to shut down the federal government: “Over the years, I’ve made clear that I don’t like funding our federal government from one short-sighted, band-aid bill to another. We must establish plans to responsibly fund our government long-term. “However, the extension voted on tonight would have reauthorized the Children’s Health Insurance Program for six years, providing approximately 80,000 Iowa children with access to important health care services, especially in rural and underserved areas. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats are playing political games and opposed our efforts to ensure this critical funding is in place for children in Iowa and across the country. “The Senate Democrats who chose to play politics with children’s health care also set arbitrary deadlines regarding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). America is a nation of immigrants, and our diversity is our strength. It’s incredibly important that we find a fix for DACA recipients as they are so important to our communities and to our future. Many young, undocumented children were brought here through no fault of their own. Congress has been and must continue to work together to identify and pursue a measured approach that addresses DACA recipients’ unique situation, and also respects the importance of our immigration laws, keeps our borders secure, and discourages future illegal immigration. There is still time to achieve a solution, but holding the government hostage and stalling important discussions on DACA is nonsensical. “Additionally, despite their rhetoric otherwise, Senate Democrats are turning their back on our men and women in uniform by putting our military’s resources and readiness in jeopardy. It is inexcusable. “It’s my hope that Senate Democrats will put their reckless games aside and start working with us on a path forward to fund the government, ensure low-income children have access to health care, provide the resources our military needs, and find a solution for DACA recipients.”
01.19.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Mattis released the National Defense Strategy. Senator Ernst, combat veteran and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, issued the following statement: “Today, Secretary Mattis delivered a National Defense Strategy that preserves peace through strength and protects the American way of life. After 10 years without a National Defense Strategy, this plan sets American on a path to ‘compete, deter and win’ against any enemy. To achieve these goals, the new strategy prioritizes the need to continue working by, with, and through our allies to maintain global security. “As near-peer adversaries like China and Russia continue to expand their military capabilities, this strategy makes clear we can no longer afford to sacrifice modernization. From rifles, to shipbuilding, to missile defense, it is critical that the U.S. maintain a competitive edge over countries that wish us harm. The National Defense Strategy calls for not only modernization of our warfighting equipment and capabilities, but innovation through the establishment of a National Security Innovation Base to ensure our force is more lethal and agile than ever before. “The threats posed by our top adversaries, China and Russia, in addition to those by North Korea, Iran, and global terrorism, demand a clear and concise strategy to guide the Department of Defense and prioritize our efforts. The National Defense Strategy seeks to address the emerging threats posed by our most advanced adversaries by increasing the lethality of our force. In order to maintain our military edge over these near-peer adversaries, the strategy also calls for an end to the burdensome and bureaucratic acquisition process plaguing the Department. As Chair of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I will continue to keep a watchful eye on technologically advanced adversaries such as North Korea and continue to promote the development of new capabilities vital to the defense of our homeland and American interests. “I am also encouraged to see an emphasis placed on creating a more efficient and agile Department that implements best practices to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent judiciously. In Congress, we must also do our part to provide our military with stable and long-term funding so the Pentagon can properly plan and execute the missions ahead. “I look forward to working with Secretary Mattis and my colleagues in Congress to protect the security of our nation.”
01.19.2018	WASINGTON – U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina), James Lankford (R-Oklahoma), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Steve Daines (R-Montana) and Roy Blunt (R-Missouri) have delivered a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell requesting that he schedule a vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The senators noted the legislation would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks—the point at which scientific evidence shows that unborn children can feel pain. The United States is currently one of only seven countries in the world that permit elective abortion after 20 weeks. Polling numbers consistently show that the majority of Americans support a ban on abortion at this stage of pregnancy; these Americans no longer want to keep the company of countries like China and North Korea. The full text of the letter is below. Tomorrow, hundreds of thousands of Americans from across the country will gather in Washington to take part in the 45th Annual March for Life. To coincide with the march, we write to respectfully request that you publicly announce your plans for a Senate vote on S. 2311, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. As you know, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act would prohibit abortion after 20 weeks—the point at which scientific evidence shows that unborn children can feel pain. The United States is currently one of only seven countries in the world that permit elective abortion after 20 weeks. Polling numbers consistently show that the majority of Americans support a ban on abortion at this stage of pregnancy; these Americans no longer want to keep the company of countries like China and North Korea. Twenty states have already passed legislation protecting unborn children beginning at 20 weeks of pregnancy. As pro-life marchers from every corner of our nation come to Washington this week, it is important that we announce a vote on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. A vote would make our constituents immediately aware of the members of Congress who support elective late-term abortions and oppose extending legal protection to pain-capable unborn children nationwide. Enclosed please find a letter from the leaders of pro-life organizations who represent millions of individuals and families across the country, voicing their support for a vote on this bill. We are all grateful for your pro-life leadership, and we look forward to seeing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act receive consideration on the Senate floor soon.
01.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), hosted a meeting in her office with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Congressman Rod Blum (IA-01), and Director of Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Mick Mulvaney to discuss an outstanding flood mitigation project in Iowa and a path forward to ensure Iowa receives its long overdue assistance. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “One of Iowa’s top infrastructure priorities is flood mitigation. Today, I reiterated to Director Mulvaney that Cedar Rapids has yet to receive the critical flood assistance needed from the Corps, despite the fact that it has already been authorized. Much of this is due to the flawed benefit-cost-ratio (BCR), and is something I have been pushing the Army Corps of Engineers to reevaluate. “As I have raised with both the President’s nominee to be Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. R.D. James, as well as Lieutenant General Semonite, I again emphasized to Director Mulvaney that the Corps’ benefit-cost-ratio for federal assistance favors coastal regions with a high property value, often leaving rural states and their cities, such as Cedar Rapids, at a disadvantage. Through my committee work, I have stressed that we must find a way to improve these metrics so our rural communities have an opportunity and do not continually remain a lower priority to the Corps. “Just yesterday, General Semonite agreed that the BCR metrics do need to be changed and that a ‘one-size fits all metric’ does not work. Additionally, last month, Mr. James agreed that the BCR metrics should be modified, and said, ‘it’s not right that there’s people in this country [who] will never, ever get any type of water infrastructure project under the current BCR analysis.’ Both committed to working with me and the OMB on modifying the BCR in a timely manner. “We explained the importance of this project to Director Mulvaney, and we are hopeful that he will work with us to explore all avenues that could result in ensuring this project receives the assistance that has been authorized for flood mitigation in Iowa.” PHOTO: Senators Ernst, Grassley, Congressman Blum, and Director Mulvaney discuss the outstanding flood mitigation project in Iowa. Ernst Efforts to Obtain Assistance for Iowa Flood Mitigation: Yesterday, at an EPW hearing, Senator Ernst again pushed for a commitment from Lieutenant General Todd Semonite, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to work to modify the current BCR metrics used by the Corps to determine which projects receive funding. Ernst stressed the way the BCR is currently calculated puts Cedar Rapids—and other communities in rural states and regions—at a disadvantage. General Semonite agreed that the BCR metrics do need to be changed and that a “one-size fits all metric” does not work. At a December 2017 EPW hearing, Senator Ernst received commitments from the nominee to be Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. R.D. James, to reevaluate and improve the current BCR metrics used by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine which Corps projects receive funding, in an effort to make those funds more accessible to rural states like Iowa. The 2016 Water Resources Development Act was signed into law, which included an Ernst provision for the Cedar Rapids flood control project.
01.18.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Ahead of the annual March for Life in Washington, D.C., U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today delivered remarks on the Senate floor on the importance of protecting and celebrating life. Watch Senator Ernst’s remarks here or by clicking on the image below.
01.17.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) again pushed for a commitment from Lieutenant General Todd T. Semonite, Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to work to modify the current benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) metrics used by the Corps to determine which projects receive funding. The way the BCR is currently calculated puts Cedar Rapids—and other communities in rural states and regions—at a disadvantage. General Semonite agreed that the BCR metrics do need to be changed and that a “one-size fits all metric” does not work. Additionally, Senator Ernst requested more information from the Corps on how it determines which projects receive funding under the “human safety” exception, which gives the Corps discretion to fund projects with low BCRs if it deems there is a “significant risk to human safety.” General Semonite stated that he would take a look at this decision-making process and if this exemption could be applied to the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Lieutenant General Semonite here or by clicking on the image below. Senator Ernst highlighted that the lack of federal funding for the Cedar Rapid’s flood mitigation project is due to its low BCR, and cited a commitment in December by the nominee to be Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. R.D. James, to modify the formula so that communities like Cedar Rapids have a better chance of receiving funding.
01.10.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, today delivered remarks on the Senate floor highlighting the positive impacts the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will have on Iowa’s farmers and rural communities. Watch Senator Ernst’s remarks here or by clicking on the image above. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law by President Trump in December, and also included Senator Ernst’s SQUEAL Act to eliminate a tax break for Members of Congress, as well as the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act, which helps spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas.
01.08.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, issued the following statement after President Trump delivered remarks at the American Farm Bureau Federation’s Annual Convention today: “Over the last year, this Administration has made great strides in providing relief to rural Americans and our agricultural community, including the sweeping tax reform that was just signed into law, which reduces the tax burden for rural Iowans. Additionally, the President has worked to reinvigorate our economy by rolling back harmful rules and regulations, such as the burdensome Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule. “Additionally, at the direction of the President, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity has worked to collect feedback from rural communities around the country. The priorities included in the report can play a vital role in strengthening our agricultural communities. Rural America is vital to our nation’s economy, and it’s my hope that these recommendations are turned into action for Iowans and rural communities across the nation.”
01.05.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced the launch of her 99 county tour for 2018 which includes public events in Montgomery and Boone counties. “In 2017 I heard from Iowans who were concerned about skyrocketing taxes, the rising costs of health care, and the harmful impacts of burdensome regulations. Throughout the year, I worked to translate those concerns into action in Washington,” said Senator Ernst. “While we have made some gains on behalf of Iowans, there is more work to be done in 2018. I am looking forward to my fourth 99 county tour as a U.S. Senator to continue hearing directly from Iowans so we can build on the progress we’ve made.” Details for the events are as follows: Montgomery County Coffee with Joni Sunday, January 14, 2018 2:00pm CT Montgomery County Family YMCA 101 East Cherry Street Red Oak, IA Boone County Boone County Town Meeting Monday, January 15, 2018 3:00pm CT Boone Community High School 500 7th Street Boone, IA At the end of each event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with press. NOTE: If you are a credentialed member of the media and plan to attend any of the events, please RSVP to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov.
01.03.2018	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the bipartisan Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act, introduced by Senators Ernst and Mazie Hirono (D-HI), unanimously passed the Senate. This legislation seeks to improve veterans’ access to health care services by expanding telehealth services – including mental health treatment - provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “All of our veterans must have access to quality and timely care, including life-saving mental health treatment, regardless of where they live,” said Senator Ernst. “The VETS Act would allow Iowa’s rural or disabled veterans to receive care from their own home by increasing telehealth and telemedicine services provided by the VA. With more than 200,000 veterans across Iowa, I am thrilled to see our bipartisan effort advance through the U.S. Senate so we can continue working to ensure better care for those who have sacrificed so much.” “The VETS Act will help Hawaii veterans access high quality VA care and health services when they need it, where they need it,” said Senator Hirono. “I urge the swift enactment of the bill and will continue to fight to ensure Hawaii veterans can access the care they need from a strong, well-resourced VA system.” About the VETS Act: Senators Ernst and Hirono first introduced the VETS Act in 2015, and reintroduced it in the 115th Congress in April of 2017. In August of 2017, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) announced it will expand telehealth services for veterans and provide telemedicine across state lines, mirroring efforts in the VETS Act. The VETS Act was included in the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2017 and was approved by the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs on November 29, 2017. The VETS Act seeks to improve health care access – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by allowing VA health officials to practice telemedicine across state lines if they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized federal duties. Additionally, the legislation ensures the VA and Congress provide oversight of the VA’s telehealth program by requiring the VA to measure program effectiveness.
12.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – As 2017 comes to a close, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released a series of initiatives and victories she led throughout the year on behalf of Iowans. “Over the last year, I’ve had the opportunity to talk with folks from any every corner of the state to hear exactly what is on their mind,” said Senator Ernst. “Across Iowa, folks made clear that they wanted to see Washington get to work, from simplifying the tax code, cutting reckless spending, and growing our economy, to protecting the RFS, strengthening our military, and ensuring our veterans receive timely and quality care. We have made significant progress in 2017, and I am looking forward to building on these gains in the new year.” HIGHLIGHTS Senator Ernst had three bills signed into law as standalones: The Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act Legislation to Restore States’ Ability to Make Funding Decision for Title X Providers Six Ernst-led bills signed into law as a part of legislation: Stop Questionable, Unnecessary, and Excessive Allowances for Legislators (SQUEAL) Act (Signed into law through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act (Signed into law through the National Defense Authorization Act) Suicide Prevention And Resilience Program For The National Guard And Reserves (Signed into law through the National Defense Authorization Act) Enhancement of Effective Prosecution and Defense in Courts-Martial (Signed into law through the National Defense Authorization Act) PRIVATE Act (Signed into law through the National Defense Authorization Act) Legislation to Examine Women-Owned Small Business Opportunities (Signed into law through the National Defense Authorization Act) The Iowa Senator helped introduce more than 25 bipartisan bills. October marked the completion of Senator Ernst’s third annual 99 county tour as a U.S. Senator. She held 16 public listening sessions and traveled across the state, visiting schools, small businesses, manufacturers, farms, and much more.

INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senators Ernst, King (I-ME), Donnelly (D-IN) and Collins (R-ME) introduced bipartisan legislation that would increase funding to successful U.S. Department of Agriculture export promotion programs and help U.S. farmers maintain an edge in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. The bill, the Cultivating Revitalization by Expanding American Agricultural Trade and Exports (CREAATE) Act, aims to revitalize the USDA’s export promotion programs, which generated a net return of $28.30 for every dollar invested between 1977 and 2014. Senator Ernst fought for and received assurances on biofuel volumes and the EPA’s commitment to follow both the letter and the spirit of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), as well as a commitment to not pursue other policies harmful to our farmers across Iowa. Sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Scott Pruitt asking him to examine a burdensome regulation that makes it more difficult to sell gasoline with ethanol content above ten percent, such as E15 year round. Led a letter along with Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) to Administrator Pruitt expressing support for the current point of obligation under the RFS, and urging the EPA to finalize its decision to reject the petitions for rulemaking to change it as soon as possible. Joined 22 senators in a bipartisan letter urging President Trump to maintain the point of obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and reject proposed changes that would upend the current successful system. Continued to push for legislation she cosponsored that would remove unnecessary regulatory hurdles that keep E15, and higher blends of ethanol, from being sold year round across the country. Offered commentary at the EPA public hearing for the proposed RFS for 2018, and the Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2019. Sent a letter to President Donald Trump expressing her concern over the EPA move to potentially set biodiesel volumes in the RFS for 2018 and 2019 at substantially lower volumes, which could in turn, hurt Iowa farmers, manufacturers, and rural communities. Sent a letter with a bipartisan group of senators to Administrator Scott Pruitt calling for a strong RFS as the agency works toward finalizing its rule on biofuels volume requirements for 2018 under the RFS. Joined Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) along with a bipartisan group of 28 other senators in urging the EPA to increase its proposed 2019 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for biodiesel to encourage growth in the industry and diversity in the nation’s energy supply, and to abandon its effort to reduce biofuel production in 2018. Met with Administrator Pruitt to express her significant concerns over the agency’s recent action to potentially set biodiesel volumes in the RFS for 2018 and 2019 at substantially lower volumes. Received key commitments for Iowa from Administrator Pruitt to support the spirit and the letter of the RFS. However, she expressed disappointed that the 2019 biodiesel numbers were held flat at the bare minimum level that the Administrator committed to.

The report was requested by Iowa Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley in March of 2016. GAO found low voluntary participation among pharmacies, citing high costs and confusion over compliance with federal regulations.

The Personnel Protection Equipment award is given to servicemembers whose lives were saved by their equipment, such as helmets or body armor.

Clarifies and revises the definition of a commercial item, to address concerns from small businesses who seek to sell items to both the Department of Defense and everyday Iowans. SIGNED INTO LAW: Senator Ernst cosponsored the Countering Iran’s Destabilizing Activities Act, introduced by Senator Bob Corker (R-TN).

The EMPOWERS Act would create pathways to opportunity by giving states the flexibility to pursue pilot projects that better address the challenges faced by low-income families and individuals. SIGNED INTO LAW IN TAX REFORM: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act (IIOA). The IIOA incentivizes investment in economically distressed areas by allowing trillions of dollars in private capital to be used to encourage small businesses, support entrepreneurs, and to develop dilapidated properties in zip codes most in need of a resurgence. PROTECTING LIFE SIGNED INTO LAW: Senator Ernst and Representative Black’s bicameral legislation to restore states’ ability to make funding decisions for Title X providers was signed into law by the president. The legislation overturned an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration that would have forced states to provide entities like Planned Parenthood with federal Title X dollars. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst, joined by 23 other Senators, introduced the Protect Funding for Women’s Health Care Act, which would prohibit federal taxpayer dollars from going to Planned Parenthood of America and its affiliates.

They have since initiated a rulemaking seeking to clarify whether bump-stocks constitute a machine gun. TRADE INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senators Ernst, Joe Donnelly (D-IN), and Rob Portman (R-OH), introduced bipartisan legislation that would ensure the American recreational vehicle industry, as it continues to expand and create jobs in American communities, has access to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) duty-free trade program. The bill would more accurately characterize current domestic economic production by requiring a review of trade data from the last three calendar years, as opposed to antiquated data from 1995, as currently required. Senator Ernst sent a letter to President Trump expressing her concern over reports that the U.S. might withdraw from the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS) and urged him to maintain the agreement.

During several Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee hearings, she questioned the head of the Army Corps of Engineers on working towards a solution for the city. Her questions focused on how the Corps’ cost-benefit metrics for federal assistance favors coastal regions with a high property value, which often leaves rural areas, such as Cedar Rapids, at a disadvantage. Senator Ernst also organized a meeting with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to discuss funding for the Cedar Rapids project. At an EPW hearing, Senator Ernst received commitments from the nominee to be Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. R.D. James, to reevaluate and improve the current benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) metrics used by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine which flood mitigation projects receive funding, in an effort to make those funds more accessible to rural states like Iowa. CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst was a co-sponsor of the Rebuild America Now Act, which aims to expedite the completion of infrastructure projects, with a focus on streamlining the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA). Often, the lengthy and complex NEPA review process is blamed for infrastructure project delays, which also increase construction costs. At EPW hearings on infrastructure, Senator Ernst stressed the importance of recognizing the differences between the infrastructure needs of rural states and more populated, coastal states. Her questions focused on the importance of transportation infrastructure to the agricultural economy, and the challenges associated with public-private partnerships in rural states.

Dave Loebsack, the Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA OIG) released results of its review of the circumstances of veteran Brandon Ketchum’s suicide and whether Ketchum received adequate mental health treatment at the Iowa City VA Health Care System. The lawmakers said they would hold the VA to these commitments.
12.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes the SQUEAL Act, into law: “This is a monumental moment for our country; this tax reform, on average, will provide every income group with tax relief. Under this law, middle- and low-income Iowans will see lower tax rates, ObamaCare’s costly individual mandate will be eliminated, folks will be able to keep more of their hard earned dollars, the child tax credit is doubled, and job creators of all sizes will be more competitive and can reinvest in their most important resource – their employees. “The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also included two of my provisions: the SQUEAL Act, which eliminates an unnecessary tax break for lawmakers, and the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act which helps spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas. I am thrilled to see my efforts and many other commonsense initiatives included in this long-overdue reform so that Iowans will finally be able to see relief from an overly-burdensome tax code, first-hand.” Senator Ernst’s efforts included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: SQUEAL Act The Investing in Opportunity Act
12.21.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Responding to a December 4th letter from Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) today said that the Iowa City VA doctor in question is no longer a VA employee and that they have “issued a new policy to ensure full compliance with the law and a national review to verify that this policy is being implemented correctly.” This follows a disturbing report that shed light on hiring practices at VA hospitals, including the Iowa City VA. While Iowa senators are pleased to hear that actions to correct these missteps are taking place, they are calling for more answers to their questions. The full text of Senator Ernst and Grassley’s letter is available here and below. The VA’s December 21st response letter, can be found here. Senator Ernst and Grassley’s original December 4th letter to the VA is available here. December 21, 2017 The Honorable David Shulkin Secretary U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington DC 20420 Dear Secretary Shulkin: On December 4, we wrote a letter to you requesting answers regarding hiring practices at the VA. We sent this letter because the VA knowingly hired a neurosurgeon who had his medical license revoked in one state, which goes against VA regulations. We appreciate your responses to our questions and are glad to hear corrective action is being taken. However, we would like you to provide additional clarification regarding your responses. Our first question asked for the “incorrect” guidance given to the Iowa City VA that allowed them to hire the neurosurgeon. In your response, you stated that the Iowa City VA relied on VA Handbook 5005/57. Please provide the page number and section in VA Handbook 5005/57 which “suggested” that the Iowa City VA could hire the neurosurgeon. Additionally, please explain how hospital officials were expected to reconcile the aforementioned section with the information on page 80 which states that “individuals are not eligible for appointment” if their license had been revoked in another state. You also stated that the VA issued new guidance that fully complies with current law, accordingly, please provide a reference to the newly issued guidance. We also asked what steps the VA is taking to determine how many providers at the Iowa City VA were hired illegally. In your response you stated that the VA has initiated a national review of currently appointed providers to ensure they meet all licensure qualifications. Will the results of the review be made public? Will patients and family members be notified if they received care from a provider who had been hired illegally? In addition, a recent USA Today report found that the VA has been hiring providers illegally since 2002. Will you expand the scope of your national review to examine providers hired from 2002 onwards? Please respond by January 22, 2018. Sincerely, Charles E. Grassley Joni K. Ernst United States Senator United States Senator
12.20.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Senate passed the final version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which includes Senator Ernst’s SQUEAL Act. “We are one step closer to helping hardworking, lower-and middle-income Iowans keep more of what they’ve earned. This tax reform package will also strengthen our economy and ensure job creators of all sizes see relief from an overly-complicated tax code. “Additionally, I am thrilled that two of my proposals have been included in the final bill; the SQUEAL Act ensures legislators are offering up their own unnecessary tax break for living expenses in the Washington, D.C. area, and our bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act will spur economic growth for many distressed rural communities across Iowa and the country.” The landmark tax reform package now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for a final vote, and then to the President’s desk for his signature.

12.14.2017	Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John Cornyn (R-TX), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Rob Portman (R-OH), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Kamala Harris (D-CA), and Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV) today introduced new bipartisan legislation that would overhaul the current process that victims of harassment and discrimination in Congress must go through when reporting a claim. The current process for victims of harassment and discrimination in Congress lacks transparency and is difficult to navigate. This legislation, the Congressional Harassment Reform Act, would bring transparency and accountability to the current process by extending protections to interns and fellows, eliminating forced mediation, ending the current required secrecy in the process by allowing victims to speak publicly about their case, requiring Members of Congress found personally liable for harassment to pay settlements out of their own pockets, and improving systems to address harassment and discrimination in Congress. “Congress should never be above the law or play by their own set of rules,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We should treat every person who works here with respect and dignity, and that means creating a climate where there is accountability, fairness, respect, and access to justice if sexual harassment takes place. There are real costs to sexual harassment in the workplace. We now know that many people quit their jobs because of it, or miss out on promotions or raises, all of which can throw off the entire trajectory in their careers. We must ensure that Congress handles complaints to create an environment where staffers can come forward if something happens to them without having to fear that it will ruin their careers. This bipartisan legislation would bring us much closer to that goal.” “Sexual harassment is wrong. Every person, man or woman, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect in the workplace,” said Senator Cruz. “In recent months, we've seen wave after wave of appalling sexual harassment and assault allegations -- from Hollywood, to newsrooms, to the halls of Congress. And powerful men who have abused their positions have been held to account. Congress is not above the laws, and secret settlements with taxpayer money to cover up harassment should no longer be tolerated. This legislation seeks to empower victims of harassment to report those crimes and to hold the perpetrators accountable." “There cannot be tolerance for any type of sexual harassment or abuse in our society. Congress must lead by example and immediately improve upon how it addresses allegations of sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination to make sure that those who have engaged in misconduct are held accountable and the victims are protected. This bipartisan legislation takes the necessary steps to provide victims with greater protections and choice, holds Members of Congress liable for their wrongdoings, and protects taxpayer dollars. Victims are coming forward and making their voices heard; it’s critical that we take action now to protect and defend them,” said Senator Ernst. “We’re finally experiencing a cultural shift in this country to a place where sexual abuse and harassment will no longer be tolerated, and Congress needs to lead by example. For starters, that means requiring training to prevent harassment and discrimination, ensuring that no one is silenced or retaliated against, and increasing accountability regarding settlements. Every person—regardless of where they work—should feel safe. Our bill will enact important and necessary reforms as part of a much larger movement,” said Senator Feinstein. “I am proud to join with a diverse bipartisan group of colleagues in proposing this comprehensive reform of congressional harassment policies. Quite honestly, I am appalled at the current policies and procedures in place regarding harassment claims in Congress and reports of settlement payouts. Looking back, Congress has been reluctant to apply basic civil rights protections to its own employees, and when it finally did, it included arduous requirements that seemed to protect the victimizer more than the victims. This is a significant piece of legislation which levels the playing field for victims, improves transparency, and holds members of Congress who use their positions of power in abusive ways personally liable to repay the government for the cost of their conduct. It is the strong medicine we’ve long needed to deter harassment in the congressional workplace and ensure that those who perpetrate it are held accountable. Every workplace should be a safe-haven for employees, free from any kind of harassment,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski. “We urgently need accountability in the halls of Congress,” said Senator Shaheen. “Those who’ve experienced sexual harassment on Capitol Hill face a daunting struggle to reach any semblance of justice and often have egregious restrictions that prevent them from speaking out. And it’s galling that the taxpayer, rather than the perpetrator, is on the hook for paying settlements. Congress must not be resistant to the awareness and accountability that is sweeping the country. This legislation makes long overdue reforms and I’m very encouraged by the bipartisan support. I urge leadership to quickly begin consideration of this important effort.” “Harassment must not be tolerated in any workplace, especially in Congress. This legislation will institute stronger policies and procedures to deter reprehensible behavior in the first place, and when it does occur, ensure just outcomes for victims,” said Senator Blumenthal. “While comprehensive, mandatory training is a straightforward and common-sense step to begin addressing workplace harassment on Capitol Hill, it is not sufficient. Allowing employees access to counseling, mediation and confidential advice will give survivors of harassment the resources and peace of mind they deserve in resolving the misconduct of employers and supervisors.” “We need to make major changes here in Congress and get our house in order. The current process for victims of sexual harassment or discrimination on Capitol Hill is difficult to navigate and lacks transparency. This needs to change and Senator Gillibrand’s bipartisan legislation will reform the current process so it works better for victims of sexual harassment or discrimination and provides more transparency to the public," said Senator Baldwin. “Sexual harassment in the workplace is a pervasive, persistent problem across the country and across industries, and Congress is certainly no exception,” said Senator Booker. “The current system for reporting sexual harassment in Congress is archaic, discourages justice, and focuses on protecting members and offices at the expense of survivors. This bipartisan bill is a much needed step toward creating a reporting system in Congress that puts the rights of survivors first and provides much needed accountability. The survivors of sexual harassment and assault have carried the burden of congressional inaction for far too long. It’s vital that Congress send a clear message to survivors that they are heard and supported, and to those who commit these atrocious acts that there’s no place for their behavior anywhere in our society.” “Sexual harassment and assault can leave lifelong scars on victims—which can be compounded by an arduous system of reporting,” said Senator Sullivan. “All of those in Congress must be respectful towards one another. I’m glad to cosponsor this bill that will mandate a much-needed overhaul in our reporting system. Victims and survivors need to know we’ll do all we can do in Congress to make sure that they are protected and that those who abuse their employees are held accountable.” “Over the past few months, our country has experienced a much-needed transformation when it comes to listening to courageous women share their stories about harassment. No one should be forced to work in an environment where they are made to feel uncomfortable or intimidated. Let me be extremely clear: sexual harassment and workplace misconduct has no place in America, and certainly has no place in the United States Congress,” said Senator Gardner. “I’m proud to join Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and my other colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to introduce this bipartisan legislation that reforms the way Congress deals with harassment. This legislation ensures we have an open, transparent process that does not leave the taxpayers on the hook for Members of Congress’ misconduct. I’m proud to introduce this bill today and call on each of my colleagues to support this important proposal.” "We know that the system in Congress for dealing with sexual harassment is broken, and we must continue working to empower all women and do everything we can to prevent sexual harassment, misconduct, and assault from occurring in the first place," Senator Hassan said. "This bipartisan bill is critical to those efforts, and I will keep working across the aisle to move this important measure forward and to help ensure a safe work environment for all." Specifically, the Congressional Harassment Reform Act would do the following: Extends protections to interns and fellows.Requires everyone working on Capitol Hill, including Members, to take the Office of Compliance training.Changes the name of the Office of Compliance (OOC) to the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights.Puts victims in the driver’s seat by allowing them to choose how to resolve their complaint (e.g. counseling and mediation are both no longer mandatory) and protecting their option to discuss their claim publicly.Establishes a Confidential Advisor to consult, on a confidential basis, with any employee who has alleged harassment or discrimination; and assist any employee who has an allegation under Title IV in understanding the procedures, and the significance of the procedures.Gives OOC’s General Counsel the authority to conduct interviews and gather evidence regarding complaints of covered harassment and discrimination filed under this section, including interviews with former employees.Allows individuals to work remotely without penalty throughout proceedings.Improves tracking of complaints and procedures by implementing an online platform.Requires that if a Member of Congress is found to be personally liable for harassment or discrimination, they will be responsible for the cost of any settlement.Requires that if a Member of Congress is found to be personally liable for harassment or discrimination, any settlement must be approved by the Senate or House Ethics Committee.Requires that all settlements will be publicly disclosed unless the victims choose to keep them private.Requires offices to post notices with information about employees’ rights and how to contact the Office of Compliance.Provides for a climate survey to identify the pervasiveness of the problem and what gaps continue to exist in its resolution.

12.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, released the following statement after President Trump signed the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, which included 37 of the Iowa Senator’s measures. “The National Defense Authorization Act is critical to the overarching mission of our servicemembers and our great nation. I am pleased President Trump signed this legislation into law and has made it a top priority to improve the readiness and strength of our military. Additionally, I am glad to see 37 of my provisions enacted into law, including my continued efforts to combat sexual assault and hold bad actors within our military accountable for their actions. I am grateful that this bipartisan defense package enacts these measures, and many more, to provide the necessary support for our men and women in uniform as they protect and defend our homeland.” Summary of Ernst Bills Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: S.1243 - Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act S.1316 - Suicide Prevention And Resilience Program For The National Guard And Reserves S.1408 - Enhancement of Effective Prosecution and Defense in Courts-Martial S.1296 - PRIVATE Act S.1038 - Legislation to Examine Women-Owned Small Business Opportunities Summary of Additional Ernst Provisions Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: A provision to ensure appropriate compensation for enlisted servicemembers. This derives from the Leadership Recognition Act which, in part, addresses these discrepancies by ensuring fair compensation among senior enlisted advisors. A provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army to award the Personnel Protection Equipment award of the Army to former members of the Army. The Personnel Protection Equipment award is given to servicemembers whose lives were saved by their equipment, such as helmets or body armor. A provision increasing the procurement of commercial off-the-shelf personal protective equipment, like body armor. Iowa is home to many companies that build military equipment, and even some who make the strongest body armor in the world. A provision restricting the Department of Defense from the use of reverse auctions and lowest price technically acceptable contracting methods when procuring critical safety items, like parachutes. This ensures the best parachutes are purchased for our servicemembers, not just the most cost-effective. A provision to modernize authority to help the country of Colombia to ensure the country is able to counter armed groups and terrorist organizations. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for the U.S. to address the rise of groups, like ISIS, in Latin America. A provision reviewing the Department of Defense’s effort to combat the funding of terrorism through the illicit trafficking in commodities, to include tobacco. A provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to partner forces to support U.S. special operations to combat irregular warfare threats. A provision extending the authority for and increasing the funding of lethal and non-lethal support to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. A provision extending the ban on military cooperation with Russia. A provision prohibiting any funding for activity that would recognize the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea. A provision extending U.S. anti-tunnel cooperation activities with Israel. A provision supporting U.S assistance to the Kosovo Security Force as it makes its transition to a multi-ethnic army for the Republic of Kosovo. A provision that would require the Secretary of the Navy to provide quarterly updates on the progress of the Navy’s Physiological Episode Team and their efforts to combat physiological episodes in jets. Physiological episodes create an unsafe, and potentially lethal, flying environment. A provision encouraging the Department of Defense to expand its efforts beyond lightweight polymer ammunition casing into polymer magazine pallets, rounds, and other related equipment. A provision that allows the U.S. Marine Corps to award M-1 rifles as trophies for marksmanship competitions. A provision recognizing computer-based human simulation testing Human Simulation Report Language, like that found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. Human simulation research lowers costs to enhance warfighter mobility, survivability, welfare and training. A provision recognizing military paint training facilities that perform painting and coating operations for the Department of Defense, a key program also found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. These training programs save the Department time and funding resources. A provision acknowledging injuries sustained by helicopter crewmembers due to the type of restraints in use. It encourages the Army to use the Mobile Aircrew Restraint System currently in use by the Air Force to reduce the number of injuries to crewmembers. A provision providing a technical change to last year’s provision for companies like Uber and Lyft to have access to bases. A provision that supports Department of Defense to start ride-share pilots on base to cut down on DUIs. A provision that underscores the importance of protecting the religious liberty of members of the Armed Forces and directs the Department of Defense – in consultation with commanders, chaplains, and judge advocates – to develop and implement a comprehensive training program on religious liberty issues. A provision recognizing the risk of Foot and Mouth Disease, or other foreign animal disease, to our food production economy and our national security. It directs the Department of Defense and Department of Agriculture to analyze our ability to respond to such an attack. A provision requiring a report on the adoption of project, program, and portfolio management standards within the Department of Defense.

A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to transfer excess and unused equipment from the Defense Distribution Depot to Rock Island Arsenal to be used to build new warfighting equipment. An amendment to authorize the expedited procurement of a commercially available off-the-shelf item or non-developmental item for a 7.62mm rifle capability. Cosponsored a report on the audit of the full financial statements of the Department of Defense. Cosponsored an amendment that encourages government entities to relocate to existing military installations with excess space, like Rock Island Arsenal, before leasing commercial space. A provision for temporary reutilization authorization for arsenals, depots, and plants. A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to establish a make-or-buy guidance illustrating what products should be made at organic industrial bases versus purchased from outside vendors. A provision that clarifies and revises the definition of a commercial item, to address concerns from small businesses who seek to sell items to both the Department of Defense and everyday Iowans.
12.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on the Trump Administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel: “I am pleased President Trump is following through on a promise made by many U.S. presidents in the past. Recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is an important step forward for Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East. It is essential that the United States continues to stand with our friends and trusted allies around the globe.”
12.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee hearing today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the committee, received commitments from the nominee to be Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, Mr. R.D. James, to reevaluate and improve the current benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR) metrics used by the Army Corps of Engineers to determine which flood mitigation projects receive funding, in an effort to make those funds more accessible to rural states like Iowa. Senator Ernst highlighted the devastation following recent floods in Iowa and described how efforts to protect Cedar Rapids from future floods have been hampered by the current BCR metrics. The Iowa Senator explained that despite being first authorized in the 2014 Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and then mentioned for prioritization in WRDA 2016, the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project has been unable to secure federal funding due to a low BCR that results from the relatively low property values in the area. Mr. James agreed with Senator Ernst that the BCR metrics should be modified, and said, “it’s not right that there’s people in this country [who] will never, ever get any type of water infrastructure project under the current BCR analysis.” Mr. James also committed to working with Senator Ernst and the Office of Management and Budget on modifying the BCR in a timely manner.

12.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, issued the following statement after Iowan Glen Smith was confirmed by the Senate to be a member of the Farm Credit Administration Board: “I’m so pleased to see Iowa’s own Glen Smith confirmed today by the Senate to serve as a member of the Farm Credit Administration Board. Glen has an impressive resume as a small business owner and farmer. He has worked for decades to enhance and promote our agricultural economy in Iowa, and I have no doubt he will do the same for our country in his new role.” Senator Ernst introduced Mr. Smith ahead of his testimony before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry last month. Watch Senator Ernst’s introduction here.
12.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following a letter of response from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding a recent report that details unauthorized waiting lists outside of the VA patient tracking system for some mental health appointments that date back to 2006, Iowa’s U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley this week each met with VA Deputy Secretary Tom Bowman. Following these meetings, the Iowa Senators issued the following joint statement: “During our meetings, we each stressed that prompt care for our veterans is absolutely critical. As we’ve made clear, it’s important that our veterans and the public know what disciplinary measures are being applied by the VA. “Deputy Secretary Bowman stated that individuals identified as being culpable for the secret waitlists will be held accountable. In the two cases he referenced, the individuals resigned and the circumstances regarding their departure will be part of their record. The VA has pledged to provide documentation on the disciplinary action taken against each of the culpable employees. The VA has also committed to issuing further guidance to make it absolutely clear that unofficial waitlists are not permissible. We will continue to hold the VA accountable and ensure they follow through on these commitments.” Additionally, the VA stated that they are working to assess the situation at the Iowa City VA and will be answering the questions in the letter sent by Senators Ernst and Grassley yesterday, following a disturbing report that shed light on hiring practices at VA hospitals.
12.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a meeting at the White House with President Trump and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today stressed the importance of ensuring that any changes made to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) do not negatively impact the agricultural industry. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “Today I stressed to President Trump and Trade Representative Lighthizer the importance of maintaining NAFTA, and the duty free access our ag products enjoy under it. “Trade plays a critical role in Iowa’s economy, and I reiterated to the administration the importance of ensuring Iowans remain competitive in the global market – provided our trading partners are operating on a level playing field. I will continue working to ensure that any changes made to NAFTA do not hurt our crop and livestock producers.” BACKGROUND May 15, 2017: Senators Stress Economic Benefits of NAFTA to New U.S. Trade Rep June 28, 2017: Ernst Joins Senators to Urge USTR to Strengthen Agricultural Trade in NAFTA Negotiations November 20, 2017: Senators Call on Commerce Secretary to Conduct Economic Analysis of NAFTA Changes to Ag Sector
12.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Iowa Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) expressing concern and seeking information over a disturbing report that shines a light on hiring practices at VA hospitals, including the Iowa City VA. The senators wrote, “It should go without saying that physicians hired by the VA should be fit to practice and have a track record of providing quality care. However, a disturbing report in USA Today found that the VA has knowingly hired providers who have a history of providing substandard care. “A neurosurgeon featured in the article had ‘a dozen malpractice claims and settlements in two states’ and had his license revoked in one state, yet he was hired to work at the Iowa City VA this April.” The Iowa senators noted that this hiring goes against the Veterans Health Administration Handbook. The report specifically cites an Iowa City VA neurosurgeon who was hired even though “licensure revocation and other malpractice claims were on his application,” all of which should have prevented him from being lawfully employed by the VA in the first place. Senators Ernst and Grassley are now seeking answers from the VA as to how this individual was hired, and the actions the VA will take if they determine other providers were hired illegally. Additionally, the Senators requested insight into the VA’s hiring practices to better ensure that Iowa’s veterans receive the care they deserve. The full text of the letter is available here and below. December 4, 2017 The Honorable David Shulkin Secretary U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington DC 20420 Dear Secretary Shulkin: Veterans who receive care through the VA deserve the highest standard of care available. This high standard applies throughout an entire episode of care, but is most critical when a veteran sees their physicians. It should go without saying that physicians hired by the VA should be fit to practice and have a track record of providing quality care. However, a disturbing report in USA Today found that the VA has knowingly hired providers who have a history of providing substandard care. A neurosurgeon featured in the article had “a dozen malpractice claims and settlements in two states” and had his license revoked in one state, yet he was hired to work at the Iowa City VA this April. His hiring goes against Veterans Health Administration Handbook 1100.19 which states: “Applicants…who had such license, registration, or certification revoked for professional misconduct, professional incompetence, or substandard care by any of those States, or voluntarily relinquished a license, registration or certification in any of those States after being notified in writing by that State of potential termination for professional misconduct, professional incompetence, or substandard care, are not eligible for appointment.” According to the report, the neurosurgeon’s licensure revocation and other malpractice claims were on his application. It is unacceptable that it was only as a result of USA Today’s report that the VA determined that hiring this neurosurgeon was illegal. Accordingly please provide the following: 1) Please describe the “incorrect” guidance that was given to hospital officials in Iowa City that led to the hiring of the neurosurgeon. 2) On his application the neurosurgeon listed the previous malpractice suits and the revocation of his medical license. As part of his contract with the VA, was the neurosurgeon required to be monitored while providing care? 3) The VA is initiating an “independent, third-party clinical review” of the care the neurosurgeon provided. Will the results of the third-party review be shared with the patients and their families? 4) What steps is the VA taking to determine how many providers at the Iowa City VA were hired illegally and what actions will the VA take if they determine that additional providers were hired illegally? 5) What discretion do VA hospital officials have in regard to hiring providers who have not had their licenses revoked but have had problems with their State Licensing boards? Thank you for your attention. Please respond by December 11, 2017. Sincerely,
12.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the Senate passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which includes the SQUEAL Act: “Today, the Senate took a monumental step forward in pursuing a simpler tax code that provides much-needed relief for hardworking Iowans and helps strengthen our economy. It also eliminates ObamaCare’s costly individual mandate that forces Americans to buy health insurance that is in many cases for Iowans, unaffordable. “Additionally, I am thrilled that the SQUEAL Act is included in this tax reform legislation. My proposal will force Congress to offer up its own unnecessary tax break that allows Members of Congress to deduct, for income tax purposes, thousands of dollars annually in living expenses while in the Washington, D.C. area. “This Senate bill also includes a bipartisan measure I helped lead to spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas, and bring hope and opportunity back to many distressed rural communities in Iowa. “Moreover, job creators of all sizes will finally see relief from the burdensome and complicated tax code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would allow Iowa small businesses and entrepreneurs to keep more of their hard-earned dollars to reinvest in their companies, and is estimated to create over 10,000 jobs across Iowa. This legislation also gives more money back to Iowa’s hardworking parents by doubling the child tax credit. “While the bill does not include everything I hoped, I am pleased that this legislation creates more opportunities for all, including lower- and middle-income families across the State of Iowa who will see thousands of dollars back in their pockets. I look forward to seeing this important bill move ahead to reduce the burden of our overly-complicated tax code and enact reforms that provide relief to Iowa’s hard-working families and businesses.” Senator Ernst’s efforts included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: SQUEAL Act The Investing in Opportunity Act Read Senator Ernst’s recent column in the Des Moines Register on the importance of tax reform here.

The legislation requires that all open recommendations from inspectors general (IG) at federal agencies that have remained unimplemented for more than a year be posted to a single, searchable website. This legislation would allow Congress and the public to keep better tabs on the problems that have been identified at the federal agencies where IGs conduct audits to combat waste, fraud, and abuse – and keep track of whether or not steps have been taken to resolve those problems. IGs serve as federal watchdogs within government agencies by investigating agencies and recommending how to improve operations and transparency on issues ranging from cybersecurity to federal hiring practices. For the third consecutive year, the IGs identified in their recommendations over $20 billion in potential taxpayer savings. However, there is currently no standard requirement for how IGs organize and maintain open recommendations on their websites, and the quality of publicly available information varies from agency to agency. “Each year, our government invests in the important work of inspectors general. Unfortunately, it’s often difficult for taxpayers to assess whether a federal agency is listening to inspector general recommendations and making good-faith efforts to correct major issues that could help the federal government work better,” said Heitkamp. “Our bipartisan bill would allow the public to better hold government agencies and their leadership accountable by making sure the work of inspectors general gets the full and public analysis it deserves. That way recommendations are put to good use and tax dollars are used efficiently.” “Inspectors General play a critical role in the oversight of our federal agencies,” said Ernst. “I am glad to join Senator Heitkamp in this bipartisan effort to make the recommendations made by the Inspectors General more accessible and transparent so we can better combat waste and abuse in our federal agencies.” Heitkamp has been consistently working with the IG community on ways to implement key elements of this bill to help improve transparency and accountability across the federal government. As members of the Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management Subcommittee within the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Heitkamp – the ranking member – and Ernst held a subcommittee hearing on how federal departments and agencies implement recommendations from the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the offices of inspectors general. Before the launch of this legislation, Heitkamp met with U.S. Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz to discuss ways to improve Congressional oversight of his agency’s recommendations.
11.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, made the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their final rule on Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2018 along with setting the 2019 RVOs for biodiesel: “Today, the EPA has upheld their commitment to set the volume requirements for conventional ethanol for 2018 at approved levels, and I am pleased that this administration is keeping its pledge to rural America to support the RFS. However, I am disappointed that the 2019 biodiesel numbers were held flat at the bare minimum level that the Administrator committed to. Moving forward, I will continue pressing the EPA to further bolster the biodiesel and cellulosic requirements. “I am glad to see my efforts, and those of my colleagues, to hold the EPA accountable to the letter and spirit of the RFS as intended by Congress have been successful thus far, and I will continue working tirelessly to protect and defend the RFS.”
11.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the Senate voted to begin debate on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: “I am pleased that today we voted to begin debate on the much-needed tax reform package. It is estimated that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would create over 10,000 jobs across Iowa, and that on average, low and middle-income earners would see thousands of dollars added back into their pockets. “It also includes a bipartisan measure that I helped lead to incentivize private investment in struggling communities so we can spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas, and bring hope and opportunity back to many distressed rural communities in Iowa. “Additionally, I am offering two amendments; the SQUEAL Act and the bipartisan Credit For Caring Act. The SQUEAL Act would force Congress to lead by example and offer up its own unnecessary tax break that allows Members of Congress to deduct, for income tax purposes, thousands of dollars annually in living expenses while in the Washington, D.C. area. Meanwhile, the Credit for Caring Act would provide working family caregivers with a nonrefundable tax credit up to $3,000 to assist with out-of-pocket expenses related to caregiving. These are two important reforms that I hope to see included on the Senate floor. “As debate proceeds, I look forward to working with my colleagues on this long-overdue effort to simplify our tax code, and to create more opportunities for all.” NOTE: A motion to proceed to consider is “a motion, usually offered by the majority leader to bring a bill or other measure up for consideration.”
11.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, issued the following statement after the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs passed legislation that includes the bipartisan Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act. The VETS Act, led by Senators Ernst and Mazie Hirono (D-HI), seeks to improve health care access – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “I am thrilled that our bipartisan efforts to expand veterans’ access to telehealth services was included in the Caring for Our Veterans Act of 2017, and approved by committee today on a bipartisan basis,” said Senator Ernst. “With over 200,000 veterans across Iowa, it is imperative that we continue looking for ways to create opportunities to increase access to quality and timely care – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans. “As the Care for our Veterans Act heads to the Senate floor, I look forward to continuing to review the legislation as it is finalized.” About the VETS Act: Senators Ernst and Hirono first introduced the VETS Act in 2015, and reintroduced it in the 115th Congress in April of 2017. In August of 2017, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) announced it will expand telehealth services for veterans and provide telemedicine across state lines, mirroring efforts in the VETS Act. The VETS Act seeks to improve health care access – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by allowing VA health officials to practice telemedicine across state lines if they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized federal duties. Additionally, the legislation ensures the VA and Congress provide oversight of the VA’s telehealth program by requiring the VA to measure program effectiveness.
11.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, made the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reaffirmed Administrator Pruitt's previously stated commitment that he will support the spirit and the letter of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): “I'm pleased to see reports that reaffirm EPA Administrator Pruitt's previously stated commitment to me and my colleagues, that he will support the spirit and the letter of the RFS as intended by Congress. “As I have said before, these assurances are a win for Iowans. I am grateful that the Administration is keeping its pledge to rural America to advance the full potential of the RFS, and I will continue to work tirelessly to protect and defend the RFS.”
11.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, led a bipartisan congressional delegation, including Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), and Congressmen David Young (R-IA), Keith Rothfus (R-PA), and Rob Wittman (R-VA) to Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq to thank U.S. servicemembers for their service and sacrifice ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. The congressional delegation also met with senior military and diplomatic leaders in the region to receive updates on continued anti-terrorism efforts, including the fight against ISIS and the Taliban. Senator Ernst, a former company commander in the Iowa National Guard and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, visited with approximately 35 Iowa Army National Guard soldiers stationed at Kandahar Air Field in Afghanistan and others throughout the region. As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, Senator Ernst has oversight over numerous commands and agencies within the Department of Defense, including Special Operations Command. As such, she coordinated classified briefings in Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq, so the delegation could hear directly from Special Operators and their chain of command about battlefield realities. She also led diplomatic discussions regarding stability efforts concurrent with Operations Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Resolute Support in Afghanistan, and follow-on strategies. After their visit, the senators and congressmen made the following statements: “In this season of thanksgiving, it was an honor to visit with our Iowa soldiers who are away from their loved ones at the holidays, and to thank them for the sacrifices they make – and those of their families – to protect all that we hold dear,” said Senator Ernst. “Additionally, hearing more about their efforts to support, protect, and defend the United States and our international partners from those on the ground was invaluable, particularly as we work to enact the National Defense Authorization Act, which is critical to ensure our troops have the resources and equipment they need to combat the evolving global threats confronting America.” “Michigan servicemembers and their families sacrifice so much in defense of our nation and our way of life - missing milestones in their childrens’ lives and spending their holidays thousands of miles away from home,” said Senator Peters, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve. “I couldn’t be more honored to personally thank our men and women stationed abroad for their service. America's military is the strongest in the world because of their valor and dedication.” “The women and men in our military are the bravest among us. It was an honor to meet with service members from Iowa, hear their stories and collect messages to send back to their loved ones,” said Congressman Young. “Hearing from Iowans in our military and leaders on the ground about the successes, challenges, and needs of our troops provides me with greater insight as we address issues affecting our military and national security in Congress.” “It was an honor to meet with our Pennsylvanian service members who are away from their loved ones during this holiday season. In this time of thanksgiving, I am grateful for these courageous men and women -- and their families -- for their selfless sacrifices to protect our country,” said Congressman Rothfus. “At this time of year, we all want to be close with family. However, our men and women in uniform are often not afforded that opportunity,” said Congressman Wittman. “It was an honor to meet with the brave individuals who are currently serving our country in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Kuwait. Each time I visit this area of the world, I learn more about ways that Congress can be more effective. It is important to see first-hand what our forces need in order to be their voice back in Washington. We face a wide array of threats around the globe and we must provide the authorities and resources for our men and women of the Armed Forces to do the job we've asked them to do.” Senator Ernst leads congressional delegation, and visits with Iowa Army National Guard soldiers, in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Senator Peters meets with Michigan servicemembers in Afghanistan. Congressman Young meets with members of the military as part of a Congressional Delegation to Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Iraq. Congressman Rothfus visits with Pennsylvania service members Hope Bunce, Brian Faust, and Edmund Willis. Congressman Wittman visits with soldiers and leaders of the Aviation Task Force in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
11.21.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regarding a recent report in the Omaha World-Herald that details unauthorized waiting lists outside of the VA patient tracking system for some mental health appointments that date back to 2006. Today’s letter follows a recent letter from the Iowa Senators to VA Secretary Shulkin regarding a similar report of waitlists dating back to 2014. While they received a response regarding corrective actions in place, the letter today requests that the ongoing investigation include the reports of unauthorized waitlists in 2006. “As we stated in our first letter, it is important for veterans and taxpayers to know what disciplinary measures are being applied,” Senators Ernst and Grassley wrote. “We request that you keep us informed on how the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to hold culpable individuals accountable to ensure that this situation will not reoccur and the extent to which the scope of the VA's ongoing investigation will include the older waitlists.” The full text of the letter is available here and below: November 21, 2017 The Honorable David Shulkin Secretary U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Washington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary Shulkin: Last month, we wrote to you seeking information on unauthorized waiting lists outside the VA patient tracking system for some mental health appointments at the VA facility in Omaha. We appreciated your prompt response and were glad to hear that corrective action is being taken so this does not happen again. Our first letter was prompted by a report that found some wait lists dating back to 2014. A recent report in the Omaha World-Herald, however, found that there was a previous use of unauthorized waitlists dating back to 2006. This report indicated that there were corrective actions taken previously, which were apparently not entirely successful in that the use of unauthorized waitlists reoccurred. As we stated in our first letter, it is important for veterans and taxpayers to know what disciplinary measures are being applied. We request that you keep us informed on how the Department of Veterans Affairs plans to hold culpable individuals accountable to ensure that this situation will not reoccur and the extent to which the scope of the VA's ongoing investigation will include the older waitlists. Thank you for your attention. Please respond by December 1, 2017. Sincerely,
11.20.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today joined her colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross asking the administration to conduct a robust economic analysis to evaluate how any changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would affect changes to the nation’s crop and livestock sectors. “It is imperative that before any changes are made to NAFTA, or any other free trade agreement, that economic analysis that illustrates the impact on the full supply chain of the industries involved be shared. As such, we request an economic analysis that examines and evaluates the impacts to crop and livestock sectors as a result of any change to NAFTA,” the senators wrote. As the world’s top exporter of food and agricultural products, U.S. agriculture depends on access to international markets in which to sell their products. With the fifth round of NAFTA renegotiations underway, the senators were clear that any changes to U.S. trade policy must be positive for agriculture, especially in a time when many farmers and ranchers are struggling financially. The bipartisan letter included the support of Senators John Boozman (R-AR), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Cornyn (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Rob Portman (R-OH), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Luther Strange (R-AL), John Thune (R-SD) and Thom Tillis (R-ND). The full text of the letter is below and can also be found here: Dear Secretary Ross, As Senators representing states with significant agricultural economies, we write to you today to underscore the vital role that agriculture plays throughout our home states and across America. Given your recent comments regarding agriculture and international trade, we find it essential that Congress’ voice be heard. The U.S. is the world’s top exporter of food and agricultural products and is an important economic driver that stimulates prosperity and jobs throughout rural America. According to USDA, every $1 in agricultural exports generates an additional $1.27 in economic activity, and every $1 billion in farm exports supports 8,000 jobs. In fact, the data shows the benefits of agricultural trade align with many of the Administration’s goals and priorities – supports U.S. jobs, encourages U.S. investment, and fosters economic growth within the U.S. The agriculture industry does not want to see momentum hindered especially at a time when net farm income has declined by approximately 50 percent over the past four years. It is imperative that before any changes are made to NAFTA, or any other free trade agreement, that economic analysis that illustrates the impact on the full supply chain of the industries involved be shared. As such, we request an economic analysis that examines and evaluates the impacts to crop and livestock sectors as a result of any change to NAFTA. With 95 percent of consumers residing outside of the U.S., farmers and ranchers must have access to export markets to sell their high-quality product. Free trade agreements have allowed the U.S. agriculture industry to establish itself as a trusted supplier. International markets have taken years to build, and it is imperative that no steps be taken to jeopardize these gains. We must continue to move the global presence of U.S. agricultural products forward, not backward. As the Administration works to strengthen current trade agreements and negotiate new agreements, we ask that you support the important role that agriculture plays in the nation’s economy. We look forward to working with you to ensure a strong marketplace for our farmers and ranchers. Sincerely,
11.17.2017	Washington, D.C. – In a major step toward helping distressed communities nationwide, the bipartisan Investing in Opportunity Act (IIOA) passed out of the Finance Committee as a part of the tax reform bill that will be voted on by the full Senate in the coming weeks. The IIOA incentivizes investment in economically distressed areas by allowing trillions of dollars in private capital to be used to encourage small businesses, support entrepreneurs, and to develop dilapidated properties in zip codes most in need of a resurgence. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a cosponsor, joined the legislation’s lead sponsor, Senator Tim Scott (R-SC), along with several of their colleagues, in issuing statements following the IIOA’s inclusion in the tax reform bill: “I am thrilled that our legislation, the Investing in Opportunity Act, has been included in the Senate tax reform plan,” said Sen. Ernst (R-IA). “This provision compliments much-needed tax relief for low and middle-income earners. By incentivizing private investment in struggling communities, it would spur economic growth in poverty-stricken areas, bringing hope and opportunity back to many distressed rural communities in Iowa.” “Since I entered Congress, my goal was simple: create opportunity for everyday Americans wherever possible,” said Scott. “It is a passion because I grew up in a single-parent household, surrounded in poverty, with very little expectation that I would find my way to success. But I learned that opportunity can truly be the difference that changes the course of one’s life. I know that when the IIOA is passed, when it actually reaches the people it’s intended to help, the results will be truly amazing because it will help everyday people in South Carolina and beyond build their way to a brighter future.” “It’s time to give our middle class the boost they need following several years of job loss and economic distress,” said Sen. Capito (R-WV).“The Investing in Opportunity Act can help spur growth in these communities and level the playing field, creating new opportunity in West Virginia and other regions. I’m pleased to see it included in the latest version of the Senate’s tax proposal.” “As a fifth generation Coloradan who grew up on the Eastern Plains, I know how important it is to attract growth to local communities, and particularly rural communities, in Colorado,” said Sen. Gardner (R-CO). “The Investing in Opportunity Act will encourage investment, incite growth, and extend opportunities to communities that are struggling. This commonsense legislation is a stepping stone to restoring faith in the American Dream for some people who feel like they have been left behind.” "Too many low-income Ohioans have been left behind as our broken tax code hampered economic growth," said Sen. Portman (R-OH). "I’m pleased that the Investing in Opportunity Act was included in our landmark tax reform package to pave the way for long-term investments in Ohio’s small businesses and entrepreneurs, which in turn means more jobs and opportunities for the families in distressed communities across our state. Every hard-working Ohioan should be able to reach their God-given potential." "Lack of opportunity is a common circumstance in distressed communities across the country," said Sen. Young (R-IN). "This proposal is a common-sense way to unleash investment and entrepreneurship in distressed communities to create hope and new opportunity. Ultimately, this is exactly the kind of behavior we should strive to promote and incentivize." There are currently 52 million Americans living in distressed communities across the country, and trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains sitting on the sidelines. The IIOA would provide an opportunity for U.S. investors to use a temporary capital gains referral in exchange for investing the capital in these communities. This public-private partnership will create new channels for investment that will grow jobs, inspire entrepreneurship, and improve the local economy for future generations.
11.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, released the following statement after the Senate passed the bipartisan Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The final package includes 37 of the Iowa Senator’s measures and now heads to the president’s desk. “The National Defense Authorization Act ensures our servicemembers have the resources, equipment, and support they need to continue defending our nation. I am pleased to see several of my efforts that aim to increase the strength and readiness of our military were included in the final package. Additionally, this bipartisan bill includes my continued efforts to thwart military sexual assault and streamline the process by which we hold bad actors accountable for their actions in the military. I thank my colleagues for their work on this important legislation, and hope the President will sign this legislation into law as soon as possible.” Summary of Ernst Bills Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: S.1243 - Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act S.1316 - Suicide Prevention And Resilience Program For The National Guard And Reserves S.1408 - Enhancement of Effective Prosecution and Defense in Courts-Martial S.1296 - PRIVATE Act S.1038 - Legislation to Examine Women-Owned Small Business Opportunities Summary of Additional Ernst Provisions Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: A provision to ensure appropriate compensation for enlisted servicemembers. This derives from the Leadership Recognition Act which, in part, addresses these discrepancies by ensuring fair compensation among senior enlisted advisors. A provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army to award the Personnel Protection Equipment award of the Army to former members of the Army. The Personnel Protection Equipment award is given to servicemembers whose lives were saved by their equipment, such as helmets or body armor. A provision increasing the procurement of commercial off-the-shelf personal protective equipment, like body armor. Iowa is home to many companies that build military equipment, and even some who make the strongest body armor in the world. A provision restricting the Department of Defense from the use of reverse auctions and lowest price technically acceptable contracting methods when procuring critical safety items, like parachutes. This ensures the best parachutes are purchased for our servicemembers, not just the most cost-effective. A provision to modernize authority to help the country of Colombia to ensure the country is able to counter armed groups and terrorist organizations. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for the U.S. to address the rise of groups, like ISIS, in Latin America. A provision reviewing the Department of Defense’s effort to combat the funding of terrorism through the illicit trafficking in commodities, to include tobacco. A provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to partner forces to support U.S. special operations to combat irregular warfare threats. A provision extending the authority for and increasing the funding of lethal and non-lethal support to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. A provision extending the ban on military cooperation with Russia. A provision prohibiting any funding for activity that would recognize the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea. A provision extending U.S. anti-tunnel cooperation activities with Israel. A provision supporting U.S assistance to the Kosovo Security Force as it makes its transition to a multi-ethnic army for the Republic of Kosovo. A provision that would require the Secretary of the Navy to provide quarterly updates on the progress of the Navy’s Physiological Episode Team and their efforts to combat physiological episodes in jets. Physiological episodes create an unsafe, and potentially lethal, flying environment. A provision encouraging the Department of Defense to expand its efforts beyond lightweight polymer ammunition casing into polymer magazine pallets, rounds, and other related equipment. A provision that allows the U.S. Marine Corps to award M-1 rifles as trophies for marksmanship competitions. A provision recognizing computer-based human simulation testing Human Simulation Report Language, like that found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. Human simulation research lowers costs to enhance warfighter mobility, survivability, welfare and training. A provision recognizing military paint training facilities that perform painting and coating operations for the Department of Defense, a key program also found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. These training programs save the Department time and funding resources. A provision acknowledging injuries sustained by helicopter crewmembers due to the type of restraints in use. It encourages the Army to use the Mobile Aircrew Restraint System currently in use by the Air Force to reduce the number of injuries to crewmembers. A provision providing a technical change to last year’s provision for companies like Uber and Lyft to have access to bases. A provision that supports Department of Defense to start ride-share pilots on base to cut down on DUIs. A provision that underscores the importance of protecting the religious liberty of members of the Armed Forces and directs the Department of Defense – in consultation with commanders, chaplains, and judge advocates – to develop and implement a comprehensive training program on religious liberty issues. A provision recognizing the risk of Foot and Mouth Disease, or other foreign animal disease, to our food production economy and our national security. It directs the Department of Defense and Department of Agriculture to analyze our ability to respond to such an attack. A provision requiring a report on the adoption of project, program, and portfolio management standards within the Department of Defense. A provision that recognizes our adversaries’ use of low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and the United States’ need to expand its capability to protect against UAS threats. A provision requiring a report on the Department of Defense’s implementation of direct hiring authorities for military spouses. A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to transfer excess and unused equipment from the Defense Distribution Depot to Rock Island Arsenal to be used to build new warfighting equipment. An amendment to authorize the expedited procurement of a commercially available off-the-shelf item or non-developmental item for a 7.62mm rifle capability. Cosponsored a report on the audit of the full financial statements of the Department of Defense. Cosponsored an amendment that encourages government entities to relocate to existing military installations with excess space, like Rock Island Arsenal, before leasing commercial space. A provision for temporary reutilization authorization for arsenals, depots, and plants. A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to establish a make-or-buy guidance illustrating what products should be made at organic industrial bases versus purchased from outside vendors. A provision that clarifies and revises the definition of a commercial item, to address concerns from small businesses who seek to sell items to both the Department of Defense and everyday Iowans.

In Washington, Senator Ernst serves on four Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Environment and Public Works; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
11.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) released the findings of a study into the Drug Enforcement Agency’s (DEA) implementation of regulations that create potential barriers to the participation of local pharmacies in federal drug take-back programs. The report was requested by Iowa Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley in March of 2016. Following the release of the GAO’s report, Senators Ernst and Grassley issued the following statement: “The GAO’s report found low voluntary participation among pharmacies, citing high costs and confusion over compliance with federal regulations. While we are disappointed in the GAO report’s findings, we cannot allow regulations to get in the way of participation in this critical program. Prescription drug take-back programs are a necessary and effective part of an all-of-the-above strategy in combatting the opioid epidemic, and we are looking at ways to increase participation moving forward.” Read the GAO’s report here.
11.09.2017	WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, reintroduced the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment (SAVE) Act. The bipartisan Military SAVE Act puts military sexual trauma (MST) survivors in control of their health care by giving them the opportunity, flexibility, and discretion to choose treatment options that best suit their needs. Under this legislation, if the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not meet the needs of MST survivors, the Military SAVE Act gives all MST survivors the option to seek prompt care at a non-VA facility of their choice. This enables MST survivors to find a trusted provider who has the specialized training and expertise to care for these complex and sensitive cases. “This year’s National Defense Authorization Act continues to build upon my bipartisan efforts to thwart sexual assault, but we must continue working to make sure victims of these heinous crimes receive quality and timely care,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “Our bipartisan effort would give military sexual trauma survivors greater choice to determine their own trusted health care provider. This Congress must act to ensure victims of military sexual assault have access to immediate care, and the support they need.” “Survivors of sexual assault have unique treatment needs, and they should be able to seek treatment with a provider they trust,” said McCaskill, a former sex crimes prosecutor. “We’ve got to ensure victims have a range of choices about the type of treatment that’s best for them—whether in or out of the VA system—with a specialized provider. Our bipartisan bill is a simple, commonsense fix to empower victims and make that choice possible.” About the Military SAVE Act: The Military SAVE Act amends the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act to allow veterans who are MST survivors to choose health care providers outside the VA, regardless of certain eligibility requirements. The option to access non-VA care applies to injuries directly related to military sexual trauma while serving in the military on active duty or in training. Survivors of MST would contact the Veterans Choice Card benefits hotline in order to report a documented or previously unreported sexual assault during their military service – these veterans would receive automatic authorization to private care without having to satisfy any other conditions.
11.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry held a hearing to consider the nomination of Iowan, Glen Smith, to be a member of the Farm Credit Administration Board.

11.07.2017	WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) as well as Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have today introduced a senate resolution that would mandate sexual harassment prevention training for all employees of the Senate. “As a body of elected officials, we Senators have an obligation to set an example. Establishing a healthy and productive work environment should be no exception to that obligation. We should do everything possible to make sure our colleagues and staffs don’t have to endure harassment if we can prevent it,” Senator Grassley said. “Trainings like this are important for cultivating the right kind of working environment and setting the baseline standards that any place of work should have.” “Women deserve to feel safe at work, and every employer and employee—including the U.S. Senate—must take sexual harassment seriously. Our resolution makes clear that all Senate employees should be trained in this area and that harassment will not be tolerated. We’re also working on legislation to reform the Senate’s process for handling complaints so that victims can come forward with confidence and violators face appropriate consequences,” Senator Feinstein said. “Sexual harassment training should be mandatory in the United States Senate,” said Senator Klobuchar, Ranking Member of the Senate Rules Committee. “I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and my Rules Committee colleagues to pass and implement this important update to Senate policy.” “There is no place for sexual harassment on our college campuses, in our workplace, our gyms, our military – or anywhere else,” said Senator Ernst. “It is critical that Congress has zero tolerance for such inappropriate behavior and action in our society. I am glad to join my colleagues in this measure to ensure that Members of the Senate and their staffs are provided with the necessary training on prevention and reporting procedures to combat sexual harassment.” “I am proud to join a bipartisan group of my colleagues to introduce this resolution to help combat sexual harassment in Congress,” said Senator Gillibrand. “What we are seeing from the powerful #MeToo campaign is that sexual assault and sexual harassment are pervasive across our entire society. What you see time and again in institutions all around the country is a culture where power and fear keep sexual assault and sexual harassment in the shadows. Congress is no different. Congress should never be above the law or play by their own set of rules. This bipartisan resolution would help hold this institution accountable by mandating sexual harassment prevention training for Members, interns and their staffs.” “Sexual harassment—under any circumstance and in any setting—is simply unacceptable. As members of Congress and staff serving the American people, we have a responsibly to set an example of what it means to foster an appropriate and respectful work environment,” Senator Capito said. “This resolution will help ensure our policies reflect these priorities and make it clear that sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the United States Senate.” The bipartisan “Senate Training on Prevention of Sexual Harassment” or “STOP Sexual Harassment” resolution (S. Res. 323) requires all Senate members, staff, interns, fellows and detailees to complete the sexual harassment prevention training offered by the Office of Compliance (OOC) or the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment. The training must be completed no later than 60 days after starting work in the Senate. Further, the Committee on Rules and Administration is to issue rules about periodic completion of the training. The resolution also calls for an anonymous survey to be administered by the Sergeant at Arms that will gather information about instances of sexual harassment or related behavior in the Senate. The congressional Office of Compliance (OOC) was established under the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, a statute that Grassley sponsored to ensure that Congress follows the same civil rights, labor, workplace safety and health laws as other federal agencies and the private sector. OOC and the Office of the Senate Chief Counsel for Employment offer sexual harassment training to Senate offices, but this training is not mandatory. This resolution aims to change that.

11.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Congressman David Schweikert (AZ-06), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, introduced the House companion to U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s bill known as the Stop Questionable, Unnecessary, and Excessive Allowances for Legislators (SQUEAL) Act. This bill would eliminate a provision of the tax code that allows U.S. Senators and Representatives to deduct, for income tax purposes, up to $3,000 annually in living expenses while in the Washington, D.C. area. “As we work together to eliminate wasteful loopholes in our tax code, the place we need to start is the thousands of dollars in tax deductions set aside for Members of Congress,” said Congressman Schweikert. “I am excited to work with Senator Ernst on this first step towards a simpler, equitable tax code.” “If Congress is going to get serious about tax reform and lower tax rates for hardworking families and businesses, a good place to start is by eliminating the thousands of dollars in a tax break for Members of Congress,” said Senator Ernst. “I’m thrilled to have Congressman Schweikert’s support in the House as we call on Congress to lead by example and offer up its own unnecessary tax break.” About the SQUEAL Act: The Code of Federal Regulations defines living-expenses as meals, lodging, and other incidental expenses. Under our current tax code, taxpayers are allowed to claim business-expense deductions for unreimbursed travel expenses incurred while they are away from their principal place of business (“home”). For the purposes of this deduction, a Member of Congress’ “home” is the state or district they represent – not Washington, D.C. where they work. Due to this loophole, legislators are allowed to claim deductions for their living-expenses while working in Washington, D.C., even though they spend a significant amount of time working there. Senator Ernst’s SQUEAL Act eliminates the provision of the tax code that allows Members of Congress to deduct up to $3,000 in D.C.-based living expenses from their income taxes per year.

10.31.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst introduced the Stop Questionable, Unnecessary, and Excessive Allowances for Legislators Act, also known as the SQUEAL Act, to cut perks for elected officials and make Washington squeal. This legislation would eliminate a provision of the tax code that allows Members of Congress to deduct, for income tax purposes, up to $3,000 annually in living expenses while in the Washington, D.C. area. “Iowans sent me to Congress to make Washington, D.C. squeal and that includes eliminating handouts to politicians,” said Senator Ernst. “To achieve the ultimate goal of lowering tax rates for hardworking families and businesses, Congress is going to have to eliminate various loopholes and deductions in our outdated tax code. Congress should lead by example and offer up its own unnecessary tax break.” About the SQUEAL Act: The Code of Federal Regulations defines living-expenses as meals, lodging, and other incidental expenses. Under our current tax code, taxpayers are allowed to claim business-expense deductions for unreimbursed travel expenses incurred while they are away from their principal place of business (“home”).

Senator Ernst’s SQUEAL Act eliminates the provision of the tax code that allows Members of Congress to deduct up to $3,000 in D.C.-based living expenses from their income taxes per year. Since elected to Congress, Senator Ernst has worked to identify areas of reckless spending in the federal government, and looked for solutions to reduce our nation’s $20 trillion debt. Most recently, the Senator reintroduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017 to cut the perks received by former presidents. Read the full text of Senator Ernst’s SQUEAL Act here.
10.31.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Joni Ernst (R-IA), co-chairs of the Senate RV Caucus, along with Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), today introduced bipartisan legislation that would ensure the American recreational vehicle industry, as it continues to expand and create jobs in American communities, has access to the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) duty-free trade program. The bill would more accurately characterize current domestic economic production by requiring a review of trade data from the last three calendar years, as opposed to antiquated data from 1995, as currently required. Donnelly said, “This bipartisan proposal would make a common sense change to ensure the federal government uses current data, as originally intended, in determining participation in a duty-free trade program. The Indiana RV industry and other manufacturers could potentially benefit, allowing for greater economic growth in northern Indiana. I’m proud to introduce this bill with Senators Ernst and Portman to support the thousands of Hoosier workers in the RV industry and the local businesses that help provide opportunities for Hoosier families.” Ernst said, “At present, manufacturers could see an increase in tariffs on certain imports that are important not only to Iowa, but our country. This bipartisan bill offers a straightforward approach to modernize outdated trade policy, offering relief from tariffs for our manufacturers.” Portman said, “This bill makes a common sense change to the GSP statute. Decisions about GSP-eligibility should be based on actual market considerations, rather than conditions that existed in 1995. That’s ancient history. By merely changing the date in the statute, this simple bill makes a key update to help American businesses – such as iconic motorhome manufacturer and Ohio company, Airstream – better source products not found in the United States.” The proposal would modernize a waiver process that allows the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) to provide duty-free treatment to certain items as long as current domestic production of the item is taken into account. Under current law, antiquated trade data from 1995 is reviewed to make such a determination, whereas this proposal would update that requirement to more accurately characterize current production as within the last three calendar years and also move the deadline for annual waiver decisions from July 1 to October 15 to allow for the review of full-year trade data in making a determination.
10.30.2017	WASHINGTON – Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst received a response from Veterans Affairs Department Secretary David Shulkin regarding an inquiry seeking information on reported unauthorized waiting lists outside the VA patient tracking system for some mental health appointments at the VA facility in Omaha. In his response to Grassley and Ernst, Shulkin said that an internal audit found that 87 veterans encountered delays from employees improperly managing the Electronic Waiting List in spring 2017. Shulkin also said that “one employee who was involved retired and one resigned,” and that an “investigation is ongoing into the culpability of additional subordinate employees.” The investigation is scheduled to be completed by the end of the month. In addition, Shulkin noted that the VA is taking additional steps to prevent a similar situation from happening again. Grassley and Ernst made the following comment. “We’re glad our concerns appear to be taken seriously, and we appreciate the responsiveness of Secretary Shulkin. While the VA indicated that it has taken corrective action, more should be done department-wide to ensure employees are properly trained to prevent situations like this from happening again. We look forward to reviewing the results of the investigation once it concludes.” Grassley and Ernst have long worked to improve veterans’ services, particularly those involving mental health and suicide prevention.
10.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following recent reports of reckless spending by agency heads on travel accommodations, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro requesting the Government Accountability Office (GAO) look into whether the travel by federal officials within the executive branch are cost effective and abide by the rules of the federal agency. In the letter, Senator Ernst cited the U.S Code that requires employees to use the most “expeditious means of transportation” possible and should correspond “with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.” Senator Ernst continued, stating that “unfortunately, it does not appear that agency heads are living up to the standards of this statute”. The Iowa Senator asked the GAO the following: Are agency heads, political appointees, and career officials within the executive branch traveling in a cost-effective manner? Are the rules and procedures regarding the travel of agency heads, political appointees, and career officials effective in upholding 5 U.S.C. § 5733 and ensuring that the executive branch officials travel in a cost-effective manner? Are these regulations consistent across agencies within the executive branch? She also requested “that the GAO’s report include recommendations for actions that can be taken by Congress and the executive branch to ensure that travel by federal officials is done in a cost-effective manner and that the regulations governing executive branch officials are effective and consistent across the executive branch.” The full text of Senator Ernst’s letter to GAO Comptroller Dodaro can be found here or below. The Honorable Gene L. Dodaro Comptroller General of the United States 441 G Street, NW Washington, DC 20548 Dear Mr. Dodaro, I am writing to request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) investigate travel by federal officials within the executive branch. According to the U.S. Code, “The travel of an employee shall be by the most expeditious means of transportation practicable and shall be commensurate with the nature and purpose of the duties of the employee requiring such travel.” Unfortunately, it does not appear that agency heads are living up to the standards set by this statute. This fall, reports emerged that Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price took numerous trips on private planes this year. According to some estimates, Secretary Price's 26 trips on private jets cost taxpayers over $400,000. Troubling reports have also surfaced regarding the travel of other agency heads. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Office of Inspector General is currently reviewing whether EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s trips to his home state violated EPA travel regulations. Similar concerns have been raised regarding the travel of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. I respectfully request that the GAO answer the following questions: 1) Are agency heads, political appointees, and career officials within the executive branch traveling in a cost-effective manner? 2) Are the rules and procedures regarding the travel of agency heads, political appointees, and career officials effective in upholding 5 U.S.C. § 5733 and ensuring that the executive branch officials travel in a cost-effective manner? Are these regulations consistent across agencies within the executive branch? I also request that the GAO’s report include recommendations for actions that can be taken by Congress and the executive branch to ensure that travel by federal officials is done in a cost-effective manner and that the regulations governing executive branch officials are effective and consistent across the executive branch. If you have any additional questions, please contact Tyler Brown in Senator Joni Ernst’s office at (202) 224-3254. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
10.26.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, introduced the bipartisan Prove It Act. This bipartisan legislation aims to improve transparency and strengthen the voices of small businesses in the rulemaking process by giving the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy (the small business watchdog for federal rules and regulations) an opportunity to ask agencies to prove their regulatory analysis when proposing a rule that may be economically harmful to small businesses. For example, the proposed Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule drastically expanded federal authority over land and water to the point that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) could regulate water on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. The SBA’s Office of Advocacy found that the EPA and Army Corps improperly certified this rule, and, despite the EPA claiming otherwise, the rule would indeed have a costly and direct impact on small businesses. Provisions in the Prove It Act would have allowed for a review or reconsideration of the proposed rule before it is put into action. “Small businesses make up 97 percent of all of Iowa’s employers, meaning their success is our state’s success,” said Senator Ernst. “The bipartisan Prove It Act serves as a check on the federal agency certification and analysis process, allowing the small business community the opportunity to question a rule, and, if a discrepancy is found, allowing for it to be re-evaluated before it’s finalized. I am grateful to have the support of Senator Heitkamp as we work to rein in burdensome regulations to foster a more thoughtful and efficient rulemaking process for our small businesses.” “Small businesses are the backbone of North Dakota’s economy, and we need to make sure they have a level playing field to grow, thrive, and create jobs,” Heitkamp said. “The needs of small businesses have to be considered as regulations are created so we can prevent red tape and burdensome rules from unfairly impacting them. That’s why Senator Ernst and I are introducing this bipartisan legislation to give small businesses a bigger seat at the table and a stronger voice if a proposed regulation could hurt their ability to grow. For years, I’ve heard from North Dakota small business owners that one of their biggest concerns is federal rules, and the Prove It Act will make sure their voices are heard.” Other examples of areas the Prove It Act could be applied include: the EPA’s Risk Management Program Rule, the Department of Energy’s energy conservation standards for manufactured housing, and the Department of Energy’s energy conservation standards for vending machines. In Fiscal Year 2016, the Office of Advocacy provided 20 official public comment letters to federal agencies on a variety of proposed rules. Most frequently, the concerns were raised over the inadequacy of an agency’s analysis of a proposed rule. Senator Ernst first introduced the Prove It Act in the 114th Congress, where it was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. View the bill text here. About the Prove It Act: Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), federal agencies are required to certify whether a rule has a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. If the rule does, agencies are then required to perform a substantive analysis. Agencies also have the discretion to certify that the rule would not impact small businesses significantly and can then bypass further analysis requirements. The Prove It Act gives small businesses a stronger voice and requires agencies to prove their regulatory analysis if the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy disagrees with the agency’s decision to certify that the rule would not have a significant economic impact. The request for review must be published in the Federal Register and on the SBA Office of Advocacy’s website to ensure transparency.
10.26.2017	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a combat veteran, issued the following statements after President Trump signed into law the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act: Sen. Johnson: “Chris Kirkpatrick did the right and honorable thing when he raised concerns about the over-prescription of opioids to veterans. Today we are sending a strong message that federal whistleblowers like Chris deserve protection, and attempts to intimidate or silence whistleblowers are unlawful. I thank Sen. Ernst and Rep. Duffy for their work with me on this important issue, and I thank the president for signing this important legislation to protect veterans and whistleblowers across the federal government.” Sen. Ernst: “I’m thrilled to see our whistleblower protection legislation signed into law today. Whistleblowers who bravely come forward about mistreatment or corruption at the VA must be protected. This legislation will work to safeguard those who report these wrongdoings, while holding the offenders and retaliators accountable for their actions. I’m grateful for Senator Johnson’s leadership on this bill and look forward to continuing efforts to protect whistleblowers and improve care for our veterans.” The bill is named for Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a whistleblower at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tomah, Wis., who took his own life after being fired for questioning excessive prescription practices at the facility. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s brother, Sean, testified at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in September 2015 about the retaliation his brother faced. Last year, Chairman Johnson released a report detailing the systemic failures at the Department of Veterans Affairs and VA Office of Inspector General that led to the tragedies at the Tomah VA. This bill is a direct result of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s investigation. It also implements a number of suggestions that Sean Kirkpatrick and others have made to improve whistleblower protections at the VA and across the federal government. The legislation will strengthen penalties on those who retaliate against whistleblowers, add protections for probationary employees, and ensure that federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower protections.
10.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s Senate Resolution honoring the Sailors and Marines lost while fighting the 1967 fire onboard the USS Forrestal, and commemorating the efforts of the survivors, including now-Senator John McCain (R-AZ), passed unanimously in the U.S. Senate: Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a combat veteran, issued the following statement upon passage: “Our Sailors and Marines aboard USS Forrestal, and accompanying vessels, assumed unimaginable risks and made countless sacrifices to protect their shipmates and save their ship. Through this bipartisan resolution, we seek to honor the crewmembers lost, the families they left behind, and those who survived the tragic fire, like Senator John McCain. Their honor, courage, and commitment to our nation is an inspiration to us all.” Senator Ernst introduced the USS Forrestal Senate Resolution on July 27, 2017, during the week of the 50th anniversary of the tragic fire.
10.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, released the following statement after the committee voted to approve Paul Trombino III of Iowa to serve as the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration at the Department of Transportation (DOT) as well as several nominees to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). “As we continue to move forward on an infrastructure plan, it is imperative that we have someone at the helm who understands the unique challenges of maintaining and updating rural Americas’ roads, bridges, and highways,” said Senator Ernst. “Mr. Trombino has proven both in his time as the Director of the Iowa Department of Transportation, and during his confirmation hearing that he has the necessary expertise to take on this role. “We also advanced additional nominees, including Bill Wehrum, the EPA’s nominee to be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, which oversees the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). I had expressed concerns over his answers as to how he will uphold the spirit and the letter of this law; however, after many discussions, I have received written commitments from Administrator Pruitt that the EPA will support the spirit and the letter of the RFS.” These nominations now head to the Senate floor. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Mr. Trombino at his confirmation hearing, here.
10.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced bipartisan legislation to strengthen and improve the Agriculture Risk Coverage-County Level program (ARC-CO), which helps farmers when commodity prices fall to damaging levels. Heitkamp and Ernst’s bill aims to strengthen the ARC-CO safety net program in the next Farm Bill to better support farmers during tough times like low commodity prices or drought and make sure they get the accurate payments they deserve. The bill builds on Heitkamp’s successful effort from 2015 when she got the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to allow farmers whose land is across multiple counties to have their ARC-CO payments recalculated so those payments reflect what’s owed to them in the physical counties where their farms are located. Additionally, Senator Ernst, along with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), sent a letter to then-Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack last May requesting more information regarding the methodology for determining county yields for the ARC-CO program. ARC-CO provides revenue loss coverage at the county level when the actual county crop revenue of a covered commodity is less than the ARC-CO guarantee. “North Dakota’s farmers and ranchers feed our state, the country, and the world – and it’s critical that they get the support they need to continue to operate during good and bad times,” said Heitkamp. “As I’ve met with producers across our state over the past few months, they have made clear that improvements are necessary to programs like ARC-CO that help our agriculture community get through challenges like drought and low commodity prices. Two years ago, I successfully pressed USDA to make a fix so farmers who produce in more than one county get the payments they deserve. This bipartisan bill builds on that effort to improve the ARC-CO program to better serve the farmers who need it most. As Congress works on the next Farm Bill, we need to make sure bills like this one that aim to protect and strengthen the farm safety net are included.” “In Iowa, 97 percent of our farmers’ corn acres and 98 percent of their soybean acres are enrolled in the ARC-CO program. Unfortunately, some of our farmers have experienced payment discrepancies due to the program’s reliance on administrative county lines, rather than a farm’s actual physical location,” said Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “I am glad to join my colleague, Senator Heitkamp, in this bipartisan effort to address these disparities. Specifically, this legislation will work to ensure the data and process used by the Farm Service Agency to determine payments to our farmers are not unfairly affected by state or federal boundaries that have no bearing on a farm’s yield. I will continue to use our farmers’ feedback to address their concerns and provide them the support they need.” Heitkamp and Ernst’s bill would specifically: Improve data used to make ARC-CO payments. The bill would direct the Farm Service Agency (FSA) to use the more widely-available data from the Risk Management Agency as the first choice in yield calculations so that county level data is more accurate and updated; Calculate safety net payments so they reflect what’s owed to producers in the physical counties where their farms are located. This fix would permanently put in place a change Heitkamp successfully had USDA implement in 2015 for North Dakota farmers, rather than having the payments based solely on the single county the producer used for administrative purposes; and Make payments more accurate. The bill would provide FSA state committees discretion to adjust yield data estimates to help reduce inexplicable variation between neighboring counties or along boundaries with neighboring states. Adjustments would be made prior to yields being finalized or published. The bill is supported by the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers Union, American Soybean Association, National Association of Wheat Growers, National Barley Growers Association, National Corn Growers Association, National Sunflower Association, USA Dry Pea & Lentil Council, US Canola Association, North Dakota Grain Growers Association, North Dakota Corn Growers Association, and the North Dakota Soybean Growers Association. Click here for statements of support. The Title I ARC-CO program in the 2014 Farm Bill makes payments to producers when their county’s actual crop revenue is less than the ARC-CO revenue guaranteed in their county. But for the farmers who farm land across county lines, it’s possible that their single administrative county may not have triggered a payment – even if they also farm in a county that did trigger a payment, or that triggered a payment at an increased level.
10.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, issued the following statement after the committee approved the nomination of Iowa’s Secretary of Agriculture, Bill Northey, to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for Farm Production and Conservation at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): “As a fourth generation farmer, Mr. Northey has an innate understanding of our agricultural community and the obstacles our farmers and ranchers face. At his confirmation hearing, Mr. Northey illustrated his extensive knowledge and experience. I’m pleased that our committee sees what a qualified and fitting candidate he is for this position, and I look forward to his full consideration in the Senate.” Mr. Northey’s nomination now heads to the Senate floor. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Mr. Northey at his confirmation hearing, here.
10.19.2017	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa today asked the Department of Veterans Affairs for a response to a report in the Omaha World-Herald of unauthorized waiting lists outside the VA patient tracking system for some mental health appointments in Omaha. “With mental health, receiving prompt care is crucial, and in severe cases can be a matter of life and death,” Grassley and Ernst wrote to Secretary David Shulkin. “It is important for veterans and taxpayers to know what role these unauthorized lists played and how they impacted access to care, what types and levels of employees were involved in the decision to establish the list and in operating the list, and what corrective actions and disciplinary measures were applied to make sure this does not happen again.” Grassley and Ernst wrote that they appreciated that the VA apparently took action to correct the Omaha situation after learning of it but “the little that was disclosed publicly leaves some unanswered questions.” In addition to seeking details about how the unauthorized lists affected access to care and employee disciplinary action in this case, Grassley and Ernst sought details about agency “protocols for disciplinary action and how the taxpayers and the public should be kept informed in such instances.” They also asked for a description of how the unauthorized waiting lists came to light in the Omaha situation and whether the VA has systemic checks and balances to bring such unauthorized waiting lists to the forefront agency-wide. Grassley and Ernst have long worked to improve veterans services, particularly those involving mental health and suicide prevention. Their letter is available here.
10.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In response to concerns U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) previously outlined, including in a meeting earlier this week, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Pruitt sent a letter to her and fellow colleagues, giving her key commitments that he will support the spirit and the letter of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), released the following statement: “Over the last few weeks, I had serious concerns about the EPA following the spirit and the letter of the RFS, which I made clear to my committee colleagues, the EPA, and the White House. Tonight, I’m pleased to see these commitments from EPA Administrator Pruitt to uphold the RFS as intended by Congress. “Specifically, the Administrator committed to finalizing the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) rule on time, and at levels equal to or greater than the levels in the proposed rule. He also made a commitment to work with Congress on a Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) fix, so consumers nationwide can have access to E-15 and higher blends of ethanol year-round. I look forward to the EPA issuing their definitive legal analysis on whether or not they have the authority to issue this waiver so they can address it or turn to Congress for a statutory fix. “The Administrator has also made assurances that the EPA will not consider granting compliance credits to ethanol exports; doing so would go against the spirit of the program and invoke the ire of our trading partners. “In addition, the Administrator has recognized the overwhelming opposition to moving the point of obligation, and is keeping it where it is to ensure stability in the marketplace. “These assurances are a clear win for Iowans. Echoing the President’s commitment to advancing the full potential of the RFS to benefit rural America is welcome at a time when our family farms are struggling with commodity prices that are below the cost of production. I am appreciative of Administrator Pruitt’s pledges to rural America, and I will continue to work collaboratively with the EPA going forward on this and other issues that help our farmers, manufacturers, land owners, businesses and communities.” View the letter to Senator Ernst and her colleagues here.

10.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the U.S. Senate voted to approve the Fiscal Year 2018 budget resolution: “Today, we took an important first step in delivering on our promise to the American people to reform our loophole-ridden and outdated tax code, while working to balance the budget. The FY18 budget resolution paves the way for tax reform allowing Congress to come together on a plan that will keep more hard-earned dollars in the pockets of middle class Iowans and job-creating small businesses. “At a time when we are more than $20 trillion in debt, this budget constrains federal spending and puts us on the right path towards finally balancing our budget and restoring fiscal responsibility in Washington.”
10.19.2017	Yesterday, U.S. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, made clear that she would not support the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nominee for a role that directly oversees the implementation of the RFS until the EPA could provide “strong reassurances on biofuel volumes and the EPA’s commitment to follow both the letter and the spirit of the RFS, as well as a commitment to not pursue other policies harmful to our farmers across Iowa.” Ernst represents a key vote on the committee and while she feels that a deal is getting closer, she will continue to hold the EPA’s feet to the fire until the assurances are confirmed. Below is a quick round up of some of the press coverage…. Omaha World-Herald: “Ernst was straightforward about her role in prompting the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to cancel Wednesday’s vote on several Environmental Protection Agency nominees. Those nominees included Bill Wehrum, who has been tapped to head the office that administers the renewable fuel program. A member of the committee, Ernst said she found Wehrum’s answers ‘pretty darn squishy’ when she pressed him on support for renewable fuels. ‘I told them outright I would not support him if I didn’t have assurances,’ she said, then noted that Republicans have a razor-thin 11-10 advantage on the panel. ‘One vote makes a difference.’” (Ernst: Trump, EPA taking steps in right direction on renewable fuels, 10/19/2017) Watch the KCRG-TV report HERE. POLITICO: “It seems President Donald Trump’s administration made significant progress Wednesday toward appeasing a bloc of corn-state Republicans blocking EPA nominees over the agency’s actions on biofuels, but the small-yet-powerful group proved over the last two days that they have significant power to throw sands in the gears of the president’s agenda if they want.” (Lessons from biofuels fight as progress reported, 10/19/2017) Senator Ernst on KASI radio: “My office, my staff members, myself, [we’re] in constant discussion with the White House and the EPA. So we are coming to, hopefully, an agreement. I’ve made it very clear where I stand on this and in order to get my support moving forward, again, we have to have those reassurances that the EPA and all of those being confirmed in those positions are upholding the spirit and intent of the RFS. So we’re in constant communication and we hear from them multiple times a day. So I have laid out what I would like to see, which is reflective of our entire biofuels industry, and I think we are getting somewhere and I think our discussion yesterday face-to-face with administrator Pruitt was very helpful and I reminded him there are 88,500 family farms that are really dependent on the markets driven by the RFS. So not only are we seeking energy independence and greater efficiency within the renewable fuels industry, but we also have family occupations and lives that are dependent upon this.” (Senator Ernst on the Trent Rice Show on KASI radio, 10/18/2017) Radio Iowa: “‘I am engaged in negotiations with the administrator as well as the White House,’ Ernst told Radio Iowa by phone this afternoon. ‘…Hopefully we can receive those final assurances from them, hopefully in a more public manner, and then we can move ahead with getting nominees into the EPA.’ But Ernst said those confirmation votes in the senate will not happen until the EPA abandons its retraction of renewable fuels production mandates.” (Biofuels industry ‘perplexed’ by Trump Administration ‘regression’ on RFS, 10/18/2017) E&E News: “A key senator yesterday said she was ‘almost’ ready to declare victory in a standoff with the Trump administration that has snagged the nomination of Bill Wehrum to head U.S. EPA's air office. ‘I do think we're getting closer,’ Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told reporters at the Capitol yesterday, though stopping short of predicting a deal could arrive in time to allow a committee vote next week. ‘We want to know that Scott Pruitt as the head of the agency is going to uphold the spirit of the law’ on the renewable fuel standard, she added.” ('We're getting closer' to deal on air nominee — Sen. Ernst, 10/19/2017) The Courier/Lee Enterprises: “U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who holds a key position on a Senate committee overseeing nominees to the EPA, said Wednesday she wanted assurances the ‘spirit’ and letter of the RFS would be followed. ‘We just need very clear answers on where they are with the RFS, and if we don’t receive those assurances, then I’m not likely to move anybody ahead that could undo the RFS,’ Ernst said Wednesday. Ernst is a member of the Senate’s Environment and Public Works Committee, where Republicans hold an 11-10 edge. On Wednesday, the committee postponed consideration of Trump appointee William Wehrum to head the EPA’s office of air and radiation, which oversees the RFS. The postponement came after Ernst had expressed reservations about Wehrum.” (Trump orders EPA to back off RFS changes, report says, 10/18/2017) Associated Press: “GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said Wednesday she was not prepared to support the nomination of Bill Wehrum, Trump's choice to lead the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation. If confirmed, Wehrum would oversee the Renewable Fuel Standard. Ernst questioned Wehrum about his position on the biofuels mandate in a hearing earlier this month. ‘Following his confirmation hearing, I expressed concern with the answers he gave, and told the committee I wasn't comfortable supporting him at that time due to his answers and recent actions by the EPA which had the potential to weaken or undermine the RFS,’ Ernst said.” (Trump EPA nominees on hold amid dispute over biofuel mandate, 10/18/2017) The Hill: “A key lawmaker in that fight is Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who sits on the EPW Committee. Because Republicans hold only a one-vote majority on the panel, they need everyone to support a nominee to bring it to the floor. But Ernst has been especially critical of Wehrum, and the EPA's approach to ethanol generally. She was one of several corn-state lawmakers to meet with Pruitt on Tuesday. On Wednesday, she said discussions over the RFS and the nomination are ongoing."

Senator Joni Ernst sat down with Pruitt this week, and said, ‘Iowa is the largest producer of ethanol and biodiesel in the nation.

Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Mr. Wehrum here. Senator Ernst has been a vocal opponent of any actions taken to lower RFS volumes, stressing her position through letters to EPA Administrator Pruitt and to President Trump.

Earlier this week, Senator Ernst again met with Administrator Pruitt to reiterate the need to maintain a strong RFS.
10.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works (EPW), released the following statement on Bill Wehrum, the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) nominee to be Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, which directly oversees the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): “Not long after coming to Congress, I learned the major impact the EPW Committee can have on Iowa. EPW has jurisdiction over the EPA, whose regulations and programs are critical to our state, chief among them the RFS. As the only Iowan on the committee, and with the 11 Republican, 10 Democrat split, one vote can be the difference. “Mr. Wehrum was nominated to lead the Office of Air and Radiation which oversees the RFS. When he appeared before the committee, I questioned him about how he will uphold the spirit and the letter of this law. Following his confirmation hearing, I expressed concern with the answers he gave, and told the committee I wasn’t comfortable supporting him at that time due to his answers and recent actions by the EPA which had the potential to weaken or undermine the RFS. “Over the last few weeks, my staff and I have had many conversations with the White House and Administrator Pruitt where I expressed my concerns. Holding the EPA’s feet to the fire has put us on a path to receive strong reassurances on biofuel volumes and the EPA’s commitment to follow both the letter and the spirit of the RFS, as well as a commitment to not pursue other policies harmful to our farmers across Iowa. “My staff and I will continue to keep a watchful eye as these assurances come to life, and while we are still in negotiations, I do feel good about the direction we are headed.” Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Mr. Wehrum here. Senator Ernst has been a vocal opponent of any actions taken to lower RFS volumes, stressing her position through letters to EPA Administrator Pruitt and to President Trump. The Senator received commitments from Administrator Pruitt in their pre-confirmation meeting and during his confirmation hearing that he would follow the law and maintain the RFS. Yesterday, Senator Ernst again met with Administrator Pruitt to reiterate the need to maintain a strong RFS.
10.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement after meeting with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt to express her significant concerns over the agency’s recent action to potentially set biodiesel volumes in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2018 and 2019 at substantially lower volumes, which could in turn, hurt Iowa farmers, manufacturers, and rural communities. “Iowa is the largest producer of ethanol and biodiesel in the nation. Our farmers, ranchers and rural communities depend on maintaining a strong RFS. Time and again, the RFS has proven to be a major driver of alternative fuels and economic development. “Throughout his confirmation process, Administrator Pruitt promised me multiple times that he would uphold the spirit of the RFS, as intended by Congress. Additionally, the President has consistently stated his support for biofuels and made it clear to Administrator Pruitt that he is supportive of the RFS. While the administrator has insisted that the recent actions taken by the EPA are simply to receive additional input on the RFS from stakeholders, it is evident that the ‘stakeholders’ he refers to are not the farmers and manufacturers across the State of Iowa who would be directly affected if the biodiesel volume requirements were lowered. “Our meeting today was another clear demonstration that biofuel-producing states will never stop fighting to protect the RFS. Administrator Pruitt again claimed today that he will not do anything to undermine the program. However, we have heard this before. We now need to see it. I will continue to work with the EPA, but they must prove to the agricultural community who put their faith in this administration that they will fulfill their promise to maintain the letter and the spirit of the RFS. We will not accept anything less.” Senator Ernst has been a vocal opponent of any actions taken to lower RFS volumes, stressing her position through letters to EPA Administrator Pruitt and to President Trump. The Senator received commitments from Administrator Pruitt in their pre-confirmation meeting and during his confirmation hearing that he would follow the law and maintain the RFS.
10.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry joined her Agriculture Committee colleague U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) to strengthen the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) – an innovative approach to conservation authored by Senator Stabenow in the 2014 Farm Bill. The bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act will provide more resources for partners to expand the reach of conservation projects, while cutting red-tape and increasing flexibility to attract new participants. “This initiative is one of the largest commitments ever made to protecting our land and water, and is one of the biggest Farm Bill success stories in Michigan, and all across the country,” said Senator Stabenow. “Businesses, non-profits and conservation leaders are working alongside farmers at the local level to improve water quality in our Great Lakes and create new habitats for hunting and fishing. This new bill incorporates ideas we’ve heard from current participants to pave the way for even more innovative conservation work.” “Our farmers and producers have an innate understanding of how to best care for the land they rely on to feed and fuel our world,” said Senator Ernst. “As we have seen in Iowa, the RCPP is a successful and cost-effective approach to encourage voluntary and proactive conservation. Such success makes it critically important to further develop the RCPP in order to continue incentivizing rural and urban partnerships, and allow greater flexibility in their efforts to improve water quality and soil health.” The 2014 Farm Bill created a first-of-its-kind approach to conservation through partnerships between agriculture and conservation groups to improve water quality, restore habitats for hunting and fishing, and protect the Great Lakes. These locally-led partnerships leverage private and public dollars to bring together partners to address regional conservation issues. Since its inception, the RCPP has leveraged more than $1.2 billion in private funding and brought together over 2,000 diverse partners to address local conservation goals. The bipartisan Regional Conservation Partnership Program Improvement Act includes suggestions from current partners to make the program work better for producers. The bill eliminates burdensome program requirements and streamlines contracts, cutting red tape and providing more flexibility for farmers implementing conservation practices. Additionally, the bill targets resources to expand conservation work and strengthens the focus on targeted outcomes such as improved water quality, drought resilience, and wildlife habitat. In an effort to bring more participants into the program, the bill also creates incentives for more diverse partnerships and facilitates innovative approaches to conservation through a new pilot grant program. For more information, find the bill summary fact sheet here and the bill text here. The bipartisan bill is supported by the Nature Conservancy, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Michigan Farm Bureau, and the Iowa Soybean Association in addition to more than 70 other stakeholders. Mark Recker, Iowa Corn Growers Association (ICGA) President and farmer from Arlington, Iowa: “Iowa Corn is a partner in multiple RCPP projects. Our experiences have been positive, but we believe that any new program can be improved upon. ICGA’s priority for conservation in the next farm bill is simpler programs that help farmers address challenges on working lands and better incorporate the farmer perspective. We believe this legislation adds additional flexibility for farmers and partners to do more innovative work in the areas of conservation and water quality. We thank Senator Ernst and Senator Stabenow for their commitment to improving RCPP.” Lynn Scarlett, Co-Chief External Affairs Officer of The Nature Conservancy: “The RCPP empowers communities and drives public-private partnerships to find local, innovative solutions to natural resource challenges at the watershed and landscape levels. We thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Ernst for the introduction of this bipartisan bill, which will increase the effectiveness of this vital conservation program.” Whit Fosburgh, President and CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership (TRCP): “Created in the 2014 Farm Bill as an innovative way to scale up private land conservation and tackle some of our nation’s most pressing conservation challenges, the Regional Conservation Partnership Program is strongly supported by hunters and anglers. The RCPP Improvement Act seeks to further enhance the program, taking the lessons of the last several years of on-the-ground implementation and improving benefits for landowners, conservation partners and, most importantly, natural resources. The TRCP supports these steps and applauds Senator Stabenow and Senator Ernst for introducing this bipartisan bill.” Carl Bednarski, President, Michigan Farm Bureau: “On behalf of Michigan Farm Bureau’s 44,000 farming families, we thank Senator Stabenow for her continued support for voluntary conservation programs, including her leadership for the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). RCPP has been an important conservation tool for Michigan that’s allowed us to focus additional resources in areas such as the Western Lake Erie Basin. Michigan Farm Bureau supports the Regional Conservation Partnership Program and feel it benefits agriculture and resource protection. We appreciate Ranking Member Stabenow’s dedication to RCPP. We look forward to working with her on making this program work for farmers and the environment.” Bill Shipley, President of the Iowa Soybean Association: “The RCPP Improvement Act is important step in expanding, streamlining and further focusing USDA support of collaborative partnerships resulting in greater returns on our conservation investments. Our farmers have had good success working in partnership with cities, state agencies, conservation groups and others using the RCPP to achieve progress on our Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy. The proposed changes will result in more funding, less red tape for farmers and partners, and support of watershed approach all resulting in more bang for the buck, which we strongly support. The Iowa Soybean Association thanks Senators Ernst and Stabenow for introducing this legislation.”
10.16.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Patty Murray (D-WA), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) along with a bipartisan group of 28 other senators in urging the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase its proposed 2019 Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for biodiesel to encourage growth in the industry and diversity in the nation’s energy supply, and to abandon its effort to reduce biofuel production in 2018. The EPA has proposed holding the biomass-based diesel volume stagnant for 2019 and reducing the advanced biofuel volume for 2018. These proposed volumes leave potential growth in the industry on the table and could cause near-term job losses in rural America. “The industry is poised for growth, in accordance with the intent of the law, if EPA sends the market signals with increased volumes. Reducing volumes and especially those RVOs that were previously finalized is disruptive, unprecedented, and very troubling,” the senators wrote to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. The senators continued, “We have made great progress through the RFS in diversifying our nation’s fuel supply while creating and sustaining jobs, strengthening local economies, generating tax revenues, and improving energy security. We urge you to support higher RVOs for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels in the final rule to encourage additional development and use of this fuel.” According to a study conducted last year by LMC International and released by the National Biodiesel Board, the 2.1 billion gallons of biodiesel and renewable diesel used by Americans in 2015 supported 47,400 jobs and $1.9 billion in wages, and had an $8.4 billion economic impact. The full text of the letter is available here and below: October 16, 2017 The Honorable Scott Pruitt Administrator Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20460 Dear Administrator Pruitt: We write in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for advanced biofuel for calendar year 2018 and biomass-based diesel for calendar year 2019, as well as the recent Notice of Data Availability (NODA). The NODA requests comments on reducing previously finalized RVOs, threatening business plans and investments already made based upon a final rule issued in December 2016. These proposed volumes do not meet actual biodiesel production capacity in the United States, and could have a negative impact on jobs and economies in rural communities across the nation. Therefore, we urge you to increase these volumes in the final rule. Biodiesel is the first EPA-designated advanced biofuel under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to reach commercial scale production nationwide. The biodiesel industry has met RFS criteria for growth each year, exceeding the goals that Congress envisioned when it created the RFS with bipartisan support. In addition, biodiesel has consistently made up the majority of the advanced biofuel volumes. This ability to meet or exceed RVOs coupled with the substantial investment made by the biodiesel industry indicate that these fuels offer the best opportunity for continued growth in the near future. EPA’s proposal would hold the biomass-based diesel volume for 2019 stagnant at 2.1 billion gallons and decrease the advanced biofuel volume for 2018 to 4.24 billion gallons. These proposed volumes do not reflect the existing potential for the biodiesel and renewable diesel industries in our states and could cause near-term job losses and discourage investment in capacity and new fuel development. It is estimated that every 500 million gallons of increased biodiesel production supports roughly 16,000 jobs. Further, EPA’s NODA solicits comments on whether it could further reduce the total, advanced, and biomass-based diesel volumes through several different waiver mechanisms. However, there is ample available feedstock, refining capacity, and room for growth in the domestic biodiesel industry. The industry is poised for growth, in accordance with the intent of the law, if EPA sends the market signals with increased volumes. Reducing volumes and especially those RVOs that were previously finalized is disruptive, unprecedented, and very troubling. We have made great progress through the RFS in diversifying our nation’s fuel supply while creating and sustaining jobs, strengthening local economies, generating tax revenues, and improving energy security. We urge you to support higher RVOs for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels in the final rule to encourage additional development and use of this fuel. Thank you for your consideration.

10.14.2017	“There is a great deal of frustration that Washington simply isn’t getting its work done, and I couldn’t agree more. Congress has a lot of work to do – from tax reform, to health care, to the Farm Bill, to passing measures that keep our nation safe and secure. I look forward to taking the input I’ve received from folks all across our state and translating it into action in Washington.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after completing her third annual 99 county tour across the State of Iowa: “Each stop – whether it’s a town meeting, a roundtable discussion, or visit to a local business or school – gives me a tremendous opportunity to hear from Iowans first-hand. Maintaining open lines of communication allows us to better identify problems together and find common sense solutions to those issues facing Iowans. “There is a great deal of frustration that Washington simply isn’t getting its work done, and I couldn’t agree more. Congress has a lot of work to do – from tax reform, to health care, to the Farm Bill, to passing measures to keep our nation safe and secure.

10.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued this statement following President Trump’s decision not to certify the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly referred to as the “Iran deal”: “Two years ago, I warned that the JCPOA fell dangerously short of its intended goal to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program. Today, it is clear that the flawed agreement negotiated by then-President Obama has indeed paved the way for Iran to obtain and deliver a nuclear weapon without repercussion. “Overtly, the Iranian regime continues to exploit loopholes in JCPOA to advance its ballistic missile capability. Covertly, Iranian weaponization efforts are unknown, as military leaders have stated publicly they will refuse to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of their sites. All the while, sanctions relief has fueled Iran’s support for its terrorist organization proxies engaged in malign activities in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Afghanistan, and elsewhere – places where these groups are engaged in direct combat with American servicemembers or our partners. Indisputably the JCPOA failed to meet its requirements to appropriately and proportionally contain Iran’s nefarious activities – the original purpose of the agreement. “Therefore, I support President Trump’s decision not to certify the deal under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This action does not withdraw the United States from the JCPOA, but rather, it provides an opportunity for Congress to work with the Trump administration and our allies to fix the failures of the original agreement. We will maintain a position of global leadership by upholding our obligations, while finally beginning to hold Iran accountable for not meeting the expectations of the international community. This starts today with the President’s decision not to certify the deal, and his decision to target the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps for proliferating weapons, abusing human rights, and sponsoring terror. “I look forward to working with the Trump administration, my congressional colleagues, and overseas partners in the weeks and months ahead to formalize a strategy that successfully achieves its objectives and protects American interests.”

10.06.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Dean Heller (R-NV), John Cornyn (R-TX), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), James Lankford (R-OK), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Tim Scott (R-SC), John Thune (R-SD), and James Inhofe (R-OK) today urged the Trump Administration’s U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) to swiftly review an Obama Administration decision that permitted the sale of bump stock devices and issue its own interpretation. The senators’ request for review comes after a gunman opened fire on 22,000 innocent concertgoers in Las Vegas, Nevada, killing 58 people and wounding nearly 500 more. Federal authorities found 12 bump stock devices outfitted on firearms in the assailant’s Mandalay Bay hotel room. “We recognize that it is impossible to prevent tragedy and acts of “pure evil,” in the words of our President. We believe, however, the tragic events in Las Vegas brought to light an issue from this past Administration that we respectfully request that your Bureau swiftly review,” the senators wrote. “Press reports of the crime scene in Las Vegas, Nevada, indicate that certain devices were used to modify the firearms involved. Specifically, these devices are designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles. The sale of these devices and, bump stocks specifically, is permitted under an interpretation of the Gun Control Act (18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(23)) and National Firearms Act (26 U.S.C. § 5845(b)) made by the Obama Administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).” The senators continued, “Given the function and capability of a semi-automatic rifle that is modified by a bump stock, we respectfully request that you review the Obama Administration’s interpretation and issue your own interpretation. Unfortunately, we are all now keenly aware of how this device operates and believe that this renewed review and determination will keep our citizens safe and ensure that federal law is enforced.” The letter, available here, reads in full: October 6, 2017 Mr. Thomas E. Brandon Acting Director Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 99 New York Avenue, NE Washington, DC 20226 Dear Acting Director Brandon: The citizens of Nevada, and of our country as a whole, continue to mourn the brutal and senseless attack on innocent concertgoers in Las Vegas the night of October 1, 2017. We remember and pray for those lost in this tragedy, their family and friends. We honor and applaud the bravery of the first responders, both law enforcement and civilian heroes, medical professionals, and all who came to the aid of those in need. We recognize that it is impossible to prevent tragedy and acts of “pure evil,” in the words of our President. We believe, however, the tragic events in Las Vegas brought to light an issue from this past Administration that we respectfully request that your Bureau swiftly review. Press reports of the crime scene in Las Vegas, Nevada, indicate that certain devices were used to modify the firearms involved.

10.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works held a hearing to consider the nomination of Iowan, Paul Trombino III, former Director of the Iowa Department of Transportation, to be Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the committee, introduced Mr. Trombino to her colleagues on the committee in advance of his testimony. Senator Ernst cited her experience working with Mr. Trombino as both an Iowa State Senator and a U.S. Senator, and reaffirmed her confidence in his qualifications to take on this role. Watch Senator Ernst’s introduction of Mr. Trombino here or by clicking the image below. During questioning, Senator Ernst asked Mr. Trombino for his ideas on how to best address funding gaps in the Highway Trust Fund left by declining gas tax revenue, without increasing the gas tax. Additionally, with the committee continuing to discuss an infrastructure package, the Iowa Senator asked Mr. Trombino to provide insight into the policy changes he believes could be most beneficial to rural states, such as Iowa, that face unique transportation challenges.

10.05.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) today joined Senator Lindsey Graham (R-South Carolina) as well as other Senate colleagues and pro-life leaders to formally introduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. The legislation would provide common-sense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization, a point at which there is significant scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on these vulnerable human beings. On Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Pain-Capable legislation by a vote of 237-189. “At five month gestational age, babies have 10 fingers and 10 toes, they can yawn, stretch, make faces – and they can feel pain,” said Senator Ernst. “It’s unconscionable that the United States is currently one of only 7 countries in the world that allows abortions after five months; we are currently in the same company of China and North Korea. I’m fighting for this legislation in honor of my friend and fellow Iowan, Micah Pickering, an incredible 5 year old who was born prematurely, at five months gestation. This legislation could protect up to 10,000 lives like Micah’s every year by preventing abortions after about 5 months of development, and it is absolutely critical that the Senate take up this legislation to protect our most vulnerable.” “There are only seven countries that allow wholesale abortions at the 20-week period, including China and North Korea. The United States should not be in that club,” said Senator Graham. “I don’t believe abortion, five months into pregnancy, makes us a better nation. America is at her best when she’s standing up for the least among us and the sooner we pass this legislation into law, the better. We are on the right side of history.” “The United States is one of only seven countries, including North Korea, that allow abortion at five months of pregnancy,” said Senator James Lankford (R-Oklahoma). “I applaud the House for passing this bill; it is now time for the Senate to act on this. So many children are alive, healthy, and growing today who were born prematurely at five months pregnancy. We should not allow elective abortions past five months of pregnancy, especially when science shows that unborn babies feel pain at this stage.” “Washington has a debate between empty euphemisms like ‘choice’ and basic science – none of the usual euphemisms change the fact that a 20-week old baby can see, swallow, and flex her arms and legs,” said Senator Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska). “Americans rightly condemn human rights abuses around the world because we judge societies on how they take care of their most vulnerable members – there’s no good reason for the United States to be on a list of human rights abusers like China and North Korea in allowing these kinds of abortions.” The Senators were joined at the press conference by representatives of organizations which strongly support the legislation and have worked to help push for its passage. They include National Right to Life Committee, Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, Americans United for Life and Concerned Women for America. The legislation has been cosponsored by forty-five senators, including Senators John Barrasso, Roy Blunt, John Boozman, Richard Burr, Bill Cassidy, Thad Cochran, Bob Corker, John Cornyn, Tom Cotton, Mike Crapo, Ted Cruz, Steve Daines, Joni Ernst, Mike Enzi, Jeff Flake, Deb Fischer, Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, John Hoeven, James Inhofe, Johnny Isakson, Ron Johnson, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Mike Lee, Jerry Moran, John McCain, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, David Perdue, Rob Portman, James Risch, Pat Roberts, Mike Rounds, Marco Rubio, Ben Sasse, Tim Scott, Richard Shelby, Luther Strange, Dan Sullivan, John Thune, Thom Tillis, Pat Toomey, Roger Wicker, and Todd Young.
10.05.2017	WASHINGTON – Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), along with Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and a bipartisan group of 35 other senators, sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruitt calling for a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) as the agency works toward finalizing its rule on biofuels volume requirements for 2018 under the RFS. The current proposed rule would represent a step backward for advanced biofuels, resulting in less renewable fuels being blended than in 2017. The rule unjustifiably flatlines biomass-based diesel, reduces advanced biofuels, and reduces the cellulosic biofuel blending target by about 25 percent. In the letter, the senators urged the continued implementation of the RFS as intended by Congress and the release of a strong final rule that would give consumers more choices at the pump, strengthen the economy and make the country more secure. “We urge you to ensure that the EPA’s final rule setting blending targets under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2018 promotes growth in the U.S. biofuel sector and in our economy. The 2018 proposed rule, while positive for maintaining the maximum blending target for conventional biofuel at 15 billion gallons, would represent a step back when it comes to advanced biofuels, resulting in less renewable fuels being blended than in 2017,” the senators wrote. “The rule unjustifiably flatlines biomass-based diesel, reduces advanced biofuels, and reduces the cellulosic biofuel blending target by about 25 percent. The agency arrives at these lower targets by utilizing a new methodology more reliant on historical data than projected volumes. The RFS must by law be administered in a forward-looking manner. The final rule should address these shortfalls.” The senators continued, “If done right, this rule is an opportunity to continue our nation’s path to be not only the world leader in first generation ethanol production, but also in cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuel production by spurring investment and manufacturing here in the United States rather than overseas. We urge you to continue to implement the RFS as intended by Congress and release a strong final rule that would give consumers more choices at the pump, strengthen our economy and make our country more secure.” In March, Grassley and Klobuchar led a bipartisan group of 23 senators including Ernst in urging the Administration to reject changes to the point of obligation under the RFS that would upend stability and predictability for small businesses and rural communities. Grassley has a long record of advancing biofuels policy. Most recently, following the EPA’s latest RFS proposal, which Grassley called a bait-and-switch from a previous proposal in July, Grassley has been pressing Pruitt to uphold President Trump’s pledge to support biofuels, which Trump made numerous times throughout the campaign and recently. Before Pruitt’s confirmation hearing, Grassley, along with Ernst and a group of Midwestern senators, received a commitment from Pruitt to follow the President’s vision on renewable fuels, to not undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard and to uphold the rule of law. Ernst has been a staunch defender of biofuels throughout her career in the Senate, championing them on both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, & Forestry. Just last week Ernst sent a letter to President Trump reminding him of his commitment to biofuels, while calling out the EPA’s latest attempts to undermine the RFS. At nominations hearings for Pruitt earlier this year, and for Bill Wehrum, nominee to be Assistant Administrator at EPA for the Office of Air and Radiation which oversees the RFS, Ernst held the nominees’ feet to the fire, demanding commitment that they uphold the Congressional intent of the RFS, and follow both the spirit as well as the letter of the law. The full text of the senators’ letter is below. Dear Administrator Pruitt: We urge you to ensure that the EPA’s final rule setting blending targets under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2018 promotes growth in the U.S. biofuel sector and in our economy. When Congress adopted the RFS in 2005, its goal was to put in place a stable, forward-looking policy to drive innovation and investments that would bring biofuels to American consumers. The biofuel industry supports hundreds of thousands of jobs throughout the country, reduces the environmental impact of our transportation and energy sectors, and cuts our reliance on foreign oil. The stability of our policy has led to billions of dollars of investment in the biofuel sector. America’s production capacity has expanded more than threefold since 2005 with fuels such as biodiesel, cellulosic ethanol, recycled-waste, algal, and other advanced biofuels. We need to build on this progress. The 2017 final RFS rule set Renewable Volume Obligations (RVO) at the levels Congress intended. The 2018 proposed rule, while positive for maintaining the maximum blending target for conventional biofuel at 15 billion gallons, would represent a step back when it comes to advanced biofuels, resulting in less renewable fuels being blended than in 2017. The rule unjustifiably flatlines biomass-based diesel, reduces advanced biofuels, and reduces the cellulosic biofuel blending target by about 25 percent. The agency arrives at these lower targets by utilizing a new methodology more reliant on historical data than projected volumes. The RFS must by law be administered in a forward-looking manner. The final rule should address these shortfalls. In addition, the Notice of Data Availability the agency published on September 26 would lower the blending targets by the number of gallons of biofuels imported yet still permit these imported gallons to generate compliance credits. There are also reports that the agency is considering allowing exported gallons of biofuel to generate compliance credits. Taken together, these actions would reduce renewable fuel blending in the U.S. and create uncertainty for producers. If done right, this rule is an opportunity to continue our nation’s path to be not only the world leader in first generation ethanol production, but also in cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuel production by spurring investment and manufacturing here in the United States rather than overseas. We urge you to continue to implement the RFS as intended by Congress and release a strong final rule that would give consumers more choices at the pump, strengthen our economy and make our country more secure. Sincerely,
10.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry held a hearing to consider the nomination of Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey to be Under Secretary of Agriculture for Farm Production and Conservation at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Subcommittee for Rural Development and Energy for the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, questioned Mr. Northey about his experience, and how it has prepared him to take on this role. The Iowa Senator asked Mr. Northey to expand on his experience implementing the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which has promoted voluntary, incentive-based conservation efforts in Iowa. Additionally, Senator Ernst and Mr. Northey discussed the important role of the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) in leveraging private sector dollars and creating partnerships between the federal government and local organizations. Watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Mr. Northey here.
10.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017 passed unanimously out of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and now awaits full Senate consideration. This legislation reforms the outdated system that provides former U.S. Presidents with post-presidency benefits by establishing first-ever limits on the taxpayer support they receive. “Our national debt now exceeds $20 trillion; this bipartisan effort is another important step toward reigning in Washington’s out-of-control spending,” said Senator Ernst. “It is ridiculous to continue asking taxpayers to help foot the bill for former presidents’ perks at a time when they already rake in millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements, and more. I look forward to seeing this commonsense legislation considered by the full Senate, and eventually signed into law.” Currently, under the Former Presidents Act, former presidents receive a generous pension as well as a monetary allowance to cover expenses such as travel, staff, communications, and office space – all funded by taxpayers. Nowadays, with former presidents earning millions of dollars through a myriad of lucrative opportunities, the Former President’s Act should be updated to take into account the modern financial standing of former presidents. U.S. Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA) introduced the companion legislation to the Presidential Modernization Act of 2017 in the U.S. House of Representatives, which passed unanimously out of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on September 13, 2017. Senator Ernst first introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Presidential Allowance Modernization Act on May 21, 2015. After passing both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with unanimous support, it was ultimately vetoed by President Obama. Read the full text of the bill here. About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017: According to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service, in fiscal year 2017 alone, former U.S. Presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.8 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017 would: Establish a cap on former presidents’ monetary allowances and would reduce the allowance dollar-for-dollar by each dollar of income a former president earns in excess of $400,000. Set a former president’s pension at $200,000 per year and implement a first-ever cap on the monetary allowance at $500,000, gradually reducing to $250,000 over a period of 10 years. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president.
10.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Applications from Iowa students applying to receive a nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, U.S. Military Academy, or U.S. Naval Academy for the 2018-2019 school year from U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, must be submitted to the senator’s Des Moines office no later than October 6, 2017. Every student applying to a service academy must receive a nomination. In her capacity as a United States Senator, Senator Ernst has the opportunity to nominate Iowa students to the service academies. Late or incomplete applications will not be considered. “A nomination to a U.S. Service Academy gives some of our best and brightest students the chance to serve our country while also receiving a full four-year scholarship to some of our nation’s finest institutions of higher learning,” said Senator Ernst. “I encourage Iowa students interested in attending one of our exceptional service academies to submit their applications for consideration by October 6, 2017.” Students or parents with any further questions may email or call Brenda Safranski at Brenda_Safranski@ernst.senate.gov or (515) 284-4574, or visit Senator Ernst’s website. Unlike the other service academies, the Coast Guard Academy does not require a congressional nomination. Members of the media with further questions may contact press@ernst.senate.gov.
10.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued a statement on the attack in Las Vegas that killed at least 58 and injured more than 500 people: “My prayers are with all of the victims in Las Vegas, and their loved ones affected by this senseless act of violence. “As we learn more about what happened in the days ahead, let us come together and show our gratitude to our first responders and the other unsung heroes who put their lives on the line for others.”
09.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, re-introduced the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. This legislation provides veterans greater and timelier access to mental health care treatment and incentivizes the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to hire more mental health care professionals to fully meet the demand. “We tragically lose 20 veterans a day to suicide, according to the VA. Selfless men and women who sacrificed years ago, often in dangerous and hostile environments, should not become victims of suicide when they return home. We can and must do better,” said Ernst. “At some centers in Iowa, thousands of veterans still experience wait times for mental health care appointments greater than 30 days. That is entirely unacceptable. “The Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act provides an option for our veterans to receive mental health treatment with VA Choice Act providers, until they can receive the comprehensive mental health care treatment at the VA they deserve. September marks Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, another reminder that we can – and we must – do better for our veterans who demonstrated their willingness to sacrifice everything for our freedom.” Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and John Cornyn (R-TX) have also joined as original co-sponsors of the bill. Senator Ernst originally introduced the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act in March 2015 and it was her first piece of legislation introduced in the United States Senate. About the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act: Amends the Veterans’ Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to allow a veteran instant authorization of non-VA care if the veteran provides an electronic or hard-copy statement in writing that they are not receiving adequate or timely mental health care at the VA. Eliminates the 40-mile and VA wait-time triggers for mental health care only under the Choice Act. Prioritizes incentives for the hiring of mental health care professionals at VA. Uses Choice Act funds to pay for the bill. Provides the VA 90 days to enact the program. Additionally, September is Suicide Awareness Prevention Month.

09.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued a statement on the framework for tax reform: “Our loophole-ridden and outdated tax code is a prime example of how government inefficiency can negatively impact Iowans and their businesses. At 35 percent, our corporate tax rate is the highest in the developed world. For our small businesses — which make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa — the marginal tax rate can reach as high as 44.6 percent. On top of that, business owners spend untold amounts of money and hours attempting to comply with our nonsensical tax code. “We must ensure that this mission to reform our broken tax code focuses on relieving the burden the complicated federal tax system has placed on Iowa’s families, individuals, and small businesses. Such reform is essential to reinvigorating America’s economy. I am pleased to see this framework today and look forward to reviewing it and working with my colleagues to simplify and streamline our tax code in order to keep more hard-earned dollars in the pockets of Iowans.”
09.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, sent a letter to President Donald J. Trump expressing her concern over the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) move to potentially set biodiesel volumes in the RFS for 2018 and 2019 at substantially lower volumes, which could in turn, hurt Iowa farmers, manufacturers, and rural communities. In the letter to the president, Senator Ernst noted his “relentless backing” of the RFS, but stated her displeasure “to see your Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forward a Notice of Data Availability related to biodiesel volumes in the RFS for 2018 that have already been finalized, along with proposed volumes for 2019. While the document technically ‘provides the public notice and an opportunity to comment,’ in reality it serves to make the case for substantially lowering the volumes for U.S. produced biodiesel, just as domestic producers are making investments to bring unused capacity back online.” Senator Ernst has consistently called for maintaining and protecting the current RFS standard, and has stressed the importance of the RFS to EPA Administrator nominee Scott Pruitt several times. Senator Ernst emphasized to the President today that it is her “hope that your EPA has not forgotten about the pledges that were made to my constituents and to farmers across the country. And it is my hope that your support of American jobs and made in America energy has not wavered.” The full text of Senator Ernst’s letter to President Trump can be found below or by clicking here. The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Trump: As you know, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) is critical to our farmers, and is an important part of our national energy security. Ethanol and biodiesel provide jobs across rural America, along with clean, renewable energy that is made in the U.S.A. Your relentless backing of this energy policy has been very much appreciated. However, I was surprised yesterday to see your Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put forward a Notice of Data Availability related to biodiesel volumes in the RFS for 2018 that have already been finalized, along with proposed volumes for 2019. While the document technically “provides the public notice and an opportunity to comment,” in reality it serves to make the case for substantially lowering the volumes for U.S. produced biodiesel, just as domestic producers are making investments to bring unused capacity back online. Needless to say, this is bad for American farmers, American manufacturing and American rural communities, and would appear to be at odds with your commitment to grow American renewable fuels. It is my hope that this “opportunity to comment” is that and only that. It is also my hope that your EPA has not forgotten about the pledges that were made to my constituents and to farmers across the country. And it is my hope that your support of American jobs and made in America energy has not wavered. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
09.20.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Ernst (R-Iowa), King (I-Maine), Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Collins (R-Maine) introduced bipartisan legislation that would increase funding to successful U.S. Department of Agriculture export promotion programs and help U.S. farmers maintain an edge in the increasingly competitive global marketplace. The bill, the Cultivating Revitalization by Expanding American Agricultural Trade and Exports (CREAATE) Act, aims to revitalize the USDA’s export promotion programs, which generated a net return of $28.30 for every dollar invested between 1977 and 2014. The CREAATE Act would aid two of the USDA’s most successful programs, the Market Access Program (MAP) and Foreign Market Development Program (FMDP), by doubling their funding over five years. "As American farmers and ranchers are struggling with historically low commodity prices, maintaining and strengthening U.S. trade relationships around the world is critical to the survival and profitability of the agricultural community,” said Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry. “The Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development Program have proven to be effective in expanding foreign markets for American agricultural goods. With one in every five jobs in Iowa being dependent on trade, it’s important that we ensure these programs have the ability to continue supporting our agricultural economy in Iowa, as well as across the United States. I am glad to join my colleagues in supporting the bipartisan CREAATE Act.” “Export promotion programs like MAP and FDMP have a proven track record of helping American farm products reach foreign markets, opening up new opportunities and adding billions of dollars to our nation’s agricultural industry. However, recent funding levels for these programs do not reflect their importance to American exports.” said Senator King. “Passage of this bipartisan legislation would mean growth for our agricultural industry and more good jobs across the economy. Additionally, it would ensure Maine’s famous lobsters, blueberries and everything in between can be enjoyed around the globe.” “Hoosier farmers are among the best in the world and a pillar of Indiana’s economy,” said Senator Donnelly. “That’s why I am proud to work with my colleagues and friends, Senators Angus King, Joni Ernst and Susan Collins, on bipartisan legislation that would help expand international market access for our farmers, increase opportunities for them to sell their products to customers across the globe, and strengthen our state’s agricultural economy.” “American farmers, ranchers, and fishermen in Maine and across our country rely on programs like MAP and FDMP extensively to help them expand their customer base and market their products abroad. This bipartisan legislation would help strengthen our nation’s agricultural industry and help create jobs.” said Senator Collins. “Maine-made food is renowned for its quality and taste, and this increased investment would enable more consumers to access our state’s homegrown products.” MAP was established in 1985, and allows agricultural trade associations, farmer cooperatives, non-profit trade groups, and small businesses to apply for either generic or brand-specific promotion funds to support exporting efforts. Generic commodity funds are issues with a 10-percent minimum matching fund, while brand-specific funds require a funding match of at least 50%. FMDP was first developed in 1955, and is largely used for the promotion of bulk commodities, helping agricultural trade associations establish permanent presences in important markets. It also includes a matching fund requirement. USDA export programs like MAP and FDMP have added an annual average of $8.15 billion to the value of American agricultural exports, and added up to 239,800 full and part-time jobs, including 90,000 farm sector jobs. Despite these successes, MAP and FDMP funding has not increased since the 2002 Farm Bill, even as competitors increase their efforts; for example, the European Union’s spending for the promotion of wine exceeded the total budget of MAP and FMDP in 2017. The CREAATE Act would curb this trend by providing the agricultural community with the level of support they need.
09.20.2017	WASHINGTON – A bipartisan fix to military law from U.S. Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa and Claire McCaskill of Missouri to better guard against “revenge porn” by making such conduct a standard offense across the military—following the Marines United scandal earlier this year—is set to become law as part of the annual defense bill. The sweeping legislation was approved by the Senate 89-8 and now heads to the President’s desk. “The disgusting online activity of certain servicemembers uncovered earlier this year is simply unacceptable," said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “The PRIVATE Act makes it clear that sexual assault, or harassment of any kind, will not be tolerated within our military. This legislation holds servicemembers accountable for their actions, and encourages all servicemembers to conduct themselves with integrity and respect. I am pleased that this legislation was included in the FY2018 NDAA so that we can continue to change the culture surrounding sexual assault, not only in our military, but society as a whole.” “Whether it’s in the barracks or on the internet, degradation and intimidation of our servicemembers is a serious crime that threatens good order and discipline, and we’ve got to give our military the tools it needs to treat it that way,” said McCaskill, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and a former courtroom prosecutor. “This will enable us to better go after these bad actors and ensure justice for victims of these exploitative crimes.” Ernst and McCaskill have also teamed up with a bipartisan group of colleagues to address sexual violence on college campuses with the Campus Accountability and Safety Act—legislation to combat sexual assault on college and university campuses by protecting students, promoting equity, and strengthening accountability and transparency for institutions. Earlier this year, an investigative journalist and Marine veteran brought to light a series of nude posts of female service members online in the Facebook group “Marines United” – in which Active Duty and Reserve service members posted degrading comments and shared nude photos of fellow service members online. Additional nude photo sharing sites were also uncovered, and reports suggest the horrific activity was carried out by members in each service branch. In spite of this scandal, The Department of Defense’s Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military showed a continuation of the trend demonstrated since an historic overhaul of the military justice system—a further drop in incidents of sexual violence, combined with an increased willingness of victims to come forward. The report shows a nearly 27 percent decrease in incidents of sexual assault and an increase in the number of victims coming forward to report crimes. The Pentagon’s report also estimated in 2016, 14,900 servicemembers experienced a sexual assault, down 27 percent from approximately 20,300 in 2014. The report also showed a 1.5 percent increase in incident reporting from 2015 to 2016, with 6,172 reports filed last year. The last Fiscal Year Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military, for 2014, which measured both reporting and incidents, showed that incidents of unwanted sexual contact dropped by 29 percent from 2012 to 2014. The total number of reports (restricted and unrestricted) went up 11 percent from 2013 to 2014, and up 70 percent from 2012.
09.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, released the following statement after voting in favor of Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) on the floor, which included 41 of Senator Ernst’s amendments, and passed the Senate with bipartisan support. “The bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act is critical to ensuring our servicemembers have the resources and equipment they need while combatting the evolving global threats confronting our country. “As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, strengthening our military, and ensuring the United States is ready to counter rising threats across the globe is my priority in the NDAA. I am pleased the NDAA included several of my provisions that direct our military to better address the growing threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia, as well as extend funding and authority to fend off threats from Russia, and provide support to Iowa’s sister state, Kosovo. “Additionally, the NDAA contains my bipartisan efforts to thwart sexual assault, hold bad actors accountable for disgusting online activity, and create a career track for the JAG corps in order to improve expertise within the military justice system. “I am pleased the Senate has passed this critical legislation, bringing us one step closer to providing our servicemembers with the resources they need to best protect themselves and our country. I look forward to making sure it is sent to the president’s desk as quickly as possible.” Summary of Ernst Bills Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: S. 307 - Department of Defense Emergency Response Capabilities Database Enhancement Act of 2017 S.1243 - Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act S.1316 - Suicide Prevention And Resilience Program For The National Guard And Reserves S.1349 - Leadership Recognition Act S.1408 - Enhancement of Effective Prosecution and Defense in Courts-Martial S.1296 - PRIVATE Act S.1038 - Legislation to Examine Women-Owned Small Business Opportunities Summary of Additional Ernst Provisions Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: A provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army to award the Personnel Protection Equipment award of the Army to former members of the Army. The Personnel Protection Equipment award is given to servicemembers whose lives were saved by their equipment, such as helmets or body armor. A provision that clarifies and revises the definition of a commercial item, to address concerns from small businesses who seek to sell items to both the Department of Defense and everyday Iowans. A provision increasing the procurement of commercial off-the-shelf personal protective equipment, like body armor. Iowa is home to many companies that build military equipment, and even some who make the strongest body armor in the world. A provision restricting the Department of Defense from the use of reverse auctions and lowest price technically acceptable contracting methods when procuring critical safety items, like parachutes. This ensures the best parachutes are purchased for our servicemembers, not just the most cost-effective. A congressional charter for Spirit of America to allow increased partnership with the Department of Defense as they seek to support U.S. missions abroad. A provision to modernize authority to help the country of Colombia to ensure the country is able to counter armed groups and terrorist organizations. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for the U.S. to address the rise of groups, like ISIS, in Latin America. A provision to strengthen and support the National Guard counterdrug program, like the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center found in Iowa. A provision reviewing the Department of Defense’s effort to combat the funding of terrorism through the illicit trafficking in commodities, to include tobacco. A provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to partner forces to support U.S. special operations to combat irregular warfare threats. A provision extending the authority for and increasing the funding of lethal and non-lethal support to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. A provision extending the ban on military cooperation with the Russia. A provision prohibiting any funding for activity that would recognize the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea. A provision extending U.S. anti-tunnel cooperation activities with Israel. A provision directing U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Special Operations Command – Pacific to develop a strategy to combat the growing threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for a strategy to address growing terrorism in Southeast Asia. A provision supporting the U.S assistance to the Kosovo Security Force as it makes its transition to a multi-ethnic army for the Republic of Kosovo. A provision that would require the Secretary of the Navy to provide quarterly updates on the progress of the Navy’s Physiological Episode Team and their efforts to combat physiological episodes in jets. Physiological episodes create an unsafe, and potentially lethal, flying environment. A provision encouraging the Department of Defense to expand its efforts beyond lightweight polymer ammunition casing into polymer magazine pallets, rounds, and other related equipment. A provision that allows the U.S. Marine Corps to award M-1 rifles as trophies for marksmanship competitions. A provision recognizing computer-based human simulation testing Human Simulation Report Language, like that found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. Human simulation research lowers costs to enhance warfighter mobility, survivability, welfare and training. A provision recognizing military paint training facilities that perform painting and coating operations for the Department of Defense, a key program also found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. These training programs save the Department time and funding resources. A provision acknowledging injuries sustained by helicopter crewmembers due to the type of restraints in use. It encourages the Army to use the Mobile Aircrew Restraint System currently in use by the Air Force to reduce the number of injuries to crewmembers. A provision providing a technical change to last year’s provision for companies like Uber and Lyft to have access to bases. A provision that supports Department of Defense to start ride-share pilots on base to cut down on DUIs.

A provision recognizing the risk of Foot and Mouth Disease, or other foreign animal disease, to our food production economy and our national security. It directs the Department of Defense and Department of Agriculture to analyze our ability to respond to such an attack. A provision requiring a report on the adoption of project, program, and portfolio management standards within Department of Defense. A provision that recognizes our adversaries’ use of low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and the United States’ need to expand its capability to protect against UAS threats. A provision requiring a report on the Department of Defense’s implementation of direct hiring authorities for military spouses. A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to transfer excess and unused equipment from the Defense Distribution Depot to Rock Island Arsenal to be used to build new warfighting equipment. An amendment to authorize the expedited procurement of a commercially available off-the-shelf item, non-developmental item, or Government off-the-shelf material solution for an Interim Combat Service Rifle. An amendment expressing the sense of Congress on the threat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant poses to Iraq, including the Iraqi Sunni, Shia, and Kurdish communities. Cosponsored a report on the audit of the full financial statements of the Department of Defense. Cosponsored a report on the capabilities and activities of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other violent extremist groups in Southeast Asia. Cosponsored an amendment that encourages government entities to relocate to existing military installations with excess space, like Rock Island Arsenal, before leasing commercial space.

09.15.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) joined Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-IA.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), urging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to work with the Brazilian government to end a recently reinstated 20 percent tariff on ethanol imports in excess of 600 million liters (158 million gallons) annually. In 2016, the United States exported 264 million gallons of ethanol to Brazil, and current trends indicate 2017 could be even larger for U.S. producers. The United States is the primary exporter of ethanol into Brazil. U.S. producers called Brazil’s tariff plan “a trade barrier that threatens over $750 million in U.S. exports and American jobs.” “The U.S. renewable fuels industry has invested heavily in ethanol plants, feedstock development and infrastructure over the last several decades to advance the industry,” the senators wrote. “Similar investments have been made in many other countries including Brazil. Unfortunately, seemingly arbitrary or protectionist tariffs are threatening to disrupt the growing global market that has developed for ethanol. We look forward to working with you to address the concerns regarding Brazil’s actions.” The full text of the letter can be found below or by clicking here. September 15, 2017 Ambassador Robert Lighthizer United States Trade Representative 600 17th Street NW Washington, DC 20508 Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: As you know, the Brazilian government recently announced it will impose a Tariff Rate Quota (TRQ) on ethanol imports. The reinstatement of this 20% tariff, which is imposed on imports in excess of 600 million liters (158 million gallons) during a one year period, raises great concern. We are writing to ask that you directly engage the Brazilian government and quickly work to resolve this issue. For several years, the U.S. and Brazil have engaged in ethanol trade which signaled the maturing and global nature of the biofuels industry. However, this new action by Brazil’s Chamber of Foreign Trade indicates a potential turning point in how ethanol moves between our respective countries. The U.S. renewable fuels industry has invested heavily in ethanol plants, feedstock development and infrastructure over the last several decades to advance the industry. Similar investments have been made in many other countries including Brazil. Unfortunately, seemingly arbitrary or protectionist tariffs are threatening to disrupt the growing global market that has developed for ethanol. We look forward to working with you to address the concerns regarding Brazil’s actions. Sincerely, Sen. Chuck Grassley Sen. Joni Ernst Sen. Deb Fischer Sen. Joe Donnelly Sen. Tammy Duckworth Sen. Al Franken Sen. Amy Klobuchar Sen. Debbie Stabenow Sen. Ben Sasse Sen. Dick Durbin
09.14.2017	U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, today delivered remarks on the Senate floor urging her colleagues to support the FY 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The FY 2018 NDAA unanimously passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on June 28, 2017, and included 35 of the Iowa Senator’s provisions. Click here or the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Mr. President, “Throughout my time as a Senator, I have heard our service chiefs testify, time and again, to the hollowing of America’s military as a result of insufficient and unpredictable funding. Simultaneously, external dangers have grown in size and scope. “Now, sadly, for the first time in decades, we are forced to confront, not one, but multiple existential threats to the American way of life. An aggressive Russia, expanding China, nuclear North Korea, nefarious Iran, and relentless global terror networks put our lives, and the lives of future generations, at risk. “America is once again in crisis. Inaction, obstruction, or partial commitments are not options. “This year’s National Defense Authorization Act provides us an opportunity to fulfill our duty – to provide America’s Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Guardsmen the tools they need to accomplish all that we demand. “I find it particularly fitting this bill came to the floor the week of September 11th – an anniversary of unparalleled adversity, but also one of national unity. On that day, and the days that followed sixteen years ago, the best of America eclipsed the evil of terror. We came together for the sake of our security, demonstrating to the world, America’s resilience. “There is no greater symbol of that resilience than those who serve in uniform. Secretary Mattis reminded us of that on Monday when he said, ‘the men and women of America’s armed forces have signed a blank check – to protect the American people and to defend the Constitution – a check payable with their lives.’ “The least the Senate can do in return is authorize and prioritize Congressional efforts to keep faith with that promise. “At the same time, we are under no obligation to fund over-budget, behind timeline Defense programs with a blank check of their own. To the contrary, we have an oversight obligation to the American taxpayers, those in and out of uniform, to ensure proper stewardship of their hard-earned dollars. “That is why I, along with my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee, crafted and passed unanimously the bill before you. In it, we have prescribed a clear and comprehensive plan to rebuild our military to decisively deter or defeat any adversary. However, we are also holding the Department accountable for each dollar it spends. “For my part, as a member of the Armed Services Committee and Chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities subcommittee, I focused on three priorities: “First, I supported our troops and their families by making senior enlisted pay scales commensurate with job requirements, by combating sexual assault and retaliation, and by facilitating federal direct hiring authority for military spouses. I extended that support to the battlefield by promoting enhanced standards for things like parachutes, aircraft life support systems, and counter-drone technologies. “Second, I advanced policy initiatives to increase cooperation with international partners, to codify a more comprehensive counter-terror strategy, and to reaffirm America’s support for our European friends by putting Russia on notice for its aggression in Ukraine and Crimea. “Finally, I included measures to optimize existing institutions, such as our National Guard’s cyber capabilities, and to ease regulatory burdens, so the best ideas and products from our universities and private companies can bolster national security at a lower cost. “I have led important efforts to hold DoD accountable by requiring enhanced program management standards, and by joining Senators Grassley and Perdue in demanding the Department finally meet its 26-year overdue statutory obligation to complete a clean audit. “Colleagues, let us be clear, no one wants America’s military to be our first, or only, option. But we must also acknowledge this truth – it is fundamental to our security that a ready military remains an option. “The FY18 NDAA is a vital step towards providing that security. Seeing it through to fruition, as part of a larger effort to re-assert our ‘power of the purse’, that’s the next step. There will be time to debate non-defense policies and budgets later – and, as legislators, our job is to have these very debates. “Let us take the first step now, and I urge all of my colleagues – to support the NDAA. Follow through in the months ahead. Fulfill our obligation to realize its goal. We can do no less. “Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.”
09.14.2017	WASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate today confirmed by a unanimous, bipartisan voice vote the nominations of Peter Deegan, Jr. and Marc Krickbaum to be U.S. Attorneys for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa, respectively, the final step in the confirmation process before being sworn into office. The nominations were previously reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Sen. Chuck Grassley. Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst made the following comment. “Congratulations to Pete Deegan and Marc Krickbaum on their confirmations to serve as U.S. attorneys for Iowa. The overwhelming bipartisan support for their nominations from the U.S. Senate is an impressive testament to their qualifications and readiness to serve. Mr. Deegan’s significant experience within the office he will now lead, most recently as chief of the criminal division, has uniquely prepared him for his new role as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Iowa. Likewise, Mr. Krickbaum’s extensive experience within the Department of Justice, most recently as an assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago and Des Moines, has provided him with the experience necessary to lead as the next U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa. Both Mr. Deegan and Mr. Krickbaum are highly qualified and we’re confident they will serve our state and country well.”

09.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an effort to cut spending and safeguard taxpayer dollars, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today re-introduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017. This legislation reforms the outdated system that provides former U.S. Presidents with post-presidency benefits by establishing first-ever limits on the taxpayer support they receive. Currently, under the Former Presidents Act, former presidents receive a generous pension as well as a monetary allowance to cover expenses such as travel, staff, communications, and office space – all funded by the American taxpayer. According to the Congressional Research Service, this post-presidency funding dates back to 1958, when Congress passed the Former Presidents Act in an effort to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and help cover the costs associated with having held the office of the president. Nowadays, with former presidents earning millions of dollars through speaking engagements, consulting, book deals, and board memberships, the Former President’s Act needs to be updated to take into account the modern financial standing of former presidents. Senator Ernst’s legislation would establish a cap on former presidents’ monetary allowances, which are currently unlimited and fund resources like office space, staff salaries, cell phone bills, and more. It would then reduce the allowance dollar-for-dollar by each dollar of income a former president earns in excess of $400,000. This legislation, however, does not impact funding for the security or protection of a former president. “With the national debt quickly approaching $20 trillion, we cannot afford to generously subsidize the perks of former presidents to the tune of millions of dollars,” said Senator Ernst. “The reality is that post-presidential life already provides fruitful opportunities on its own, with former presidents raking in tens of millions of dollars from book deals, speaking engagements, and more. This legislation implements greatly needed reforms and saves taxpayers millions. Most importantly, it’s another step toward reigning-in Washington’s out-of-control spending.” Senator Ernst first introduced the bipartisan and bicameral Presidential Allowance Modernization Act on May 21, 2015. After passing both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives with unanimous support, it was ultimately vetoed by President Obama. Congressman Jody Hice (R-GA) will introduce the companion legislation to the Presidential Modernization Act of 2017 in the U.S. House of Representatives. Read the full text of the bill here. About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017: According to a recent report from the Congressional Research Service, in fiscal year 2017 alone, former U.S. Presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.8 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2017 would: Set a former president’s pension at $200,000 per year and implement a first-ever cap on the monetary allowance at $500,000, gradually reducing to $250,000 over a period of 10 years. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president.
09.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, released the following statement on the nomination of former director of the Iowa Department of Transportation, Paul Trombino, to serve as the Administrator of the Federal Highway Administration at the Department of Transportation (DOT): “Our federal government has an important role when it comes to developing and maintaining our country’s infrastructure, and along with national defense, it is one of its core functions. Having a robust and efficient transportation infrastructure is vital to our economy. “Paul Trombino understands this, and is a committed public servant with more than 20 years of experience in updating our infrastructure at the local and statewide level. His work as President of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) as well as his service to Iowa as the director of the Iowa Department of Transportation gives him a valuable perspective and high level of dedication and will be a tremendous asset to DOT to improve the lives of all Americans. “As we move ahead on an infrastructure plan, we must ensure that it addresses fixes to roads, bridges, and highways, and also looks at dam and levee infrastructure. I look forward to working with Paul on a plan that includes these transportation needs of rural America, and not just major cities.”
09.08.2017	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa today urged the Office of National Drug Control Policy to include an evaluation of drug take back programs in the final report of the President’s Commission on Combatting Opioid Abuse, correcting a shortcoming in the interim report. “Unfortunately, the interim report did not include any reference to prescription drug take back programs,” Grassley and Ernst wrote to Richard Baum, acting director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. “We believe these programs may be an effective part of an all-of-the-above strategy to approaching the opioid epidemic. We write today to urge the Commission to include an evaluation of prescription drug take back programs in the final report.” Grassley and Ernst wrote that many people who are prescribed opioids are unsure of how to dispose of them, worsening the problem of the diversion of controlled substances to those other than the prescription holders. Congress has enacted polices to promote drug take back programs, including allowing local pharmacies to accept unused controlled substances. Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of drug take back programs in curbing abuse, the senators wrote. Iowans have participated enthusiastically in drug take back programs such as those sponsored by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). At Grassley and Ernst’s request, the U.S. Government Accountability Office is studying the DEA’s implementation of the law allowing local pharmacies to accept unused controlled substances for public convenience, amid concerns that regulations present barriers to participation. A draft report is expected very soon. Oct. 28, 2017 is the next National Prescription Drug Take Back Day, created to increase public awareness of these programs. The Grassley-Ernst letter is available here.
09.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in favor of relief funding for victims of Hurricane Harvey, but against raising the debt limit: “This week, I stated that the Senate should take up the House’s clean bill to make sure the victims of Hurricane Harvey receive the assistance they need, and today I supported a measure that would do exactly that. “Unfortunately a final deal was cut and while it includes initial relief funding, it also raises the debt limit and kicks the can down the road once again on our overall government spending levels. This is not the right way to legislate, and quite frankly, it is exactly what the American people are sick and tired of. I called for the August state work period to be canceled so that we could address issues such as the debt limit and our annual spending bills. Instead, Congress went home for several weeks when we should have been in Washington working to find solutions to many of these issues. “Washington continues to raise the debt limit without addressing the spending problems, implementing spending reforms, or working toward a balanced budget. We must get back to regular order when it comes to the debt limit and the continuing resolution (CR), rather than using this disaster to cut backroom deals. That is unacceptable. “The White House and this Congress must do better for the American people. I cannot support these efforts to raise the debt limit while failing to put into place any spending constraints or a clear path forward to get our debt under control. “We are nearly $20 trillion in debt, and today Washington is showing little regard toward getting serious about cutting spending. All across Iowa, I hear from folks who have said enough is enough when it comes to our debt, and that we simply can’t continue spending money that we don’t have. I agree. Therefore, while I supported a standalone vote on Hurricane Harvey disaster relief funding, I cannot support a bloated overall deal that hands Washington another credit card without a limit and avoids the thoughtful legislating the American people expect from Congress. “Yesterday, I called for the October state work period to be canceled, and after today’s disappointing outcome, I hope my colleagues will be willing to get to work on the incredible number of items at hand this fall.” Background: Senator Ernst supported an effort by Senator Sasse which would allow the Senate to pass funding for the victims of Hurricane Harvey as a standalone bill, without the debt limit or CR attached to it. Senator Ernst voted against final passage of the bill which included increasing the debt limit and the CR.
09.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Iowa’s U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley sent a letter to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for the Senate to remain in session during the scheduled October state work period (also referred to as “recess”), to continue working on the critical issues facing the American people. In the letter, the Iowa Senators cited the opportunity to live up to the promises Congress has made to the American people, including: “rolling back burdensome regulations, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, modernizing our infrastructure, and reforming our outdated and uncompetitive tax code.” The Senators explained “Much of this fall will be consumed by deliberation over the National Defense Authorization Act, disaster relief, the debt ceiling, appropriations, and reauthorizing programs that are set to expire at the end of this month. Furthermore, we have an unprecedented number of nominees that still need to be confirmed. “This will leave little time for Congress to work on priorities such as tax reform and infrastructure modernization, both of which are essential to reinvigorating the American economy. Furthermore, it is also imperative that we pursue a path forward on health care as soon as possible and not give up on our promise to provide relief from this failing law.” Following Senator Ernst’s call for a similar cancellation in the August state work period, the Senate saw a one week delay and made significant progress on nominations and other legislation. Read the full text of the letter here and below. The Honorable Mitch McConnell Majority Leader United States Senate S-230 Capitol Building Washington, D.C. 20510 Dear Leader McConnell, Last November, the American people sent a clear message to Washington that business as usual was no longer acceptable. Congress was finally given an opportunity to fulfill the promises we have made to the American people, such as rolling back burdensome regulations, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, modernizing our infrastructure, and reforming our outdated and uncompetitive tax code. While we have made some progress during the first 9 months of this Congress—particularly with regard to reducing the regulatory burden on hardworking businesses and individuals—we have much work to accomplish and we respectfully request that the Senate work through the scheduled October state work period. Much of this fall will be consumed by deliberation over the National Defense Authorization Act, disaster relief, the debt ceiling, appropriations, and reauthorizing programs that are set to expire at the end of this month. Furthermore, we have an unprecedented number of nominees that still need to be confirmed. This will leave little time for Congress to work on priorities such as tax reform and infrastructure modernization, both of which are essential to reinvigorating the American economy. Furthermore, it is also imperative that we pursue a path forward on health care as soon as possible and not give up on our promise to provide relief from this failing law. However challenging these issues may be, the American people rightfully expect us to follow through on the commitments that we have made, and we believe it is critical that we devote the necessary time to accomplishing these tasks. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst Charles E. Grassley United States Senator United States Senator
09.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued a response following the announcement from the Trump administration regarding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program: "America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, but we are also a nation of laws. However, many young undocumented children were brought here by parents, caretakers, and so forth through no fault of their own. As I have stated many times before, we must show compassion toward these children. While I do not support giving them citizenship, we must identify and pursue a measured approach that addresses their unique situation, but also respects the importance of our immigration laws and discourages future illegal immigration. “It is now incumbent upon Congress to act. We have an opportunity to solve this issue, work to secure the border, and modernize the legal immigration system.”
09.05.2017	“Terminating KORUS would leave our farmers at a competitive disadvantage to those in other countries that enjoy preferential trade access to Korea. American farmers and ranchers would lose market share, and their profitability would be impacted at a time when they are already struggling with historically low commodity prices.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, sent a letter to President Trump expressing her concern over reports that the United States might withdraw from the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). In the letter, Senator Ernst highlighted the importance of this trade deal to both the U.S. and Korea, stating that “with over $144 billion in goods and services moving between us in 2016. One of our top trading partners, Korea represents our 7th largest goods export market, and stepping away from this deal could have many negative consequences.” Additionally, the Iowa Senator detailed the potential negative outcomes for our nation’s agricultural economy: “Terminating KORUS would leave our farmers at a competitive disadvantage to those in other countries that enjoy preferential trade access to Korea. American farmers and ranchers would lose market share, and their profitability would be impacted at a time when they are already struggling with historically low commodity prices.” Senator Ernst has consistently focused on the need for strong trade agreements to foster relationships with nations, and reemphasized again today that “In addition to the negative impact on our family farms, backing out of this agreement could have geo-political ramifications as well.” This rings true especially in the Pacific Rim, where “there is another economic force in the region that would gladly step in to fill that void and consolidate power, and that nation is China.” The full text of Senator Ernst’s letter to President Trump can be found below or by clicking here. The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Trump: I write to you today to express my strong concern with the rumored proposal to withdraw the United States from the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). This trade deal has been beneficial to both of our countries, with over $144 billion in goods and services moving between us in 2016. One of our top trading partners, Korea represents our 7th largest goods export market, and stepping away from this deal could have many negative consequences. Over its relatively short life span, KORUS has been particularly favorable for American agriculture, an area in which we enjoy a large trade surplus. Our ag exports to Korea totaled $6.2 billion in 2016, compared to the $519 million in ag products they sent to us. Korea is our 5th largest agricultural export market, and is particularly important for our beef, corn, and pork producers. Terminating KORUS would leave our farmers at a competitive disadvantage to those in other countries that enjoy preferential trade access to Korea. American farmers and ranchers would lose market share, and their profitability would be impacted at a time when they are already struggling with historically low commodity prices. In addition to the negative impact on our family farms, backing out of this agreement could have geo-political ramifications as well. We should be engaging more closely with countries in the Pacific Rim, and developing stronger trade ties with them. When I visit these nations, I hear overwhelmingly that they would like to do more trade with the U.S., and have their economies more closely integrated with ours. If we are not engaging with these nations, there is another economic force in the region that would gladly step in to fill that void and consolidate power, and that nation is China. We should maintain and strengthen our ties with South Korea at a time of great tension in the region, and recommit to growing this trading relationship for our family farmers and ranchers across the country. I respectfully urge you not withdraw the U.S. from KORUS. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
09.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, issued the following statement on the nomination of Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey to serve as Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA): “Agriculture has been engrained in Bill Northey all his life. As a fourth generation Iowa farmer, he has dedicated his life to helping farmers and ranchers across the state of Iowa. Bill has traveled around to Iowa’s 99 counties to hear directly from folks about the issues they are concerned about and works tirelessly to identify a path forward. Additionally, he has taken part in important international trade missions and understands the need to promote our agricultural bounty abroad. “For nearly a decade, Iowa has benefited from having a Secretary of Agriculture as committed and hardworking as Bill Northey; he will be greatly missed. However, I know he is the best person for the job and will serve the American people well, along with Secretary Perdue, and will be an advocate on behalf of farmers, and not Washington bureaucrats.”
08.21.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued this statement following President Trump’s update on Afghanistan: “As a veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I do not take lightly the decision to commit America’s young men and women to conflict. Unfortunately, the reality is this: arbitrary timelines, troop levels, and an overall lack of strategy from the previous Administration has created an environment in Afghanistan where 20 of the world’s international terror networks reside, the Taliban is resurging, and the region is vulnerable to the malign influence of Iran and Russia. As Secretary James Mattis recently described, ‘we are not winning in Afghanistan.’ “Maintaining the status quo is unacceptable to our national security and unacceptable to our troops and their families. “Tonight the President outlined his vision for a new strategy in Afghanistan - one which prioritizes the need for increased cooperation with regional partners such as Pakistan and India. “Now is not the time to abandon our fight against terrorism in Afghanistan, its people or our international partners. Instead, we must once again lead from a position of strength. Therefore, moving forward, I am committed to both guaranteeing our servicemembers are well-equipped for combat, while also holding the Department of Defense and the Administration accountable for ensuring the effectiveness of this strategy.”
08.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, bipartisan legislation championed by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), known as the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act, was signed into law by the President. The bill, sponsored by Congressmen Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Seth Moulton (D-MA), is a companion measure to S. 926 which Ernst and Manchin introduced in April. The legislation authorizes the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, a private foundation, to begin the process of pursuing the construction of a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The memorial will honor our men and women in uniform, the fallen servicemembers, their families, and all those who have been impacted by our nation’s longest war. “I am thrilled the President has signed into law this important legislation authorizing the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation to begin creating a place of remembrance for those who served, their loved ones, and all impacted by this war,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “I am thankful this years-long process can now begin so the veterans of this war may have the opportunity to visit the tribute to their selfless service.” “For the thousands of Americans who perished protecting our freedom, and the million more who were wounded or fought in the global war on terror, this memorial will forever honor their sacrifice to our great country,” Senator Manchin said. “I’m proud of the work done by my colleagues in approving the first step towards building a memorial that commemorates our sons and daughters who answered the call to fight. I thank the President for seeing to it that this memorial was quickly approved.” This authorization is the first step in a process that will culminate with the design and construction of a Global War on Terror Memorial on the National Mall without using any federal funds. Additionally, this legislation has received support from The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the US (VFW), Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans Of America (IAVA), Wounded Warrior Project, The Military Order of the Purple Heart, American Veterans (AMVETS), American Goldstar Mothers, Student Veterans of America, The Green Beret Foundation, Team Rubicon, The Mission Continues, Team Red White and Blue, Travis Manion Foundation, Got Your Six, Warrior Expeditions, Union Veteran Council of the AFL-CIO, and Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS).

08.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) applauded the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) announcement to expand telehealth services for veterans and provide telemedicine across state lines. This announcement follows the senators’ efforts to improve telehealth services for veterans through their bipartisan legislation, the Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act. “The VA’s decision to allow veterans to access care from the comfort of, or closer to, their own homes is necessary to improving quality and timely care for the more than 200,000 veterans in Iowa, particularly those who are disabled or reside in rural communities,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “It is critical that we continue to create opportunities for veterans to receive the best care out there, including potentially life-saving mental health care. Improving the VA’s telehealth program is critical, and I am thrilled to see this common-sense measure will be put into action to benefit Iowans and veterans across the country.” “Today’s announcement is a positive step forward to allow Hawaii veterans to access health care services regardless of where they live,” said Senator Hirono. “I will continue to push for the passage of the VETS Act to ensure that Secretary Shulkin’s announcement can be strengthened with full legislative authority to help veterans across the country.” Beginning in 2015 and again in 2017, Senators Ernst and Hirono called for the expansion of telehealth services for veterans through their bipartisan Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support (VETS) Act. The VETS Act seeks to improve health care access – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) by allowing VA health officials to practice telemedicine across state lines if they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized federal duties. Additionally, the legislation ensures the VA and Congress provide oversight of the VA’s telehealth program by requiring the VA to measure program effectiveness.

08.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, bipartisan legislation championed by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Joe Manchin (D-WV), known as the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act, passed the Senate unanimously. The bill, sponsored by Congressmen Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) is a companion measure to S. 926 which Ernst and Manchin introduced in April. The legislation previously passed the U.S. House of Representatives and now heads to President Trump’s desk. The senators’ legislation authorizes the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, a private foundation, to begin the process of pursuing the construction of a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The memorial will honor our men and women in uniform, the fallen servicemembers, their families, and all those who have been impacted by our nation’s longest war. “I am thrilled the Senate has overwhelmingly approved our bipartisan legislation, so that we can take another step closer toward honoring the brave men and women, and their loved ones, who have sacrificed so much in the defense of our nation with an important memorial,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “It is my hope that this memorial is a place for our veterans and their families to heal, honor, and remember all those impacted by this war.” “Since September 11, 2001, brave warriors from all across our country have returned home from the battlefield with both visible and invisible wounds,” said Senator Manchin. “Our most courageous sons and daughters selflessly picked up arms to fight terror. It is incredibly important that we honor these men and women through this memorial, so that their stories may be told and remembered for generations.” This authorization is the first step in a process that will culminate with the design and construction of a Global War on Terror Memorial on the National Mall without using any federal funds. Additionally, this legislation has received support from The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the US (VFW), Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans Of America (IAVA), Wounded Warrior Project, The Military Order of the Purple Heart, American Veterans (AMVETS), American Goldstar Mothers, Student Veterans of America, The Green Beret Foundation, Team Rubicon, The Mission Continues, Team Red White and Blue, Travis Manion Foundation, Got Your Six, Warrior Expeditions, Union Veteran Council of the AFL-CIO, and Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS).
08.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Office of Inspector General at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA OIG) today released the results of its review of the circumstances of veteran Brandon Ketchum’s suicide and whether Ketchum received adequate mental health treatment at the Iowa City VA Health Care System. Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Sen. Ron Johnson, and Rep. Dave Loebsack sought the review. The Members of Congress made the following comment. “This case is a tragic example of why we must do better for our veterans. It also illustrates the importance of having independent watchdogs at federal agencies. Inspectors general review agency work and point out problems that need to be fixed and ensure that policies and procedures in place are adequate. In this case, the inspector general report made four recommendations to improve mental health treatment for veterans going forward, but could not determine if these shortcomings impacted Brandon’s care. With an average of 20 veterans committing suicide a day, the VA must do everything in its power to extend help before it is too late. When it comes to caring for these brave men and women, there is no room for error. We expect the VA to implement the recommendations thoroughly and carefully, and we intend to make sure the VA does so. The VA should go beyond the recommendations if necessary. We all have to work as hard as possible to make sure all veterans receive the care they need and deserve.” The VA OIG’s four recommendations include: The OIG recommends that the Acting Under Secretary for Health ensure that facility staff conduct thorough post suicide reviews to include all information that provides valuable context and details related to the event. The OIG recommends that the System Director ensure that the system No-Show policy and practice for mental health patients is in alignment with the expectations of the Office of Mental Health Operations and that system leaders monitor compliance. The OIG recommends that the System Director ensure that clinicians update outpatient mental health treatment plans according to applicable requirements and guidance and that system leaders monitor compliance. The OIG recommends that the System Director ensure that the Mental Health Treatment Coordinator program complies with the Veterans Health Administration requirements and guidance, and that system leaders monitor compliance. The inspector general report is available here. More information on the request is available here.
08.02.2017	WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-NY) bipartisan legislation to direct the Small Business Administration to conduct a study on women-owned small business’ (WOSB) participation in federal multiple award contracts (MACs) was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. A report issued at the end of 2015 by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that the odds of a WOSB winning a federal contract are 21 percent lower than that of their counterparts. The report also found that WOSBs have lower odds of winning contracts in the industries that receive the majority of federal contract dollars. The study would address concerns that WOSBs are underrepresented in MACs, and would also examine the participation of all other socio-economic categories of small businesses such as those participating in the Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) program. “In order to ensure all our entrepreneurs have a fair shot at winning federal contracts, we must first understand the root of this problem and how extensive it is,” said Senator Ernst. “With small businesses making up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa and about 82,000 of those being women-owned businesses, I am pleased to see my colleagues on the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee approve this important step towards ensuring all small businesses have better access to these contracting opportunities.” “We need to do everything we can to make sure that women-owned small businesses can compete for federal contracts on a level playing field, so that they can have the same access as anyone else to business opportunities that can create good-paying jobs,” said Senator Gillibrand. “Now that this bill is heading to the full Senate for a vote, I am urging my colleagues to pass this legislation to help women-owned small businesses have a fair shot at growing and succeeding.”
08.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, issued the following statement after the United States Senate passed the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017: “Our veterans deserve timely access to high quality health care no matter where they are located,” said Senator Ernst. “The VA Choice program can work to improve access and choice when it comes to veterans’ care, particularly for our disabled and rural veterans. I applaud the passage of the VA Choice and Quality Employment Act for putting the access to quality and timely care for our veterans first.” The VA Choice and Quality Employment Act of 2017 provides critical funding to the Veterans Choice Fund, therefore extending the VA Choice Program for an additional six months. The VA Choice Program authorizes veterans who live farther than 40 miles from a VA facility, or those who cannot get an appointment with the VA in under 30 days, to access care outside the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system. Additionally, this legislation authorizes 28 major medical facility leases and puts in place reforms to strengthen the VA’s ability to train, recruit and retain its workforce. This important legislation now heads to the President’s desk.
08.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed former United States Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justices’ Criminal Division, Christopher Wray, to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): “Mr. Wray’s extensive experience in public service and the field of law enforcement has proven him to be a solid choice to serve as director of the FBI,” said Senator Ernst. “Ensuring integrity and independence in the agency is critical, and I look forward to him leading the FBI with the same dedication and conviction as he has throughout his career.”
08.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell calling for him to press ahead on repealing and replacing ObamaCare. In the letter, Senator Ernst detailed that, “While traveling across Iowa, I hear countless stories from Iowans facing these premium increases, as well as increases in other out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays that they simply cannot afford. We don’t have the option to sit back and do nothing; Iowans, like so many Americans across the country, are demanding relief from ObamaCare.” The Iowa Senator continued: “It is imperative that the results of last week, and months of work leading up to it, are not the end of our efforts. Rather, we still must work as hard as we can to repeal this failed law and ensure people have access to affordable, patient-centered health care.” In late June, Senator Ernst joined a group of her colleagues in sending a letter to Majority Leader McConnell requesting they work through the August state work period (also known as “recess”) to make progress on important priorities, such as health care. While Majority Leader McConnell took their concerns to heart and delayed the August state work period, Senator Ernst stated the Senate “should use this as an opportunity to work legislative efforts through our committees and engage with all of our colleagues to find a solution.” The full text of the letter can be found below or by clicking here. Senator Mitch McConnellMajority Leader, United States SenateS-230U.S. CapitolWashington, DC Dear Leader McConnell: I share your disappointment and frustration over the failure to convince our colleagues that ObamaCare has failed and needs to be repealed and replaced. As I’ve said throughout this debate, ObamaCare is not sustainable in Iowa. In fact, Iowans in the individual market have seen massive rate increases and their choices disappear. While traveling across Iowa, I hear countless stories from Iowans facing these premium increases, as well as increases in other out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays that they simply cannot afford. We don’t have the option to sit back and do nothing; Iowans, like so many Americans across the country, are demanding relief from ObamaCare. It is imperative that the results of last week, and months of work leading up to it, are not the end of our efforts. Rather, we still must work as hard as we can to repeal this failed law and ensure people have access to affordable, patient-centered health care. Last month, you decided to keep the Senate in session to work through our priorities and get results for the American people. My colleagues and I were pleased that you took our concerns to heart. It is imperative we not simply walk away from our effort to repeal and replace ObamaCare. We should use this as an opportunity to work legislative efforts through our committees and engage with all of our colleagues to find a solution. I made a promise to the voters of Iowa that I would repeal and replace ObamaCare because of the harm it has caused. My votes last week reflected that promise, but the Senate must forge ahead and make good on that promise to our constituents. Sincerely, Joni K. ErnstUnited States Senator
08.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, offered commentary at the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) public hearing for the proposed Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) for 2018, and the Biomass-Based Diesel Volume for 2019. In her comments, Senator Ernst detailed the important role a strong RFS plays for not only Iowa’s agricultural industry, but also in reducing our nation’s dependence on foreign oil and giving consumers more choice at the pump. The Iowa Senator noted that while she is pleased the EPA’s proposed 2018 volume requirements for conventional ethanol met the congressionally directed levels, she is disappointed in the lowered numbers for advanced biofuels. Senator Ernst continued, “Reducing volumes for biodiesel and cellulosic biofuels would create uncertainty and slow investment in advanced biofuels. Especially as rural communities continue to experience a downturn in the ag economy, it is essential that the EPA’s volume requirements provide stability for these critical industries.” Senator Ernst has raised the importance of the RFS to both President Trump and United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Perdue. As Senator Ernst noted in her remarks, when President Trump visited Iowa in June, he “reiterated his commitment to supporting ethanol and biodiesel as part of his plan to rebuild rural America.” Adding that she trusts “that the President’s commitment will be reflected in the final rule that the EPA puts forward.” Additionally, the Iowa Senator, a vocal supporter of biofuels, has repeatedly emphasized the important role of the RFS in a column earlier this year and with EPA Administrator Pruitt in his pre-confirmation meeting, confirmation hearing, and in multiple letters. Read Senator Ernst’s full comments below: “Good morning everyone. I’m Joni Ernst, the junior Senator from the great State of Iowa. “I would like to start by thanking the EPA for holding this public forum today. It is important to take feedback from all stakeholders to inform the final rule. “I would also like to stress how important it is that the EPA get the final rule out on schedule. “Delays in years past have hampered investment in our domestic biofuels industry, which has cost jobs in rural communities across my home state of Iowa as well as the rest of the country. “The RFS is critical to supporting our agricultural economy, while also reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and providing consumers with choices at the pump. “While I was pleased that the EPA set the proposed volume requirements for conventional ethanol for 2018 at congressionally directed levels, I am disappointed that the advanced biofuels numbers were lowered. “Additionally, I am concerned that the biodiesel numbers for 2019 are being held constant, and would like to see it increased to more accurately reflect our current domestic production capacity and usage. “Reducing volumes for biodiesel and cellulosic biofuels would create uncertainty and slow investment in advanced biofuels. Especially as rural communities continue to experience a downturn in the ag economy, it is essential that the EPA’s volume requirements provide stability for these critical industries. “When President Trump visited Iowa in June, he reiterated his commitment to supporting ethanol and biodiesel as part of his plan to rebuild rural America. “I trust that the President’s commitment will be reflected in the final rule that the EPA puts forward. “Thank you for taking my comments today.”
07.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement after Senate consideration of legislation to repeal and replace ObamaCare. “As I’ve said throughout this debate, ObamaCare is not sustainable in Iowa and we have to act. Iowans in the individual market have seen their choices vanish and have seen massive rate increases. Throughout my 99 county tour, I hear countless stories from Iowans facing these premium increases, as well as increases in other out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays that they simply cannot afford. We don’t have the option to sit back and do nothing; Iowans are demanding relief from ObamaCare. “I am disappointed that the Senate was unable to advance important changes to this flawed law. We must now continue to find ways to work on behalf of Iowans and the American people who have been negatively impacted by Obamacare to find affordable, patient-centered solutions that work for them.”
07.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement after the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) use of “inadequate domestic supply” waiver authority to reduce the Renewable Fuel Standard’s Renewable Fuel Volumes (RVO) for 2016: “I was pleased the court rejected the EPA’s flawed methodology behind reducing the Renewable Fuel Standard’s renewable fuel volumes for 2016. Supplying enough renewable fuels has not been a problem for our farmers and biofuels producers, and the EPA’s use of ‘inadequate domestic supply’ waiver authority created needless uncertainty for the industry. Having a strong and long-term RFS is of critical importance to Iowa, as well as our nation, and I’m glad the court recognized this today.” In 2015, Senator Ernst pushed back on both the proposed and final RVO rules from the EPA, and joined her Senate colleagues in specifically pointing out the flawed methodology that was outside of the EPA’s authority.
07.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement after the United States Senate voted to pass the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act, legislation to increase sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. “As I have said many times before, Russia is not our friend, and poses a serious threat through their support for the murderous Bashar al-Assad regime, annexation of Crimea, and malicious cyber activity. Additionally, Iran continues its ballistic missile program and support for terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. Meanwhile, North Korea, which Secretary of Defense James Mattis cited as the ‘most urgent and dangerous threat’, continues to defy the U.S. by expanding nuclear and ballistic missile programs. These sanctions are greatly needed to help protect the United States. “I am glad Congress is taking a strong bipartisan and decisive stance against our adversaries, and urge the President to sign this legislation into law.”
07.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, led 25 of her Senate colleagues in introducing a Senate Resolution to honor Sailors and Marines who sacrificed their lives for ship and shipmates while serving onboard USS Forrestal 50 years ago this week, and to commemorate the efforts of those who survived, including now-Senator John McCain (R-AZ). On July 29, 1967, an inadvertent rocket sparked a devastating fire aboard USS Forrestal as she supported combat operations off the coast of Vietnam. The fire created a chain reaction, igniting nine bomb explosions across the flight deck. For 18 hours, the Sailors and Marines onboard, including some of Iowa’s own, fought to extinguish the fire. Despite their valiant efforts, the fire claimed the lives of 134 men and severely injured 161 others. Among the survivors was Senator McCain, who narrowly escaped the initial explosion. Ultimately, the loss of 21 aircraft and irrevocable damage to the ship forced the USS Forrestal to terminate its mission and return to Norfolk, Virginia for repairs. “The selfless sacrifices of the 134 crewmembers lost aboard USS Forrestal, and the families they left behind have not, and will never be forgotten,” said Senator Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a combat veteran. “With sincerest gratitude, we also recognize the courage and dedication of those Sailors and Marines who survived; Iowans were among them and so was my good friend Senator John McCain. Without their heroic efforts, the loss would have been even greater. Such a somber anniversary serves as a reminder of the daily risk assumed by our men and women in uniform and their commitment to serving our nation, no matter the cost.” Senator Ernst introduced this legislation with the support of Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), James Inhofe (R-OK), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Roger Wicker (R-MS), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Tim Kaine (D-VA), David Perdue (R-GA), Angus King (I-ME), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Luther Strange (R-AL).

07.26.2017	WASHINGTON – In recognition of the crucial role played by whistleblowers in shining a light on fraud, waste and abuse in the federal government, the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus introduced a bipartisan resolution designating July 30, 2017, as National Whistleblower Appreciation Day. The resolution, sponsored by caucus members and colleagues, aims to encourage federal agencies to acknowledge employees who call attention to fraud, waste and abuse and to remind employees of their legal rights as whistleblowers. “The identification of waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government frequently comes from courageous whistleblowers. Unfortunately, all too often, these individuals are penalized by their superiors for doing the right thing,” Sen. Ernst said. “Ensuring our whistleblowers are protected when they expose wrongdoing is critical to holding our government accountable and safeguarding taxpayer dollars. Let’s acknowledge and commemorate the important contributions these individuals make in pursuit of a better, more efficient, federal government for the people.” “Whistleblowers are patriotic Americans who bring accountability to government, rooting out waste, fraud and abuse. Their brave work, too often penalized by embarrassed superiors, saves taxpayers billions of dollars and shines a light on wrongdoing. More than two centuries ago our nation’s founders recognized that we needed truth-tellers in government. That is no less true today. Our resolution reaffirms this idea and celebrates whistleblowers for their contributions to transparent and accountable government,” Sen. Grassley said. “As the leaders of the bipartisan Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, Sen. Grassley and I are working today and every day to stop retaliation against those who do what’s right when they see something wrong,” Sen. Wyden said. “Congress has a lot more work to do to give whistleblowers the protections they deserve, but for now, this resolution shows there is bipartisan support in the Senate for people who are willing to speak out against waste, fraud or abuse in government and the private sector.” “Whistleblowers play an important role in promoting accountability throughout federal agencies. Unfortunately, whistleblowers often face retaliation from within their own agency. As Chairman of the Senate’s chief oversight committee, I’ve proposed legislation like the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act to protect whistleblowers and ensure bad actors are held accountable. I join with my colleagues in offering support to these brave federal employees whose actions often expose problems and, ultimately, make our government better,” Sen. Johnson said. “Whistleblowers can help to shine a light on wrongdoing or misbehavior, which helps us root out waste, fraud and abuse across the federal government. These brave individuals help to uphold the integrity of the missions they serve and can spark positive change. As a member of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus, my colleagues and I will continue working together to ensure that individuals are free to speak truth to power without fear of retaliation,” Sen. Carper said. “Whistleblowers help identify waste, fraud and abuse within the government. Recognizing the brave individuals shows how important these individuals and encourages others to expose wrongdoing. As a member of the Senate Whistleblower Caucus, I am working to ensure these men and women and protected against retaliation for speaking up,” Sen. Boozman said. “Whistleblowers are our unsung heroes—the first line of defense in identifying and rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse in the government,” Sen. McCaskill said. “Since my days as Missouri’s state auditor, I’ve been committed to doing everything I can to protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars from going to waste, and I’m so thankful for all of the whistleblowers who’ve been pivotal partners in these efforts.” “We should do more to embrace whistleblowers who want to improve the system. When whistleblowers are empowered to step forward and shine a light on misconduct, fraud, waste, and abuse, we are all better off,” said Sen. Baldwin. “I am proud to support this bipartisan resolution recognizing National Whistleblower Appreciation Day.” “Whistleblowers play an irreplaceable role in serving the public interest by exposing waste, fraud and abuse. They often put their jobs, reputations, and even lives at risk to serve the greater good. We should continue to encourage their selfless acts, protect them against reprisal, and recognize them through this bipartisan resolution,” Sen. Markey said. “Whistleblowers play an important role in government transparency and reducing fraud, waste, and abuse,” Sen. Tillis said. “Far too often, the brave individuals who fight for accountability are punished for the actions, and I am proud to support National Whistleblower Appreciation Day to honor those who make the choice to speak up against wrongdoing within the federal government.” “Far too often, whistleblowers who shed light on misconduct or abuse face unjust retaliation from their employers,” said Sen. Peters. “These patriotic citizens play a critical role in keeping government agencies honest, efficient and accountable to taxpayers. Instead of being punished, targeted or ostracized for their actions, whistleblowers should be honored for their commitment to truth and transparency.” National Whistleblower Appreciation Day will fall on the 239th anniversary of the first whistleblower protection law, enacted on July 30, 1778. The Continental Congress adopted the original resolution, which stated that, “it is the duty of all persons in services of the United States … to give the earliest information to Congress or any other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any persons in the services of these states, which may come to their knowledge.” All members of the bipartisan Whistleblower Protection Caucus cosponsored the resolution. In addition to Senator Ernst, they include caucus chairman, Senator Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and caucus vice-chairman, Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), as well as Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) and Gary Peters (D-Mich.). Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also cosponsored the resolution. Full text of the resolution can be found here.
07.26.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Forestry, and Nutrition, today joined a bipartisan group of 36 senators in sending a letter urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to push the Chinese government to end its ban on the sale of American poultry products. The ban was instituted by China in 2015 due to the detection of a wild duck with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influence (HPAI) and continues to be enforced today, in contradiction of World Health Organization for Animal Health (OIE) standards. “Poultry is produced in almost every state. For communities and states that rely on a thriving and growing poultry industry, these agreements are essential to a strong and vibrant future,” said the Senators in a letter to U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue. The United States is the largest poultry producer in the world and the second biggest poultry meat exporter, with nearly 18 percent of its product shipped to foreign markets. Iowa ranks 9th in the production of turkey nationally, raising 11 million turkeys per year on 130 family farms. Additionally, Iowa leads the nation in the production of eggs. Joining Senator Ernst on the letter are Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Thad Cochran (R-MS), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Tom Carper (D-DE), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Al Franken (D-MN), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Kamala Harris (D-CA), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mike Lee (R-UT), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jerry Moran (R-KS), David Perdue (R-GA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tim Scott (R-SC), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Luther Strange (R-AL), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Roger Wicker (R-MS), and Todd Young (R-IN). “The poultry industry provides thousands of high quality jobs in our rural communities and the reopening of the Chinese market would provide a huge boost for these rural areas. We encourage you to remain focused on the next steps to officially reopen the Chinese market as soon as possible,” added the Senators. The full text of the letter follows. A copy of the letter is available here. The Honorable Sonny Perdue Secretary United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave., S.W. Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Perdue: We are encouraged by the Administration’s recent efforts to reopen the Chinese beef trade market, and are pleased you have made lifting the Chinese ban on U.S. poultry products one of your top priorities as Agriculture Secretary. In January 2015, China banned all poultry products from the United States due to the detection of a wild duck with Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). More than two years later, China continues to enforce this ban, which is inconsistent with World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) standards. As a result, U.S. poultry producers have been negatively affected by the loss of this burgeoning export market. The poultry industry provides thousands of high quality jobs in our rural communities and the reopening of the Chinese market would provide a huge boost for these rural areas. We encourage you to remain focused on the next steps to officially reopen the Chinese market as soon as possible. Expanding market access in growing regions in the Asia Pacific, especially China, is essential for our poultry producers and will result in the creation of new jobs and higher wages in rural communities. We are hopeful for a swift process and offer our strong support as you and your staff continue to work to reopen this critical export market for poultry produced in the United States. We understand and are encouraged that China has begun its animal health audit of the U.S. poultry industry. Once this audit is completed, we encourage USDA to remain diligent in seeking final Chinese approval for U.S. poultry’s first successful shipment as quickly as possible. Poultry products are often part of the Chinese New Year celebrations, and our farmers would very much like to be able to offer their products during that time. With the productivity of U.S. agriculture exceeding domestic demand, the U.S. food and agriculture industry—and the rural communities which depend on it—rely heavily on export markets to sustain prices and revenues. Poultry is produced in almost every state. For communities and states that rely on a thriving and growing poultry industry, these agreements are essential to a strong and vibrant future. We look forward to hearing from you regarding the status of this important negotiation.
07.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. –Sen. Joni Ernst, Sen. Chuck Grassley, and Sen. Al Franken today introduced bipartisan legislation to increase the amount of information students receive about federal student loans, including their potential ability to repay, before rather than after signing up for tens of thousands of dollars in debt to Uncle Sam. “Across the state of Iowa, many students look to going to college as a step toward a good education and career; however, what they don’t always see until after graduation is the mountain of debt they accrued from their federal student loans,” Ernst said. “The bipartisan Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act provides the much needed counseling for students prior to borrowing to ensure they have the most comprehensive information on student loans before making a financial commitment. With the federal government sharing roughly 90 percent of the student loan market, we must make sure students have access to the right tools and resources to succeed.” “A college education generally remains a good investment,” Grassley said. “But when students’ academic dreams become a nightmare upon graduation because they borrowed more from the federal government than they can afford to repay with the degree they earned, they understandably feel something is wrong. The federal government, as the lender, has a responsibility to at least ensure that students know what they’re getting themselves into before they get in over their heads. This legislation will do that.” “Student loan debt is a real front-burner issue for Minnesotans, who graduate college owing more than $30,000 on average,” said Franken. “All too often, that debt becomes too much to bear and loan borrowers end up underwater, and part of the problem is that students and their families often don't have a clear picture of how much their education is going to cost them. Our bipartisan bill would help make sure that students are fully in the know before taking on debt, giving them a better idea of their financial aid options, and what they actually need to borrow to get through school.” The Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act strengthens the current loan counseling requirements for institutions of higher education in the Higher Education Act by making the counseling an annual requirement before new loans are disbursed rather than just for first-time borrowers. The bill then adds several key components to the information institutions of higher education are required to share with students as part of loan counseling, including: An estimate of the student’s projected loan debt-to-income ratio upon graduation based on the starting wages for that student’s program of study and the estimated total student loan debt the student will likely take out to complete the program. A statement that the student should borrow the minimum amount necessary to cover expenses and that the student does not have to accept the full amount of loans offered. A warning that the higher the borrower’s debt-to-income ratio is, the more difficulty the borrower is likely to experience in repaying the loan. Options for reducing borrowing through scholarships, reduced expenses, work-study or other work opportunities. An explanation of the importance of graduating on time to avoid additional borrowing, what course load is necessary to graduate on time, and information on the impact of adding an additional year of study to total indebtedness. The bill requires that a student manually enter, either in writing or through electronic means, the exact dollar amount of federal direct loan funding that the student desires to borrow. This ensures that students make a conscious decision about how much they borrow rather than simply accepting the total amount of loans for which they are eligible. The Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act also would provide that students receive regular loan statements while they are in school just like they will when they graduate and start repaying. That way, students will be more aware of their level of indebtedness and will be encouraged to at least pay any interest that accrues. This will help students be more mindful of the debt they are taking out, encourage students to control their expenses, and discourage over-borrowing. Several Iowa programs helped to inspire and inform the Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act. The University of Northern Iowa, created a program with the theme “Live Like a Student.” The program includes workshops and courses designed to educate students on the importance of living within their means while they are in school so they need not live like a student later in life. As a result, the university has lowered average student debt 10.7 percent over the past seven years, to $22,993. Grand View University has created GV Complete, where students and families construct a comprehensive four-year financing plan to help ensure students graduate on time and make informed decisions about paying for their education. Under this plan, each student is paired with a completion coach who helps him or her plan for on-time graduation both financially and academically. Grand View has capped increases in tuition, room, and board at no more than 2.5 percent since the program's inception. The first two cohorts of Grand View University students enrolled in the program are projected to take out approximately $4,000 less in student loans over their four years at Grand View. Iowa Student Loan, the state-based nonprofit lender, also has a program called the Student Loan Game Plan, an online, interactive resource that calculates a student’s likely debt-to-income ratio. It walks students through how their borrowing will affect their lifestyle in the future and what actions they can take now to reduce their borrowing. As a result, since 2014, 17 percent of students who participated in the Student Loan Game Plan decreased the amount they had planned to borrow by an average of $3,138, saving students approximately $5 million in additional loan debt. The senators said they hope the Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act will be included in the re-authorization of the Higher Education Act, which governs federal higher education programs. The Higher Education Act is overdue for re-authorization. The current law will need to be extended or a new law will need to be enacted. In April, Grassley and Franken re-introduced two other bills to give students and their families better information about the costs of college. The Net Price Calculator Improvement Act would improve the effectiveness of and access to net price calculators, the tools that provide students with early, individualized estimates of higher education costs and financial aid figures before they decide where to apply. The Understanding the True Cost of College Act would create a universal financial aid award letter so that students easily could compare financial aid packages between schools. The text of the Know Before You Owe Federal Student Loan Act of 2017 is available here.
07.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hearing on the upcoming 2018 Farm Bill, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced Mr. Bruce Rohwer of Paullina, Iowa to the committee and questioned agricultural community leaders. Mr. Rohwer is a corn and soybean farmer, small business owner, and a Board Member of the National Corn Growers Association. He provided testimony on the committee’s first panel of farmer witnesses. Click here or on the image below to watch her introduction. The committee also heard from Mr. Ron Rutledge of West Des Moines, Iowa, who is the President and Chief Operating Officer of Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa. During questioning, Senator Ernst continued to push for increased trade opportunities and to maintain our leadership role in agriculture. Additionally, the Iowa Senator asked the witnesses for their opinion on how the federal government can better support the agricultural community and how to prepare future generations of farmers for the responsibility of feeding and fueling the world. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questions. Senator Ernst also raised questions over the impact of increased use of land retirement programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), rather than targeted conservation. The Senator pointed to unemployment and stagnant population growth in rural areas in connection with the availability of farmland, noting that “many of the counties in Iowa with the highest poverty rates are also the counties with the most land enrolled in CRP.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s final set of questions.
07.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement to begin debate on repealing and replacing ObamaCare: “Today we took a significant step forward and voted to allow the full Senate to begin debate over repealing and replacing ObamaCare. “For years, I have heard from Iowans who are struggling under the weight of ObamaCare and are looking for affordable, and patient-centered health care solutions. The reality in our state is that continuing the status quo isn’t an option because ObamaCare is unsustainable. Therefore, I will not stand by and do nothing while Iowans in the individual market have seen their choices vanish and will likely see a massive rate increase – all under the weight of ObamaCare. “This is the long-overdue opportunity we’ve been waiting for to roll back this disastrous law and replace it with affordable, patient-centered solutions for Iowans. As we move forward in the time ahead, I will closely examine the amendments to see how they will affect Iowans’ insurance availability and affordability in 2018 and beyond.” NOTE: According to the United States Senate, the motion to proceed to consider is “a motion, usually offered by the majority leader to bring a bill or other measure up for consideration.”
07.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – As support continues to grow for the bipartisan Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act (S. 926), U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today submitted written testimony to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks ahead of its hearing to consider this critical legislation. The bipartisan legislation, which she introduced with Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) in April, authorizes the Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation, a private foundation, to begin the process of pursuing the construction of a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The memorial will honor our men and women in uniform, the fallen servicemembers, their families, and all those who have been impacted by our nation’s longest war. In her written testimony, Senator Ernst detailed that as a veteran of the Global War on Terror, she witnessed firsthand the service of the brave men and women who served in this ongoing war: “I saw young men and women leaving their regular lives behind to ensure we at home were able to sleep safely at night. Now, many of those men and women are old enough to have their own children deployed in the name of this war. They, too, fight to defend us from an enemy that is ever present and threatens our security here at home.” Ernst continued, pointing out that, “The longer we wait, the greater the chance that our first veterans of the Global War on Terror will not be witnesses to a National Memorial dedicated to their service and sacrifice.” The hearing in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks follows a May 25th letter from Senators Ernst and Manchin requesting Chairman Murkowski hold this hearing to examine the legislation. Since its introduction in the Senate on April 25th, 2017, the legislation has garnered strong bipartisan support from twenty U.S. Senators. There are over 140 cosponsors of the companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. Additionally, the Acting Deputy Director of the National Park Service, Department of Interior Robert Vogel is the witness for the hearing. He has submitted written testimony in support of the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act. Below is the full text of the testimony submitted by Senator Ernst, which can also be found by clicking here. July 19, 2017 The Honorable Lisa Murkowski The Honorable Maria Cantwell Chairman Ranking Member Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Committee on Energy and Natural Resources 304 Dirksen Senate Office Building 304 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Murkowski and Ranking Member Cantwell: On April 25, 2017, I introduced S. 926, the Global War on Terrorism War Memorial Act along with Senator Manchin. This bill would authorize the Global War on Terror Memorial Foundation to establish the National Global War on Terrorism Memorial as a commemorative work in the District of Columbia. In just a short while, this bill has garnered strong bipartisan support from twenty of our colleagues here in the Senate, many of whom are members of this committee. It’s also worth noting that the companion bill has over 140 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. This legislation sends a signal to those who have served and those who continue to serve in the Global War on Terror. As a veteran of the Global War on Terror, I saw firsthand these brave men and women defending our nation. I saw young men and women leaving their regular lives behind to ensure we at home were able to sleep safely at night. Now, many of those men and women are old enough to have their own children deployed in the name of this war. They, too, fight to defend us from an enemy that is ever present and threatens our security here at home. What makes this commemorative work different from others that have come before this committee is the fact that the War on Terror is still ongoing. I am well aware that the Commemorative Works Act (CWA) requires that at least ten years elapse from the end of a war or conflict until such event can be commemorated. However, I’m also keenly aware that if we were to wait that long, a 40-year-old servicemember who deployed in 2001 would be approaching sixty-five years of age. The longer we wait, the greater the chance that our first veterans of the Global War on Terror will not be witnesses to a National Memorial dedicated to their service and sacrifice. It is my hope that the discussion today will revolve around why it is necessary and appropriate for a time-period exemption from the CWA be granted, so all those who have served in our nation’s longest war, and their families, be given the opportunity to heal, honor, and remember. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst
07.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The office of U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is seeking Iowa college students and recent graduates for internship opportunities in the Washington, D.C. and Iowa offices for fall 2017. Internship applications are available here. “Whether in Washington, D.C. or one of our state offices, a congressional internship provides the next generation of leaders with insight into the issues most important to Iowans and gives them the opportunity to learn more about policy, constituent services, communications and more,” said Senator Ernst. “I encourage any Iowa college students and recent graduates that are interested to apply.” Interns will have the opportunity to experience a wide-range of responsibilities. In the Iowa offices, interns will assist constituents and attend local events. In the Washington, D.C. office, interns will learn about communications, the legislative process, give tours of the U.S. Capitol and help with constituent services. Applications for fall 2017 can be submitted to Ernst_Internships@ernst.senate.gov. For student/parent questions, please contact Erica Wenig at Erica_Wenig@ernst.senate.gov.

In Washington, Senator Ernst serves on four Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Environment and Public Works; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
07.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, questioned industry leaders on how best to promote the United States’ agricultural bounty abroad in the upcoming 2018 Farm Bill, and highlighted the importance of international trade agreements to benefit not only the agricultural economy, but our national security. Specifically, the Iowa Senator requested input on the recent trade agreement between the European Union (EU) and Japan. As the largest market for U.S. exports of beef, pork, and potatoes, and in light of the EU-Japan agreement, Senator Ernst and the witnesses agreed on the importance of the U.S. negotiating its own bilateral trade agreement with Japan to lower burdensome tariffs and protect that relationship for the agricultural community. Despite the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), Senator Ernst also reaffirmed her support for it and the critical role it would play for not only our agricultural producers, but in our national security interests and partnerships abroad: “I firmly believed in TPP as far as our agricultural commodity products, and getting those into those countries we believe could be very good trade partners for us… Not only do I see this as a good trade opportunity with those nations, but I also see it as a national security issue, because if we are not participating in trade with these nations, there is certainly another country in that region that will step in, and that country is China… I believe that good trade partners make good friends.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questioning.
07.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), David Perdue (R-GA), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Luther Strange (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) comment on Majority Leader McConnell’s decision to cancel the first two weeks of the Senate’s scheduled August state work period: “We are glad leadership took our concerns into consideration. It is time to get results for the American people.” On June 30, the Senators sent a letter to Leader McConnell outlining their request to work through the August recess period. They will continue working to make progress on fixing health care, funding the government, dealing with the debt ceiling, passing a budget resolution, and improving our tax code.
07.07.2017	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst today invited Iowa lawyers who would like to be recommended for a judicial appointment by President Donald Trump to serve as a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa to submit applications by August 11. The senators intend to make recommendations to fill the federal judgeship that will be left vacant when Judge Linda R. Reade, of Cedar Rapids, takes senior status. Reade was recommended in 2002 by Grassley to President George W. Bush for the seat previously held by Judge Michael Melloy. Reade served as Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Iowa from 2007 until earlier this year. Nationwide, there are 94 district courts in the federal court system. In Iowa, there are two districts housing a total of five district court judges. Federal judges are nominated by the President, confirmed “with the advice and consent” of the U.S. Senate, and serve lifetime appointments. Applicants or the Northern District Court judgeship in Iowa should submit a resume, three letters of recommendation, references, and a completed Senate Judiciary Committee questionnaire to Fred_Schuster@grassley.senate.gov. Schuster will provide the questionnaire upon request by email or at 319-363-6832.
07.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVOs) for 2018 at 15 billion gallons of conventional ethanol, meeting the levels Congress prescribed in 2007, along with setting the 2019 RVOs for biodiesel at 2.1 billion gallons: “The RFS is critical to supporting our agricultural and rural economy, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and providing consumers with choices at the pump,” said Senator Ernst. “While I am pleased the new administration has set the proposed volume requirements for conventional ethanol for 2018 at congressionally approved levels, I am disappointed that the 2019 biodiesel number was held constant, and would like to see it more accurately reflect current domestic usage and production capacity. “Iowa leads the nation in the production of ethanol and biodiesel, and maintaining a strong RFS aligned with congressional intent is important to our state and country. The RFS has proven to be a major driver of alternative fuels and economic development, and I will continue to protect and promote it in the Senate.” Senator Ernst recently raised the importance of the RFS to President Trump and United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Perdue. Additionally, the Iowa Senator, a vocal supporter of biofuels, has repeatedly emphasized the important role of the RFS in a column earlier this year and with EPA Administrator Pruitt in his pre-confirmation meeting, confirmation hearing, and in multiple letters.
07.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) will hold a town meeting in Shelby County as part of her 99 county tour to hear from constituents about the issues most important to them. This town meeting is open to the public. Monday, July 10th, 2017 Shelby County Town Meeting 8:00 AM CT Harlan Community High School Auditorium 2102 Durant Street Harlan, IA NOTE: If you are a credentialed member of the media and plan to attend the event, please RSVP to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov by 5:00 PM on July 9th. At the end of the event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with the media.
06.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined U.S. Senators David Perdue (R-GA), Steve Daines (R-MT), John Kennedy (R-LA), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Luther Strange (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), and Thom Tillis (R-NC), in asking Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to cancel the Senate’s scheduled August state work period if meaningful progress has not been made on the following five priorities: fixing health care, funding the government, dealing with the debt ceiling, passing a budget resolution, and improving our tax code. The senators outlined their request in a letter sent to Leader McConnell on Friday, June 30, 2017, which included a countdown of the remaining scheduled work days until the end of the fiscal year, September 30. “Our current Senate calendar shows only 33 potential working days remaining before the end of the fiscal year,” said the senators in the letter. “This does not appear to give us enough time to adequately address the issues that demand immediate attention. Therefore, we respectfully request that you consider truncating, if not completely foregoing, the scheduled August state work period, allowing us more time to complete our work.” “Delivering meaningful results was never assumed to be easy, but the millions of Americans who placed their confidence in our leadership expect our full and best effort,” concluded the senators. View the full text of the letter here and below. Dear Leader McConnell: We are united in our belief that we must work with a sense of urgency to deliver conservative solutions for pressing legislative issues on behalf of the American people. Our current Senate calendar shows only 33 potential working days remaining before the end of the fiscal year. This does not appear to give us enough time to adequately address the issues that demand immediate attention. Therefore, we respectfully request that you consider truncating, if not completely foregoing, the scheduled August state work period, allowing us more time to complete our work. There are five imperatives which must be accomplished this year. We must complete the first phase of Obamacare repeal and replace. Next, we have to pass a budget that serves as a reconciliation vehicle for reforming our outdated tax code. Before September 30th, we must agree on an appropriation that responsibly funds the government. Also, we must deal with our debt limit before that approximate date. If we successfully navigate those priorities, we can finally get to our once in a generation opportunity on tax reform. Growing the economy, repairing our infrastructure, and rebuilding our military are all dependent on accomplishing the tasks before us. Each of these issues is challenging in its own right. For example, the passage of a budget and all twelve appropriations bills before September 30th is a rarity, occurring only 4 times in the last 43 years. However, the stakes are much higher this year. We simply cannot afford to lose any additional time in resolving these issues when tax reform is hanging in the balance. Robust change to our tax code is our single most important economic growth tool, and there is already growing anticipation for us to act. Failure to deliver could have devastating economic consequences. We appreciate your leadership, both in advancing our agenda and by moving a package of bills this year to roll back regulations. This effort has already helped deliver much needed relief and advance economic growth. Further, we have been encouraged by your work to date to help us stay on track. However, there is much to be done. Please be assured that our request is fully backed by our commitment to thoughtfully and diligently work through these issues. We simply recognize that making America great again requires a certain time commitment. Delivering meaningful results was never assumed to be easy, but the millions of Americans who placed their confidence in our leadership expect our full and best effort. Sincerely,
06.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, announced the Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) includes 35 of Senator Ernst’s amendments, as well as multiple other measures to strengthen our nation’s security and support those who defend our nation. The Senate Armed Services Committee passed the NDAA with Senator Ernst’s support, and the bill will now go to the full Senate for further consideration. Following the markup, Senator Ernst released the following statement: “The NDAA builds upon my efforts in recent years to bolster our national security, and I am pleased that several of my bipartisan bills are included. The legislation makes the needs of our servicemembers a top priority, starting with key parts of my bipartisan bill to rectify compensation discrepancies among senior enlisted servicemembers and reduce the president’s authority to deny troops their mandated pay raise each year. The NDAA also includes important provisions for Iowa and Iowa Guardsmen. My provisions in the NDAA extend a critical program providing members of the National Guard and Reserves, as well as their families and communities, with training in suicide prevention; and another requires the Department of Defense to track cyber and domestic response capabilities important to national security. It also includes my provision to increase workload at the Rock Island Arsenal, and to extend the authority for the Arsenal to lease excess space. “Additionally, working to address various aspects of sexual violence and retaliation against survivors in the military is another priority of mine. The FY 2018 NDAA incorporated my bipartisan bills that thwart military sexual assault by mandating in-person, comprehensive sexual assault prevention training for newly enlisted servicemembers; hold our military accountable for disgusting online activity; and create a career track for the JAG corps in order to improve expertise within the military justice system. I remain committed to working to change the culture surrounding sexual assault and retaliation in the military, so that we may prevent such heinous crimes from happening. “As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I also worked to ensure this NDAA shapes policy to counter rising threats. To address the growing threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia, one of my provisions directs U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Special Operations Command – Pacific to develop a strategy with our allies in the region. To counter the increasing threat of Russia, my provisions increase funding and extend the authority for the U.S. to provide lethal and non-lethal aid to Ukraine, and ensure no action the U.S. takes could be seen as legitimizing Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. Lastly, In order to ensure Russia’s next target is not Iowa’s sister state, Kosovo, I also provide support for Kosovo as they make the gradual transition from a security force to a regular military. “My legislation in the NDAA, in cooperation with the important work put forth by my colleagues in the Senate Armed Services Committee, is designed to enhance the performance of our men and women in uniform so that they are prepared to defend our nation and face the ever-evolving threats of tomorrow. I look forward to continuing this discussion with my colleagues in the Senate as we work to move this important package forward.” Summary of Ernst Bills Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: S. 307 - Department of Defense Emergency Response Capabilities Database Enhancement Act of 2017 S.1243 - Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act S.1316 - Suicide Prevention And Resilience Program For The National Guard And Reserves S.1349 - Leadership Recognition Act S.1408 - Enhancement of Effective Prosecution and Defense in Courts-Martial S.1296 - PRIVATE Act Summary of Additional Ernst Provisions Included in FY ‘18 NDAA: A provision authorizing the Secretary of the Army to award the Personnel Protection Equipment award of the Army to former members of the Army. The Personal Protective Equipment award is given to servicemembers whose lives were saved by their equipment, such as helmets or body armor. A provision that clarifies and revises the definition of a commercial item, to address concerns from small businesses who seek to sell items to both the Department of Defense and everyday Iowan’s. A provision increasing the procurement of commercial off the shelf personal protective equipment, like body armor. Iowa is home to many companies that build military equipment, and even some who make the strongest body armor in the world. A provision restricting the Department of Defense from the use of reverse auctions and lowest price technically acceptable contracting methods when procuring critical safety items, like parachutes. This ensures the best parachutes are purchased for our servicemembers, not just the most cost-effective. A congressional charter for Spirit of America to allow increased partnership with the Department of Defense as they seek to support U.S. missions abroad. Modernizes authority to help the country of Colombia to ensure the country is able to counter armed groups and terrorist organizations. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for the U.S. to address the rise of groups, like ISIS, in Latin America. Strengthens and supports the National Guard counterdrug program, like the Midwest Counterdrug Training Center found in Iowa. A provision reviewing the Department of Defense’s effort to combat the funding of terrorism through the illicit trafficking in commodities, to include tobacco. A provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to partner forces to support U.S. special operations to combat irregular warfare threats. A provision extending the authority for and increasing the funding of lethal and non-lethal support to Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. A provision extending the ban on military cooperation with the Russia. A provision prohibiting any funding for activity that would recognize the sovereignty of the Russian Federation over Crimea. A provision extending U.S. anti-tunnel cooperation activities with Israel. A provision directing U.S. Pacific Command and U.S. Special Operations Command – Pacific to develop a strategy to combat the growing threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia. Senator Ernst has been a leader in calling for a strategy to address growing terrorism in Southeast Asia. A provision supporting the U.S assistance to the Kosovo Security Force as its makes its transition to a multi-ethnic army for the Republic of Kosovo. A provision that would require the Secretary of the Navy to provide quarterly updates on the progress of the Navy’s Physiological Episode Team and their efforts to combat physiological episodes in jets. Physiological episode create an unsafe, and potentially lethal, flying environment. Encourage the Department of Defense to expand its efforts beyond lightweight polymer ammunition casing into polymer magazine pallets, rounds, and other related equipment. A provision that allows the U.S. Marine Corps to award M-1 rifles as trophies for marksmanship competitions. A provision recognizing computer-based human simulation testing Human Simulation Report Language, like that found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. Human simulation research lowers costs to enhance warfighter mobility, survivability, welfare and training. A provision recognizing military paint training facilities that perform painting and coating operations for the Department of Defense, a key program also found at some of Iowa’s leading universities. These training programs save the Department time and funding resources. A provision acknowledging injuries sustained by helicopter crewmembers due to the type of restraints in use. It encourages the Army to use the Mobile Aircrew Restraint System currently in use by the Air Force to reduce the number of injuries to crewmembers. A provision providing a technical change to last year’s provision for companies like Uber and Lyft to have access to bases. A provision that supports Department of Defense to start ride-share pilots on base to cut down on DUIs.

A provision recognizing the risk of Foot and Mouth Disease, or other foreign animal disease, to our food production economy and our national security. It directs the Department of Defense and Department of Agriculture to analyze our ability to response to such an attack. A provision requiring a report on the adoption of project, program, and portfolio management standards within Department of Defense. A provision that recognizes our adversaries’ use of low-cost Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and the United States’ need to expand its capability to protect against UAS threats. A provision requiring a report on the Department of Defense’s implementation of direct hiring authorities for military spouses. A provision requiring the Secretary of the Army to transfer excess and unused equipment from the Defense Distribution Depot to Rock Island Arsenal to be used to build new warfighting equipment.
06.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and combat veteran, today introduced the Health Equity and Access for Returning Troops and Servicemembers (HEARTS) Act. The HEARTS Act works to give medically retired servicemembers more flexibility when choosing their health insurance plans, and rectifies an unintended burden currently plaguing wounded servicemembers who return to work after recovering from their injuries. Medically retired servicemembers are eligible to enroll in TRICARE upon returning home. If the servicemember has sustained injuries that prevent them from returning to work, they then are able to receive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). After two years, those servicemembers receiving SSDI payments become eligible for Medicare. Once a veteran is Medicare eligible, they are no longer eligible for traditional TRICARE. In order to keep the TRICARE supplement, TRICARE for Life, veterans must enroll in Medicare Part B. Under current law, if a veteran is able to return to work, SSDI payments cease, but the veteran remains Medicare eligible for a minimum of 8.5 years. Since these veterans are still Medicare eligible, they are unable to return to their traditional, more affordable, TRICARE plan and forced to pay the higher rates associated with Medicare. The HEARTS Act rectifies this financial burden by allowing veterans returning to work to opt-out of Medicare Part B and return to their TRICARE plan of choice when SSDI payments cease. Additionally, it allows these wounded servicemembers to maintain access to TRICARE for Life even if they opt-out of Medicare Part B. “Our veterans deserve every opportunity for a smooth transition back into civilian life,” Senator Ernst said. “The HEARTS Act gives medically retired servicemembers returning to work access to the health care benefits they were originally entitled to, and have rightfully earned, after selflessly serving our country.” The HEARTS Act was also introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Representative Sam Johnson (R-TX) and is cosponsored by the Chairman Phil Roe (R-TN) and Ranking Member Tim Walz (D-MN) of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.

06.28.2017	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today joined 16 of her colleagues in the Senate in urging U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to strengthen agricultural trade as the administration prepares to begin negotiations to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). “As Senators representing states with significant agricultural exports, we appreciate the careful approach the administration is taking to strengthen the NAFTA agreement, while ensuring that no changes are made that could result in harm to U.S. agriculture,” the senators wrote. “We look forward to working with you throughout the congressional consultation process to ensure that NAFTA continues its substantial economic contributions to U.S. farmers and ranchers and to the growth of our agricultural economy.” Last month, the Trump administration notified Congress of its intent to open negotiations with Canada and Mexico with respect to NAFTA. The notification triggers a 90-day consultation period under the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (TPA), and the administration is required to provide specific negotiating objectives at least 30 days before any negotiations begin. Since NAFTA was signed into law in 1993, Canada and Mexico have been two of the top five destinations for U.S. agriculture products. Last year, the two countries accounted for 28 percent of the value of total agriculture exports from the United States. Since NAFTA’s enactment, livestock and meat exports to Canada have doubled and agriculture commodity exports to Mexico have increased significantly. Mexico accounts for almost half of Iowa’s corn exports, generating over $400 million annually, and in 2015, Iowa exported $844 million worth of agricultural products to Canada. In addition to Senator Ernst, the letter is signed by Sens. John Thune (R-S.D.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). Full text of the letter can be found below: The Honorable Robert Lighthizer U.S. Trade Representative Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 600 17th Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20508 Dear Ambassador Lighthizer: As you prepare to begin negotiations to update the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), we write to emphasize the economic significance of agricultural trade between the United States, Canada, and Mexico and the critical role that NAFTA plays in the trade relationships. NAFTA has been an important trade agreement for the United States for more than 20 years. While we strongly support continued participation in the agreement, we also support the administration’s effort to review and strengthen NAFTA. Given the significance of agricultural products in U.S. exports, we request that you avoid any revisions to NAFTA and other previously negotiated trade agreements that would diminish the opportunities for U.S. farmers and ranchers to export their products, particularly given the current depressed state of the agriculture economy. Since NAFTA was signed into law in 1993, Canada and Mexico have been two of the top five destinations for U.S. agriculture products. Last year, the two countries accounted for 28 percent of the value of total agriculture exports from the United States. Since NAFTA’s enactment, livestock and meat exports to Canada have doubled and agriculture commodity exports to Mexico increased significantly. The longstanding trade agreement between the three countries has proven to be an important success within the agriculture industry. As Senators representing states with significant agricultural exports, we appreciate the careful approach the administration is taking to strengthen the NAFTA agreement, while ensuring that no changes are made that could result in harm to U.S. agriculture. We look forward to working with you throughout the congressional consultation process to ensure that NAFTA continues its substantial economic contributions to U.S. farmers and ranchers and to the growth of our agricultural economy. Sincerely,
06.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Department of the Army, and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule today to repeal the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule: “I am pleased that the Trump administration is taking another important step toward eliminating this burdensome WOTUS rule,” said Senator Ernst. “In Iowa, 97 percent of the land is subject to extensive overregulation by the EPA and unnecessarily hamstrings our farmers, businesses and manufacturers. All across Iowa, folks are calling for this rule to be scrapped, which is why I have led efforts in the Senate to do just that. “This is good news for Iowa and rural communities across the country as we move closer to finally eliminating this overreaching rule.” Senator Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Continued to highlight major flaws with expanded WOTUS Rule in Environment and Public Works Committee hearings. Applauded WOTUS rule executive order. Raised her concerns with then-nominee to be Administrator of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, at his confirmation hearing, as well as his pre-confirmation meeting. Introduced a resolution that expresses the need to vacate the Obama administration’s WOTUS rule. Praised the bipartisan passage in both chambers of her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. The Obama administration vetoed this legislation and Senator Ernst vowed to continue looking for ways to roll back the WOTUS rule. Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule. Spoke on the floor of the Senate to urge support for her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Introduced and led a joint resolution to scrap WOTUS. Cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and direction for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders.
06.23.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Marco Rubio (R-FL), members of the Senate Opportunity Coalition, announced they will introduce the Economic Mobility, Prosperity, and Opportunities with Waivers that Enable Reforms for States (EMPOWERS) Act, to give states the flexibility to modernize programs to help families and individuals find long-term success. Despite over 80 programs and billions of taxpayer dollars spent, all too often, the federal government fails to address the barriers to self-sufficiency faced by those living in poverty. The EMPOWERS Act would create pathways to opportunity by giving states the flexibility to pursue pilot projects that better address the challenges faced by low-income families and individuals. “I’ve heard from Iowans struggling to make ends meet that due to current federal programs in place, taking one step forward often means taking two steps back,” said Senator Ernst. “Worse yet, these programs sometimes punish self-sufficiency through stiff phase out rates, or ‘cliff effects’ which inadvertently penalize individuals when they gain employment or are awarded a raise. The EMPOWERS Act encourages states to develop solutions that utilize federal resources to remove barriers to self-sufficiency and help families and individuals find long-term success.” “The EMPOWERS Act recognizes what Americans already know: Washington doesn’t have all the answers. More than 50 years after President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty, it’s clear our social safety net programs are in desperate need of innovation and modernization,” said Senator Rubio. “I’m proud to join my friend Senator Ernst in introducing this bill, which will empower states to develop new ways to help the most vulnerable Americans and reduce poverty.” Additionally, the EMPOWERS Act has received support from Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds: "The EMPOWERS Act takes a bold step in granting states flexibility to partner with those looking for long-term success,” said Governor Reynolds. “The act offers a chance for states to create pathways of new opportunity for families and individuals and breaks down some of the barriers currently preventing many from leading more stable and fulfilling lives. I want to thank Sen. Ernst for placing confidence in states to carry out this important work. Iowa is excited and able to readily accept this challenge." About the EMPOWERS Act: This allows states to apply for four-year temporary waivers to integrate and reform two or more covered federal programs that assist folks in need. Requires states to submit a proposal for a cost-neutral demonstration project designed to reduce poverty and promote employment, savings, financial literacy, family stability, and self-sufficiency for participants in order to receive a temporary waiver. States which obtain waivers would receive the same level of funding that folks in their state would otherwise receive for the covered programs, and they would be required to reinvest any savings on helping low-income families and individuals. Requires states to contract with an independent, third party evaluator, tasked with rigorously testing the project. Establishes the Interagency Board for Empowering Low-Income Families to oversee the waiver process, and ensure projects do not have benefit cliffs or steep phase-out rates that can result in a net loss of a low-income household’s resources once wages or hours are increased at work.

06.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following response on the health care reform legislation: “The draft was just released, so I am carefully looking through it. However, the reality in Iowa is that continuing the status quo simply isn’t an option because ObamaCare is unsustainable. Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Aetna have both pulled out of the Iowa individual market altogether, leaving only one statewide carrier. “While I'm pleased that Medica has decided to stay for another year, Iowans in the individual market will likely see a massive rate increase, all because of ObamaCare. This is unacceptable. “Traveling across Iowa on my 99 county tour, I hear from Iowans who are looking for affordable, and patient-centered health care solutions; their feedback is critical. I will be closely examining the bill to see how it will affect insurance availability and affordability in 2018 and beyond.”
06.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today put forward legislation to create a career track for the Judge Advocate General (JAG) Corps in order to improve expertise within the military justice system. Our servicemen and women deserve to have the most experienced litigators possible in the courtroom during legal proceedings. However, defense counsels and prosecutors in the military justice system may have to litigate a case with little experience in the courtroom, potentially limiting their effectiveness. This bipartisan legislation seeks to improve the quality of litigation expertise by requiring each branch of our military to implement a career litigation track that allows a portion of its attorneys to specialize in the foundation of U.S. military law and the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), for the bulk of their careers — an approach the Navy successfully adopted in 2007. Senator Ernst and Senator Gillibrand also implemented a review of this program in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. “The lack of specialized JAG litigators that currently exists in many branches of our military is an injustice to our servicemembers who may be hindered from receiving the best trial possible,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “Improving our military justice system will ensure victims of sexual assault and other crimes receive legal advice from well-qualified, experienced JAG’s in the military justice system. Our servicemembers – both victims and defendants – deserve the best.” “Our service members and the public at large deserve a military justice system that upholds our Constitution, provides due process for the accused, and protects the rights of survivors,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the Ranking Member on the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee. “Because JAGs transfer so frequently, most do not gain the necessary experience to try cases, defend the accused, or represent a survivor adequately. Moreover, JAGs are encouraged to have a broad range of experience, which means that a JAG who has very little experience trying cases may be assigned to a complex sexual assault case. Our service members deserve better. Our bill will change that and model the military justice system after the civilian system where lawyers become experts in their fields.” About the JAG Corps Career Litigation Track Legislation: Increases prosecutorial experience, ensuring victims, including sexual assault survivors, work with seasoned prosecutors. Develops seasoned defense counsel. Empowers new JAG officers by providing an experienced co-counsel in the courtroom. Creates a talent pipeline of experienced litigators. Provides protection for skilled litigators who otherwise may have been forced out of military justice practice or military service due to lack of jobs for military justice practitioners at higher ranks or a preference for generalists.

06.22.2017	WASHINGTON- U.S. Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Jack Reed (D-RI) today introduced the Teachers Are Leaders Act, which would create partnerships between colleges and high-need schools to develop and support innovative teacher leader roles. Teachers are one of the most important factors in student achievement. Unfortunately, high teacher attrition rates, which have neared 8 percent in recent years, mean that quality teachers are leaving the classroom every year. Teacher attrition rates are highest in our lowest-performing schools, where students have the greatest need for high-quality teachers. Read the bill text here. Read a one-pager on the bill here. The top reasons for teachers leaving the classroom often include a lack of administrative support, professional learning opportunities, and decision-making input. Teachers desire and deserve a variety of career advancement opportunities to lead in their school without having to leave the classroom. Recognizing this, innovative districts and states such as Delaware and Iowa have created “teacher leader” roles, wherein classroom teachers take on additional responsibilities to address unique school needs. To support these efforts, this bill would support locally-designed teacher leader development programs that would create teacher leader roles that directly address demonstrated school needs, which could range from peer coaching to developing new dual enrollment courses. The bill would ensure that the continuum of teacher preparation and development extends beyond the first few years of teaching and would offer a practical way for higher education to address teacher recruitment and retention challenges. “Teachers invest so much of themselves in their students, so it’s critical that we invest in them to ensure they have all the resources they need to make sure every child can receive an excellent education. Teacher leadership is a promising investment that offers teachers new learning and leadership opportunities, which have been shown to improve teacher job satisfaction, and more importantly, to increase student achievement,” said Senator Coons. “Across our nation, educators play an important role in not only the development of our students, but in the community as a whole,” said Senator Ernst. “Unfortunately, for many rural school districts, such as those in Iowa, attracting and retaining teachers remains a challenge. Investing in our state’s teachers is investing in our future leaders. I am pleased to partner with my colleague Senator Coons on the bipartisan Teachers Are Leaders Act to allow for greater flexibility for states to assist our educators in growing and developing their skills.” “Iowa has a major teacher leadership initiative,” said Senator Grassley. “This legislation will support efforts in states like Iowa to provide career advancement opportunities for teachers and improve student achievement by having the most successful teachers coach others.” “Teacher leadership is too often an underutilized resource for improving our schools, advancing student achievement, and strengthening the teaching profession,” said Senator Reed. “I’m proud to help introduce this legislation to develop this vital resource and foster new opportunities for growth for both students and teachers across the nation.” “The nation’s expert teachers know that teacher leadership is critical for solving important challenges in education today, including teacher retention and recruitment. We salute Sens.

06.21.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today spoke on the Senate floor about the unsustainable and unaffordable health care system under ObamaCare. Click here or the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: Mr. President, No choice and a proposed 43 percent increase in premiums. That is what ObamaCare and its harmful impact will bring to Iowa in 2018. This year, it brought premium increases up to 42 percent. Last year, it brought increases up to 29 percent. ObamaCare is not sustainable and not affordable for Iowans. To anybody that has studied health care reform, this should come as no surprise. In the past, many states have tried to reform their individual market. Twenty-seven years ago, Kentucky made an attempt and implemented the Kentucky Health Care Reform Act of 1994. This bill was similar to ObamaCare in many respects – it contained more taxes, more regulations, and more mandates. Within three years, three years, insurers fled the individual market and the state was hit with skyrocketing premiums. What happened in Kentucky then is eerily similar to what is happening in Iowa today as a result of ObamaCare. When it comes to affordability and choice, my home state of Iowa has been hit particularly hard. While traveling across the state, I hear from Iowans who are looking for affordable coverage. Far too often, I hear that high monthly premiums are squeezing pocketbooks, and that soaring out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays make coverage unaffordable to use for those who do have it. That’s not what ObamaCare promised, but that is what it has brought. One Iowan who works at a small business in Hinton wrote me and said: “Over the past seven years prices have jumped considerably and the coverage employees are getting for the amount of money spent is substantially less! We have tried to help our employees by minimizing the changes in premiums, but these last two years we had to start passing on some of the increases in order to survive. We can no longer absorb the constant rate increases, nor can we not offer a health plan to our employees. Therefore we find ourselves between the proverbial rock and the hard place. We certainly are not the only small business facing the same dilemma.” Employees at this small business can breathe a small sigh of relief because their employer still has the ability to offer coverage - even if they are forced to pay more and more because of ObamaCare. Other Iowans are on the edge because their options for coverage are shrinking. In 2016, United Healthcare left the individual market in Iowa. A few months ago, Wellmark and Aetna both announced they would be leaving the individual market in 2018. Medica is the only remaining statewide carrier, and while they appear to be staying for next year, it will take a massive rate increase on Iowans for them to do so. The Iowa Insurance Commissioner said that: “Iowa has hit a point within our market's collapse that a 43 percent rate increase will drive healthier, younger, and middle aged individuals out of the market. Iowa's individual market remains unsustainable.” And if Medica leaves after next year, there is a very real possibility that tens of thousands of Iowans will have nothing to purchase on the individual market. To put this issue into perspective, and show why it matters so much, I want to share concerns I received from a constituent in Ames, Iowa. This constituent is the parent of a child with a rare disease. The family purchased a plan from Wellmark to cover the child for 2017, but now that Wellmark plans to leave, the parents are unsure whether they will be able to find a plan for their child. They find this whole experience “disruptive and anxiety provoking.” Disruption and anxiety are not just being felt in Iowa. All across the country, premiums are skyrocketing and choices are limited and in some places, non-existent. Recent data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows that 2.4 million people in twelve hundred counties across the country will have one, one option for insurance in 2018. That’s not an option at all. And a recent report by HHS found that between 2013 and 2017, premiums more than doubled on the exchange. More than doubled on the exchange. In some states, premiums tripled. Across the country and in my home state of Iowa, we don’t have the option to continue with the status quo when it comes to our health care. The reality folks is the status quo is truly unsustainable. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
06.15.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), today issued the following statement after the United States Senate voted to strengthen sanctions against Iran and Russia and authorize funding to support our allies combatting Russian interference in Europe: “I cannot overstate the importance of taking action to curb the continued aggression of Russia and Iran and hold them accountable for their actions. “The threat Russia poses through their support for the murderous Syrian regime, unconventional warfare efforts in Ukraine, and malicious cyber activity ceases to slow. Additionally, Iran continues its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and support for terrorism across the Middle East. “The United States must show strength and send a clear message to both Russia and Iran that such nefarious behavior will not be tolerated.”
06.14.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, continued to push for legislation she cosponsored that would remove unnecessary regulatory hurdles that keep E15, and higher blends of ethanol, from being sold year round across the country. Iowa leads the nation in the production of ethanol, and the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act would help to break down barriers that have impeded retailers and consumers from accessing E15 in the summer months. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s exchange with industry leaders. Senator Ernst has called for relief from burdensome regulation on ethanol retailers in Iowa, as well as maintaining the current point of obligation for the Renewable Fuel Standard.

06.14.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, introduced the bipartisan Leadership Recognition Act to ensure appropriate compensation for enlisted servicemembers. Except for seven senior enlisted positions, enlisted personnel do not receive a pay increase as their responsibility levels grow, creating great discrepancies. For example, the Senior Enlisted Adviser To The Chairman Of The Joint Chiefs Of Staff gets paid more than the Senior Enlisted Adviser to the Commander of Pacific Command, even though they both are the same rank with equivalent levels of responsibility. Additionally, each year troops are mandated to receive a pay raise that matches the Employment Cost Index, unless the president cites economic concerns or a national emergency. Unfortunately, previous presidents have cited economic concerns to deny troops their pay raise while simultaneously claiming a growing economy publicly; and the FY’18 budget request for a pay raise does not match the Employment Cost Index. The Leadership Recognition Act addresses these discrepancies by ensuring fair compensation among senior enlisted advisors and removes the president’s ability to block pay raises by citing economic concerns. “Senior enlisted servicemembers carry a great responsibility leading our men and women on and off the battlefield, and we must ensure they receive appropriate compensation as we seek to retain them and strengthen our military,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “Likewise, it is important that we are able to recruit servicemembers by giving troops a pay raise that matches the Employment Cost Index in the private sector. I am glad to partner with my colleague, Senator Warren, to ensure our troops are receiving the compensation they deserve for serving our great nation.” "Our men and women in uniform‎ serve this country with honor,” said Senator Warren. “They know they won't get rich in the military, but they serve with skill and dedication, and they are entitled to basic pay increases that will give them a chance to build some economic security. I'm glad to partner with my Armed Services colleague Senator Ernst to offer a bipartisan bill that recognizes the important work of our enlisted personnel." To read the full text of the bill, click here. Additionally, this legislation has received support from the American Legion, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and the Military Officers Association of America. About the Leadership Recognition Act: States that senior enlisted advisors to the commanders of the combatant commands shall receive equivalent monthly pay to the senior enlisted advisors to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Directs the Secretary of Defense to carry out a study on what other positions should receive an elevation in base pay that have an equivalent responsibility level to the seven enlisted personnel that must receive increased base pay due to their level of responsibility. Strikes the president’s ability to cite economic concerns when using his authority to deny troops their mandated pay raise in future years.
06.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services’ Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, questioned Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford Jr. on a strategy in Southeast Asia to combat ISIS, and how that strategy can best support our partners in the Asia-Pacific region to stop these bad actors. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s exchange with Secretary Mattis and General Dunford. Senator Ernst has repeatedly warned of the threat posed by ISIS in Asia and has stressed the importance of strengthening our global partnerships to defeat ISIS.
06.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after her meeting at the White House this afternoon on health care reform: “We had a productive meeting this afternoon, and discussions will continue to take place over health care reform. The reality in Iowa is that continuing the status quo simply isn’t an option because ObamaCare is unsustainable. “Wellmark Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Aetna have both pulled out of the Iowa individual market altogether, leaving only one statewide carrier. Additionally, news reports indicate that the sole carrier, Medica, is very concerned about its ability to continue to serve Iowans in the individual market. Should they leave too, 72,000 Iowans will be left without an option to purchase health insurance next year, all because of ObamaCare. That’s unacceptable. “While traveling across Iowa on my 99 county tour, I hear from Iowans who are looking for affordable, and patient-centered health care solutions; their feedback is critical. As with any reform, we must ensure that it is done thoughtfully and carefully, but also with close attention to how it will affect insurance availability in 2018 and beyond.”
06.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, today issued the following statement on the news of the end of the more than 13 year ban on U.S. beef exports to China: “This is a great day for cattle producers in Iowa and across the country. President Trump’s team, including USDA Secretary Perdue, Commerce Secretary Ross, U.S. Trade Representative Lighthizer and newly-confirmed Ambassador Branstad were all instrumental in getting this done. Having access to the world’s most populous nation is a huge win for our entire agricultural industry, as well as for the people of China who can now enjoy our high quality beef.”
06.08.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, and Jon Tester (D-MT), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, introduced bipartisan legislation to extend for one year a critical program that provides members of the National Guard and Reserves, as well as their families, with training in suicide prevention, resilience, community healing and response to suicide. The current program is set to expire October 1, 2018. “One life lost to suicide is too many; we must do whatever we can to help those who sacrificed so much for our freedoms and are suffering from invisible wounds,” said Senator Ernst. “The suicide prevention, outreach, and community response training program for our National Guard and Reserve members and their families plays a critical role in providing folks with the tools they need. In order to combat suicide among servicemembers and our veterans, we must keep education and prevention training a priority.” “National Guard and Reserve members serve an invaluable role in protecting Montana and our country,” said Senator Tester. “This bill does right by them to make sure we are treating the unseen wounds of war. By giving service members, veterans and their families the tools to recognize the risk of suicide, we can extend a lifeline to those in crisis when they need it most.” “National Guardsmen and Reservists have some unique challenges when it comes to accessing behavioral help,” said retired Brig. Gen. Roy Robinson, the President of the National Guard Association of the United States. “They don’t live in a base environment surrounded by support networks and readily available treatment like their active-component counterparts. This legislation helps bridge these gaps and we greatly appreciate the efforts of Senator Tester and Senator Ernst in extending this important program. The continuing high rate of suicide in the National Guard and Reserve must cannot be accepted as some sort of new normal. Clearly, this not acceptable." About the Extension of the Suicide Prevention and Resilience Program: Directs the Secretary of Defense to provide members of the National Guard and Reserves with training in suicide prevention.

06.07.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Dean Heller of Nevada, and Joni Ernst of Iowa, who worked together to address sexual violence on college campuses, are leading a bipartisan fix to military law to better guard against “revenge porn” following the Marines United scandal earlier this year, by making such conduct a standard offense across the services. “The vast majority of our troops conduct themselves with the highest standards of honor and integrity, but for the few bad apples, we’ve got to make sure the punishment fits the crime,” said McCaskill, a senior member of the Armed Services Committee. “And this kind of degradation and intimidation of servicemembers—whether online or in the barracks—is a serious crime that threatens the good order and discipline that makes our military the greatest in the world.” “If members of our military fall victim to someone sharing their private information without their consent, they should have the assurance that their privacy rights are protected regardless of where they are serving,” said Heller. “The PRIVATE Act is a commonsense bill that bolsters privacy protection measures for service members who often cross state lines during duty, and it’s a positive step toward better addressing sexual exploitation.” “Sexual assault, disgusting online activity, and illegal photo sharing are issues that plague society as a whole. However, certain servicemembers’ online activity that has surfaced in recent months utterly fails to meet the high standards of integrity and faithful service to which we hold those who wear our nation’s uniform,” said Ernst, a combat veteran. “Through this legislation our military can hold bad actors accountable, and take important steps forward toward changing the culture and making clear that sexual assault or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated - period.” Earlier this year, an investigative journalist and Marine veteran exposed a series of nude posts of female service members online in the Facebook group “Marines United” – in which Active Duty and Reserve service members posted degrading comments and shared nude photos of fellow service members online. In spite of this scandal, The Department of Defense’s Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military released last month showed a continuation of the trend demonstrated since an historic overhaul of the military justice system—a further drop in incidents of sexual violence, combined with an increased willingness of victims to come forward. The report shows a nearly 27 percent decrease in incidents of sexual assault and an increase in the number of victims coming forward to report crimes. The Pentagon’s report also estimated in 2016, 14,900 servicemembers experienced a sexual assault, down 27 percent from approximately 20,300 in 2014. The report also showed a 1.5 percent increase in incident reporting from 2015 to 2016, with 6,172 reports filed last year. The last Fiscal Year Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military, for 2014, which measured both reporting and incidents, showed that incidents of unwanted sexual contact dropped by 29 percent from 2012 to 2014. The total number of reports (restricted and unrestricted) went up 11 percent from 2013 to 2014, and up 70 percent from 2012.
06.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today applauded the announcement by U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, along with his Mexican counterpart Secretary of Economy Ildefonso Guajardo Villarreal, on the successful conclusion of negotiations on modified suspension agreements on sugar imports from Mexico. Senator Ernst, who had previously sent Secretary Ross a letter stressing the urgent need for a solution to the ongoing dispute, issued the following statement: “The outcome of these negotiations is important to Iowa, as we lead the nation in the production of corn, and are a large corn refiner with multiple processing facilities in our state. With this in mind, I’m pleased the Commerce Department was able to find a solution to this dispute. Identifying common ground and avoiding retaliatory measures is a step in the right direction, and sets the stage for the upcoming negotiations on other bilateral trade measures.” Click here to view the letter Senator Ernst sent to Secretary Ross last month.
06.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, today applauded Senate passage of the bipartisan Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This legislation, which Senator Ernst cosponsored, gives the VA Secretary the authority to fire senior executive VA employees who are not fulfilling their duties, and offers due process protections for whistleblowers. “This bipartisan legislation helps protect those who courageously step forward to identify any wrongdoing within the VA, and gives the VA Secretary the appropriate authority to dismiss those who do not have our veterans’ best interests in mind,” said Senator Ernst. “It is critical that we identify and improve issues within the VA so that we can ensure our veterans are being provided the quality and timely care they deserve.” About the VA Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act: Creates an Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection. Requires the VA to train supervisors on the rights of whistleblowers to prevent retaliation and submit a report to congress on morale, administrative action, and effectiveness of discipline on employees. Prohibits the VA secretary from dismissing employees who have filed a complaint with the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistleblowers from retaliation or undue termination Provides the secretary with the necessary authority to rebuke or fire any senior executive in a 21-day internal department grievance process, and remove, demote, or suspend for longer than 14 days without pay non-senior executive service employees Additionally, the Senate recently passed Senator Ernst’s Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act, which strengthens penalties for those who retaliate against whistleblowers, adds protections for probationary period employees, and ensures federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower protections.
06.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, applauded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary David Shulkin’s announcement to discontinue usage of VistA, the VA’s internal outdated electronic health record system, and begin integrating with the Department of Defense’s records system. Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “I have repeatedly expressed my great concern that the VA is wasting taxpayer dollars and creating duplicative, confusing programs for veterans,” said Senator Ernst. “I am pleased to hear that Secretary Shulkin will stop using this ineffective and outdated program for record keeping. The new system is designed to allow veteran’s health records to transfer seamlessly from the DoD’s system to the VA system after they leave the military. It is my hope that the VA will continue this trend, and apply the same common sense reforms to other duplicative and outdated programs in the VA, like those used for scheduling.” During her pre-confirmation meeting with Secretary Shulkin, Senator Ernst raised her displeasure with the current failures of the VA. On February 17th, 2017, the Iowa Senator wrote Secretary Shulkin requesting the rationale behind his decision to continue using a duplicative outdated scheduling platform, also under VistA. In their response, the VA agreed with Senator Ernst’s concerns, and stated they are only using VistA system ‘while the VA works on a more definitive solution’.
05.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, United States Senators and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced bipartisan legislation known as the Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act. This legislation would implement educational steps to thwart military sexual assault by mandating in-person, comprehensive sexual assault prevention training, and teaches proper use of social media for newly enlisted servicemembers in all branches of the U.S. military before they depart for basic training. “Sexual assault and disgusting online activity will continue to plague our nation and our military until we take concrete steps forward to address this horrific issue and change the culture within our society," said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. "This legislation gives the military an opportunity to lead by example, and it ensures they don’t create an ineffective computer-based teaching program to do it. The military can help prevent sexual assaults and horrific online activity from happening in the first place by sitting down and talking with servicemembers about what is right, and what is wrong. This is especially important for those just entering the service, and it is my hope that this reinforces that these acts will not be tolerated.” “We’ve seen from the Defense Department’s own sexual assault crime data and from the shameful scandal involving cyber misconduct that military sexual assault is still as pervasive as ever,” said Senator Gillibrand. “This bipartisan bill would help make sure that all new enlistees who are waiting to enter boot camp will be trained to identify and respond to sexual assault. This is an important step toward making sure our entire military has the education and training they need to fight back against sexual assault and harassment, including on social media, and I am proud to work with Senator Ernst to pass this bill.” About this legislation: The Educating Servicemembers in Training On Prevention (E-STOP) Act mandates the Department of Defense develop and implement sexual assault prevention training for servicemembers in the Delayed Entry Program, and that the training should be in person and cover the proper use of social media. The Delayed Entry Program is for servicemembers who have taken the oath of enlistment, but are waiting to depart for basic training. They may be in the program anywhere from a day to a year while waiting for their boot camp report date. As they wait, the servicemembers report in to the recruiting station often for training. This bipartisan legislation will ensure that men and women who chose the Delayed Entry Program before boot camp receive this extremely important training prior to their first day on active duty. It is not intended to delay any servicemember from departing for training. Why this legislation is necessary: While 2016 DoD annual report estimates that 14,900 U.S. servicemembers experienced a sexual assault, compared to 20,300 when the last comprehensive canvas was conducted in 2014, more must be done. Additionally, while about 1 in 3 servicemembers who experienced a sexual assault filed a report in 2016 (up from 1 in 14 a decade ago), 58 percent of those say they've experienced retaliation of some sort for coming forward. Support for the legislation: This bill has received support from the Iowa Coalition Against Sexual Assault, Protect Our Defenders, Futures Without Violence, National Alliance to End Sexual Violence and Service Women’s Action Network (SWAN).

05.25.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a combat veteran, issued the following statements after the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act was approved unanimously by the Senate Thursday: “The dedicated men and women who take a risk to expose wrongdoing and waste in the federal government deserve the respect and support of our nation,” Sen. Johnson said. “Unfortunately, too often these courageous individuals are subjected to retaliation in an attempt to silence them. This must stop, and I’m pleased the Senate acted today to support veterans and whistleblowers across the federal government by passing the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act.” “When there are acts of corruption and mismanagement at the VA, we must make sure whistleblowers are protected when they come forward about this mistreatment so that we can address it,” Sen. Ernst said. “It is so important that we make sure our veterans are receiving the quality and timely care they deserve. I’m grateful to work with Senator Johnson to move this legislation through the Senate and become one step closer to better protecting our whistleblowers and improving our VA system.” The bill is named for Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a whistleblower from the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tomah, Wis., who took his own life after being fired for questioning excessive prescription practices at the facility. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s brother, Sean, testified at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in September 2015 about the retaliation his brother faced after blowing the whistle about the wrongdoing at the Tomah facility. This bill implements a number of suggestions he made at the hearing to improve whistleblower protections at the VA and across the federal government. The legislation will strengthen penalties for those who retaliate against whistleblowers, add protections for probationary period employees, and ensure federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower protections.
05.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, and Joe Manchin (D-WV) sent a letter to Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources Chairman Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) requesting a hearing on their bipartisan legislation to authorize the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation.

05.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement congratulating newly sworn-in Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds: “The position of U.S. Ambassador to China is one of the most important ambassadorial positions in the world, and I am pleased to see Iowa’s longest serving governor and my friend, Terry Branstad, confirmed for this position,” said Ernst. “As evidenced by his confirmation hearing, Governor Branstad knows China and its leaders well and will not only work tirelessly to advance our trade and economic interests with China, but will also skillfully tackle our other complex bilateral issues. I am so grateful for his service to Iowa, and I wish him and his family the very best. “Additionally, Iowa will be in good hands under now Governor Reynolds, who has made history today as our first female governor. Her leadership on critical issues over the last seven years, and her work alongside Governor Branstad, has prepared her well for this new role. Under Governor Reynolds, Iowa's future remains bright. “Today is an extraordinary day for our state and our nation. It has been an honor to serve the people of Iowa alongside Terry Branstad and Kim Reynolds, and I look forward to continuing to work with both of these outstanding leaders in their new roles.”

The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Mr. President, “I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support Iowa Governor Terry Branstad’s nomination to be U.S. Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. “The position of U.S. Ambassador to China is one of the most important ambassadorial positions in the world, and I am confident that my friend and Governor – Terry Branstad – is the right person for the job. “Having worked alongside the Governor for many years, I know he will exemplify the same leadership, thoughtfulness, and dedication in his role as Ambassador to China on behalf of the United States as he did for the people of Iowa. “Importantly, Governor Branstad also knows China and its leaders well. He first met President Xi Jinping while he was visiting Iowa on an agricultural research trip in 1985. They have kept in touch over the years, and Governor Branstad has since visited China a number of times on behalf of the State of Iowa. “Iowa’s extensive trade relationship with China has given Governor Branstad a front-seat view of the complexities of our country’s broader trade and economic relationship with China and will provide him with the foundation to effectively advocate for U.S. interests. “As evidenced by his successful confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee – which approved his nomination by voice vote – Governor Branstad will not only work tirelessly to foster our trade and economic interests with China, but he is also prepared to tackle the many other complex bilateral issues we have with China – from North Korea to the South China Sea to human rights. “It has been an honor to serve the people of Iowa alongside Governor Branstad – the longest serving governor in United States history – and I am thrilled to continue to work with him in his new role serving the American people. “I thank Governor Branstad for his service to Iowa, and I wish him and his family the best as they prepare to depart for Beijing. “Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. ”

05.17.2017	WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), as well as U.S. Representatives Tom Reed (R-NY) and Linda Sánchez (D-CA), reintroduced the bipartisan, bicameral Credit For Caring Act, which would provide working family caregivers with a nonrefundable tax credit up to $3,000 to assist with out-of-pocket expenses related to caregiving. This bipartisan legislation seeks to aid those balancing full or part-time employment, while also taking on added financial responsibilities as a family caregiver supporting a loved one. This tax credit for caregivers can be used toward expenses such as transportation, home modifications to accommodate a family member, medication management services, and training or education for the caregiver. “Family caregivers play a critical role in supporting aging parents or special needs individuals,” said Ernst. “There are more than 40 million family caregivers across the country, and 317,000 in Iowa. I am grateful for the bipartisan support from my colleagues on this important legislation to better accommodate family caregivers’ selfless actions.” “Colorado’s family caregivers dedicate countless hours of unpaid care so their loved ones can continue to live independently,” said Bennet. “This bipartisan tax credit will help ease the burden of everyday expenses for family caregivers. As our population grows older, this is an additional step we can take to support families across the country.” “Having recently shared in the caregiving of my own parents, I understand the difficulties that caregivers face and the significant costs involved,” said Capito. “The Credit for Caring Act is exactly the type of solution we need to help ease the financial burden caregivers face, and I am proud to join my colleagues to support this important measure.” "More than 40 million Americans provide unpaid care to a friend or relative with a long-term illness or medical condition, often juggling this work with other obligations and spending a great deal of money providing this care," said Warren. "This modest tax credit will make life a little easier for the hardworking Americans who do the often-unacknowledged but powerfully important work of taking care of their loved ones in need." “We all care about ensuring our aging loved ones get the assistance they deserve,” said Reed. “We must work to find an equitable approach to ease the burden on family caregivers, which is accomplished with this legislation.” “As a daughter with two parents living with Alzheimer’s disease I understand the burden this responsibility places on family caregivers in similar situations all across the country,” said Sánchez. “The Credit for Caring Act will help alleviate some that burden by providing a tax credit for services such as home care and adult day care. I am proud to work with Rep. Tom Reed and Sen. Joni Ernst to find a bipartisan solution to help families across this country care for their loved ones.” “AARP is pleased to endorse the Credit for Caring Act and appreciates the bipartisan leadership of Senators Ernst (R-IA), Bennet (D-CO), Capito (R-WV), and Warren (D-MA) and Representatives Reed (R-NY) and Sánchez (D-CA) to support family caregivers,” said Nancy LeaMond, AARP Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer. “Across the country, 40 million Americans are taking care of loved ones so they can stay in their homes and communities, delaying or preventing more expensive institutional care or hospital stays. Last year, these family caregivers spent an average of 20 percent of their income on care-related expenses. That translates to $6,954 in 2016, and some pay much more. The Credit for Caring Act would give some much-needed financial relief to eligible family caregivers. We look forward to working with the bill’s sponsors and others to pass this important legislation.” About the Credit for Caring Act: Creates up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit adjusted to inflation for family caregivers Applies to incurred family caregiving expenses greater than $2,000 Qualified care recipients must have been certified by a health care practitioner to be in need of long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days Eligibility is limited to a caregiver of a qualified care recipient who must pay for caregiving expenses and has earned income in excess of $7,500 Credit is phased out when income exceeds $150,000 for joint filers or $75,000 for individual filers Family Caregivers in Iowa: According to AARP, there are 317,000 family caregivers in Iowa at any given time during the year AARP also found that the unpaid contributions of family caregivers in Iowa are valued at $3.86 billion annually
05.16.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst joined Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein along with 61 bipartisan colleagues in introducing a resolution to commemorate National Police Week. “Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line to keep our communities, states and nation safe, day in and day out,” said Senator Ernst. “Let us remember their selfless sacrifices – as well as the sacrifices made by so many law enforcement families – and honor them.” In 1962, President Kennedy signed a joint congressional resolution proclaiming the week of May 15 as National Police Week. The United States continues to celebrate Police Week 55 years later to honor the dedication and sacrifices of the men and women of American law enforcement. The names of more than 20,000 fallen officers are etched on the walls of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in the nation's capital, forever marking their sacrifices for their communities. Last year, 143 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty. This bipartisan resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that National Police Week provides an important opportunity to show strong support for law enforcement officers across the United States, recognize the need to ensure that law enforcement officers have the equipment, training, and resources necessary to protect their own safety and well-being, and acknowledge the selfless bravery and sacrifices undertaken by law enforcement officers in the United States. Additional cosponsors of this resolution include: Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Tom Carper (D-Del.), Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Christopher Coons (D-Del.), Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John Kennedy (R-La.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Luther Strange (R-Ala.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Thom Tilis (R-N.C.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.).
05.15.2017	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today joined a letter along with several Senate colleagues to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer stressing the positive economic impacts of NAFTA as the administration considers taking a fresh look at the agreement. U.S. Sens. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), John Cornyn (R-Tex.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), John Thune (R-S.D.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), and Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) also signed the letter. “Given that the agreement is more than two decades old, there are areas in which NAFTA will benefit from strengthening and modernization. On the other hand, efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences,” wrote the senators. Full text of the letter is included below, and a signed copy is available here. *** May 15, 2017 Ambassador Robert Lighthizer Office of the United States Trade Representative 600 17th Street, NW Washington, D.C. 20006 Dear Ambassador Lighthizer, We write to congratulate you on your confirmation as United States Trade Representative. With your rich experience in international trade issues and negotiating trade agreements, we are pleased you are at the helm of the office that facilitates U.S. trade. U.S. trade policy has remained a prominent issue in recent months and it appears that taking a fresh look at the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) will be an immediate priority. Among other benefits, NAFTA has led to tremendous growth in U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada, integrated cross-border supply chains that benefit U.S. employers, and more than tripled U.S. exports of goods (including agricultural and manufactured goods) and services. Given that the agreement is more than two decades old, there are areas in which NAFTA will benefit from strengthening and modernization. On the other hand, efforts to abandon the agreement or impose unnecessary restrictions on trade with our North American partners will have devastating economic consequences. As senators who represent states that see a significant economic impact from trade, we will maintain a keen interest in the on-going process surrounding NAFTA and look forward to working with your office. Sincerely,
05.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, today applauded U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue’s decision to create a new Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs within the USDA. This announcement follows Senator Ernst’s questioning during Secretary Perdue’s confirmation hearing in which the Senator asked that he establish this role pursuant to provisions in the 2014 Farm Bill. Following today’s announcement, Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “I’m thrilled that USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue announced the creation of a new Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs. “The 2014 Farm Bill recognized the importance of trade, and Congress directed the USDA to establish an undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs. During his confirmation hearing, I asked Secretary Perdue to take a look at that and make sure that we put the right person for that job in place. “Today, Secretary Perdue made good on his commitment, and through this move, he acknowledged how vital trade is to our farmers and ranchers, and that he is prepared to step up and fight for their interests. “Additionally, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, I was encouraged to see Secretary Perdue elevate the Rural Development agencies to report directly to him, further highlighting his commitment to the rural communities that are the backbone of our nation.” Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks during the confirmation hearing.
05.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Mr. Robert Lighthizer to be U.S. Trade Representative (USTR): “With Iowa leading the nation in pork, corn, egg, and soybean production, establishing new and aggressive trade agreements, along with strengthening existing relationships, is critical for growing Iowa’s economy,” said Ernst. “In addition to advocating for our manufacturers, Mr. Lighthizer pledged to promote our agricultural trade priorities, and I will work to ensure he maintains those commitments so that Iowa’s farmers and manufacturers are able to sell their goods competitively in the global market.”
05.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, emphasized to the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Lieutenant General Semonite, that Cedar Rapids products have a domestic and global economic impact and rely on proper Corps infrastructure to move. The economic success of the City of Cedar Rapids is critical to the entire wellbeing of Iowa. There are businesses located in Cedar Rapids that have domestic and global economic impacts. Senator Ernst highlighted that the September 2016 flood caused Cedar Rapids, the second largest city in Iowa, to “lose 26 million dollars in sales and production due to being essentially shut down for an entire week when they were evacuated due to the floods.” The Iowa Senator highlighted a few of the important domestic and global economic contributions of Cedar Rapids that could be affected by delays in production due to insufficient infrastructure. She noted, “breakfast cereal manufacturers in Cedar Rapids produce 13 percent of total U.S. output. Industry in Cedar Rapids also processes as much as 19 percent of the global oat crop in value added manufacturing per year, and wet corn milling in Cedar Rapids accounts for 8 percent of U.S. domestic ethanol production.” Senator Ernst also referenced a provision in the recently passed Omnibus that stated, “administration budget metrics shall not be a reason to disqualify a study or project from being funded.” The Iowa Senator noted that this provision is a “great step forward,” and asked Lieutenant General Semonite if these changes were a sign that the Corps and the Administration are looking to improve the system that calculates the economic benefits of flood control projects, which often favors areas with a higher property value. Lieutenant General Semonite admitted that while the Cedar Rapids Flood Mitigation project was not a project that received priority due to the current benefit cost ratio, he did commit to continuing to work on moving the project forward. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s full questioning of Lieutenant General Semonite. At a March 29, 2017 hearing, Senator Ernst asked General Semonite for an update on the USACE’s budget submission process and for his commitment to thoughtfully consider the Cedar Rapids project, given it was authorized in 2014 and Congress mentioned the project for prioritization in 2016.

05.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today released the following statement in support of the Trump administration’s decision to directly equip the Peoples Protection Units (YPG): “I have long been supportive of providing additional equipment to our Kurdish allies, both the Peshmerga forces in Iraq and the YPG that are part of the Syrian Democratic Forces. I am pleased the administration today decided to directly equip the YPG, as this move will greatly increase our ability to defeat ISIS in Syria. “Moving forward we need to ensure proper oversight of any and all equipment provided and reassure our NATO ally, Turkey, that we will remain allies in the fight against ISIS.”
05.09.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted in support of President Trump’s nominee to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the People's Republic of China, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad: “As we saw evidenced in his confirmation hearing last week, Governor Branstad will exemplify the same leadership, thoughtfulness, and dedication in his role as Ambassador to China on behalf of the United States as he has for the people of Iowa. I congratulate Governor Branstad on his approval by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today, and I hope that the full Senate will move quickly to confirm Governor Branstad for this important role.” Governor Branstad’s nomination now heads to the Senate floor.

05.08.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Dr. Heather Wilson to be Secretary of the U.S. Air Force: “I am pleased Dr. Wilson was confirmed today to be Secretary of the Air Force and to see another important civilian leadership position filled in our military,” said Ernst. “During her confirmation hearing, I received commitment from Dr. Wilson that she will work with me on my priorities, including finding ways to cut wasteful spending, and combatting and preventing military sexual assault and retaliation, and I look forward to working with her on these issues.”
05.04.2017	WASHINGTON D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) today introduced bipartisan legislation to direct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to conduct a comprehensive study on women-owned small business (WOSB) participation in multiple award contracts (MACs) from the federal government. This study would address concerns that WOSBs are underrepresented in MACs, and would also examine the participation of all other socio-economic categories of small businesses, including service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, and those participating in the Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) program. A report issued at the end of 2015 by the U.S. Department of Commerce showed that the odds of a WOSB winning a federal contract are 21 percent lower than that of their counterparts. The report also found that WOSBs have lower odds of winning contracts in the industries that receive the majority of federal contract dollars. “Small businesses make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa, which is home to about 82,000 women-owned businesses, so it’s important that we make sure our entrepreneurs are getting a fair shot at winning federal contracts,” said Ernst. “This bipartisan call for a study is an important first step to identify any discrepancies so we can develop solutions to ensure all small businesses have equal access to these contracting opportunities.” "Women-owned small businesses receive a disproportionately low number of federal contracts, and this legislation would help uncover why this is happening," said Gillibrand. "We need to do everything we can to make sure that women-owned small businesses can compete for federal contracts on a level playing field, so that they can have the same access to good-paying jobs as anyone else. I am proud to introduce this bipartisan bill with Senator Ernst, and I will always fight for good-paying jobs in New York."
05.02.2017	“… the position of U.S. Ambassador to China is one of the most important ambassadorial positions in the world, and I am confident that President Trump has made an excellent choice in nominating Iowa Governor Terry Branstad for this role. I look forward to him being confirmed by the Senate and bringing the ‘Iowa Way’ to Beijing.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for his confirmation hearing to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to the People's Republic of China. Click here or the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Thank you, Chairman Corker and Ranking Member Cardin and to the members of the committee. “It is my privilege to be here today, along with our longtime senior senator, Senator Grassley, to introduce my governor, my friend, and the longest serving governor in U.S. history, Terry Branstad. “A native Iowan, Governor Branstad served in the Iowa legislature before serving our state as governor from 1983 to 1999, and again from 2011 until what I hope will be his swift confirmation as U.S. Ambassador to China. “Having worked alongside the governor for many years, I know he will exemplify the same leadership, thoughtfulness, and dedication in his role as Ambassador to China on behalf of the United States as he did for the people of Iowa. “Importantly, Governor Branstad also knows China and its leaders well. He first met President Xi Jinping while he was visiting Iowa on an agricultural research trip in 1985. They have kept in touch over the years, and Governor Branstad has since visited China a number of times on behalf of the State of Iowa. “Iowa’s extensive trade relationship with China has given Governor Branstad a front-seat view of the complexities of our country’s broader trade and economic relationship with China, and will provide him with the foundation to effectively advocate for U.S. interests. “While our bilateral economic relationship with China is certainly important, I don’t have to tell you that our list of bilateral issues with China is long and expands beyond trade and investment to include issues like North Korea, the South China Sea, human rights, and more. “Accordingly, the position of U.S. Ambassador to China is one of the most important ambassadorial positions in the world, and I am confident that President Trump has made an excellent choice in nominating Iowa Governor Terry Branstad for this role. I look forward to him being confirmed by the Senate and bringing the ‘Iowa Way’ to Beijing. “I also want to extend my thanks to the support that has been given to Governor Branstad by his wonderful family and I know he’ll introduce Chris and the rest of his family soon. They are truly an asset to Iowa, I know that they are going to be a greater asset for the United States of America. “Thank you, Mr. Chairman.”

04.28.2017	WASHINGTON – Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced a bipartisan resolution to commemorate April as National Sexual Assault Awareness Month. “Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month serves as an opportunity to call attention to the heinous crime of sexual assault and the need to change the culture surrounding it,” said Ernst. “We won’t tolerate sexual assault in our gyms, on college campuses, in the military, or in our middle and high schools. Sexual assault has absolutely no place anywhere in our society. Together with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I will continue working to prevent sexual assault from happening in the first place, empower survivors, and ensure that perpetrators are held accountable.” “Many survivors of sexual violence suffer from severe and lasting challenges, including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Sadly, the traumatic experience can even lead to suicide,” said Grassley. “This resolution brings greater awareness to the problem of sexual assault and publicly acknowledges the survivors of such horrible crimes.” “Sexual assault is an epidemic in this country—one in five women are raped at some point during their lives," said Feinstein. "But too often, the scope of the problem is hidden because women feel too ashamed to come forward and don’t trust that they will be believed. I’ve seen this firsthand over the past several months working with gymnasts whose allegations of sexual abuse were missed by people in positions of authority. Congress has an obligation to help raise awareness of sexual assault to help victims feel comfortable coming forward and stop this epidemic.” A sexual assault is committed every 98 seconds in the United States according to law enforcement statistics. Sexual assault can take many forms, including rape, commercial sex trafficking, child sexual abuse and stalking. Each horrific instance of sexual assault can have profound and lasting consequences for victims. The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that National Sexual Assault Awareness Month provides an important opportunity to acknowledge survivors of sexual assault, educate the public about sexual violence, and commend the volunteers and professionals who assist survivors in their efforts to heal. The resolution also commends public safety, law enforcement and health professionals for their hard work and innovative strategies to ensure justice for victims and accountability for perpetrators. The United States first observed National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month on April 1, 2001. Click here to read more about Senator Ernst’s efforts to combat sexual assault.
04.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Alexander Acosta to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor: “During my 99 county tour across Iowa, I hear from businesses of all sizes that we must develop a well-trained workforce to meet the demand for qualified workers,” said Senator Ernst. “I am encouraged that Mr. Acosta is committed to closing the skills gap so that we can better prepare our workforce for long-term success. I look forward to working with Mr. Acosta to encourage economic growth and increase opportunities for Iowans.”
04.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, today questioned Admiral Harry B. Harris, Jr., Commander of the United States Pacific Command (PACOM), in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing examining the strategies and technological developments needed to give the United States a competitive edge in the Asia-Pacific region. The Iowa Senator expressed her frustration with the often slow and expensive defense acquisition process, and questioned Admiral Harris about the importance of efficiently developing cutting edge technologies to combat the advancing technological capabilities of North Korea and China. Admiral Harris said that overregulation can often slow down the acquisition process, preventing our servicemembers from utilizing new technologies when it is necessary to move rapidly to defend ourselves from our adversaries. Additionally, Senator Ernst asked Admiral Harris to detail the importance of engaging with our partners in the Asia-Pacific region to advance mutual interests such as countering ISIS, specifically the growing threat in Southeast Asia. Admiral Harris praised our longstanding partnerships in the region as well as Special Operations Command Pacific for their active engagement providing assistance to vulnerable countries, specifically noting their work in the southern Philippines. Senator Ernst has continually warned of the threat posed by ISIS in Asia and has stressed the importance of strengthening our global partnerships to defeat ISIS.

04.26.2017	“… the Corps and the Department of Justice claimed that a farmer needed a permit to plow his own land because the tops … of plowed furrows dry out in the sun and constitute, and no jokes folks, ‘mini mountain ranges,’ ‘mini mountain ranges’ so plowing doesn’t qualify as an ordinary farming activity. My farmers would beg to differ. Here is a picture of those ‘mountain ranges,’ from the report written by DOJ’s expert witness. I guess under this definition, Iowa is one of the more mountainous states in the United States. What is left of the ordinary farming exemptions if you can’t even plow your soil?” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, highlighted the flaws of the expanded definition of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) Rule at today’s hearing entitled, “A Review of the Technical, Scientific, and Legal Basis of the WOTUS Rule.” The Iowa Senator questioned not only the basis for the Obama administration’s claim to include ephemeral streams, or water that flows after rainfall, under the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule, but also criticized the impact this broad definition has on our farmers’ ability to manage their own land. The Senator highlighted a case in California that designated dried out plowed furrows as “mini mountain ranges” and included them under the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Hearing witness and Solicitor General of the State of Wisconsin, Misha Tseytlin, agreed with Senator Ernst on the dangers of such jurisdictional expansion, noting “the American Farm Bureau, the Wisconsin Farm Bureau and farm bureaus all over the country oppose, very strongly, the WOTUS rule.” Senator Ernst also pointed out that “by these definitions, the entire expanded definition, 97 percent of the State of Iowa is regulated by that expanded definition and considered ‘Waters of the US.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questioning. On regulating ephemeral streams, which flow only after rainfall (0:33 mark): “As part of their propaganda campaign that the Government Accountability Office found to be illegal, the Obama EPA tried to get people to believe that unless they regulate ephemeral water—which by definition is a ‘stream that flows only briefly during and following a period of rainfall,’ so essentially rainwater runoff—that the drinking water of 117 million people would be at risk… EPA put up a map on their website to support this claim.” “However, if you read EPA’s ‘Summary of the Analysis’ … you find out that EPA based this claim on a study of streams that are visible at medium resolution… At this scale, you are only going to see major streams. Does a study of those major streams at that scale have anything to do with ephemeral streams?” On the impact on farmers, Senator Ernst cited a case in California that required a permit for a farmer to plow his own land (3:41 mark): “In that case, the Corps and the Department of Justice claimed that a farmer needed a permit to plow his own land because the tops … of plowed furrows dry out in the sun and constitute, and no jokes folks, ‘mini mountain ranges,’ ‘mini mountain ranges’ so plowing doesn’t qualify as an ordinary farming activity. My farmers would beg to differ. “Here is a picture of those ‘mountain ranges,’ from the report written by DOJ’s expert witness.

04.26.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement after the Trump administration released their tax reform proposal: “With Tax Day having recently come and gone, Americans were reminded, yet again, of the untold amounts of time and money spent attempting to comply with our outdated, burdensome, and loophole-ridden tax code. Our tax code is a prime example of how government inefficiency and waste can negatively impact every day Iowans and their businesses. It’s long-overdue that we take a hard look and find ways to simplify it and ensure our country has a globally competitive system that promotes business growth and helps hardworking families. “I am reviewing the proposal issued by the Trump administration, however I believe any plan concerning tax reform should be based on common sense and sound financial policy, with the goal of lessening the burden placed on Iowa’s families, individuals, and small businesses from high taxes and an unnecessarily cumbersome federal tax code.”
04.26.2017	WASHINGTON – United States Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa, along with a bipartisan group of 14 other senators led by Grassley and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), today introduced legislation to reform the biodiesel tax credit and extend the new policy for three years. The Grassley and Cantwell-authored American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017 extends this important clean-fuel incentive for three years and reforms the incentive by transferring the credit from the blenders to the producers of biofuels. The switch ensures that the tax credit incentivizes domestic production and taxpayers aren’t subsidizing imported fuel Since 2014, biofuels imports have increased from 510 million gallons to about one billion gallons in 2016. Already in the first quarter of 2017, imports are 10 percent higher than they were at this time in 2016. In many cases, foreign biodiesel benefits both from the existing tax credit and from additional foreign subsidies, which makes it difficult for domestic biodiesel facilities to compete. In 2015 alone, the U.S. Treasury spent more than $600 million on tax credits for imported biodiesel and renewable diesel. According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, the biodiesel industry supports nearly 4,000 Iowa jobs, generates more than $300 million of income for Iowa households and accounts for $447 million of Iowa’s GDP. “U.S. tax policy should support U.S. products and U.S. jobs,” Grassley said. “This bipartisan bill would end a system that gives many foreign producers a leg up over U.S. producers and give certainty to the biodiesel industry, which is responsible for employing thousands of Americans. Iowa producers shouldn’t be put at a disadvantage by foreign producers that in many cases are double dipping by benefiting from U.S. tax incentives on top of their own significant government subsidies. These reforms supporting domestic producers would also save taxpayers money. Policies ought to encourage the production of domestic renewable fuels to meet consumer demand and support the creation of American jobs.” “Iowa leads the nation in biodiesel production, and it’s critical that we continue to support its growth here in the U.S.” Ernst said. “By investing in our domestic energy production, we can promote job creation and stability for the many Iowans who work in the industry and the surrounding farming communities. I’m proud to support this bipartisan legislation with Senator Grassley, which will ensure that we are not inadvertently supporting foreign-produced biodiesel.” Switching from a blenders credit to a producers credit would offer numerous additional benefits. The blenders credit can be difficult to administer, because the blending of the fuel can occur at many different stages of the fuel distribution. This can make it difficult to ensure that only fuel that qualifies for the credit claims the incentive, making the program susceptible to abuse. Joining Grassley and Ernst to co-sponsor the American Renewable Fuel and Job Creation Act of 2017 are Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Patty Murray (D-Wash.). Modifying the credit is estimated to have little to no impact on the consumer. Much of the credit would continue to be passed on to the blender and ultimately, the consumer. Additionally, the U.S. biodiesel industry is currently operating at approximately 65 percent of capacity. The domestic biodiesel industry has the capacity and access to affordable feedstocks to meet the demand of U.S. consumers, the senators said. In 2005, Congress created the biodiesel tax incentive. As a result of this incentive, the Renewable Fuel Standard, and consumer interest, biodiesel is providing significant benefits to the nation. Domestic biodiesel production supports tens of thousands of jobs. Replacing traditional diesel with biodiesel reduces emissions and creates cleaner air. Homegrown biodiesel improves U.S. energy security by diversifying transportation fuels and reducing dependence on foreign oil. Biodiesel itself is a diverse fuel that can be produced from a wide array of resources such as recycled cooking oil, soybean and other plant oils and animal fats.

04.26.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced the opening of a new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office. This announcement, which fulfills the Trump administration’s executive order in January directing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to establish such an office, also represents the implementation of parts of Sarah’s Law – legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed in 2016 by a drunk driver who was in the country illegally. On January 5, 2017, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and Ben Sasse (R-NE), re-introduced Sarah’s Law, which included measures to mandate that ICE provide victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants and the victims’ families with relevant up-to-date information. Following the announcement, Senator Ernst issued a statement: “The many injustices Sarah Root and her family have suffered for more than a year now are simply incomprehensible,” said Senator Ernst. “Today’s action to increase communication between ICE and victims and their families is a long-overdue step in the right direction. Victims and families should not be left in the dark, and it is my hope that this office will ensure these folks receive the up-to-date information from federal immigration authorities they deserve.” Language (in-part) from the Trump administration’s Executive Order entitled “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States” issued January 25th: Sec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States. Language in Sarah’s Law: ‘(3) NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT- Upon encountering or gaining knowledge of an alien described in paragraph (1), the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Immigration and Customs Enforcement shall make reasonable efforts-- `(A) to obtain information from law enforcement agencies and from other available sources regarding the identity of any victims of the crimes for which such alien was charged or convicted; and `(B) to provide the victim or, if the victim is deceased, a parent, guardian, spouse, or closest living relative of such victim, with information, on a timely and ongoing basis, including-- `(i) the alien's full name, aliases, date of birth, and country of nationality; `(ii) the alien's immigration status and criminal history; `(iii) the alien's custody status and any changes related to the alien's custody; and `(iv) a description of any efforts by the United States Government to remove the alien from the United States.'.
04.26.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, attended a hearing entitled “The Challenges and Opportunities of Running a Small Business in Rural America,” to address issues Iowa employers have discussed with her while on her 99 county tour. Senator Ernst questioned John Lettieri, Co-Founder and Senior Director for Policy and Strategy at Economic Innovation Group, on how to address the workforce challenges experienced by Iowa employers. Mr. Lettieri emphasized the need for cooperation between local government, the private sector, and educational institutions to ensure that the skills taught locally match the job opportunities available in our communities. Senator Ernst also stressed the importance of reliable internet access for rural communities and their small businesses, noting that this issue must be addressed in any potential infrastructure package.

04.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, and Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced bipartisan legislation to authorize the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Foundation, a private foundation, to begin the process of pursuing the construction of a memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. The memorial will honor our men and women in uniform, the fallen servicemembers, their families, and all those who have been impacted by our nation’s longest war. “The ongoing Global War on Terrorism has impacted the lives of millions of Americans across our nation,” said Senator Ernst. “Though nothing will ever be able to bring back those we have lost, this will serve as a tribute to the brave men and women and their loved ones who have sacrificed in the defense of our freedom and who fight for those across the globe who do not have those same freedoms. It is my hope that this memorial will serve as a place of healing and reflection for servicemembers, veterans and the families of our fallen, as well as a reminder of the heroic acts of many for generations to come.” “Throughout our country we have many memorials to remember those who we have lost and those who have sacrificed in conflicts throughout our history and in wars across the globe,” Senator Manchin said. “But we have yet to erect a memorial for the men and women in uniform, Fallen servicemembers and their families who have served their country courageously in our nation’s longest war – the Global War on Terror. This memorial will serve as a place for families and loved ones to reflect and honor their service and remind Americans of the human cost of war. I am proud to join my colleague Senator Ernst in introducing this important legislation to memorialize all of the servicemembers we have lost and all of those who have served in the war on terror.” This authorization is the first step in a process that will culminate with the design and construction of a Global War on Terror Memorial on the National Mall without using any federal funds. The bipartisan companion legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Congressmen Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Seth Moulton (D-MA). Additionally, this legislation has received support from The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the US (VFW), Iraq And Afghanistan Veterans Of America (IAVA), Wounded Warrior Project, The Military Order of the Purple Heart, American Veterans (AMVETS), American Goldstar Mothers, Student Veterans of America, The Green Beret Foundation, Team Rubicon, The Mission Continues, Team Red White and Blue, Travis Manion Foundation, Got Your Six, Warrior Expeditions, Union Veteran Council of the AFL-CIO, and Tragedy Assistance Program For Survivors (TAPS).
04.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, and Mazie Hirono (D-HI) reintroduced the Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support Act of 2017 (VETS Act). This bipartisan legislation seeks to improve health care access – including mental health treatment – for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). “Iowa is home to more than 200,000 veterans, many of whom reside in more rural areas, distant from Iowa’s VA facilities,” said Senator Ernst. “Telehealth offers another way in which we can provide veterans the care they need, including critical, and potentially lifesaving mental health care. The VETS Act will ensure that veterans can receive the timely and quality care they deserve from the comfort of their own homes.” “Hawaii veterans shouldn’t have to fly to Oahu, or even different states, to seek the medical care they have earned,” said Senator Hirono. “The VETS Act builds on a VA telemedicine program that is proven to work, and removes barriers to accessing care particularly for veterans in rural areas like Hawaii’s Neighbor Islands.” Currently, VA may only perform at-home telehealth services when the patient and provider are located in the same state. Such requirements prevent veterans from seeking treatment from a provider in another state that may be closer to their home. In some cases, veterans also must travel great lengths to a federal facility instead of receiving telehealth services by camera or phone. The VETS Act addresses these barriers by allowing qualified VA health professionals to operate across state lines and conduct telehealth services, including vital mental health care treatment, for veterans from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. The VETS Act is endorsed by the American Legion, American Telemedicine Association, Coalition for Health IT Now, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. The companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives was introduced today by Representatives Glenn Thompson (R-PA) and Julia Brownley (D-CA). VETS Act: Allows VA health professionals to practice telemedicine across state lines if they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized federal duties. Ensures the VA and Congress provide oversight of the VA’s telehealth program by requiring the VA to measure program effectiveness. Click here to read the full text of the VETS Act.
04.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, issued the following statement after a strong bipartisan majority in the United States Senate confirmed former Georgia Governor, Sonny Perdue, to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). “Farmers and ranchers will have an ally at the Department of Agriculture with Governor Perdue,” said Senator Ernst. “In our conversations, I stressed to Governor Perdue the need to rollback burdensome regulations that have hindered our agricultural producers for too long. Governor Perdue not only committed to me that he will work with other agencies to find solutions, but that he will be an advocate on behalf of farmers, and not for Washington bureaucrats. I look forward to working with Governor Perdue to cut red-tape for Iowa’s agricultural industry, while also promoting our agricultural bounty abroad, and collaborating on the next Farm Bill.”
04.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, President Donald Trump signed into law U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Congressman Diane Black’s (TN-06) bicameral legislation to overturn an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration, and restore decisions about the best eligible Title X providers to the states. Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “I am pleased that President Trump signed our legislation into law, and I’m grateful to have worked with Congressman Black to ensure that states are not forced to provide entities like Planned Parenthood - the nation’s single largest provider of abortions - with federal Title X dollars. “States are closer to, and more familiar with, their health care providers and patients, and therefore, should be able to make their own decisions about the best eligible Title X providers – whether those are hospitals, community health centers, or other types of providers. “The Obama administration’s rule emboldened abortion providers like Planned Parenthood, empowered federal bureaucrats, and silenced our states in the process. Today’s action restores states’ rights over a Washington-knows-best mentality and ensures that states have the ability to identify the best eligible Title X sub-grantees,” said Senator Joni Ernst. Congressman Black issued the following statement: “This is a historic victory for the pro-life community, and it has been an honor to work with Senator Ernst in this critical fight for life. I applaud my colleagues in Congress, as well as Vice President Pence, for advancing our life-affirming resolution to put the American people—not bureaucrats in Washington—back in the driver’s seat, empowering states like Tennessee to steer their Title X funds away from abortion-centric facilities like Planned Parenthood. With the passage of this legislation, Congress has rolled back the Obama Administration’s parting gift to the abortion industry and affirmed what the majority of Americans know to be true, that all life is sacred and worthy of our protection. By signing this legislation into law, President Trump is sending a strong message that the Trump Administration is a bold defender of life, and middle Tennesseans hear him loud and clear,” said Congressman Diane Black. Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks following Senate passage. Senator Ernst and Congressman Black also penned a column in the Washington Examiner on the need to overturn this rule.

04.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) led a bipartisan group of senators including Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in a letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis calling for the Department of Defense (DOD) to comply with mandatory audits, which are long-overdue by the department. The senators highlighted that twenty-five years after the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 was enacted, “the DOD is the only agency yet to comply. This inability to account for expenditures does a disservice to the American taxpayer and threatens our national security.” The bipartisan group emphasized that “At a time when military readiness and modernization require continued investments, DOD must reassure Congress and the American people that those investments will be properly managed. Clean audits inherently provide controls that guard against fraud, waste and abuse. They also enable more efficient and effective spending on critical programs and bring the Department in compliance with federal law.” The Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act reinforced the 1990 CFO Act and set a September 30, 2017, audit compliance deadline for the Department of Defense. The senators said a critical step toward meeting the deadline is fixing the “inadequate accounting systems that appear to make obtaining a clean audit unachievable.” Click here to view the letter. The full text of the letter is as follows: April 7, 2017 The Honorable James Mattis Secretary of Defense Department of Defense 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301 Dear Secretary Mattis: We write to direct your attention to the long overdue and failing Department of Defense (DOD) audit effort. The Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 mandated that all federal departments produce unqualified annual financial statements by 1992. Twenty-five years later, DOD is the only agency yet to comply. This inability to account for expenditures does a disservice to the American taxpayer and threatens our national security. At a time when military readiness and modernization require continued investments, DOD must reassure Congress and the American people that those investments will be properly managed. Clean audits inherently provide controls that guard against fraud, waste and abuse. They also enable more efficient and effective spending on critical programs and bring the Department in compliance with federal law. During your confirmation hearing, you committed to running a more efficient and transparent Department and to cooperate with Congress. This gives us confidence that you will succeed where your predecessors have failed. The September 30, 2017, deadline for audit compliance, established by the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, is rapidly approaching. We request the Department of Defense work diligently to fix the inadequate accounting systems that appear to make obtaining a clean audit unachievable, and that you are appropriately prepared to present a clean audit to the American people. Sincerely, Charles E. Grassley Joni K.

04.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. “I am thrilled that a bipartisan majority has voted to confirm Judge Gorsuch, who is eminently qualified to serve on our nation’s highest court,” said Senator Ernst. “Throughout his career, Judge Gorsuch has shown an unparalleled depth of understanding and respect for our Constitution. He is dedicated to interpreting the text of the Constitution and statutes as they are written, rather than attempting to legislate from the bench. It’s easy to see why Judge Gorsuch was previously confirmed by the Senate with unanimous support – including the support of Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. “The American people are behind Judge Gorsuch, and I look forward to seeing him take his seat on the bench very soon.”
04.06.2017	WASHINGTON – A bipartisan coalition of Senators today renewed the Campus Accountability and Safety Act—legislation to combat sexual assault on college and university campuses by protecting students, promoting equity, and strengthening accountability and transparency for institutions. The bill was reintroduced by U.S. Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Dean Heller of Nevada, Mark Warner of Virginia, Marco Rubio of Florida, Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, and Joni Ernst of Iowa. The Senators’ legislation would reform the way colleges and universities address and report incidents of sexual assault that occur on their campuses, and safeguards both survivors and accused students. It incorporates feedback from key stakeholders to strengthen how student surveys are conducted, as well as strengthens newly required training standards. The bill sets new notification requirements for both survivors and accused students involved in the campus disciplinary process. Key provisions of the legislation include: Establishes New Campus Resources and Support Services for Student Survivors: Colleges and universities will be required to designate Sexual Assault Response Coordinators to assist survivors of sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Sexual Assault Response Coordinators will coordinate support services and accommodations for survivors, provide information about options for reporting, and provide guidance or assistance—at the direction of the survivor—in reporting the crime to campus authorities and/or law enforcement. Schools will no longer be allowed to sanction students who report sexual violence but reveal a non-violent student conduct violation in good faith, like underage drinking. Requires Fairness in Campus Disciplinary Process: All schools will now be required to use one uniform process for campus student disciplinary proceedings and may no longer allow athletic departments or other subgroups to handle complaints. Schools must now provide written notification to the accused as well as the victim of any decision to move forward with a campus disciplinary proceeding within 24 hours of that decision. The notice must include details of the complaint, a summary of the disciplinary proceeding, and the rights and due process protections available to both parties. Ensures Minimum Training Standards for On-Campus Personnel: This legislation ensures that everyone from the Sexual Assault Response Coordinators to those responsible for investigating and participating in disciplinary proceedings will receive specialized training so that they have a firm understanding of the nature of these crimes and their effect on survivors. Creates New Transparency Requirements: For the first time, students at every college and university in America will be surveyed about their experience with sexual violence to get an accurate picture of this problem. This new biennial survey will be standardized and confidential, with the results published online so that parents and high school students can make an informed choice when comparing universities. The Department of Education will also be required to publish the names of all schools with pending investigations, final resolutions, and voluntary resolution agreements related to Title IX with respect to sexual violence and the requirements of the Clery Act. Campus Accountability and Coordination with Law Enforcement: This legislation will require colleges and universities to enter into memoranda of understanding with each local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction to report to a campus as a first responder to clearly delineate responsibilities and share information so that when a crime occurs, both campus authorities and local authorities can focus on solving the crime rather than debating jurisdiction. Stiffer Penalties for Clery Act Violations: Schools that do not comply with certain requirements under the bill may face a penalty of up to 1 percent of the institution’s operating budget. The bill also increases penalties for Clery Act violations up to $150,000 per violation from the current penalty of $35,000. Financial penalties collected from universities in violation will be distributed back to campuses through a new competitive grant program, administrated by the Secretary of Education, for which colleges and universities can apply for the purpose of researching best practices for preventing and responding to sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking on college campuses and sharing such research with peer institutions and the Department of Education. “Democrats and Republicans may not agree on much, but protecting our kids and students is something that cuts across every political divide, straight to who we are as people,” McCaskill said. “I’m really proud to work with this group of colleagues on smart policy to do just that—protect and empower our students, hold perpetrators of this heinous crime accountable, and make our schools more responsive—because combating sexual assault and instilling respect and empowerment in our kids is a value all of us share.” “Sexual assault is pervasive and far too often colleges and universities would rather sweep it under the rug, but we can no longer turn a blind eye to this problem. This bipartisan bill would flip the incentives so that schools are finally held accountable. It would also help protect students and establish new resources for student survivors. Our bipartisan coalition will keep working together to pass this bill, change the status quo, and make our campuses safer,” said Gillibrand. “As a father and grandfather, I want to ensure that all students feel safe on their college campus. In addition to providing victims with the support and resources they need, our legislation establishes safeguards to help schools further protect their students from the threat of sexual assault. I’m proud to work with my colleagues on this bipartisan legislation, and I’m hopeful others will join us in supporting it,” said Heller. “I am proud to continue working with this bipartisan group of colleagues on sexual assault prevention legislation that demands greater transparency, consistency, and accountability from colleges and universities nationwide,” said Warner. “There has been a huge increase in public awareness and meaningful policy discussion in recent years thanks to the courage of campus sexual assault survivors as well as leadership from advocacy organizations. However, Congress still has a responsibility to strengthen and support these efforts with legislation. Reintroducing the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which was supported by more than one-third of the United States Senate in the previous Congress, represents an important step towards meeting this commitment to better protect our young people on campus.” “Sexual assault on college campuses is a crime that too often goes unpunished,” Rubio said. “We must hold colleges and universities accountable for ensuring the safety and well-being of their students. This legislation will protect and empower survivors, reform the way institutions handle sexual assault cases, and ultimately help ensure these cases are handled in the criminal justice system as the serious crimes that they are. I’m proud to be a part of a bipartisan coalition that is aiming to make our college campuses safer.” “Sexual assault is a crime, period. That’s true whether it occurs on or off a college campus. Our bill has provisions to ensure that colleges treat sexual assault cases with the seriousness they deserve,” Grassley said. “This includes better coordination with law enforcement and clearer expectations for how colleges should handle reports of sexual assault. Like with any crime, weak enforcement makes the problem worse. This bill will start to turn that around.” “By ensuring colleges treat sexual assault with the seriousness it deserves, this bipartisan legislation aims to change campus culture and stop the staggeringly prevalent scourge of sexual assault,” Blumenthal said. “College administrators can no longer dismiss, demean, or deny the problem. This bill’s message is clear: the days of victim blaming are over and the days of accountability are here.” “Sexual assault of any kind must be met with zero tolerance from our society – including on our college campuses,” said Ernst. “We must ensure that student survivors of sexual assault have the support and resources they need to feel empowered to come forward. Additionally, those responsible for such heinous crimes on college campuses across the country must be held accountable. I’m proud to be a part of this bipartisan effort to protect young students and take steps to try to change the unacceptable culture surrounding sexual assault.”
04.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, questioned the Commander of the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), Admiral Kurt W. Tidd on the rise of ISIS in Latin America. Senator Ernst asked Admiral Tidd if he was concerned about the rise of ISIS in Latin America, to which the Admiral responded, “Senator, we’re very concerned. There is, I think, a tendency to often think that ISIS is only present in the middle east or north Africa, and the reality is ISIS is present here in the western hemisphere.” Additionally, Senator Ernst asked Admiral Tidd if he felt prepared and equipped to counter their recruiting efforts in the region. Admiral Tidd stated that “That is probably the, one of the areas of greatest work that we are engaged in.” Additionally, the admiral noted that what’s more concerning is the efforts by ISIS to encourage radicalized individuals to stay in their home countries to and conduct attacks on their home soil or the United States. The Iowa Senator also raised concern over the pathways being used by cartels to move goods into North America, and the possibility of terrorist organizations exploiting those pathways. Admiral Tidd stated that “we have to assume that [ISIS] is going to try.” During the hearing, Senator Ernst also spoke with Admiral Tidd about the need to counter the misinformation campaign and activity by the Russians aimed to weaken the United States’ relationship with their partnering nations in the region. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of SOUTHCOM Commander Admiral Tidd. Below is the full text of Senator Ernst’s questions. On the rise of ISIS in Latin America: Senator Ernst: “Admiral Tidd, in February of 2017, the Associated Press reported that Trinidad and Tobago has become the largest per-capita source of ISIS recruits in the Western hemisphere. And according to the report, as many as many as 125 fighters have traveled from the island to ISIS controlled areas over the past 4 years. So are you concerned about the rise of ISIS in SOUTHCOM?” Admiral Tidd: “Senator, we’re very concerned. There is, I think, a tendency to often think that ISIS is only present in the middle east or north Africa, and the reality is ISIS is present here in the western hemisphere. You cited the case of foreign fighters that have gone over to Iraq and Syria to fight, obviously we’re very concerned about the return of those fighters, but what’s become more troubling is an effort, an active effort on the part of ISIS to communicate to radicalize individuals, telling them ‘stay home, and conduct attacks in your home countries against your countries and the United States, and our interests in this region’. “You cited Trinidad and Tobago, but that’s not the only country where we know there is a presence of radicalized individuals to whom the ISIS message is very appealing, and I think it’s an area that we need to pay close attention. Our counter-network approach we’re applying enables us to recognize that this presence of ISIS in the theater, when previously we focused exclusively on commodities, it was often times it was, we focused more on the criminal networks and did not pay attention to the fact that there are also terrorist networks as well.” Senator Ernst: “So those terrorist networks, they understand those pathways that are being used by various cartels and so-forth, moving goods into the NORTHCOM area. Do you think those could be exploited then by those terrorist organizations?” Admiral Tidd: “ISIS, when it did recent issues of Dabiq communicates directly in English language to radicalized individuals to attempt to exploit those pathways into the United States, so we have to assume they’re going to try.” Senator Ernst: “Okay. Those that are fighting in Iraq and Syria, how are they able to reach back into the Caribbean and radicalize the folks there? What do you think is the primary means of communication?” Admiral Tidd: “I think its internet, by cyber means.” Senator Ernst: “And is cyber something you believe we should pay attention to then?” Admiral Tidd: “I think we all recognize that it’s a domain that must bear increasing attention.” Senator Ernst: “Absolutely, I appreciate that. And then, do you think we are doing enough to counter ISIS’s recruiting efforts in the SOUTHCOM region?” Admiral Tidd: “That is probably the, one of the areas of greatest work that we are engaged in. In order to work with our partner nations and in our discussions with them, they now recognize that they must pay attention to the rise of the radicalization phenomenon. We were all, I think, had a wakeup call with the attacks that occurred in Paris and Brussels, but also in San Bernardino and in Orlando, that individuals can become radicalized and can conduct horrific attacks, and so it’s up to all of us to work together, exchange information, and attempt to remove the conditions that lead to radicalization.” On countering Russian Misinformation Campaigns: Senator Ernst: “[Admiral Tidd] I did appreciate meeting with you last week or last month, excuse me. We had a very good conversation and during that conversation, you brought up the fact that you had seen more activities from the Russians - you mentioned that a little bit earlier as well with some other countries - you stated that it may not be with a military bent, but that there were some other military activities that they were engaging in. Can you enlighten us as to the types of activities you are seeing from the Russians and why that would be of a national security interest to us?” Admiral Tidd: “Thank you, Senator. We have seen the deployment of ships, particularly frequent deployment of intelligence collection ships, that we know operate frequently on the east coast of the United States and then spends time down in the Caribbean. We’ve also seen periodically the deployment of long-range aviation, comes down and spends a bit of time down in our theater. But probably of greater long-term concern as the very aggressive arms sales programs where Russia is down and talking with our traditional partners, attempting to displace the United States as the partner of choice. And then the part that I think is most troubling, we see they are engaged in very aggressive misinformation campaigns. Basically peddling the story that the United States is not a reliable partner in Latin America, that we are not interested in the region, and that we are withdrawing from the region. It’s troubling because of resource constraints that we’ve had, and the requirement of the number of forces available in our theater - as that has declined- that plays directly into that narrative that Russia has been peddling. These are relationships we have with strong partners and it’s just up to us to be able to prove that we are the partner of choice.” Senator Ernst: “So not only do we need to maintain a presence there, but we also need to reinforce our own message-“ Admiral Tidd: “Absolutely.” Senator Ernst: “-to those areas.
04.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services’ Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and combat veteran, issued the following statement on President Trump’s decision to launch a missile strike against Syria: “Tonight, President Trump took action against Bashar al-Assad's regime, and followed through with the red line drawn by the Obama administration. “Assad is a war criminal. His regime, backed by Russia, continues to destabilize Syria and target civilians. This has been a tragic reality for the past six years and has gone on far too long. “Unlike the Obama administration, the Trump administration is showing global leadership and we must work to find an end to the root causes of this crisis.”
04.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) with U.S. Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Rob Portman (R-OH) in introducing the Fair Chance Act, which would prohibit federal employers and contractors from asking a job applicant about his or her criminal history until the final stages of the interview process. The bipartisan bill is being introduced in the House of Representatives today by Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) and Darrell Issa (R-CA). By “banning the box” in federal hiring and federal contractor hiring, the Fair Chance Act will help formerly incarcerated individuals re-integrate into society and gain meaningful employment, while still providing employers the opportunity to learn about criminal histories before hiring. The bill includes important common-sense exceptions for jobs related to law enforcement and national security, jobs dealing with classified information, and other jobs requiring criminal history information. “The Fair Chance Act represents second chances and opportunity,” Senator Ernst said. “This bipartisan legislation opens doors to those with a record who have served their time, and empowers them to pursue employment with the federal government or contractors based on their qualifications. Additionally, this legislation maintains safeguards for employers and proactively works to reduce recidivism and protect tax dollars. It’s my hope that the Senate will move on this important legislation as quickly as possible.” “The barriers faced by incarcerated people when they try to transition back into society are a big part of why our criminal justice system is so broken,” Senator Booker said. “Our bill helps to address this challenge by giving those who have paid their dues a second chance by putting jobs in the federal government or with a federal contractor within reach. At the same time, the bill also includes safeguards for employers. By improving employment prospects for returning citizens, we will not only better live up to our ideals, but will help reduce recidivism rates and make our communities safer.” "If someone getting out of prison wants to work and be a productive member of society we should do everything possible to facilitate that. The dignity of work is one of the best ways we can keep people from turning back to a life of crime,” Senator Johnson said. “Between legislation like this bill and community workforce development initiatives like the Joseph Project, we can continue to help people get back to work and improve the safety of our communities, strengthen families, and reduce government dependence.” "The Fair Chance Act will help formerly incarcerated individuals live out their God-given potential,” Senator Portman said. "This legislation will change lives in Ohio and across the country by ensuring the mistakes of our past don't have to define the potential for our future. I hope that we all can join together on a bipartisan basis to support those who want a fair shot at living an honest and productive life." “If you’ve served your time, you shouldn’t continue to be punished for your past mistakes,” Senator Brown said. “We need to give folks who’ve paid their debt to society a fair shot to earn a living and contribute to society, rather than ending up back behind bars.” “Those who have made mistakes and paid their debts to society deserve a chance to move forward and live a productive life,” Senator Baldwin said. “However today, more than 70 million Americans with criminal histories face unreasonable employment barriers that stand in the way of them successfully reentering society and contributing to our workforce. Our bipartisan effort will help ensure people have a fair chance to secure steady jobs, support their families and strengthen our communities.” Specifically, the Fair Chance Act would: 1) Ban the federal government from requesting criminal history information from applicants until they reach the conditional offer stage. 2) Prohibit federal contractors from requesting criminal history information from candidates for positions within the scope of federal contracts until the conditional offer stage. 3) Include important exceptions for positions related to law enforcement and national security duties, positions requiring access to classified information, and positions for which access to criminal history information is required by law. 4) Require the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in coordination with the U.S. Census Bureau, to issue a report on the employment statistics of formerly incarcerated individuals. Last Congress, Senators Ernst, Booker, Johnson, Baldwin, and Brown introduced the Fair Chance Act in September 2015. It passed unanimously out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in October 2015.
04.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Gary Peters (D-MI) announced the formation of the first-ever Motorcycle Caucus in the United States Senate. The life-long motorcycle riding senators will serve as co-chairs of the caucus, and will advocate for a multitude of issues on behalf of both motorcycle riders and manufacturers. “Some of my most cherished memories include motorcycles, from delivering messages as a young girl to my dad while he was working out in the fields, to riding through the rolling hills of Northeast Iowa with family and friends,” said Senator Ernst. “I am thrilled to have the opportunity to encourage thoughtful discussion and solutions on behalf of motorcycle riders and manufacturers through my new role as co-chair of the Motorcycle Caucus. Throughout my 99 county tour of Iowa, I have heard from many of these folks about some of their priorities, including improving safety, infrastructure, and energy efficiency. These concerns are shared by folks across our great state and country, and I look forward to working with Senator Peters toward solutions.” “I’ve loved motorcycles since I was a kid, and I started a newspaper route to buy my first motorcycle at age 11. To this day, I believe there is no better way to see Michigan’s beautiful scenery than by bike, whether I’m riding to meet with constituents and small businesses or taking my bike out on the weekend,” said Senator Peters. “Motorcyclists come from all walks of life, and I can’t think of a better way to bring together a diverse and dedicated group of advocates to discuss everything from safety concerns to manufacturing. I’m looking forward to working with Senator Ernst as co-chair of the bipartisan Senate Motorcycle Caucus to foster these important discussions and find common ground with motorcycle lovers across the country.”

This town meeting is open to the public. Monday, April 10, 2017 Clayton County Town Meeting 6:00 PM CT Central Community School Auditorium 400 1st Street NW Elkader, IA At the end of the event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with press.

03.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At yesterday’s Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee hearing on examining how small businesses confront and shape regulations, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the committee, discussed with hearing witness Mr. Randy Noel, President of Reve Inc. and First Vice Chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, the rules and regulations that impact America’s small businesses. Senator Ernst highlighted her legislation, the Prove It Act, which would provide a check on federal agencies that too often issue rules without completing enough analysis to determine how that rule would impact small businesses. As an example, the Iowa Senator referenced the Waters of the U.S. rule, which would cover 97 percent of Iowa. Mr. Noel agreed that the opportunity for a second look at these federal agencies’ analysis would be beneficial to the small businesses who felt they were unjustly fined. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s discussion with Mr. Noel. Senator Ernst: “Thank you Mr. Chair. Mr. Noel, thank you for being here today and testifying. Your testimony was spot on when you spoke about Waters of the US. I appreciated that very much. Really had some interesting interactions through their rule making process when the EPA came up with that version of WOTUS, so thank you. “That rule gave the EPA the power to regulate 97 percent of Iowa. Not 97 percent of Iowa’s waters, 97 percent of Iowa. So that really hit home with me. So you better believe that when that happened, when that rule was implemented, that our small businesses were impacted at home. “And it was EPA’s failed rulemaking process and its lack of consideration for those small businesses that led me to work on legislation that I introduced last year called the Prove It Act. And we are currently working on what we consider a 2.0 version of the Prove It Act and we’re requesting lots of feedback from different groups. “At its core, the bill seeks to strengthen the voice of small business owners and improve the quality of agency certifications and analysis, which we felt was lacking, as we went through WOTUS. “Last year, we had the support of NFIB, the Chamber, and Women Impacting Public Policy. It’s a good government bill that says if there is a difference in opinion between the office of advocacy and a federal agency on the economic impact of the rule, such as the certification, then advocacy should have the ability to request that the agency take a second look at its analysis, which we feel is reasonable. “It would serve as a check on whether agency certification of ‘no impact’ on small businesses is correct, which is a need that you mentioned in your testimony, so thank you for highlighting that. “So my question to you, Mr. Noel, is this: do you think providing greater accountability for agency certifications would improve the rulemaking process and outcomes for small businesses?” Mr. Noel: “Well absolutely. If you have no accountability, you can do anything you want to do, knowing there’s no repercussion. To tag on to the story, we had builders on the north shore in St. Tammany that were making sure that the dirt didn’t go into the street but had not had the right paperwork filed to prove that they inspected it weekly and 24 hours after the rain. Got fined $1500. They were accomplishing the goal of runoff, but because the paperwork wasn’t – same thing happened with lead paint on a remodeler. Because he hadn’t had a document saying he’d given a pamphlet to a homeowner, he got fined. Now come on. And there’s nothing you can do about it because the fine is not enough to justify hiring a lawyer and suing them, although Volks Construction did that in Baton Rouge and won, but this is not fair to the small American business.” Senator Ernst: “Right, so we do think there should be a check and a balance-” Mr. Noel: “Absolutely.” Senator Ernst: “-available there so if there is a question, go back and have them take a second look at it. We’re hoping to gain a little traction on that piece of legislation this year or in this Congress, so thank you for that. And second, in your experience and in your role with the National Association of Homebuilders, how many proposed regulations would you say were either improperly certified by agencies or made it through the process without thoughtfully considering the comments of the small business community? Just an estimation in your part.” Mr. Noel: “How many rules came out in the last eight years? Or the last twelve months? Hundreds?” Senator Ernst: “Thousands.” Mr. Noel: “I know that we’re dealing with right now at least five that we’re spending court money on to stop. That’s not a very good use of our member’s money, especially if we could stop the rule from going in place before it harms the small business.” Senator Ernst: “Absolutely, and that’s why I think the Prove It Act is necessary, if there is a discrepancy that can be shown, it can be reevaluated before its promulgated.” Mr. Noel: “Oh, that’s wonderful.” Senator Ernst: “Yeah, anyway, thank you very much, gentlemen, for being here today. I appreciate it. Thank you.”
03.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today spoke on the floor of the Senate to applaud the passage of the bicameral legislation she introduced along with U.S. Representative Diane Black (R-TN) to overturn an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration, and restore decisions about the best eligible Title X providers to the states. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Mr. President. “I rise today to thank my colleagues for their support of my legislation to overturn President Obama’s 11th hour rule that revoked States’ rights to determine the best eligible sub-grantees for Title X family planning funding. “It should be the right of our States to allocate sub-grants under the Title X program in the way that best fits the needs of the people living there. Unfortunately, like many other rules issued during the Obama administration, this rule attempted to empower federal bureaucrats in Washington and silence our States. “As we all know, States are closer to and more familiar with the health care providers and patients within their borders, and should be able to make their own decisions about the best eligible Title X sub-grantees – be it hospitals, federally qualified community health centers, or other types of providers. “A number of States have acted in recent years to prioritize Title X sub-grants to more comprehensive providers, where women can receive greater preventive and primary care than they can at providers like Planned Parenthood. “The Obama Administration’s rule attempted to claim that providers like Planned Parenthood can ‘accomplish Title X programmatic objectives more effectively’. This rhetoric does not match the reality. “In fact, after Representative Diane Black and I led more than 100 of our colleagues in pointing that out to the Obama administration, HHS acknowledged the challenge of measuring effectiveness across all types of Title X recipients and sub-recipients, and therefore, removed the word ‘effectively’ from the final rule. “So why was this rule implemented in the first place? It’s because the Obama administration wanted to do everything it could to secure federal funding streams for Planned Parenthood before they turned over the keys to the Trump administration. “With our vote today, we prevented that from happening. “But let me be clear. Although it is no secret that I do not believe Planned Parenthood – the nation’s single largest provider of abortion services – is deserving of federal taxpayer dollars, this legislation does not prevent Planned Parenthood or any other specific entity from receiving Title X funds. “If states like Washington or Massachusetts want to distribute Title X sub-grants to Planned Parenthood, this legislation to overturn the Obama Administration’s rule won’t prevent them from doing so. “Nor does overturning the rule reduce overall funding levels for the Title X family planning programs. “In fact, this legislation does not in any way decrease women’s health care funding. “Rather, overturning the rule merely empowers States over a Washington-Knows-Best mentality and ensures that States have the ability to identify the best eligible Title X sub-grantees. “It restores local control and ensures that States aren’t forced by the Federal Government to provide abortion providers like Planned Parenthood with taxpayer dollars. “I appreciate my colleagues’ support of this legislation, and I look forward to President Trump signing it and scrapping the Obama Administration’s overreaching, 11th hour rule. “Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.” About Senator Ernst and Representative Black’s bicameral legislation: The rule currently secures federal Title X family planning grants for Planned Parenthood and interferes with states’ ability to make their own decisions about the best eligible providers. This legislation would overturn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) final rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program. At the 2017 March for Life in Washington, D.C., Senator Ernst announced the reintroduction of this measure to thousands of attendees. That same day, Senator Ernst and Representative Black penned a column in the Washington Examiner detailing their commitment to protecting life.
03.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a combat veteran, questioned Dr. Heather A. Wilson, nominee to be Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, at her confirmation hearing today. During her questioning, Dr. Wilson committed to work with Senator Ernst to cut wasteful spending and to make it a priority. Senator Ernst also discussed innovative solutions to rapidly introduce highly lethal, low-cost capabilities to the battlefield. Senator Ernst, who has oversight of Special Operations Command (SOCOM) in her Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, cited SOCOM’s use of commercial off the shelf equipment to update old aircraft and effectively engage the enemy without burdening taxpayers. Ernst stated, “…why do we spend our millions and millions, or even billions, of dollars on aircraft munitions to destroy a ten thousand dollar pick up in the middle of the desert… I think there are ways that we can refine what we do with innovation and make it very cost-effective as well for our armed services.” Dr. Wilson said she was open to innovative experiments, while stating the importance of engaging the scientific and technical community to move our nation forward.

Transcription: Senator Ernst: “Thank you for your testimony today and for being willing to take on this great responsibility. Before I begin, I would like to ask you some simple yes or no questions. Do you commit to cutting wasteful spending and making it a priority?” Dr. Wilson: “Yes.” Senator Enrst: “Do you commit to working with me to combat and prevent military sexual assault and retaliation in the Air Force?” Dr. Wilson: “Yes.” Senator Enrst: “Will you provide me with advanced notice should changes to the gender integration policies be considered?” Dr. Wilson: “Yes.” Senator Enrst: “And finally, given your previous work with the defense contracting industry, do you commit to upholding an unbiased approach throughout the acquisition process?” Dr. Wilson: “Yes.” Senator Ernst: “Thank you for those answers. “Dr. Wilson, when Secretary Mattis was Commander of CENTCOM, he initiated “Combat Dragon II,” an innovation experiment designed to rapidly introduce highly lethal, low-cost capabilities to the battlefield. “As part of this experiment, SOCOM borrowed two mothballed Vietnam-era aircraft from NASA. They outfitted them with advanced commercial ISR systems and precision weapons, which cost less, and in many cases, provided more capabilities than traditional ISR and strike aircraft combined. “During a 3-month deployment, this SOCOM unit achieved a 99 percent sortie completion rate, and was able to find, fix and finish highly-sensitive missions by employing 63 precision-guided rockets on 41 different targets. “Can you speak to the benefits of a high-low mix of combat capabilities? Specifically, how can we leverage the lessons of Combat Dragon to rapidly provide new capabilities to the warfighter without over-burdening our American taxpayers?” Dr. Wilson: “Thank you Senator, I think that is probably a good example, although I was aware of OE-10’s that were recently brought back to service. I don’t know if that was the Combat Dragon program, but I do think there are ways to innovate and have been involved in a few of them myself when I was on the National Security Council staff trying to get some very new capability to the warfighter. We always have to be sensitive to the fact that sometimes our great ideas in the world of science and engineering have to be operated by an eighteen year old with minimal training in a very highly stressed situation, so we always have to be sensitive to those things, and the total cost of maintaining and all of those things. But I think particularly the Air Force, has always been, we’ve supposed to be the innovators. We’re supposed to be the can-do, fix-it, get it there, duct tape and bailing wire service in a way, and I think I’m very open to those kinds of experiments.” Senator Ernst: “Very good. Do you see other ways that you can use innovation in the Air Force to really protect the taxpayers or are there other programs you think should be looked at?” Dr. Wilson: “There are a wide variety of innovation programs. I do think that thinking about how we engage the scientific and technical community, because we’re all short of scientists and engineers, so how do we better engage them to try to move us forward. And also to try to be aware of what our adversaries might be doing. Our entire intelligence system since pearl harbor has been set up for indications and warning to prevent surprise attack. “While in the area of science and technology, preventing surprise attack is detecting what our adversaries might be doing with respect to scientific and technical advancement, and what implications that might have for us. So their development of stealth tech, the best examples are the developments of the jet engine in World War II or the V2 rocket, or Einstein’s letter to the president about the potential for a nuclear weapon. How are we systematically assessing scientific and technical development to prevent surprise at the scientific and technical level, and I think there may be some things that we can do today that were not even possible to do ten years ago because of the ability to link scientists and engineers who otherwise wouldn’t have known each other.” Senator Ernst: “No and I appreciate that very much and we will continue to look for innovation. Something I heard not long ago which I think really plays into the Combat Dragon II is a comment that was made- why do we spend our millions and millions, or even billions, of dollars on aircraft munitions to destroy a ten thousand dollar pick up in the middle of the desert. So I think there are ways that we can refine what we do with innovation and make it very cost-effective as well for our armed services. I want to thank you again for being here today and taking on this challenge. Thank you, Dr. Wilson.”
03.30.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst and members of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee voted in support of President Trump’s nominee to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue. Governor Perdue’s nomination now heads to the Senate floor for a vote. Following the vote in committee, Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “I applaud the committee’s decision to favorably confirm Governor Perdue and move forward with his confirmation process,” said Senator Ernst. “At his confirmation hearing, Governor Perdue expressed commitment to working with other agencies to roll back onerous government regulations that hinder Iowa’s agricultural industry. Getting government out of the way of our farmers is critical as we work to stabilize and grow the ag economy, particularly in our rural states, and I look forward to working with Governor Perdue.” To watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Governor Perdue at his confirmation hearing last week, click here. # # #
03.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services’ Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee and a combat veteran, held her first open subcommittee hearing titled “Russian Influence and Unconventional Warfare Operations in the ‘Grey Zone’: Lessons from Ukraine.” During the hearing, Senator Ernst stressed the need to examine Russia’s grey zone activities in Crimea and ensure it never happens again. Additionally, Senator Ernst expressed her concern that we could see similar events impact Iowa’s state partner, Kosovo. Senator Ernst emphasized: “The invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea in the spring of 2014 represents the breadth of Russia’s influence campaign in Ukraine, and the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty represents the first attempt to change the boundary of a European nation since the end of the Cold War. Russian operations spanned the spectrum from covert information operations, intended to influence political opinion - to overt deployment of military forces for unconventional warfare, designed to dominate civilian populations. We cannot afford to understate its importance or ignore its lessons.” She continued “…Last week, the commander of U.S. European Command, General Scaparrotti, characterized the Russian operations in Crimea as ‘activities short of war’. Or, as it is commonly referred to – the grey zone.” The Iowa Senator also pressed the witnesses on her concern over “Russia’s involvement in Serbia right now, and its impact on Iowa’s sister country – we have a state partnership program with Kosovo – so I do get very concerned about those activities in Serbia and how they might lead to activities with Russia in Kosovo. Just last week, General Scaparrotti said he shared my concerns about Russia’s activities in Serbia as well.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s opening remarks. Witnesses at the hearing included Dr. Olga Oliker, Senior Adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Lieutenant General Charles T. Cleveland, USA (Ret.), Senior Fellow at the Madison Policy Forum and Former Commanding General of the United States Army Special Operations Command; and Dr. Michael R. Carpenter, Senior Director of the Biden Center for Diplomacy at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to Kosovo, Senator Ernst also had the opportunity to question the witnesses on Russia’s ability to illegally annex Crimea and destabilize eastern Ukraine, and Russian propaganda campaigns (more below the full text of the remarks). Full text of Senator Ernst’s opening remarks: “Today, the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee meets to receive testimony on Russian influence and unconventional warfare operations in the “Grey Zone” and the lessons learned from those operations in Ukraine. I would like to welcome our distinguished witnesses this morning: Dr. Olga Oliker, Senior Advisor and Director of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies; Dr. Michael Carpenter, Senior Director of the Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania; and Retired Lieutenant General Charles Cleveland, former commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and currently a Senior Fellow at the Madison Policy Forum. “Thank you very much for joining us today. “The invasion and illegal annexation of Crimea in the spring of 2014 represents the breadth of Russia’s influence campaign in Ukraine, and the violation of Ukrainian sovereignty represents the first attempt to change the boundary of a European nation since the end of the Cold War. “Russian operations spanned the spectrum from covert information operations, intended to influence political opinion - to overt deployment of military forces for unconventional warfare, designed to dominate civilian populations. “We cannot afford to understate its importance or ignore its lessons. It is my hope our witnesses can help us understand in more detail what happened, why it was successful, and how to stop it from happening again in the future. “Last week, the commander of U.S. European Command, General Scaparrotti, characterized the Russian operations in Crimea as ‘activities short of war’. Or, as it is commonly referred to – the grey zone. “Russia’s grey zone activities in Crimea are important for us to review today, and unique because it was an influence campaign of propaganda and disinformation, culminating in the employment of Russian Special Operations Forces on the sovereign territory of Ukraine. “This hearing today also allows us to discuss our own Special Operations Forces. It is time we review their Unconventional Warfare capabilities. “I look forward to hearing from General Cleveland about his thoughts on the need to strengthen the capabilities in our special operations forces – which may have understandably atrophied after over a decade focused on direct action counter terrorism missions. “The Russian influence campaign and unconventional warfare efforts in Ukraine contain all the hallmarks of grey zone operations: ambiguity of attribution, indirect approach, and below the threshold of open conflict. “As we continue to see Russia conduct these operations across the globe, I hope our witnesses today can better help us understand, and better counter these efforts.” On Russian involvement in Serbia leading to activity in Kosovo: “Dr. Oliker, you note at the end of your written comments that you don’t think a ‘Crimea-like scenario’ is what we need to worry about in the future. As we witness continued grey zone activities from Russia throughout the Baltics and Balkans – I am worried about what scenario we might possibly see there in the future. Specifically, I am concerned about Russia’s involvement in Serbia right now, and its impact on Iowa’s sister country – we have a state partnership program with Kosovo – so I do get very concerned about those activities in Serbia and how they might lead to activities with Russia in Kosovo. Just last week, General Scaparrotti said he shared my concerns about Russia’s activities in Serbia as well. So what type of Russia scenarios do you think we might see in the future, specifically in that region? Senator Ernst followed up with Dr. Carpenter regarding his earlier comments about railcars being purchased with Russian dollars. “I thought it was interesting, Dr. Carpenter, that you mentioned the railcars that are being purchased with Russian dollars and that was brought to my attention by the Kosovars. They mentioned that there are railcars that have been purchased that are located in Serbia that have been run into Kosovo. So there are some concerns out there, they’re wondering what is going on, what type of propaganda is this that exists out there. Do you have any brief comments on those types of activities?” Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s questions to Dr. Oliker and Dr. Carptenter. On Russia’s ability to illegally annex Crimea and destabilize eastern Ukraine: “General Cleveland, if I could start with you, why were the Russians so successful in achieving their objectives of illegally annexing Crimea and destabilizing eastern Ukraine? And why do you think U.S. Special Operations forces are prepared today to counter situations like that in the future?” Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s question to General Cleveland. On Russia Propaganda Campaigns: “Dr. Carpenter, to counter Russian information operations, you say that the United States should ‘take a more pro-active approach’ including identifying and taking action against Russian misinformation – or debunking those false stories. And I agree with you on that point. Can you explain to us what role the messaging in Russian films and TV shows play into this information campaign? And then also, what about social media and how that applies to the situation?” Click here or on the image above to watch Senator Ernst’s question to Dr. Carpenter.
03.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, questioned the Commanding General and Chief of Engineers of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Lieutenant General Semonite, on the status of necessary funding for the Cedar Rapids Flood Mitigation Project following unprecedented flooding in 2008 and 2016. Senator Ernst asked Lieutenant General Semonite for an update on the USACE’s budget submission process and for his commitment to thoughtfully consider the Cedar Rapids project, given it was authorized in 2014 and Congress mentioned the project for prioritization in 2016. While Lieutenant General Semonite said Senator Ernst raised good points, he stated there was no guarantee that what he puts in the budget will ultimately be approved. Senator Ernst stressed that “we’ll continue working on this issue. Again, it’s very important, not just for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, but for so many of those other projects that are authorized, but continue to hang out there.” This follows a recent meeting organized by Senator Ernst with Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney on flood mitigation. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questioning of Lieutenant General Semonite. Below is the full text of Senator Ernst’s questions and Lieutenant General Semonite’s responses: Senator Ernst: “Thank you Mr. Chair, and Senator Markey, thank you for bringing up the budget. I think this is going to be an area that we really do need to work through and so my line of questioning will be a little different, but it does focus on budget and funding issues. “General, thank you for appearing for a second time in a month in front of this committee, I am greatly appreciative and I’m sure you know where my questioning will go this morning. It is really good to have you here, we’ve had many discussions over the course of the past several months. “I wanted to take the time today to just reemphasize the flood mitigation projects that we have hanging out there. One of those is in Iowa in Cedar Rapids, and thank you again for participating in those discussions with me. “On Monday, I met with OMB Director Mulvaney, alongside Senator Grassley and Congressman Blum, to talk about the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project and how important that is for our state. And I know that you’re aware of it, I appreciate your work on this with me and it’s my understanding when we visited with Director Mulvaney, it’s my understanding, that the Corps as of Monday had not yet submitted their budget to the OMB for Fiscal Year ’18. Is that correct?” Lieutenant General Semonite: “So, ma’am, we got guidance about three weeks ago. We’ve been cranking hard all the way though that and then we provided our update to the Assistant Secretary of the Army on Monday. That budget is being worked right now at the senior levels of the Army and then it will go into OMB on this Friday. That is the current timeline.” Senator Ernst: “Excellent. Thanks, General.” Lieutenant General Semonite: “So, the short answer is we have submitted it to our higher level, but it has not been submitted to the OMB.” Senator Ernst: “OK, thank you very much for that. The Cedar Rapids project was authorized in 2014 and WRDA 2016 directed the Corps to prioritize funding and expedite completion of the Cedar Rapids Project. And I also received a hand-written note from you on January 30th that said you and the Corps agree in the risk to Iowa citizens and that you will pursue all possible options to support this critical project, and I do ask that you carefully consider all of these provisions when making your determinations going forward in the budget. Will you do that?” Lieutenant General Semonite: “Yes, ma’am. Unfortunately though, as you’re probably aware, and some of the people have already highlighted this here, there could be potential cuts to the Civil Works Account based on what was in the President’s initial proposal, so we’ll have to see how that plays out and our ability to be able to then fund all of those critical priorities.” Senator Ernst: “Thank you. And will you commit to work to solve this particular issue expeditiously and to work with myself and the OMB to modify the metrics that the Corps utilizes so we can stop discounting the rural areas, such as Iowa and other Midwestern areas that have lower property values?” Lieutenant General Semonite: “Senator, you and I have talked about that in the past and you have some very good points on property values and economic values. I think we want to continue to try to make sure that the processes that are used to be able to support the priorities of the Corps budget are the same things that come back out of the budget on the other end. I can’t guarantee you, though, that what I put in the budget is necessarily what is going to ultimately be approved.” Senator Ernst: “Well, we’ll continue working on this issue. Again, it’s very important, not just for the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, but for so many of those other projects that are authorized, but continue to hang out there. So General, I thank you for your work. Thank you, Mr. Chair.”
03.29.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services’ Subcommittee on Readiness and Management Support and combat veteran, asked witnesses at the hearing what the Army is doing to drive down production costs and modernize its plants, such as the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. She also asked about the status of the critical capabilities assessment for Rock Island Arsenal. The Iowa Senator noted the critical role these facilities play in our national security, and the taxpayer savings that could result from modernizing these plants. Lieutenant General Michael Dana (USMC) shared Senator Ernst’s desire to streamline production. Additionally, Senator Ernst requested an update on when the Army would put forward a report recommended by the Government Accountability Office in 2015, listing the critical capabilities at arsenals and the workload needed to maintain those capabilities. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s questioning. On Modernizing the Iowa Ammunition Plant: Senator Ernst: “Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you gentlemen for being here and testifying today on our industrial base, and the critical role that it plays in our military readiness. “I recently visited Iowa’s Army Ammunition Plant, which is a government owned contractor operated facility in my home state and their ability to rapidly increase workload and provide a stable supply of ammunition is a key part to our national security. “However, due to their dependence on the Army to modernize the facility, their techniques - the manufacturing techniques – are behind. “This isn’t something I blame the contractor for. They’ve put forth a proposal for the Iowa Ammunition Plant that could save the Army and taxpayers $18 million per year, paying for itself in less than five years. “The cost-savings decisions currently sit with the Army, so General Wyche, this is for you: What is the Army doing to modernize its government owned, contractor operated facilities in order to help drive down price production costs and cut overhead?” Lieutenant General Wyche: “Senator, we are doing a couple things. First we’ve identified the requirements and we know that to maintain the facilities, just to keep them from being degraded, it would cost us approximately $100,000 a year. And to get them at an acceptable level, with the modernized capabilities, it would cost us another $300 million for the next ten years.” Lieutenant General Dana: “Ma’am, if I could help out my Army brother on this because they help us with ammo, I made a trip to Lake City, which is one of the large ammunition plants in the Midwest and was just fascinated by the facility. Half the facility had equipment from 1942 and I own a lot of weapons – not in DC, by the way – but I load my own ammo and if you look at how they work in the plant, it’s just like they did in 1942 with the primers and the primer powder, it’s very dangerous work. “But then the other half, cause the Army’s great initiative, is they went to automated in the plant so they retrain that workforce to go from the guys and gals who’ve been doing it 30 years one way to where they’re doing automated machinery and they’re doubling the output. One of the questions was, how can the industrial base meet that requirement for ammunition, well I think the Army’s doing a great job with that.” Senator Ernst: “And hopefully we can modernize and get to that point where we’re not losing that work force, but we’re stabilizing the supply as well as growing that supply with demand as necessary. So I appreciate that.” On Outstanding Critical Capabilities Assessment for Rock Island Arsenal: Senator Ernst: “In 2015, the GAO came forward with three recommendations to ensure we sustain the critical capabilities found at our Arsenals. “The first issue is implementing guidance for a make-or-buy analysis when it comes to DOD procurement. “The second was to identify fundamental elements of a strategic plan for the Arsenals. “And the third is to develop and implement a process for identifying critical capabilities at arsenals, and the workload needed to sustain those capabilities. “The department has concurred with all of those recommendations, but as of this morning they have not followed through with any of those recommendations or produced the reports necessary. “I’ve been through the Rock Island Arsenal and really witnessed what the men and women are doing at that arsenal to contribute to our national security. “This is taking a long time and General Wyche again, when will we see the reports that have been required, specifically the critical capabilities assessment, and guidance on make-or-buy?” Lieutenant General Wyche: “Senator, that particular area of make-or-buy, I would have to come back to you on the record with that particular answer, because I’m not prepared to answer that question.” Senator Ernst: “Okay, I would appreciate that because that is very concerning, especially to the folks at the arsenals. They’d like to see those reports as soon as possible. Thank you, thank you gentlemen.”
03.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, along with a bipartisan group of Senators and former members of the U.S.A. Gymnastics national team, held a press conference today to call on Congress to pass legislation to require the immediate reporting of suspected sexual abuse at facilities under the jurisdiction of U.S. amateur athletics governing bodies. Additionally, the bipartisan legislation would require U.S. amateur sports organizations to put policies in place to ensure the prevention of sexual abuse in the first place. Click here or on the image to watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Thank you very much, I do appreciate the opportunity to be here today and join my colleagues. Senator Feinstein and Senator Collins, thank you for your leadership on this bill. It is so important that we are supporting these brave, strong women- our young athletes. So thank you ladies for being here today. “We must send a message that we will simply not tolerate sexual assault. We won’t tolerate it in our gyms, we will not tolerate it on our college campuses, and we simply will not tolerate it in the military. “Sexual assault is a horrendous crime and we must work to ensure that there is zero tolerance for sexual assault in any facet of our society. “As my colleagues have noted, this specific bill works to combat and prevent sexual assault by strengthening mandatory reporting of sexual assault allegations, and a mandatory reporting of those sexual assault allegations, and requiring U.S. amateur sports organizations to develop and enforce policies to prevent sexual assault from happening in the first place. “There’s nothing you can do once this has happened. You can’t go back and undo it, so we have to prevent it before it ever occurs. “I am proud to support it, and I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Feinstein and the other original cosponsors of this bill and we must, absolutely must, move this forward. “I want to thank the young ladies who are here today. We appreciate your strength and determination. God bless you for being here and bringing this to light. Thank you.”

03.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement in response to the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline permit by the State Department today: “The Keystone XL pipeline project will help create good jobs for the middle class and help our nation become more energy independent by reducing our reliance on Middle Eastern oil. It is important that we continue to update and improve our nation’s energy infrastructure to support and promote economic growth and job creation. I applaud the Trump administration’s commitment to moving forward with this project that has been unnecessarily politicized, and to get our country moving again."
03.23.2017	“When I travel around the state, I engage in a 99 county tour, and I consistently hear how challenging it is to be a farmer or rancher right now, due not only to the low prices, but also because of onerous government regulations. I hope you are prepared to work with all of those who are engaged in our ag economy to ensure it remains one of the strongest in feeding and fueling our growing world.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee and chair of the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, today questioned President Trump’s nominee to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue, at his confirmation hearing. Senator Ernst began her questioning by addressing the downturn in the agricultural economy, which is hurting farmers and ranchers across Iowa, especially young and beginning farmers. Senator Ernst also addressed with Mr. Perdue the unnecessary burden of regulations, and received a commitment from the USDA nominee that he will collaborate with Administrator Pruitt of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal agencies to roll back these harmful mandates. Additionally, the Iowa Senator asked Mr. Perdue to fill the Undersecretary for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs position as directed by Congress in the 2014 Farm Bill. To view the full video of Senator Ernst’s questioning, please click here or on the image below. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s opening remarks: “Governor Perdue, thank you so much for being here today and I want to thank your lovely family for joining you as well, it’s good to see everybody here. “As some of my colleagues have already stated, the ag economy has really been in a downturn the last number of years, and a lot of our producers are hurting, especially those young and beginning farmers that have just gotten their start in the last ten years. “The renewable fuels revolution bolstered demand for our commodities, driven by the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and energy programs that were included in the Farm Bill. “Trade deals like NAFTA helped to fuel both grain and meat exports which are very vital to our producers’ profitability. “As we have seen so many times before, our farmers continue to innovate and find new ways to grow more food with fewer inputs – and have not only met this new demand, but they’ve exceeded it and done quite well – leading to the slump in commodity prices we have been feeling so acutely. “When I travel around the state, I engage in a 99 county tour, and I consistently hear how challenging it is to be a farmer or rancher right now, due not only to the low prices, but also because of onerous government regulations. “I hope you are prepared to work with all of those who are engaged in our ag economy to ensure it remains one of the strongest in feeding and fueling our growing world. “Whenever I do visit those farmers and ranchers and others within the ag community, one of the common refrains that I hear is about federal regulations, especially from the EPA, how they’re harming their operations, and making their lives pretty difficult. “Whether it’s their misguided WOTUS rule or the delays in approving ag-biotech products, the EPA almost seems to have an agenda against those that are in the agricultural community. “How will you collaborate with the EPA to ensure that their work is helping, rather than hindering, our farmers and ranchers?” “…Well I appreciate that very much and I certainly support your willingness to work with the other departments and heads of those agencies. We simply can’t operate in a vacuum and developing those relationships and keeping those relationships is very important and I think you’re the right person to do that so I appreciate that very much. I also just want to make a comment too, I know that in the 2014 Farm Bill Congress really recognized the importance of trade and Congress directed the USDA to establish an undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs and I hope that you will take a look at that and make sure that we have the right person for that job established as well. Thank you very much governor, it’s good to see you, and thank you, Mr. Chair.”
03.23.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a combat veteran, has joined a bipartisan group of Senators calling on U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis to better combat sexual harassment in the military after the exposure of nude posts of female servicemembers online in the Facebook group “Marines United” – and demanding the Pentagon develop a proactive plan to eliminate intimidation, harassment, and reprisal online and in the barracks. In addition to Senator Ernst, the letter was sent by Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Dan Sullivan of Alaska, Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Bill Nelson of Florida, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Tim Kaine of Virginia, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. “We write to you regarding reports that Active Duty and Reserve servicemembers posted degrading comments and shared nude photos of female service members on the internet,” the Senators wrote in the letter. “…We are disappointed that the Department once again must react to reports of online harassment. Despite the Pentagon’s attempts to crack down on this kind of behavior, it was not uncovered by Department of Defense personnel, but by investigative journalists… If it were not for the courage and willingness of the first reporter, a combat wounded Marine Corps veteran, the contemptable treatment of female service members would have likely continued unnoticed to the public. The lack of success of the Department of Defense’s efforts to curb servicemember involvement in these kinds of groups before it became a serious problem demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the way that military leaders view and address the problem of online harassment.” The Senators’ letter continues: “As a result of our strong concern regarding this issue, we ask what proactive steps the Department of Defense will take to discover and eliminate all forms of servicemembers’ online harassment. We understand that this may be a daunting challenge, however you must agree that commanders bear the weight of attempting to address and remove all sources of intimidation, harassment, or reprisal whether online or in the barracks. The military, which instills values of integrity, courage, loyalty, and honor in all those who serve, has a responsibility to all servicemembers to eliminate degrading behavior online long before it affects unit cohesion and readiness. We appreciate your attention to this important matter and look forward to your response.” Full text of the letter HERE and below: March 22, 2017 Dear Secretary Mattis, We write to you regarding reports that Active Duty and Reserve servicemembers posted degrading comments and shared nude photos of female service members on the internet. We appreciate the commitment of military leadership to address this important issue; however, this is not the first time the Department has dealt with this kind of inappropriate behavior of service members. We are disappointed that the Department once again must react to reports of online harassment. Despite the Pentagon’s attempts to crack down on this kind of behavior, it was not uncovered by Department of Defense personnel, but by investigative journalists. Moreover, the online harassment recently perpetrated through Facebook groups like Marines United, and websites used by Navy personnel to share photos of female sailors from at least 12 commands, continue derogatory trends the Department should have addressed after witnessing them within the US Military Academy’s men’s rugby team email scandal and the Facebook group Just the Tip of the Spear. If it were not for the courage and willingness of the first reporter, a combat wounded Marine Corps veteran, the contemptable treatment of female service members would have likely continued unnoticed to the public. The lack of success of the Department of Defense’s efforts to curb servicemember involvement in these kinds of groups before it became a serious problem demonstrates a fundamental flaw in the way that military leaders view and address the problem of online harassment. Although the existence of online behavior dedicated to harassment and intimidation of females by their peers is a societal problem, in a military environment, it represents a clear threat to good order and discipline required by a highly successful military. As a result of our strong concern regarding this issue, we ask what proactive steps the Department of Defense will take to discover and eliminate all forms of servicemembers’ online harassment. We understand that this may be a daunting challenge, however you must agree that commanders bear the weight of attempting to address and remove all sources of intimidation, harassment, or reprisal whether online or in the barracks. The military, which instills values of integrity, courage, loyalty, and honor in all those who serve, has a responsibility to all servicemembers to eliminate degrading behavior online long before it affects unit cohesion and readiness. We appreciate your attention to this important matter and look forward to your response. Sincerely, Claire McCaskill Jack Reed Deb Fischer Joni K. Ernst Dan Sullivan Bill Nelson Jeanne Shaheen Kirsten E. Gillibrand Richard Blumenthal Tim Kaine Martin Heinrich Elizabeth Warren
03.21.2017	WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced they are relaunching the Senate Albanian Issues Caucus. Peters and Ernst, who will serve as co-Chairs of the caucus, also met with Albanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ditmir Bushati today. The Senate Albanian Issues Caucus will help to facilitate dialogue on critical issues facing the Albanian American community and countries in Southeast Europe with significant Albanian populations. “Albania is a key American ally and a valued member of the international community that is committed to advancing democracy and enacting critical reforms. I am proud to represent one of the largest populations of Albanian Americans in the United States, and their strong contributions to Michigan’s economy and culture are a testament to the pride Albanian Americans take in their heritage,” said Senator Peters. “I look forward to working with Senator Ernst to reaffirm the deep bonds between the American and Albanian people and support democratic rights for Albanians in Balkan nations.” “It is crucial that we continue to strengthen our relationships with our allies in Southeast Europe,” said Senator Ernst. “It was wonderful to visit with Minister Bushati today, and as co-chair of the Senate Albanian Issues Caucus along with Senator Peters, I look forward to further discussions about how we can best support the advancement of our shared goals and mutual interests.”
03.21.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, called on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address the failures of the Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) outlined in a new report from the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General. The VCL is available to veterans experiencing suicidal thoughts, or concerned friends and family, to connect with VA responders through a 24-hour hotline, online chat, or text. The report found that the VCL failed to meet the recommendations that the OIG issued in 2016, and continues to inadequately respond to veterans’ urgent needs. “The 2016 report regarding the Veterans Crisis Line revealed a failure to uphold the promises made to our veterans, and it is quite frankly completely unacceptable that many of these recommendations have yet to be enacted,” said Senator Ernst. “When a veteran is experiencing suicidal thoughts, or a concerned loved one reaches out to the Veterans Crisis Line, it is because the situation has reached a breaking point and a veteran’s life is in danger. The VA cannot continue to take this halfhearted approach when it comes to implementing the recommendations identified by the inspector general more than a year ago. “I urge VA Secretary Shulkin to address this issue immediately. We must fix this severely flawed system to ensure Iowa’s veterans, and veterans across the country, have timely access to the care they need and deserve.”
03.21.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and U.S. Representative Michael McCaul (R-Texas) today introduced legislation to support young people in agriculture by creating a tax exemption for the first $5,000 of income students 18 years of age or younger earn from projects completed through 4-H or FFA. Their bills, the Agriculture Students Encourage, Acknowledge, Reward, Nurture (EARN) Act (S. 671) and the Student Agriculture Protection Act (SAPA) (H.R. 1626), enable students to keep more of the modest income they earn, which can then be invested in education savings or future agricultural projects. “With the number of new farmers trending downward and more mouths to feed than ever across the globe, Congress must support young people who are interested in a career in agriculture,” Sen. Moran said. “This bill is one step we can take to encourage those involved in FFA and 4-H to turn their modest income from the agricultural projects into savings, money for education and training, or toward a future project. Farming kids across the country represent the future of a critical industry and way of life, and this legislation represents an important investment in the next generation.” “Ensuring members of student organizations like 4-H and FFA are afforded every opportunity to succeed is not only important for the student’s future, but the future of our nation’s agriculture,” said Sen. Ernst, a former member of the 4-H. “I’m proud to support the Agriculture Students EARN Act to allow our future farmers to gain valuable experience and skills through hands-on projects. By investing in our students’ futures, we are investing in the next generation of our nation’s leaders that will be on the forefront of agricultural innovation and production for years to come.” “We must do more to encourage our future farmers to stay in the farming business so our country can maintain a secure and steady food supply,” said Rep. McCaul. “These students across the nation today represent the future of agriculture, and enabling them to succeed means we all succeed. That is why I am proud to reintroduce the Student Agriculture Protection Act. This bill would eliminate unnecessary barriers for our young farmers to ensure the U.S. remains outfitted with innovative minds that have allowed us to be the world leader in the agricultural industry.” “Recruiting and retaining the next generation of young people to the family farm or to other agricultural pursuits starts here; it starts with legislation like the Agriculture Students EARN Act and the Student Agriculture Protection Act,” said National FFA Western Region Vice President Trey Elizondo. “This proposal would undoubtedly enable me and other agricultural education students to strengthen agriculture and support the communities in which we live. My generation is ready to accept the challenge of feeding, clothing, and sheltering our world, and this legislation helps us accept that challenge.” Typical 4-H and FFA projects include showing animals at local and state fairs, growing and harvesting crops, building agricultural mechanic projects and many others. Ag Students EARN would lower the tax burden on the students and give them an opportunity to invest more of what they’ve earned in future projects, college funds or savings accounts. Supporters of the legislation include National FFA Organization, National 4-H Council, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers Union and National Young Farmers Coalition.
03.21.2017	“The people spoke last November, and our new president has put forward a well-respected nominee who the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. It’s time for Washington to work together – as our constituents expect us to do – to help protect and defend our co-equal branches of government and the rule of law. “…I have had the great honor of meeting with Judge Gorsuch to learn more about his judicial philosophy, and over the next few days, the American people will also get to learn more about Judge Gorsuch through his confirmation hearing. I’m confident they will also determine that he is qualified to serve on our nation’s highest court.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today spoke on the floor of the Senate about United States Supreme Court Justice nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Click here or on the image below to watch the Senator’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: “Mr. President. “I rise today to commend President Trump for selecting such an eminently qualified nominee in Judge Neil Gorsuch to be Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. “No one can dispute the academic credentials and intellectual rigor of Judge Gorsuch. In fact, even a former acting solicitor general under President Obama, Neal Katyal, has called Judge Gorsuch ‘one of the most thoughtful and brilliant judges to have served our nation over the last century.’ Just yesterday, he joined the Republican and Democrat Senators from Colorado in introducing Judge Gorsuch at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Judge Gorsuch graduated with honors from Columbia University and then Harvard Law School. He later earned a Doctorate in Legal Philosophy from the University of Oxford. Prior to becoming a judge, Neil Gorsuch was Principal Deputy to the Associate Attorney General and Acting Associate Attorney General at the Department of Justice, worked as a litigator in private practice, and served as a law clerk to Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy. “Moreover, earlier this month, the American Bar Association’s Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Judge Gorsuch ‘Well Qualified’ – its highest rating. “One of my constituents who went to high school with Judge Gorsuch took the time to send me a note in support of his character, calling him ‘the most reasonable, smart, principled, kind, and humble person I know.’ Even at a young age, he made a positive impression on his colleagues – something he has continued to do to today. “During the course of Judge Gorsuch’s ten-year judicial career, his opinions have reflected not only his outstanding legal acumen, but also his respect for the Constitution and a Scalia-like ability to explain his decisions. “Judge Gorsuch was nominated to his current position on the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit by President George W. Bush in 2006. As a testament to Judge Gorsuch’s exceptional credentials, the Senate confirmed him by unanimous voice vote. Several current members of the Senate from both parties – including Minority Leader Schumer – supported Judge Gorsuch’s confirmation. “The people spoke last November, and our new president has put forward a well-respected nominee who the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. “It’s time for Washington to work together – as our constituents expect us to do – to help protect and defend our co-equal branches of government and the rule of law. “From what I have seen, if confirmed, Judge Gorsuch’s dedication to interpreting the text of the Constitution and statutes as they are written – rather than attempting to legislate from the bench – will help to do just that. “As Judge Gorsuch himself has stated in one of his opinions, ‘a judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge, reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.’ “I have had the great honor of meeting with Judge Gorsuch to learn more about his judicial philosophy, and over the next few days, the American people will also get to learn more about Judge Gorsuch through his confirmation hearing. I’m confident they will also determine that he is qualified to serve on our nation’s highest court. “I look forward to moving ahead to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with this eminently-qualified nominee, and I thank him for his willingness to serve his country in this critically important role. “Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.”
03.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today Senator Ernst joined 22 senators in a bipartisan letter urging President Trump to maintain the point of obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and reject proposed changes that would upend the current successful system. “We believe such changes are unwarranted and indefensible,” the senators wrote to Trump. “We appreciate the commitment you have made to support the RFS. We strongly urge you to steer clear of administrative changes to the policy that would undermine the program and run contrary to your goals of promoting domestic energy independence and more choices at the pump. We look forward to working with you to ensure the RFS continues to provide the stability and predictability that is creating jobs and economic growth across the country.” The senators outlined the detrimental effects of changing the point of obligation from refiners to blenders, marketers or retailers, as one prominent refiner is suggesting. Shifting the point of obligation would give refiners little incentive to produce necessary fuel blends, making it difficult for downstream entities to comply, the senators wrote. Changing the point of obligation also would “result in a massive, costly, time-consuming shift in compliance” because small businesses, especially in rural areas, lack the resources needed to comply. The program administration would become complicated and “unnecessarily result in significant uncertainty and market disruptions,” the senators wrote. Such a change is widely opposed -- by fuel marketers, retailers, truck stop operators, petroleum producers and renewable fuel producers -- because of the added complexity and the undermining of investments that businesses have made to comply, the senators wrote. “The overwhelming majority of transportation fuel market participants oppose any change to the point of obligation because it would cause massive disruptions and could lead to higher prices for consumers,” the letter states. Signing the letter in addition to Senator Ernst are Sens. Chuck Grassley, Amy Klobuchar, Debbie Stabenow, Roy Blunt, Heidi Heitkamp, John Thune, Brian Schatz, John Hoeven, Claire McCaskill, Tammy Duckworth, Sheldon Whitehouse, Richard Durbin, Edward Markey, Al Franken, Joe Donnelly, Tammy Baldwin, Jack Reed, Mazie Hirono, Gary Peters, Jeanne Shaheen, Jeff Merkley and Michael Bennet. The senators’ letter is available here.
03.15.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed former U.S. Senator from Indiana, Dan Coats, to be Director of National Intelligence: “As a former Congressman, Senator, and U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Dan Coats has extensive experience with issues of national security. While in Congress, he was actively engaged in enhancing our counterintelligence and counterterrorism, and he knows what it takes to keep Americans safe at home and abroad. Dan has admirably served our great nation, and I look forward to his continued leadership in this new role.”
03.14.2017	“As reports continue to come in across the DOD, it’s clear that this seems to be Service-wide. This is Service-wide. And so we need a Service-wide approach to addressing this issue. This is a cultural problem not just in our military, but society at large. … Illegal or not, members of our community need to know this type of activity creates a culture that leads to sexual assault. … There is absolutely no excuse for this – especially for those who wear our nation’s uniform.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, expressed her disgust and disappointment over the reports regarding the “Marines United” website at today’s committee hearing. Additionally, Ernst stressed that this is a cultural problem in our society and military, and urged General Robert B. Neller, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps, to implement the urgent necessary changes needed after telling him members of the Committee stood ready to help. Click here or on the image below to watch the Senator’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s opening remarks: “Thank you Mr. Chair. “Those who participated in these disgusting and horrible actions have not only failed our Marine Corps, they’ve failed the men and women who wish to join your ranks – and they have failed our country. “I’m not as eloquent as some of the other members on this panel, all I can do is express to you how disappointed I am. I’m very disappointed. “General Neller, I hope that you can convey the concerns you’ve delivered to this committee today directly to your Marines, not through a press conference, not through your designees, but directly to as many Marines as you possibly can. Implementing change to this type of behavior begins at the ground level. And you are a leader, sir. “As reports continue to come in across the DOD, it’s clear that this seems to be Service-wide. This is Service-wide. And so we need a Service-wide approach to addressing this issue. This is a cultural problem not just in our military, but society at large. “Hearing that many individuals were not surprised about these reports disappoints me – hearing that there may not be a way to hold many of the people that were involved in this accountable, that angers me. “Illegal or not, members of our community need to know this type of activity creates a culture that leads to sexual assault. Those that sat complacently by as this unfolded – from the NCO’s to the Officers – are all contributing to this issue. “There is no excuse, and you have stated that General Neller, I appreciate that greatly. There is absolutely no excuse for this – especially for those who wear our nation’s uniform. “The steps that you now take, moving forward, following this event will define each of us before this committee. “Regardless of what legal or administrative action you are able to take, I hope this leads to you personally sitting down, and you Sergeant Major as well, sitting down and educating our Marines. “A social media handbook has been discussed by a number of folks here on the panel, but how many Marines actually read that? How many sit down and read it? It is up to all of us to educate our Marines. “The Marine Corps has a high turnover rate. We have thousands of Marines coming through every year and we have to make all of them aware of what they represent. “They need to know that the actions they take here at home and online can take away from the success of their brothers and their sisters in arms. “This is an absolute issue that impacts our entire society, it is an absolutely horrible issue impacting us, but it’s one that we must stop. And I say we, it’s not just the Marine Corps, it’s those of us that are sitting here today. “We will be evaluating how to give you the right tools, the necessary tools to combat this issue and, absolutely, you must hold those Marines accountable. “In the meantime, I hope that you will continue to evaluate what we need to do to combat this issue, not just in the Marine Corps, but Service-wide and what we need to do to impact it in society at large. “Thank you Mr. Chair.”

03.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with the full Iowa delegation, received notice from the U.S. Air National Guard that the RC-26 aircraft will remain based in Iowa at this time. The RC-26 aircraft is designed to counter drug trafficking and assist in counterterrorism efforts, and plays an important role in the Iowa Counterdrug Task Force. In a November 17, 2016, letter led by Senator Ernst, along with Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Congressmen Rod Blum (R-01), Dave Loebsack (D-02), David Young (R-03), and Steve King (R-04), the delegation urged the Air National Guard to provide due consideration in determining whether or not the plane would remain stationed at the Des Moines Airport in Iowa. Their letter stressed the value of the RC-26 to the Iowa Counterdrug Task Force, citing that “the RC-26 aircraft has flown over 35 flight hours, including missions for 10 federal and state agencies, and helped seize over $566,900 dollars in methamphetamine in Fiscal Year (FY) 2016. In FY2015, it helped seize 20 illegal weapons, over $500,000 in methamphetamine, and $4,000 in heroin.” Following the notice that the RC-26 aircraft will continue being based in Iowa, members of the delegation issued the following statements: “The RC-26 aircraft has been of invaluable service to the Iowa Air National Guard and law enforcement in completing a number of missions, including the combating of illegal drug trafficking,” said Ernst, a combat veteran. “I am pleased to know that Iowa law enforcement can continue to partner with the Iowa Air National Guard to enhance our efforts to fight illicit drugs and threats to our homeland.” “This is great news,” said Grassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Caucus on International Narcotics Control. “I appreciate Lieutenant General Rice’s assuring me that this aircraft will remain in Iowa. Protecting the homeland and fighting illicit drugs are public safety concerns that are among the government’s core responsibilities. This aircraft has proven its value to law enforcement, and I look forward to further achievements in the future.” “I am pleased that the U.S. Air National Guard will continue to base its RC-26 aircraft in Iowa, which helps the Iowa National Guard respond to disaster relief efforts. With Iowa’s history of flooding, as well as the recent devastating storms that recently ravaged communities like Muscatine, Seymour and Centerville, this ‘eye in the sky’ helps coordinate efforts on the ground in the event of a natural disaster,” said Loebsack. “I am both pleased and encouraged to learn that the U.S. Air National Guard will continue to base the RC-26 aircraft in Iowa,” said King. “Its overwhelming success in both countering illegal drug trafficking and abetting counterterrorism efforts is undeniable and has proven invaluable to our Iowa law enforcement in the Iowa Counterdrug Task Force.” To read the November 17, 2016, letter from the Iowa Delegation to Lieutenant General L.

03.09.2017	WASHINGTON – A bipartisan group of Senators, led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, is expressing the need to protect and encourage whistleblowers who shine light on fraud, waste and mismanagement in government. In a letter today to 18 federal agencies, 11 members of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus are calling on government leaders to promote a culture that welcomes whistleblower disclosures and condemns attacks on whistleblower rights. “All Americans are better off when whistleblowers step forward and report misconduct without fear of retaliation. Consistent with your statutory responsibilities, we ask that you remind employees at your agency about their ability to make protected disclosures in accordance with whistleblower protection laws. We also ask that you remind all incoming employees and managers that retaliation against whistleblowers will not be tolerated,” the senators said in the letter. Dating back to the nation’s earliest days, whistleblowers have played a valuable role in identifying flaws in government. However, they often face reprisal from within their own ranks for calling attention to waste, fraud and mismanagement. In the letter today, the senators reference policies protecting employees who disclose problems in government, either through their chain of command or to Congress. The senators also call on agency leaders to remind employees of procedures for making protected disclosures as well as protections in place to prevent and respond to retaliation. Joining Grassley on the letter are senators Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.) and Tom Carper (D-Del.). The cosigners are all members of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus. The caucus raises awareness of the need for adequate protections against retaliation for private sector and government employees who call attention to wrongdoing. The caucus’ mission is to foster bipartisan discussion on legislative issues affecting the treatment of whistleblowers and serve as a clearinghouse for current information on whistleblower developments as well as best practices for responding to whistleblower disclosures and claims of retaliation. The letters were sent to the following agencies: U.S. Department of Agriculture U.S. Department of Commerce U.S. Department of Education U.S. Department of Energy U.S. Environmental Protection Agency U.S. Department of Health and Human Services U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development U.S. Department of Justice U.S. Department of Labor U.S. Small Business Administration U.S. Department of State U.S. Department of the Treasury U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of the United States Trade Representative U.S. Office of Management and Budget U.S. Department of Homeland Security Full text of the letter follow: March 09, 2017 Dear [Agency Leader]: Whistleblowers play a vital role in helping the government identify and resolve issues of waste, fraud, and abuse, and they are crucial for Congress in the exercise of its constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities. Since the beginning days of our nation, our Founding Fathers recognized that whistleblowers are essential to ensuring that government is functioning properly and efficiently. As early as July 30, 1778, “in demonstration of their full support for whistleblowers,” the Continental Congress unanimously approved legislation recognizing “the duty of all persons in the service of the United States” to inform “Congress or other proper authorit[ies]” of wrongdoing.[1] Today, we continue to recognize this important responsibility. President George H. W. Bush, in his October 17, 1990 Executive Order 12731, stated plainly that federal employees “shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.”[2] As members of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, we enthusiastically echo these historical precedents in our support for individuals who shine a light on waste, fraud, and abuse. We believe that it is in your agency’s best interest, and the taxpayers’ best interest, to do the same, and to openly recognize and wholeheartedly support the duty and value of whistleblowers. Whistleblowers are assets, and they can help us enhance government efficiency and transparency and save taxpayers billions of dollars. To encourage these individuals to bring problems to the surface so that they may be addressed, Congress enacted and has since strengthened federal laws that protect them from reprisal for lawful, good faith disclosures of potential wrongdoing. It is a prohibited personnel practice to retaliate against an employee for “any disclosure of information . . . which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences (i) any violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or (ii) gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.”[3] Protections from reprisal also extend to employees of contractors, subcontractors, grantees, and subgrantees.[4] These statutes protect whistleblowers who report wrongdoing internally to a supervisor—as a significant majority do—so that their management has an opportunity to address it. They also protect whistleblowers who choose to report outside of their chain of command due to real fears of reprisal by their management. In either case, these brave men and women perform an invaluable public service. That service is equally valuable and necessary when whistleblowers disclose waste, fraud, and abuse to Congress. Congress relies on these individuals working within agencies to provide the information necessary “to give effect to the checks and balances that are essential to the separation of powers.”[5] Accordingly, title 5, Section 7211 provides that the right of federal employees to furnish information to committees of Congress may not be interfered with or denied.[6] Officials or employees who do interfere with that right are not entitled to compensation.[7] Despite these protections, whistleblowers still often face intimidation, retaliation, and prohibited personnel practices. Therefore it is essential that agency leadership, from the top down, promotes an open culture for employees to make disclosures and takes swift action against any employee who violates a whistleblower’s rights. All Americans are better off when whistleblowers step forward and report misconduct without fear of retaliation. Consistent with your statutory responsibilities, we ask that you remind employees at your agency about their ability to make protected disclosures in accordance with whistleblower protection laws.[8] We also ask that you remind all incoming employees and managers that retaliation against whistleblowers will not be tolerated. Over the past several years the members of the Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus have endeavored to increase protections for whistleblowers and bring awareness to issues of retaliation. We will continue this work in the current Congress and will continue oversight of the executive branch’s implementation and enforcement of whistleblower protections. We appreciate your assistance and look forward to working with you. Sincerely, Senator Claire McCaskill Senator Chuck E. Grassley Senator Ron Wyden Senator Thom Tillis Senator Tammy Baldwin Senator Joni K. Ernst Senator Tom Carper Senator John Boozman Senator Ed Markey Senator Ron Johnson Senator Gary Peters [1] S.

03.09.2017	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senators Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), combat veteran, re-introduced the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act Wednesday. The bill is named for Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick, a whistleblower from the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Tomah, Wis., who took his own life after being fired for questioning excessive prescription practices at the facility. Dr. Kirkpatrick’s brother, Sean, testified at a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing in September 2015 about the retaliation his brother faced after blowing the whistle about the wrongdoing at the Tomah facility. This bill implements a number of suggestions he made at the hearing to improve whistleblower protections throughout the VA. “Individuals who expose wrongdoing at VA medical facilities should be thanked and listened to, not silenced and subject to mistreatment,” Sen. Johnson said. “I’m pleased to partner with Sen. Ernst to ensure future whistleblowers like Dr. Kirkpatrick receive the support they deserve.” “This commonsense legislation would help to safeguard whistleblowers who speak up about corruption and mistreatment in our VA system, and take additional steps to hold retaliators responsible,” said Senator Ernst. “Efforts to fix the VA must be protected, not punished, as we work to improve access to timely and quality care for our nation’s veterans.” The legislation will strengthen penalties for those who retaliate against whistleblowers, add protections for probationary period employees, and ensure federal employees have a greater knowledge of whistleblower protections. The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act unanimously in May 2016.

03.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced President Trump’s Associate Attorney General nominee, Rachel L. Brand of Pella, Iowa, to the Senate Judiciary Committee at her confirmation hearing. Click here or the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: Thank you, Chairman Grassley. It is my privilege to be here today to introduce a native Iowan, Rachel Brand, who has been nominated to be Associate Attorney General of the United States. After graduating from Pella Christian High School in Pella, Iowa and the University of Minnesota-Morris, Ms. Brand went on to receive her law degree from Harvard Law School. After law school, Ms. Brand embarked on an impressive legal career in both private practice and public practice. In fact, she has at one time or another served in all three branches of government – she was previously confirmed by the Senate as Assistant Attorney General for Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, and before that, she clerked for Justice Kennedy on the Supreme Court of the United States. And perhaps the most prestigious of all – she worked as an intern for Senator Grassley. In addition to her public service, Ms. Brand has had a distinguished career in private practice, has taught as an adjunct law professor, and serves as a board member for Doorways for Women and Families – an organization dedicated to creating pathways out of homelessness, domestic violence, and sexual assault. Ms. Brand has shown time and time again a commitment to public service, and if she is confirmed, it is my understanding that she will be the first woman to serve the country as Associate Attorney General of the United States. I am honored to be here today to support her for this position, and I look forward to what I hope will be a speedy approval of her nomination. Thank you, Chairman Grassley.
03.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement on the Trump Administration's executive order entitled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States”: “Here in the United States, we are a nation of immigrants; from all parts of the world and all religions. Our diversity is our strength. However, at the same time, we absolutely must remain vigilant in our efforts to protect our homeland. “A core function of the federal government is to ensure we keep our nation safe and secure. At a time of increased threats at home and abroad, it is important to reevaluate the quality and adequacy of the vetting processes we rely on for our refugee and visa programs. I am continuing to review the president’s order, but I am pleased that it does not include Iraqis who have supported U.S. military efforts. “Nevertheless, we must remain mindful that the key to addressing the current humanitarian crisis is by devising and executing a strategy to destroy ISIS. With this in mind, I look forward to hearing more about the counter ISIS plan from the Trump administration and hope it better engages our allies, correctly utilizes Special Operations Forces, and includes a global approach that is required to defeat and destroy ISIS in all parts of the world.”
03.06.2017	Washington—Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), Catherine Cortez-Masto (D-Nev.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.) and Todd Young (R-Ind.) today introduced legislation to require amateur athletics governing bodies to immediately report sex-abuse allegations to local or federal law enforcement, or a child-welfare agency designated by the Justice Department. The bill stems from recent allegations of sexual abuse made against personnel involved with USA Gymnastics, USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo. The bill would also amend the Ted Stevens Amateur and Olympic Sports Act, which governs amateur athletics governing bodies, to make it safe and easy for victims to report abuse and mandate oversight of member gymnasiums to ensure strong sexual-abuse prevention policies are implemented. For example, USA Gymnastics would implement and enforce policies to ensure coaches and personnel are trained in sexual abuse prevention. “Sexual abuse stays with victims their entire lives. Amateur athletic governing bodies, coaches, and personnel have a special obligation to do all they can to protect young athletes in their care,” said Senator Feinstein. “All allegations of sex abuse must be promptly reported to local or federal law enforcement. Otherwise, they may not be treated with the seriousness that’s required.” “Sexual abuse is a heinous crime that must be eradicated in every corner of our society,” said Senator Collins. “I have long worked to prevent sexual assault and ensure that survivors have access to the resources and support they need. By requiring amateur athletic governing organizations to promptly report every allegation of sexual abuse to the proper authorities, this legislation will help survivors receive justice and protect more people from becoming victims.” “Sexual abuse should never be tolerated. This bill helps to protect young athletes from such heinous crimes, and establishes a structure to help victims safely report abuses, which must then be relayed to the authorities,” said Senator Grassley. “It also requires oversight of the training facilities to ensure that policies preventing sexual abuse are being taken seriously.” “As a former prosecutor, I’ve seen firsthand how child sexual abuse can destroy lives. Amateur athletes deserve better protection from this terrible crime,” said Senator Klobuchar. “Our bipartisan legislation would help ensure that the governing organizations, coaches, and trainers who are closest to these young athletes are actively reporting sexual abuse crimes to law enforcement in order to punish abusers and prevent these acts from happening in the first place.” “When parents entrust their children to these programs and coaches, there should be no doubt that they will be safe and protected from predators,” said Senator McCaskill. “What happened to these kids under the watch of USA Gymnastics coaches is sickening, and these predators need to be held fully accountable.” “There is absolutely no room for sexual assault. This legislation safeguards our athletes by strengthening mandatory reporting of sexual assault allegations and requiring amateur sports organizations to develop and enforce policies to prevent these horrendous crimes from happening in the first place,” said Senator Ernst. “Combatting and preventing sexual assault is a bipartisan issue, and we must work to ensure there is zero tolerance for sexual assault in all facets of our society.” “All children have the right to be protected from abuse and protected when reporting abuse. The revelations about USA Gymnastics turning a blind eye to our most vulnerable young athletes were heartbreaking,” said Senator Harris. “The systemic disregard by officials to report instances of abuse must be addressed. We must compel amateur athletic organizations to immediately report abusers to law-enforcement, and create protected environments for children to thrive. This legislation is a critical step forward.” “This will force the U.S. Olympic Committee and their national athletic governing bodies to do something they should have been doing all along: developing and enforcing strict policies that protect athletes from sexual abuse,” said Senator Nelson. “It’s inexcusable that responsible adults looked the other way while terrible crimes were committed.” “There should be no excuse for anyone—particularly those in positions of authority and who are entrusted with the safety and well-being of young athletes—to fail to report the sexual abuse of children and young adults,” said Senator Rubio. “Recent revelations about the USA Gymnastics program are deeply troubling, and it’s clear we must do more to strengthen protections for young athletes, ensure victims receive justice, and hold predators accountable.” The bill is supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), National Children’s Alliance, Rights4Girls, University of Utah Law Professor Paul Cassell, Child Sex Crime Victims’ Lawyer James Marsh, Crime Victims Expert Steve Twist, National Crime Victims Center, National Association of VOCA Administrators, Child USA, National Organization for Victim Assistance, ToPrevail, ChampionWomen, National Children Advocacy Center, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, and Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Statements from victims and supporters: Jeannette Antolin, member of the USA Gymnastics National Team and abuse victim: “I appreciate Senator Feinstein and her colleagues taking a horrendous tragedy and creating crucial change to protect future athletes. By implementing such change, I feel like my pain can finally have a voice!” Mattie Larson, member of the USA Gymnastics National Team and abuse victim: “I am so grateful that individuals in a position of power have listened to my story and is making sure that what happened to me won’t happen to future athletes.” Jessica Howard, member of the USA Gymnastics National Team and abuse victim: “The culture of abuse in gymnastics, the tacit permission for emotional, psychological and physical abuse cloaked in obfuscation and denial creates an environment where sexual abuse can occur with impunity. This, sadly, was my experience. Sadder still is that this culture has been generationally perpetuated at an institutional level. The abuse must stop now. With proper legislation, we can make the changes necessary to ensure that children will be free to follow their dreams in an environment free of abuse.” John F. Clark, president and CEO of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children: “As President and CEO of the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, we know that protecting children and providing safe spaces for them to learn, play and grow is central to the mission of every youth-serving organization, including sports organizations. We believe that the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act will go a long way in protecting youth who participate in elite sports, so we are proud to lend our support to Senators Dianne Feinstein, Charles Grassley and all the other sponsors of this important legislation.” Rebecca O’Connor, vice president of public policy, RAINN: “This legislation is an important step to ensuring that allegations of sexual abuse of elite amateur athletes are taken seriously and acted upon swiftly. In supporting this legislation, we will work with Senator Feinstein and other members of the Senate to protect children from this abuse.” Mai Fernandez, executive director of the National Center for Victims of Crime: “This legislation will provide important protections and remedies for young athletes. We applaud Senator Feinstein for her efforts to ensure that athletes can train and compete in an atmosphere free of sexual abuse.” Nancy Hogshead-Makar, J.D., three-time Olympic gold medalist, CEO of Champion Women: “Senator Feinstein’s bold step is a simple one: requiring that the U.S. Olympic Committee and the national governing bodies of each sport shield athletes from sexually abusive coaches. For years these organizations have argued that the Sports Act prevented them from protecting athletes. This new legislation eliminates the legal gap that resulted in severe harm to thousands of young athletes over decades.” Marci Hamilton, J.D., CEO and academic director, CHILD USA: “No longer is reporting abuse in sports left solely to the states. By requiring all coaches and adults associated with a national governing body to report sexual abuse, this bill goes a long way toward changing the culture of sport. Many thanks to Senator Feinstein for her leadership in the fight to protect children.” Teresa Huizar, executive director, National Children’s Alliance: “Coaches and sporting federations wield immense power in the lives of child athletes, whether they train to excel at their chosen sports as a pastime or to represent America among nations on the Olympic stage. Some predators seeking close contact with children enter the ranks of amateur sports, where children and parents trust coaches and doctors to help them achieve their Olympic dreams. Senator Feinstein’s bill, the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse Act, would help protect child athletes from abuse and hold sporting federations accountable for providing child protection and appropriate oversight of the conduct of coaches and other professionals.”
03.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed former Texas Governor Rick Perry to be Secretary of the United States Department of Energy: “As governor of one of the largest energy producing states in the country, Mr. Perry has shown he has the experience needed to promote energy independence and job creation. I look forward to working with Mr. Perry toward an energy strategy that provides reliable, sustainable and affordable energy to American families and businesses, and supports the mission of our national laboratories. I will continue to emphasize to this administration, as I did in my meeting with Mr. Perry, the need for the development of wind energy and renewable fuels to be part of this equation.”
03.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Dr. Ben Carson to be Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development: “Dr. Carson has first-hand knowledge about the importance of building strong communities and the need for affordable housing for all Americans. Washington must work together to foster economic development and stability in the market. I look forward to working with this administration to build and strengthen our rural communities across the U.S.”
03.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) sent a bipartisan letter to Secretary of Defense James Mattis, expressing support for the creation of an Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative (APSI) to expand multi-national exercises, infrastructure, critical munitions, and U.S. ground, air and maritime forces in the Asia-Pacific. Facing a growing array of threats in the region, the senators wrote: “We remain concerned with the eroding military balance resulting from a resource-constrained U.S. defense budget, the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) two-decade military modernization, a resurgent Russia expanding fighter and bomber aviation into the Pacific, and a belligerent North Korea wherein Kim Jong-un has detonated more nuclear weapons and tested more missiles than both his father and grandfather, combined. Moreover, we are also concerned with the continued rise of terrorist groups.” The senators added: “An Asia-Pacific-focused initiative like the APSI will show both allies and adversaries that the U.S. remains committed to ensuring peace and security in a region that contains the world’s three largest economies, four most populous countries, six of the world’s largest armies, and five of the seven U.S. mutual defense agreements.” Other signatories to the letter include Senators Maize Hirono (D-HI), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Todd Young (R-IN). A copy of the full letter is available here.
03.02.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today met with President Trump's nominee to be U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), Mr. Robert Lighthizer. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “With Iowa leading the nation in pork, corn, egg, and soybean production, it is key for our state that we work to maintain and strengthen existing trade agreements and pursue new ones. Throughout my 99 county tour in Iowa, I hear from farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers who agree that we must seek an aggressive trade policy, so that Iowans are able to sell their goods competitively in the global market. “Recently, I encouraged President Trump to address trade barriers over pork and beef with Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Today, I emphasized to Mr. Lighthizer the importance of fighting for increased access to agricultural markets around the world. “While I am a strong proponent of aggressive trade enforcement against countries like China and Mexico, I encouraged Mr. Lighthizer to work to find ways to mitigate risks of any retaliatory measures directed at U.S. agricultural exports like corn and soybeans. “It was a thorough discussion, and I look forward to continuing to vet him for this position and ensuring he will focus on trade priorities important to Iowans."
03.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW), shed light on the urgent need for proper flood control and infrastructure in Cedar Rapids, and as well as in places like Des Moines and Cedar Falls, at today’s EPW hearing entitled, “Flood Control Infrastructure: Safety Questions Raised by Current Events.” The committee heard from several witnesses, including Senator Ernst’s guest and the Mayor of Cedar Rapids, Ron Corbett, as well as Lieutenant General Todd T. Semonite, the Chief of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The Iowa Senator had the opportunity to introduce Mayor Corbett to the committee, where she applauded his hard work guiding the city through the critical improvements over the years: “Mayor Corbett has been working tirelessly on behalf of the citizens of Cedar Rapids, securing state and local funding to rebuild his community after the 2008 flood – and what they have done is truly impressive. But critical assistance from the Corps is also needed to complete Cedar Rapids’ Flood Risk Management Project and this is something Mayor Corbett has been leading the charge on for years now.” Additionally, Senator Ernst called attention to the difficult position the Cedar Rapids community has been placed in due to incomplete flood mitigation projects: “Cedar Rapids and communities across my state are in need of Corps assistance but have run into hurdles trying to navigate the bureaucracy within the Corps and OMB [Office of Management and Budget]. They just point fingers at each other and it is an issue that we’re trying to work through and resolve, not just for the people of Cedar Rapids, but for many communities across the state of Iowa and the nation. The city of Des Moines also has important levee work that needs to be done and Cedar Falls has been working on a 408 permit application that still isn’t approved.” Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s opening remarks to the committee in full. Late last year, Senator Ernst met with the Corps to discuss the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, and today she reemphasized those concerns to General Semonite. Additionally, Senator Ernst stressed the need to review the metrics used by the Corps to determine federal assistance. As Senator Ernst has repeatedly stated to the committee, the current cost-to-benefit ratio puts projects in rural states, such as the one in Cedar Rapids, at a disadvantage to the coastal regions that have a higher property value. Today, the Iowa Senator specifically pressed the Corps’ decision to prioritize four projects in California over the urgent needs of Iowans: “I wrote to you last fall inquiring about how human safety is considered in the decision process to budget and fund flood risk reduction projects. The Corps sent me a letter back in December stating that these decisions are determined on a case-by-case basis. And then a list was provided to me of the FY2017 projects that were funded for construction because of the significant risks they pose to human safety. Now these also have low BCRs [Benefit Cost Ratios]. They’re very similar to what we see in Cedar Rapids and I noticed that four out of these five projects funded were in California.” Senator Ernst continued, “Can you explain to me why the lives and livelihoods of Californians are worth more value than the lives and livelihoods of Iowans? Particularly since California is a very vast state with large amounts of economic resources.” Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s exchanges with Mayor Corbett and General Semonite in full.
03.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Montana Congressman Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of the Department of Interior: “As a veteran, Ryan Zinke cares deeply about protecting our great nation and preserving our natural resources that we cherish. He will work to conserve and streamline land management, making processes more effective and efficient. I am glad to support his confirmation as Interior Secretary today and look forward to working with him to provide regulatory relief for our producers in the energy industry.”
02.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst tonight issued a statement following President Donald Trump’s first address to a Joint Session of Congress: “For the last eight years, Americans have been hamstrung under the weight of burdensome regulations, increasing taxes, and a stagnant economy, making it difficult for folks to get ahead. Tonight, we heard from President Trump about the tremendous opportunity to bring about change, which includes real regulatory reform that will get the federal government out of the way of Iowans’ everyday lives. Today alone, we made significant strides forward as the President took the first steps toward rolling back the WOTUS rule, which hurts Iowa farmers, businesses and manufacturers. “I am also eager to see an infrastructure plan that not only fixes roads, bridges, and highways, but also looks at dam and levee infrastructure. Any plan put forward must address the transportation needs of rural America, not just major cities. Fixing farm-to-market roads and bridges is essential for states like Iowa. This network of rural roads and bridges are an integral link in the food supply chain. “In addition to the significant role our federal government plays in developing and maintaining our country’s infrastructure, another core function is ensuring we keep our nation safe and secure. Previously, I pressed the Obama Administration to develop a strategy that addresses the rise of ISIS in places like Southeast Asia as we rightfully strike them in the Middle East. I look forward to the counter ISIS plan from the Trump administration. It’s my hope that this new strategy engages our allies, correctly utilizes Special Operations Forces, and includes a global approach that is required to defeat and destroy ISIS in all parts of the world – particularly in Southeast Asia where ISIS is starting to gain a foothold. “Last November, Iowans made their voices heard, and now is the time for action. I was encouraged by many of President Trump’s ideas tonight, and I will continue working to advance the issues most important to our great state.”
02.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement after President Donald Trump signed an executive order that begins the process of rescinding the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule: “Today’s action is a significant step forward toward rolling back the burdensome WOTUS rule that hamstrings Iowa farmers, businesses and manufacturers,” said Senator Ernst. “Throughout my 99 county tour across the state, I hear from folks repeatedly calling for this rule to be scrapped, which is why I have led efforts to do just that. This ill-conceived rule gives the EPA extensive power to regulate water on 97 percent of the land in the state of Iowa, breeding uncertainty and confusion for many in Iowa and across the country. “I’m thrilled that Washington is finally standing up for our rural communities and holding our government accountable as we move forward toward finally eliminating this burdensome and overreaching rule.” During her pre-confirmation meeting with now Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, Senator Ernst invited Mr. Pruitt to Iowa to visit an ethanol plant and see the impact WOTUS could have on farmers, landowners and small businesses. Senator Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap the WOTUS Rule: Introduced a resolution that expresses the need to vacate the Obama administration’s WOTUS rule. Praised the bipartisan passage in both chambers of her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. The Obama administration vetoed this legislation and Senator Ernst vowed to continue looking for ways to roll back the WOTUS rule. Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule. Spoke on the floor of the Senate to urge support for her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. Cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and direction for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders. Denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. Introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. Invited former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy never took Senator Ernst up on this offer. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa. See map below:
02.28.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, issued the following statement after differing reports emerged over potential changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). “I will continue to oppose any moves that undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard or create unnecessary uncertainty in the marketplace. As I pointed out last week in my letter to EPA Administrator Pruitt, moving the point of obligation would do precisely that, harming numerous industries that oppose this move, while benefiting a very select few. I will continue to push back against any attempts to destabilize the renewable fuels marketplace, regardless of where they originate.”
02.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Wilbur Ross to be Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce: “As a businessman, Mr. Ross understands the challenges companies face and what it takes to get back on track. His experience will be vital as we work to encourage our small and large businesses alike to grow and thrive. I look forward to seeing Mr. Ross’ business experience playing an influential role in developing viable solutions for job growth and stability in our nation’s economy.”
02.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, issued the following statement after a German hostage was beheaded by ISIS-linked militants in the Philippines: “The beheading of a German hostage by the ISIS-linked Abu Sayyaf Group is a tragic reminder of the spread of radical Islamic extremism in Southeast Asia. Germany is our partner and ally in the global fight against ISIS, and we must work together to address this rising threat as it spreads outside of the Middle East. “I was encouraged to hear Japan is willing to help the Philippines fight these terrorist groups as they continue to pledge allegiance to ISIS and terrorize Southeast Asia, something I called for previously. Following my exchange with then-Defense Secretary nominee Mattis about the clear need to address this emerging threat in Southeast Asia, it’s my hope that the counter ISIS plan he proposes this week to President Trump will suggest the global approach that is required to defeat and destroy ISIS.”
02.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst are asking the Justice Department to explain the penalties against an Iowa nursing home that was ordered closed and ordered to pay $100,000 to federal taxpayers over “grossly substandard care” that was essentially “without value.” Grassley and Ernst said The Abbey of Le Mars was on a federal watch list for two years during the Obama Administration because of concerns about care. “Given that it was a problem-prone facility, the Justice Department, as well as other agencies, need to explain why such outrageous abuse of patients was allowed to occur and what steps will be taken to ensure that this conduct will not go unpunished,” Grassley and Ernst wrote to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Grassley and Ernst asked a series of questions about when the Justice Department began looking into the facility; whether it coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General; how it arrived at the $100,000 False Claims Act settlement and whether an additional $360,000 in fines will be paid separately; how long the facility provided services deemed essentially “without value;” what monitoring is involved when a nursing home is on a federal watch list; and what other steps the previous administration took to “ensure that those engaging in the aforementioned conduct were held to account.” Grassley and Ernst said holding the nation’s nursing homes accountable to federal safety standards is critical to the health and well-being of nursing home residents as well as ensuring taxpayer value for the billions of dollars spent on nursing home care. The Grassley-Ernst letter is available here.
02.22.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today led a letter along with Senators Deb Fischer (R-NE), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Ed Markey (D-MA) to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Scott Pruitt expressing support for the current point of obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and urging the EPA to finalize its decision to reject the petitions for rulemaking to change it as soon as possible. The senators wrote that since its adoption in 2005 and expansion in 2007, the RFS “as it is structured currently, has been remarkably successful at driving significant investments in the biofuels sector.” They continued, expressing concern “that granting the petition may undermine the RFS and the progress that has been made towards increasing the amount of renewable fuels blended into our nation’s transportation fuel supply. Such a change would needlessly inject uncertainty into the fuels market and deter future investments in biofuels.” Additionally, the senators highlighted the potential risks at the EPA associated with delaying the petitions, noting “a change in the point of obligation would create a significant administrative burden for the EPA, as well as add additional compliance burdens to thousands of downstream fuel blenders or position holders. Today, there are substantially fewer refiners and importers than downstream fuel blenders or position holders. Thus, EPA’s ability to ensure that all obligated parties are compliant with their RFS obligations is relatively straightforward and manageable under the existing structure. In its proposed denial, EPA acknowledged these facts, noting that the EPA believes ‘the number of obligated parties would dramatically increase, which would place greater strain on limited resources to ensure compliance and conduct program oversight.’ The potential for less oversight over such an important program is a risk the EPA should not take.” Click here to view the letter. The full text of the letter is as follows: February 22, 2017 The Honorable E. Scott Pruitt Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20460 RE: EPA-HQ-OAR-2016-0544; FRL-9955-36-OAR Proposed Denial of Petitions for Rulemaking to Change the RFS Point of Obligation Dear Administrator Pruitt: We write regarding the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposed denial of petitions for rulemaking to change the “point of obligation” under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). We support the current point of obligation under the RFS and urge the EPA to finalize its decision to reject the petitions as soon as possible. When Congress adopted the RFS in 2005, and subsequently expanded the program in 2007, it intended to drive investments in renewable fuels – such as ethanol, biodiesel, and advanced biofuels – while reducing the nation’s reliance on foreign oil. Such a policy promotes cleaner air, a stable fuel supply, and stable prices. The RFS, as it is structured currently, has been remarkably successful at driving significant investments in the biofuels sector. However, future investments are reliant upon a stable program. As you are aware, the current petitions before the EPA would move the point of obligation from refiners and importers to entities that operate further downstream, such as fuel blenders or those that operate at the fuel terminal, so-called “position holders.” We are concerned that granting the petition may undermine the RFS and the progress that has been made towards increasing the amount of renewable fuels blended into our nation’s transportation fuel supply. Such a change would needlessly inject uncertainty into the fuels market and deter future investments in biofuels. Further, a change in the point of obligation would create a significant administrative burden for the EPA, as well as add additional compliance burdens to thousands of downstream fuel blenders or position holders. Today, there are substantially fewer refiners and importers than downstream fuel blenders or position holders. Thus, EPA’s ability to ensure that all obligated parties are compliant with their RFS obligations is relatively straightforward and manageable under the existing structure. In its proposed denial, EPA acknowledged these facts, noting that the EPA believes “the number of obligated parties would dramatically increase, which would place greater strain on limited resources to ensure compliance and conduct program oversight.” The potential for less oversight over such an important program is a risk the EPA should not take. The biofuels sector is a vital component to our states’ economies and the nation’s security. Any change in the RFS program must be closely examined for unintended consequences that would jeopardize our investments in biofuels and the progress we have made over the last decade. In fact, EPA’s initial reasoning in its proposal to deny the petitions indicates that EPA understands that many negative consequences would occur if the point of obligation were changed. Thank you for your commitment to a transparent process and we urge you to finalize the denial as soon as possible. Please, do not hesitate to contact us or our staff if we can provide any additional information. Sincerely,
02.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, today sent a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary David Shulkin about the department’s recent decision to move ahead on the VA’s own internal medical scheduling software program. This move results in the VA juggling four duplicative scheduling programs all at once, which could negatively impact veterans’ care. Senator Ernst writes, in part: “As you may know, your decision to continue the VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE) program means that it now joins the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) pilot program - which was reinstated last month - and the Veteran Appointment Request self-scheduling (VAR) program. All three of these will be joined shortly by an internet scheduling pilot program mandated by the Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016 (PL114-286).” The Senator called on Shulkin to explain the reasoning for this decision, as it contradicted a prior discussion she had with Shulkin: “In addition to being duplicative, the decision to continue VSE is contrary to comments you made to me personally during our pre-confirmation meeting. In our meeting last month, you stressed the critical need to improve the technological capabilities of the VA, specifically by contracting with commercial companies. You doubled down on this point during your confirmation hearing when you stated ‘I don’t even know how they do their jobs,’ when referencing the current scheduling methods and programs at the VA.” Ernst continued, “I fear the VA is going against best practices found in the private sector, wasting taxpayer dollars and creating duplicative, confusing programs for patients simply trying to schedule a doctor’s appointment. As we continue to see veterans’ access to care impacted by scheduling failures at the VA, it is my hope that your decision does not exacerbate the problem.” The combat veteran asked for a response from Shulkin and for him to “explain the rationale behind the decision to continue the VSE system, including what metrics were used that indicate this is the most effective scheduling method. In addition, I ask that you describe how you plan to measure the success and failure of all four programs now used for scheduling at the VA, and that you share that data with congress once it is collected.” Click here to view the letter. The full text of the letter is as follows: February 17, 2017 The Honorable David ShulkinSecretaryDepartment of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary Shulkin: I write to inquire about your decision to continue pursuing internal upgrades to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs medical scheduling software program. I am extremely concerned that this means the VA will now be juggling four duplicative scheduling programs all at once, and could negatively impact veterans’ care. I request you explain the rationale behind the decision and include the metrics used that indicate this is the most effective scheduling method for veterans. As you may know, your decision to continue the VistA Scheduling Enhancements (VSE) program means that it now joins the Medical Appointment Scheduling System (MASS) pilot program - which was reinstated last month - and the Veteran Appointment Request self-scheduling (VAR) program. All three of these will be joined shortly by an internet scheduling pilot program mandated by the Faster Care for Veterans Act of 2016 (PL114-286). In addition to being duplicative, the decision to continue VSE is contrary to comments you made to me personally during our pre-confirmation meeting. In our meeting last month, you stressed the critical need to improve the technological capabilities of the VA, specifically by contracting with commercial companies. You doubled down on this point during your confirmation hearing when you stated “I don’t even know how they do their jobs,” when referencing the current scheduling methods and programs at the VA. I fear the VA is going against best practices found in the private sector, wasting taxpayer dollars and creating duplicative, confusing programs for patients simply trying to schedule a doctor’s appointment. As we continue to see veterans’ access to care impacted by scheduling failures at the VA, it is my hope that your decision does not exacerbate the problem. As a United States Senator, and as a veteran, it is my duty to ensure our nation honors the commitments we have made to those who have served. I respectfully request you explain the rationale behind the decision to continue the VSE system, including what metrics were used that indicate this is the most effective scheduling method. In addition, I ask that you describe how you plan to measure the success and failure of all four programs now used for scheduling at the VA, and that you share that data with congress once it is collected. I look forward to your response and continuing to work with you to ensure we are delivering the best results for those who have selflessly served our nation. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst
02.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, today issued the following statement upon being re-named the Subcommittee Chairman on Rural Development and Energy: “I am grateful for the opportunity to continue serving as chairman of the Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee. This subcommittee will focus on enhancing our agriculture industry by seeking out innovative solutions in energy and economic development, and fostering job creation and stability in the market. I look forward to building upon the progress made last congress to help strengthen our rural communities.” Last year, Senator Ernst chaired a Senate Agriculture Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy hearing in which she stressed the need to examine rural development programs and regulations to ensure they are effective and efficient. Senator Ernst’s subcommittee was the only one of the five within the Ag Committee to hold a hearing in the 114th Congress. The Rural Development and Energy Subcommittee oversees numerous programs in the rural development mission of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), including economic recovery as well as job and business growth; telecommunications and utilities; electrification; loans; housing; and improving renewable energy and energy efficiency for farms and ranches. Senator Ernst will also continue to serve on the subcommittees of Nutrition, Specialty Crops and Agricultural Research as well as Livestock, Marketing and Agricultural Security.
02.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today led a letter along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Pat Roberts (R-KS), and John Thune (R-SD) to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt asking him to examine a burdensome regulation that makes it more difficult to sell gasoline with ethanol content above ten percent, such as E15 year round. The senators wrote, in part: “The Clean Air Act (CAA) limits the volatility of gasoline, as measured by Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), to nine pounds per square inch (psi) from June 1 – September 15. In 1989, the EPA adopted an interim 1-psi RVP ‘waiver’ for gasoline blends containing ten percent ethanol (E10), and this waiver was later codified through amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990. Despite repeated requests, the EPA has refused to grant this same 1-psi waiver to gasoline blends that contain more than ten percent ethanol, such as E15. As a result, sales of E15 in most of the country are severely restricted between June 1 and September 15 – the peak summer driving season. Retailers are forced to find specially tailored low-RVP gasoline blendstock to make E15 in the summertime, or avoid selling the fuel altogether. Neither of these options are practical or economical for most retailers and their customers.” The letter also called for a solution to ease this strain on retailers and consumers: “without the waiver being extended, this archaic policy prevents E15 from enjoying the same treatment year round, discouraging retailers from installing infrastructure to distribute these fuel alternatives, and ultimately increasing costs for consumers. We ask that you extend the 1-psi RVP waiver to E15 and higher blends, to eliminate this needless obstacle to consumer choice.” Click here to view the letter. The full text of the letter is as follows: February 17, 2017 The Honorable E. Scott Pruitt Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20460 Dear Mr. Pruitt: We write today to express our willingness to work with you and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to grow our country’s economy and support American jobs. Thank you for all of the answers you provided to us and our colleagues over the course of your confirmation process in the Senate. We are anxious to support you in your efforts to remove harmful and unnecessary regulations that serve as barriers to economic growth and effective environmental protection. One such barrier we would like to highlight is a nonsensical regulation that makes it more difficult to sell gasoline with ethanol content above ten percent during the summer months. The Clean Air Act (CAA) limits the volatility of gasoline, as measured by Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP), to nine pounds per square inch (psi) from June 1 – September 15. In 1989, the EPA adopted an interim 1-psi RVP “waiver” for gasoline blends containing ten percent ethanol (E10), and this waiver was later codified through amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990. Despite repeated requests, the EPA has refused to grant this same 1-psi waiver to gasoline blends that contain more than ten percent ethanol, such as E15. As a result, sales of E15 in most of the country are severely restricted between June 1 and September 15 – the peak summer driving season. Retailers are forced to find specially tailored low-RVP gasoline blendstock to make E15 in the summertime, or avoid selling the fuel altogether. Neither of these options are practical or economical for most retailers and their customers. Ironically, the volatility of E15 and other higher blends is actually lower than that of E10, meaning there is a slight evaporative emissions benefit associated with replacing a gallon of E10 with a gallon of E15. Unfortunately, without the waiver being extended, this archaic policy prevents E15 from enjoying the same treatment year round, discouraging retailers from installing infrastructure to distribute these fuel alternatives, and ultimately increasing costs for consumers. We ask that you extend the 1-psi RVP waiver to E15 and higher blends, to eliminate this needless obstacle to consumer choice. We look forward to working with you to find a permanent solution to this issue. Sincerely, JONI K. ERNST CHARLES E. GRASSLEY United States Senator United States Senator ROY BLUNT PAT ROBERTS United States Senator United States Senator JOHN THUNE United States Senator
02.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): “I’ve had the opportunity to speak with and question Mr. Pruitt over many issues of great importance to Iowans, including scrapping the Waters of the United States rule, promoting our state’s wind energy industry, and upholding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in accordance with congressional intent. In a private meeting and before the Environment and Public Works Committee, I received assurances from Mr. Pruitt that when it comes to the RFS, he will enforce the law as written by Congress, and not undermine the RFS. “Mr. Pruitt will be a partner to our states as we work to improve consumer choice, investment, and innovation. Importantly, Iowa’s farmers and businesses need relief from burdensome and overreaching regulations, and I look forward to working with Mr. Pruitt on solutions moving forward.”
02.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today issued the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed bicameral legislation she introduced along with Representative Diane Black to scrap an eleventh-hour rule issued by the Obama administration and restore local control over decisions about the best eligible Title X health providers for citizens: “Today marked a major step toward scrapping the Obama administration’s eleventh-hour rule, which secures Title X federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood – the nation’s largest provider of abortions. I remain committed to restoring our states' ability to make their own decisions about the best eligible Title X providers for folks, and I look forward to seeing this rule overturned.” About Senator Ernst and Representative Diane Black’s (R-TN) bicameral legislation: The rule currently secures federal Title X family planning grants for Planned Parenthood and interferes with states’ ability to make their own decisions about the best eligible providers for their citizens. This legislation would overturn the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) final rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program. Click here to read Senator Ernst and Representative Black’s recent column in the Washington Examiner. Additionally, in September of 2016, Senator Ernst and Representative Black led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to then-U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell expressing their opposition to the Department’s new proposed rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program.
02.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. –U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced bipartisan legislation to issue the “Gold Star” stamp recognizing and honoring families who have lost a child or family member in service to the nation. The U.S. Post Office Department first issued a stamp honoring Gold Star Mothers in 1948. Blumenthal and Ernst first introduced this legislation last year. “The resolve, resilience, and grit of Gold Star Families are remarkable beyond words, and their extraordinary contributions after devastating loss are beyond measure. Although we cannot fully repay these national heroes, reissuing the Gold Star Stamp is a small token of our gratitude and a constant reminder for not only their sacrifice and loss, but the comfort they selflessly provide others in times of despair. Their courageous example of service and sacrifice is an inspiration to all,” said Senator Blumenthal. “There is no greater grief than losing a child, spouse, or family member, and no greater sacrifice a family can make than losing their loved one in service to our country,” said Senator Ernst. “The Gold Star Families commemorative stamp is an opportunity to demonstrate our profound appreciation and respect for all of our fallen servicemembers’ families, and their sacrifices to our country. In my home state of Iowa, the Sullivan family of Waterloo lost five sons in 1942 when an enemy torpedo sank the cruiser all five were on during World War II. To honor their five sons’ courage and sacrifice, the first sheet of Gold Star Mothers commemorative stamps was presented to Mrs. Sullivan in 1948. It’s my honor to carry on the tradition by reintroducing the bipartisan Gold Star Families commemorative stamp to recognize our Gold Star Families, because no one has given more in service to our country than the families of the fallen.” “It has been nearly 70 years since the release of the first and only postage stamp honoring Gold Star Families and remembering their personal family sacrifices. Since that time, our nation has been in multiple conflicts, sacrificing Sons and Daughters for the sake of freedom. Creation of the Gold Star Families Forever Stamp will help educate the general public that freedom is never free,” said Candy Martin, National President, American Gold Star Mothers, Inc. In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed into law legislation establishing the first Gold Star Mothers stamp. The original Gold Star Mothers stamp became available on September 21, 1948. The first sheet of stamps was presented to Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan of Waterloo, Iowa, who lost five sons when an enemy torpedo sank the cruiser Juneau on November 13, 1942. Because the Gold Star Mothers stamp was designated as a special series commemorative stamp, rather than a permanent stamp, it was eventually discontinued. In 1993, a “Gold Star Loss” stamp was issued as part of a series of stamps marking the 50th anniversary of World War II.
02.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget: “Just as hardworking families all across Iowa do every day, the federal government must balance its budget. Mr. Mulvaney shares that belief, as well as my commitment to restoring integrity, fiscal responsibility, and efficiency back into the federal government. It’s time we get our nation on the right path, and I look forward to working with Mr. Mulvaney as we develop common-sense solutions.”
02.16.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Iowan Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst reintroduced legislation to grant the Meskwaki Settlement power to enforce laws for certain crimes committed on its land, bringing its authority in line with that of the vast majority of Indian country. “Our legislation kicks off the final step in a coordinated process to ensure the Meskwaki enjoy the same authority to enforce criminal law on their land as tribes have in nearly every other part of the country. It’s important that we respect the autonomy of the Meskwaki to govern themselves and enforce violations of law on their own land involving members of their tribe. The Iowa state legislature overwhelmingly passed the necessary legislation to grant this authority, and Governor Brandstad has signed it. It’s time now for the U.S. Congress to act and ensure the Meskwaki people are treated the same as nearly every other tribe in the United States,” Grassley said. “I’m pleased to join Senator Grassley in reintroducing this important legislation that will directly impact the members of the Sac and Fox Tribe of the Mississippi/Meskwaki Nation in Iowa,” said Senator Ernst. “This bill would repeal a 1948 law that restricted the tribe’s criminal authority, and return jurisdiction over certain criminal offenses committed on the Meskwaki Tribal Settlement to the tribe. In line with guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Justice, the State of Iowa first enacted a law to restore such jurisdiction to the tribe. I commend the work of all parties involved in laying the groundwork for this legislation, and I hope to see it passed and signed into law.” In most places across the country, state criminal jurisdiction over Indian land is limited to crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians and victimless crimes by non-Indians. However, because of a 1948 law, state authorities have jurisdiction over crimes committed on the Meskwaki settlement, just as it does elsewhere in Iowa. The law also grants the federal government exclusive jurisdiction over major crimes committed in Indian country, even though in most other places around the country, the federal government shares jurisdiction with the state. The legislation would bring Iowa in line with other states by limiting its criminal jurisdiction on the Meskwaki settlement to crimes by non-Indians against non-Indians and victimless crimes by non-Indians. It also allows the state and federal governments to share jurisdiction for major crimes on the settlement involving tribal members. To transfer authority, the Iowa legislature had to first enact legislation establishing the limits on the state’s jurisdiction over tribal land. Now that the state has acted, the U.S. Congress must now pass this legislation and the President must sign it to repeal the 1948 law, completing the transfer of authority.
02.15.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services' Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, convened the first hearing of the Subcommittee for the 115th Congress. The purpose was to identify the challenges of increasing Russian anti-access area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities in Europe, specifically, Russia’s continued power projection with advanced missile systems that threaten U.S. allies and partners in the region. The witnesses, including experts from the U.S. European Command and the Intelligence Community, also discussed the U.S. capacities and capabilities needed to overcome those challenges. An in depth knowledge of the threat as well as the means required to defeat it are vital to ensuring the U.S. can support the freedom and territorial integrity of our partners and allies in the region such as Ukraine and the Baltic nations. Senator Ernst released the following statement after concluding the hearing: “Today’s meeting of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee was critical to understanding the nature and scope of the threats faced by our partners and allies in Europe. The aggression of President Vladimir Putin towards his neighbors and his blatant disregard for their sovereignty and territorial integrity was on full display when he annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. Putin’s aggression is being reinforced by the placement of A2/AD capabilities from the Arctic to the Middle East. These capabilities, including advanced air defense systems, surface-to-surface missiles, and coastal defense weapons, in Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and in Crimea on the Black Sea bracket our Baltic and Ukrainian friends and directly contribute to their insecurity. Understanding the threat will help us determine what capabilities are essential so we can rebuild the technological advantages that have ensured peace and stability in Europe for over 70 years.”

02.15.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today voted in favor of a measure to reverse a last-minute final rule issued under the Obama administration, which would allow the Social Security Administration (SSA) to report certain individuals to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) in a way in which Iowans’ Second Amendment and constitutional due process rights could be violated. Senator Ernst is a co-sponsor of this legislation introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley. On December 19, 2016, the SSA issued a final rule that allows the agency to report an individual to NICS merely upon a finding that they require a representative payee, or are in need of assistance managing their Social Security benefits, and have an impairment that meets or equals the criteria found on a broad-sweeping Mental Disorders Listing of Impairments. This final rule is particularly problematic because it may result in individuals being reported to NICS that should not be – thereby depriving them of their 2nd Amendment rights without constitutional due process. “Law-abiding citizens should be able to exercise their Second Amendment right without fear of being inaccurately reported to NICS,” said Ernst. “While we must enforce current federal gun laws to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands, we can and must do so in a way that respects our Constitution. Today’s passage of this legislation ensures that law-abiding Iowans’ constitutional due process and Second Amendment rights are protected.” The following are organizations in support of this measure: ADAPT American Association of People with Disabilities American Civil Liberties Union Arc of the United States Association of Mature American Citizens Autistic Self Advocacy Network Bazelon Center for Mental Health Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Disability Law Center of Alaska National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors National Association for Rural Mental Health National Association for Rights Protection and Advocacy National Coalition for Mental Health Recovery National Council on Disability National Council on Independent Living National Disability Leadership Alliance National Disability Rights Network National Rifle Association New York Association of Psychiatric Rehabilitation Services
02.14.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Linda McMahon to be Administrator of the Small Business Administration: “Small businesses make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa; it’s critical that we create an environment where these entrepreneurs can focus on growing their business and creating jobs, rather than worrying about costly regulations. Linda McMahon shares my commitment to working to build pro-growth policies and creating a regulatory system that encourages innovation, job growth, and keeps our small businesses in mind. I look forward to working with her to identify these solutions so our small business in Iowa can thrive.”
02.14.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst joined a group of her Senate colleagues in sending a letter to recently confirmed Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Tom Price asking for relief from ObamaCare for individuals living in Iowa and 34 other states. The letter reads, in part, “We eagerly anticipate working with you to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with sensible solutions that give states more flexibility and Americans more options. However, we recognize that this process will take time, and we implore you to do everything in your power to ensure that these millions of Americans who have been protected from Obamacare do not lose their insurance now.” President Trump signed an Executive Order on January 20 instructing federal agencies to help ease the burdens of ObamaCare as Congress works to repeal the harmful law. Senator Ernst and her colleagues are committed to working with Secretary Price and the President to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, shielding Americans from unbearable costs. In Iowa and 34 other states, a transitional period has protected some individuals and small groups from ObamaCare and allowed them to keep their health care plans. However, this protection expires at the end of 2017. If the transitional relief policy is not extended, millions of plan holders – including 42,000 Iowans participating in the Iowa Farm Bureau health plan - will either lose health insurance or see premiums skyrocket. The letter was signed by Sens. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; John Barrasso, R-Wyo.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; John Boozman, R-Ark.; Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.; Thad Cochran, R-Miss.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Tom Cotton, R-Ark.; Mike Crapo, R-Idaho; Mike Enzi, R-Wyo.; Joni Ernst, R-Iowa; Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.; John Hoeven, R-N.D.; James Lankford, R-Okla.; Jerry Moran, R-Kan.; Rob Portman, R-Ohio; Marco Rubio, R-Fla.; Pat Roberts, R-Kan.; Jim Risch, R-Idaho; Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska; Tim Scott, R-S.C.; and John Thune, R-S.D. The letter reads in full: Dear Secretary Price, Congratulations on your confirmation as Secretary of Health and Human Services. We look forward to working with you to ensure access to quality, affordable health care for all Americans. We commend your commitment to repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and working with Congress to enact market-driven approaches that put Americans back in control of their health care. We appreciate President Trump’s determination to ease the burden of the ACA through his Administration. The President’s January 20, 2017, Executive Order instructing agencies to minimize the harmful impacts of the law and provide states additional flexibility is an admirable first step. As Secretary of HHS, we know that much of this responsibility will fall on your shoulders. One way HHS can protect Americans from the crippling effects of the law is to extend the transitional relief policy for individual and group plans in 35 states. HHS Guidance is needed by mid-February to give states and health plans time to act. Since the enactment of the ACA, millions of Americans have either lost their health insurance or have seen their premiums skyrocket. We are committed to working with you to ensure this does not continue to happen. In 2013, HHS created a transitional relief policy that would allow individuals and small groups to maintain certain “Grandmothered” insurance plans. In states that opted for transitional relief, Grandmothered plans are individual and small group plans purchased after enactment of the ACA and before October 1, 2013, that were not required to comply with certain ACA reforms. President Obama’s Administration permitted transitional relief for these plans to protect millions of Americans from feeling the worst pains of the law. The transitional relief policy was extended in March 2014 and again in February 2016. The current extension is set to expire at the end of 2017, causing millions of Americans to lose their Grandmothered plans in 2018. HHS should extend the current transitional relief policy indefinitely, which would give states the opportunity to allow individuals and small groups to maintain plans. This would provide stability, especially as plans to repeal and replace the ACA evolve. We eagerly anticipate working with you to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with sensible solutions that give states more flexibility and Americans more options. However, we recognize that this process will take time, and we implore you to do everything in your power to ensure that these millions of Americans who have been protected from Obamacare do not lose their insurance now. We respectfully request that HHS issue guidance by February 21, 2017, to extend indefinitely the transitional relief policy until Congress and the President are able to repeal and replace the ACA completely.
02.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Steve Mnuchin to be Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury: “Mr. Mnuchin brings years of extensive private sector experience and executive-level leadership to the Treasury Department. Such skills will be critical as we work to create a healthier economic environment for our businesses, community banks, and hard-working families across the nation. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and this new administration to move forward on tax and regulatory reform as a means to help grow our economy and remove some of the burdens placed on many of Iowa’s rural communities, families and small businesses.”
02.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today met with President Trump’s nominee to serve on the Supreme Court of the United States, Judge Neil Gorsuch. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “One would be hard-pressed to dispute the academic credentials and intellectual rigor of Judge Neil Gorsuch. During the course of Judge Gorsuch’s ten-year judicial career, his opinions have reflected not only his outstanding legal acumen, but also his respect for the Constitution and a Scalia-like ability to explain his decisions. “The people spoke last November, and our new president has put forward a well-respected nominee who the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. It’s time for Washington to work together – as our constituents expect us to do –to confirm a nominee who will defend the rule of law. “From my conversation with Judge Gorsuch, I believe he is dedicated to interpreting the text of the Constitution and statutes as they are written – rather than attempting to legislate from the bench. I look forward to moving ahead to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with this eminently-qualified nominee, and I thank him for his willingness to serve his country in this critically important role.” Senator Joni Ernst with Judge Neil Gorsuch
02.13.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Dr. David Shulkin to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): “I am deeply troubled by the many problems within the VA system. From long appointment wait times to the enormous veteran benefit appeals backlog, these shortcomings are unacceptable. Our veterans – who have given so much to this country – deserve better. We must do more to expand patient choice and access, reduce wait times, and improve mental health care, and failure to do so is not an option. I will hold Dr. Shulkin accountable to the promises he has made, and look forward to working tirelessly with him to improve the department and honor our commitment to veterans.”
02.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Congressman Tom Price, M.D. for Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services: “After nearly two decades as an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Price understands the importance of prioritizing quality, patient-centered health care, which is vital as we work to replace ObamaCare with an affordable solution that works for Americans. “Throughout my 99 county tour, I hear from Iowans facing health insurance premium increases, as well as increases in other out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays that they simply cannot afford. Americans are demanding relief from ObamaCare. I look forward to working with Dr. Price to ensure that Iowans have access to affordable health care coverage that meets individuals’ and families’ needs, instead of Washington deciding what their health insurance should look like.” “I am also eager to work with Dr. Price to ensure access to quality health care services in rural America, and to continue to work to build upon the last two years’ efforts to increase the availability of mental health and addiction services.”
02.09.2017	Washington – U.S. Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) along with Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Todd Young (R-IN), Rob Portman (R-OH), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) today sent a letter to President Trump urging his Administration to pursue a principled and tough-minded Russia policy, highlighting Russia's aggressive behavior in Ukraine, Syria, and cyberspace. The letter reads in full: Dear Mr. President: We write to ask you to pursue a results-oriented, but tough-minded and principled policy toward the Russian Federation. Russia’s cooperation is desirable, and in some cases essential, to global initiatives such as nuclear arms control, counter-terrorism, drug trafficking, or promoting global health. We should maintain active and ongoing dialogue with Russia on these and others areas of mutual interests, as every U.S. President has done since the end of the Cold War. However, while we should seek common ground with Russia in the areas of mutual interest, we must never pursue cooperation with Russia at the expense of our fundamental interests of defending our allies and promoting our values. The United States should unequivocally condemn – and take proactive steps to stem – the continued Russian aggression in Ukraine. Russia has invaded Ukraine and illegally annexed the Crimean peninsula, in violation of international law, and has directly abetted the so-called “separatist rebels” in eastern Ukraine. Since 2014, over 10,000 Ukrainians have died in this tragic conflict, and there are as many as 1.5 million internally displaced persons because of the violence. The most recent escalation of fighting along the “line of contact” in eastern Ukraine should serve as a reminder of Russia’s nefarious intentions. The Administration should maintain the current U.S. sanctions regime against Russia and Russian entities – and to impose new sanctions as necessary and merited by Russian behavior –unless Ukraine’s control over Crimea is restored, Russia fully respects the Minsk agreements, and ceases all efforts to undermine Ukraine’s sovereignty. Furthermore, we ask you to expedite the provision of defensive lethal weapons to Ukraine, and we were encouraged that Secretary of State Tillerson supported this position during his confirmation hearing. The United States should not enter into any military or diplomatic agreement with Russia regarding Syria’s future until Moscow halts its military operations that have caused immense damage and human suffering and ceases support for the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad. It is plainly evident that despite Russian claims to the contrary, Moscow’s main goal is not the defeat of the Islamic State, but the preservation of the Assad regime at any cost. According to the Pentagon’s spokesman, as of February 3, 2016, only 10 percent of Russian airstrikes were against Islamic State targets. However, according to an estimate released by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights on December 31, 2016, at least 4,700 civilians died in Syria due to Russian shelling, including the targeting of schools and hospitals. The U.S. must condemn these Russian atrocities and condition any future negotiations regarding Syria’s future on Russian compliance with international norms and basic human rights. Furthermore, we must recognize and counter the active cyber and information warfare Russia is conducting against the United States and Western democracies, including attempted interference in our democratic elections process. According to the 2016 Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community: “Russian cyber operations are likely to target US interests to support several strategic objectives: intelligence gathering to support Russian decision-making in the Ukraine and Syrian crises, influence operations to support military and political objectives, and continuing preparation of the cyber environment for future contingencies.” The United States must have a firm response to this belligerent behavior from Moscow, which should include diplomatic actions, economic consequences, as well as a strengthened military posture in Europe. Most importantly, we urge you to relay to Moscow that the values of democracy, human rights, transparency, and accountability are central to U.S. foreign policy, that these values are non-negotiable, and that the United States will continue to advance these values globally, including with regard to Russia. President Putin must know that the United States remains a beacon of hope and democracy around the world, and will stand up for what is right. Mr. President, we look forward to your reply and maintaining an open, ongoing, and respectful dialogue with you regarding U.S.-Russia relations. Sincerely,

02.08.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today emphasized to Anthony Pratt, Administrator, Delaware Department of Natural Resources & Environmental Control, at a committee hearing the importance of improving the metrics the Army Corps of Engineers uses to budget for flood mitigation projects, such as funding the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project. Click here or on the image above to watch the Senator’s questioning. Senator Ernst stated that despite being included in recent infrastructure legislation, the Cedar Rapids, Iowa flood mitigation projects remain incomplete: “One of Iowa’s top infrastructure priorities is flood mitigation, we’ve heard a little bit about flood mitigation here. Our second biggest city in the state has endured two major flood events, 2008 and 2016, and to date they haven’t received any construction funds, despite being authorized in the 2014 WRDA bill and again mentioned as a priority in the 2016 WRDA bill.” In November of 2016, Senator Ernst met with the head of the Army Corps of Engineers to discuss her concerns, “I expressed to him that communities like Cedar Rapids and states like Iowa will likely never see federal assistance from the Corps because they lose out every time to larger states that have higher property values and thus higher economic benefit.” Additionally, as the Iowa Senator noted, the Army Corps of Engineers’ cost-benefit metrics for federal assistance favors coastal regions with a high property value, one that often leaves rural areas, such as Cedar Rapids, with a disadvantage: “I’m really interested in improving these metrics so our rural communities have a fighting chance at tapping into Corps expertise because if the only metric the Corps uses to determine the economic benefit of a project is property value then it’s hard for me to conclude, or not to conclude that the Corps considers building beaches in front of multi-million oceanfront homes to be a higher priority than protecting the people that live in Iowa.”
02.08.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Senator Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General of the United States: “I have had the opportunity to work with Jeff Sessions over the last couple of years through our membership on the Senate Armed Services Committee. I have gotten to know Jeff and witnessed first-hand his commitment to keeping our nation safe. Additionally, his decades of public service have further illustrated that he works hard and fights tirelessly for those he represents. “I have no doubt that Jeff Sessions will defend our Constitution and impartially uphold the rule of law. I look forward to his service and leadership as our next Attorney General.”

02.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst released the following video after the United States Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education. Click here to watch. Transcript: All children deserve a chance to achieve success regardless of where they are born and the situations their families face. Having grown up in rural Southwest Iowa, my parents often stressed the importance of a strong education. In Iowa, we are fortunate to have one of the best public school systems in the nation. And, I am a proud product of our Iowa public school system – as is my 17 year-old daughter, Libby who will graduate this May. As a mother and grandmother, I firmly believe education should be handled at the state and local level by Iowans, not Washington bureaucrats. Over the last several weeks, I have thoroughly vetted Betsy DeVos, and have found that she shares the belief that those closest to our students – from parents to teachers to local administrators and local elected officials – know what is best for our students. Additionally, she has pledged to fight for all students, including those attending public, private, and charter schools and students who require additional support due to developmental, physical, or other disabilities. While I support her confirmation, I will be holding her accountable to the standard she has placed upon herself. I have heard from folks on both sides of the debate over Betsy DeVos. Good people can disagree with one another and still engage in a civil, productive discourse. An open and honest dialogue is important and it’s critical that I continue to hear from you – which you can do by calling one of our offices, sending me a letter, or visit my website Ernst Dot Senate Dot Gov. I look forward to working with you to protect our schools, restore local control, and prepare our youth to enter the workforce. Thank you for all that you do.
02.07.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, today sent a letter to President Trump encouraging him to address trade barriers on pork and beef during his upcoming visit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The Iowa Senator wrote, in part: “My home state of Iowa leads the nation in pork production, raising more of this safe, nutritious meat than the next two states combined. One out of every three pounds of bacon, ham or sausage in the U.S. comes from the Hawkeye state. As it would happen, Japan is the second largest market for U.S. pork exports by volume and the largest in terms of value. All of this despite significant import protections Japan imposes through a gate price system. I ask that you do everything in your power to negotiate outright elimination of all barriers for pork and pork products in any bilateral trade deal with Japan. “I would be remiss if I failed to mention our nation’s vibrant beef industry, which produces over 24 billion pounds per year. The value of U.S. beef exports in 2015 was over $6 billion, or $325 per head. Our top export market is Japan, but international competitors are chipping away at our market share. The bilateral Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement gives Australia a 10 percent tariff rate advantage over U.S. beef. I would ask that your administration move quickly to negotiate an elimination of all trade barriers to ensure a level playing field for our farmers and ranchers.” Senator Ernst concluded: “Now is the time to begin these conversations with Japan in earnest, as every moment we delay means dollars that would otherwise be going into the pockets of America’s farmers are enriching our foreign competitors instead. The timing is critical given the void left by our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as other countries will undoubtedly move to consolidate economic power in the region. I look forward to working with you and the new administration to build upon our existing food and agriculture trade surplus, and continue to strengthen our position globally.” Click here or see below to read the full letter. February 7, 2017 The Honorable Donald J. Trump President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Trump: I am writing today about working with you and your administration to help grow our country’s economy and support American jobs across this great nation. I want to highlight the prospect of continuing to increase our trade surplus in a segment of the economy that is vital to our heartland: food and agriculture. Your upcoming meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe provides a timely opportunity to engage in a dialogue that will strengthen our bilateral trade and investment relationship with Japan. The American farmer has proven time and again to be the envy of the world, producing more food, fiber and fuel than any other country. As a consequence of this astonishing productivity and consistent surplus in commodities, exports are necessary to keep this sector strong. For decades, we have run a trade surplus in food and agricultural exports. These exports add significant value to the bottom line of our nation’s farmers and ranchers, particularly those who raise livestock. My home state of Iowa leads the nation in pork production, raising more of this safe, nutritious meat than the next two states combined. One out of every three pounds of bacon, ham or sausage in the U.S. comes from the Hawkeye state. As it would happen, Japan is the second largest market for U.S. pork exports by volume and the largest in terms of value. All of this despite significant import protections Japan imposes through a gate price system. I ask that you do everything in your power to negotiate outright elimination of all barriers for pork and pork products in any bilateral trade deal with Japan. I would be remiss if I failed to mention our nation’s vibrant beef industry, which produces over 24 billion pounds per year. The value of U.S. beef exports in 2015 was over $6 billion, or $325 per head. Our top export market is Japan, but international competitors are chipping away at our market share. The bilateral Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement gives Australia a 10 percent tariff rate advantage over U.S. beef. I would ask that your administration move quickly to negotiate an elimination of all trade barriers to ensure a level playing field for our farmers and ranchers. Now is the time to begin these conversations with Japan in earnest, as every moment we delay means dollars that would otherwise be going into the pockets of America’s farmers are enriching our foreign competitors instead. The timing is critical given the void left by our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, as other countries will undoubtedly move to consolidate economic power in the region. I look forward to working with you and the new administration to build upon our existing food and agriculture trade surplus, and continue to strengthen our position globally. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
02.06.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee on the Senate Armed Services Committee, along with Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), today introduced the DoD Emergency Response Capabilities Database Enhancement Act of 2017, legislation that updates a current law and requires the Department of Defense to track cyber capabilities important to national security and domestic response found in the National Guard and Reserve forces within one year. A 2016 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that “National Guard units have developed capabilities that could be used, if requested and approved, to support civil authorities in a cyber incident; however, the Department of Defense (DOD) does not have visibility of all National Guard units' capabilities for this support.” Specifically, GAO recommended, “To ensure that decision makers have immediate visibility into all capabilities of the National Guard that could support civil authorities in a cyber incident, the Secretary of Defense should maintain a database that can fully and quickly identify the cyber capabilities that the National Guard in the 50 states, three territories, and the District of Columbia have and could be used--if requested and approved--to support civil authorities in a cyber incident.” “The reality is that cyber warfare is an emerging and ever-evolving battlefield, and we must use all available tools to protect our nation’s security, including those that already exist in our National Guard units,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran of the National Guard. “Many of our guardsmen work in the cyber and IT field in their civilian careers, and we must present more opportunities to harness their skillset to advance our nation’s cyber initiatives.” “Aggressive Russian cyber activities, China’s 2015 hack into the Office of Personnel Management, and efforts by Iran and non-state groups all demonstrate that we must make greater efforts to strengthen our cyber defenses,” said Senator Coons. “The National Guard, including Delaware’s 166th Network Warfare Squadron, is an important reservoir of cyber knowledge and expertise. Yet the Pentagon does not have adequate understanding of all Guard unit cyber skills, which could inhibit our response to a major cyberattack. This bill will create a database so the Department of Defense can fully and quickly identify National Guard Cyber capabilities, allowing for a prompt response by civil authorities to a future a cyber incident.” “Our National Guard is uniquely positioned to recruit and retain some of our best cyber warriors, and this bill would help make sure that our military is taking advantage of this extraordinary talent,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We need to do everything we can to keep our nation’s cyber defense strong and effective, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.” Twice at Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, Senator Joni Ernst pressed the Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael Rogers, on the use of National Guard units’ cyber capabilities and specifically asked him what he was doing to better track their capabilities. During her questioning last month, Senator Ernst followed up with Admiral Rogers from a previous hearing where he was unable to answer why the Department of Defense (DOD) was not tracking National Guard Cyber Capabilities in a new system, and Admiral Rogers responded, “...I am the first to acknowledge that after talking to OSD and the services, that I don’t have a good answer for you and I will get you something in writing in the next week or so.” “OSD” refers to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Later, Admiral Rogers answered Senator Ernst in a written response stating, “in compliance with the 2007 NDAA requirement, DOD built a module in DRRS that tracks emergency response capabilities; however, the module does not include cyber capabilities across the National Guard.” Referring to the Defense Readiness Reporting System. The DoD Emergency Response Capabilities Database Enhancement Act: Requires DOD specifically track, within one year, cyber capabilities found in the National Guard and Reserve forces identified by DOD to be important to matters of national security and domestic response. Allows DOD to update or utilize existing systems to track the capabilities if it’s faster and more cost effective. Click here to view the bill.
02.03.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement on the Trump administration’s actions to implement new sanctions on Iran, and to maintain its sanctions in place against Russia: “The Trump administration was right to act swiftly today to impose new sanctions on Iran for its ballistic missile program and continued support of terrorism. It is time to hold Iran accountable for its actions and send a clear message that the United States will no longer tolerate their illicit behavior. “In addition, I was also encouraged by Ambassador Haley’s remarks at the United Nations Security Council yesterday that our sanctions on Russia will remain in place until it withdraws from Crimea. We must maintain pressure on Russia to cease from its aggressive actions in Ukraine.” ###
02.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, today met with President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “Governor Perdue and I had a productive conversation about the state of the agriculture economy and the policy changes needed at the USDA to better address the challenges our farmers and ranchers are facing. “I expressed to Governor Perdue that when I visit with farmers, ranchers and agriculture businesses, the biggest concern they voice to me is the overwhelming burden of regulations, such as the expanded definition of the Waters of the U.S. rule. I noted how important it is for our new leadership in the USDA to collaborate with the other agencies and roll back many of these harmful regulations so that we can provide the much-sought-after relief for our agriculture industry. “With Iowa leading our nation in pork, egg, corn, and soybean production, it is also key that the USDA work to maintain and strengthen the existing trade agreements we have with other nations. In order to ensure our American producers are able to sell their goods competitively in the global market, it is critical we pursue an aggressive trade policy. “Furthermore, I emphasized the importance of renewable fuels to Iowa’s economy and the need to have a strong partner in the USDA as we continue to pursue alternative sources of energy that boost our economy and provide consumers with greater choice. I shared with Governor Perdue that Iowa produces more ethanol than the next two states combined. “Moreover, I encouraged the Governor to visit Iowa soon, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss many Iowans’ agricultural priorities. I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet him for this position as he comes before the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee for his confirmation hearing.”
02.01.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, a member of the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works (EPW), today expressed her disappointment over her Democratic colleagues’ refusal to attend today’s committee vote on President Trump's Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominee, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Click here or on the image below to hear her remarks. BACKGROUND Total Number of Questions Answered (from EPW): Attorney General Pruitt has answered a total of more than 1200 questions. This total includes 1,078 questions for the record and at least 206 oral questions during the hearing. This is the most total questions ever answered by an EPA administrator nominee for an incoming administration, on record.* Mr. Pruitt has answered over 1,000 more questions than incoming nominees for EPA administrator from the Obama, Bush, Clinton, and Bush Administrations. Administrator William K. Reilly, who was nominated by President George H.W. Bush, was asked a total of 459 questions (at least 91 oral questions and 368 QFR). Administrator Carol Browner, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, was asked a total of 242 questions (at least 105 oral questions and 137 QFR). Administrator Christine Todd Whitman, who was nominated by President George W. Bush, was asked a total of 242 questions (at least 64 oral questions and 178 QFR). Administrator Lisa Jackson, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, was asked a total of 202 questions (at least 69 oral questions and 133 QFR). *Available records date back to 1989. Democrats’ Comments to Chairman Barrasso on January 18, 2017 on the Amount of Time for Questions During the Pruitt Hearing: “I appreciate the way you’ve conduced this hearing today. I appreciate all the members coming and coming back again and again.” – Ranking Member Tom Carper (D-DE) “First of all, to you, sir, this is my first time going through nomination hearings. You have been very generous with the way you have been conducting these hearings. I think it is important that we note that, and I appreciate the number of rounds that you are doing.” – Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) “I think that you have been fair.” – Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) “I just want to repeat, I do think what Senator Sullivan said, you have been very, very generous, it is true.” – Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) For reference, here is Senator Sullivan’s quote: “Mr. Chairman, I think you’ve been exceedingly fair, particularly relative to the confirmation of Gina McCarthy… But relative to any other EPA Administrator hearing, you’ve been very generous, very fair.” Democrats on May 9, 2013, at a Business Meeting to Consider Gina McCarthy to be EPA Administrator: “[W]hen people have honest differences of opinion, we debate it. But when the goal is simply obstructionism, I would draw this conclusion, we are not responding to the needs of the American people if there is not an EPA Administrator.” – Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) “It has nothing to do with information not made available. It has everything to do with obstructionism.” – Senator Ben Cardin (D-MD)
02.01.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Rex Tillerson for Secretary of State: “As the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world, Rex Tillerson spent his career managing multinational operations and negotiating complex business deals with a number of foreign governments and business leaders around the world, providing him with unique insights and a broad understanding of the geopolitical landscape. Mr. Tillerson is a deal-maker, whose international business experience will be critical when working with other nations on important matters, like combatting the rise of ISIS, curbing Russian aggression, and preventing the growth of Iran’s nuclear program. “Mr. Tillerson will serve as an advocate of our national interests, and I look forward to working with him to address the many challenges we face to restore American leadership across the world.”
01.31.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement on President Trump’s announcement that he has nominated Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. “It is critical that the highest court in the land applies the text of the Constitution and statutes impartially. From what I have learned thus far, Judge Neil Gorsuch will demonstrate an unwavering commitment to interpret the law as written, rather than legislating from the bench. The people spoke last November, and our new president has tonight put forward a well-respected nominee who the Senate has previously confirmed with unanimous support. It’s time for Washington to work together – as our constituents expect us to do – and move forward to fill the Supreme Court vacancy with this eminently-qualified nominee.”
01.31.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed Elaine Chao to be Secretary of the Department of Transportation: “I am pleased the Senate has confirmed Elaine Chao as Secretary of the Department of Transportation. The new administration has made clear that improving our nation’s infrastructure is a top priority for our nation, just as it is for Iowans. Ms. Chao brings years of invaluable experience within the executive branch to this position, including her tenure as Deputy Secretary of Transportation for President George H.W. Bush, and Secretary of Labor under President George W. Bush. She is highly qualified to serve as the Secretary of Transportation, and I look forward to working with Ms. Chao to move our country forward.”
01.30.2017	WASHINGTON - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst issued the following statement regarding the Trump Administration's Executive Order "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States": “We are a welcoming nation, a nation of immigrants – of all religions and from countries across the world; but we must be vigilant in our efforts to ensure the protection of our homeland. “As I have said previously, I believe it is prudent to take the time necessary to reassess the quality and adequacy of the vetting processes we rely on for our refugee and visa programs. With respect to the President’s Executive Order, there must be more clarity surrounding the order’s implementation. In our efforts to protect our nation from ISIS, we also must ensure we are not inadvertently penalizing our allies in the fight against radical Islamic terrorism– especially those who have supported U.S. military efforts in Iraq. “Moreover, we must ultimately address the underlying cause of the current humanitarian crisis by devising and executing a successful strategy to destroy our ISIS enemy.”
01.27.2017	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today addressed the crowd at this year’s March for Life rally. In her remarks, Senator Ernst announced she will introduce two pieces of legislation on Monday: a bill that redirects funds from Planned Parenthood to other eligible women's health care providers, and a measure to scrap the Department of Health and Human Services’ new rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program. Click here or on the image below to watch. The following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks: God bless you all! Thank you so much. Thanks for being here. What I am wishing today, above all else. What I am wishing for all Americans whether they are born or unborn, is that they know peace, that they know love, and that they all might be touched by the grace of God. Thank you all so much for being here and standing up for life! This is important – we know how important it is. Back in 2015, I introduced a measure to redirect federal dollars for women’s health care away from Planned Parenthood and give that money to places like community health centers, which provide greater health care services, regardless of a person’s ability to pay. Because as we all know, Planned Parenthood is the nation’s single largest provider of abortions. Thanks to the help and support of all of you, we saw a bipartisan – let me stress bipartisan – majority support my measure – and ultimately, we sent it to the president’s desk! But unfortunately folks, back then we didn’t have a president that respected life, and he stopped us. Thankfully today is a different story. Today as you heard Vice President Pence, we have a Pro-Life President! We must keep fighting for those who are unable to protect themselves. So, I am thrilled to announce today that this coming Monday, I will re-introduce that critical legislation to redirect Planned Parenthood funding to other eligible women's health care providers. I am also going to introduce a bill Monday to stop what some have referred to as “President Obama’s last gift to Planned Parenthood.” Title X. Representative Diane Black is joining me in this effort, and it would scrap the Obama administration’s eleventh-hour rule that entrenches federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood. We as a pro-life community honor the civil liberties, independence, and strength of a woman – all women. And that means both supporting mothers and rising up to protect the most vulnerable in our society -- the innocent babies who are unable to defend themselves. As a mother, a grandmother, and a woman--thank you for joining me today, and standing up and marching for life! God bless all of you. And again, I want to say thank you God for giving us this day, thank you all for being here, and again, we wish all Americans peace, love and that they will be touched by the grace of God. About Senator Ernst’s legislation to redirect federal funds from Planned Parenthood to other eligible women's health care providers: Prohibits federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliate organizations. Protects federal funding for health services for women, including diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, prenatal and postnatal care, immunizations, cervical and breast cancer screenings and more. Ensures there is no reduction in overall federal funding available to support women’s health. About Senator Ernst and Representative Diane Black’s (R-TN) bicameral legislation to scrap an eleventh-hour rule from the Obama administration that cements federal family planning funding for Planned Parenthood: The rule currently secures federal Title X family planning grants for Planned Parenthood and interferes with states’ ability to make their own decisions about the best eligible providers for their citizens. This legislation would eliminate the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) final rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program.

01.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, today met with President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Dr. David Shulkin. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “Our veterans have made immeasurable sacrifices for our freedom and way of life, and they deserve the quality and timely care they were promised. Unfortunately all too often, our government has not lived up to this promise, resulting in countless veterans who have suffered through long waits, only to receive inadequate care. “In my meeting with Dr. Shulkin today, I voiced my displeasure with the operation of the VA under the previous administration, and stressed the urgency of immediately correcting the systematic problems at the VA. I told Dr. Shulkin the tragic stories of Iowa veterans who took their own lives after failing to receive timely and quality care at the VA. Cases like these are absolutely unacceptable, and we cannot allow those who selflessly served our nation to fall victim to a flawed system. We must do more to expand patient choice and access, reduce wait times, and improve mental health care. “The status quo at the VA cannot continue. My questions to Dr. Shulkin today were focused on ensuring he was not part of the problem in his previous VA position, and making sure he had a strategy for the heavy workload ahead if confirmed. I made it clear I want metrics for the American people that show improvement from the VA. We need strong and determined leadership at the VA to start delivering the quality of care to our veterans that we can be proud of. I look forward to continuing to vet Dr. Shulkin for this important position on behalf of those who have selflessly served our nation.” # # #
01.27.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today led Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), and David Perdue (R-GA) in a letter to the United States Army Chief of Staff, General Mark Milley, asking him why polymer ammunition magazines were not approved for United States Army rifles in combat or in training. Unlike the U.S. Marine Corps, who recently approved polymer magazines for use in combat and in training, the Army has yet to do so. Senator Ernst’s question to General Milley is part of her effort to ensure our warfighters have the best equipment possible. This letter follows her recent questions raised with General Mattis at his confirmation hearing, in which she stressed the need to ensure our military doesn’t fall behind countries like Russia in providing modern and lethal equipment, specifically as it relates to our rifles and handguns. In their letter to General Milley, the senators wrote, “The Army and Marine Corps simultaneously issued orders stating that polymer magazines were not authorized for use in 2012. This month, five years later, the Marine Corps approved the use of an upgraded version of these polymer magazines. It is my hope that the Army considers them as well, or is able to disclose what issues they’ve found with polymer magazines so that we can make the other service branches aware.” The senators added: “Reports state that the polymer magazines approved for use by the Marine Corps had zero magazine related stoppages through all of the tests carried out by the Marine Corps when combined with any ammunition tested. Additionally, reports state they also reduce damage to the chamber face and feed ramps when using M855A1 ammunition. As our national debt approaches $20 billion, ensuring the longevity of these rifles is important.” The senators requested a response from the Army as to why they have not approved the polymer magazine, noting, “After years of technology advancement for our soldiers, and your fellow service branches testing and approving this technology, it is my hope that the Army is also working to ensure its warfighters have the best equipment possible.” This letter follows the inclusion of Senator Ernst’s provision in the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act signed into law that provides funds for the Army and Marine Corps to enhance the small arms and ammunition capabilities of our soldiers and marines. Click here or see below to read the full letter. January 27, 2017 General Mark Milley Army Chief of Staff 200 Army Pentagon Washington, DC 20310-0200 General Milley: We write to you today to question why polymer ammunition magazines for United States Army rifles are not authorized for use in combat or in training. The Army and Marine Corps simultaneously issued orders stating that polymer magazines were not authorized for use in 2012. This month, five years later, the Marine Corps approved the use of an upgraded version of these polymer magazines. It is our hope that the Army considers them as well, or is able to disclose what issues they’ve found with polymer magazines so that we can make the other service branches aware. As you may know, the Marine Corps issued guidance against the use of polymer magazines in 2012 due to their inability to function with new automatic rifles. To our understanding, the Marine Corps did this following issues with their operation in the new M-27 Infantry Automatic Rifle. However, the Army never fielded the M-27 rifle, and it is not clear what specifications the previous polymer magazines failed to meet in order to be authorized for Army weapon systems. Regardless, the Marine Corps has now identified polymer magazines that are approved for their M-27 rifles, and the same M-4 carbines and M-16s the Army carries. Reports state that the polymer magazines approved for use by the Marine Corps had zero magazine related stoppages through all of the tests carried out by the Marine Corps when combined with any ammunition tested. Additionally, reports state they also reduce damage to the chamber face and feed ramps when using M855A1 ammunition. As our national debt approaches $20 billion, ensuring the longevity of these rifles is important. We request a response as to why the Army has not approved any polymer magazines for use in combat, or in training, and an update on if the Army is considering approving them now. After years of technology advancement for our soldiers, and your fellow service branches testing and approving this technology, it is our hope that the Army is also working to ensure its warfighters have the best equipment possible. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst Tom Cotton Jim Inhofe Johnny Isakson David Perdue
01.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today issued the following statement on President Trump’s executive orders to secure our borders and protect U.S. citizens: “We must secure our borders in order to protect our citizens and ensure that anyone entering our country is doing so in accordance with the law; I am encouraged to see these actions from the Trump administration today. “For the last year, my colleagues and I have advocated for Sarah’s Law – legislation that would require federal immigration authorities to detain those here illegally who harm American citizens. Additionally, Sarah’s Law would ensure victims and families of crimes committed by illegal immigrants receive up-to-date information from federal immigration authorities. “With this in mind, I am especially pleased to see that President Trump is taking steps in this direction -- ensuring that those charged with criminal offenses are considered priorities for enforcement and directing the establishment of a new office within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that will be responsible for providing relevant information to crime victims and their families. “While nothing will bring back Sarah Root, we have an obligation to her family and all Americans to ensure that no citizen or their families fall victim to this type of injustice again, and I will work tirelessly to see Sarah’s Law fully implemented.” About Sarah’s Law: Sarah’s Law is in honor of Sarah Root, a twenty-one year-old Iowan who was struck and killed in Omaha by Edwin Mejia, who entered the country illegally and was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit – and drag racing. Following state criminal charges of motor vehicle homicide and outreach by local law enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) declined to use its discretion to issue a detainer, and Mejia subsequently posted bond and has since disappeared. Now, nearly one year later, Mejia still remains at-large. Sarah’s Law would amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the federal government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally, violated the terms of their immigration status, or had their visa revoked and is thereafter charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. The legislation also requires ICE to make reasonable efforts to identify and provide relevant information to the crime victims or their families. Under this law, Mejia would have been detained, not been allowed to flee from justice, and the Root family would be kept up-to-date on Mejia’s status and federal immigration authorities’ efforts to remove him from the United States. From the President’s Executive Order: Sec. 5. Enforcement Priorities. In executing faithfully the immigration laws of the United States, the Secretary of Homeland Security (Secretary) shall prioritize for removal those aliens described by the Congress in sections 212(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 235, and 237(a)(2) and (4) of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(6)(C), 1225, and 1227(a)(2) and (4)), as well as removable aliens who: (a) Have been convicted of any criminal offense; (b) Have been charged with any criminal offense, where such charge has not been resolved; (c) Have committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense; (d) Have engaged in fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency; (e) Have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits; (f) Are subject to a final order of removal, but who have not complied with their legal obligation to depart the United States; or (g) In the judgment of an immigration officer, otherwise pose a risk to public safety or national security. … Sec. 13. Office for Victims of Crimes Committed by Removable Aliens. The Secretary shall direct the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to take all appropriate and lawful action to establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement an office to provide proactive, timely, adequate, and professional services to victims of crimes committed by removable aliens and the family members of such victims. This office shall provide quarterly reports studying the effects of the victimization by criminal aliens present in the United States.
01.25.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today sent a letter to Brigadier General Heather L. Pringle, Commander of the U.S. Air Force 502nd Air Base Wing and Joint Base San Antonio, requesting she consider a mandatory buddy pair system as a means to reduce sexual assaults at the facilities under her command for servicemembers in a training status. Her letter follows her visit to the base, which included discussions with servicemembers to identify a number of ways to better address these heinous crimes, such as a mandatory buddy pair system. In her letter, Senator Ernst writes that she was “surprised to hear that the Air Force was the only service that did not require such a system for all of its students in training status.” And added “this is disappointing, as the buddy pair system not only can reduce vulnerabilities for sexual assault, but also helps young servicemembers make better decisions.” The Iowa Senator asked that the Air Force consider implementing the buddy pair system, emphasizing that, “as we continue to see sexual assault plague institutions around the country, it is my hope that the military will continue to take concrete steps to improve and become a leading example for how to effectively curb this problem. Therefore, I request that you consider making a buddy pair system mandatory for all Air Force personnel in a training status on Joint Base San Antonio.” Senator Ernst’s letter comes as part of her ongoing efforts to combat military sexual assault, including work with Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on the Military Retaliation Prevention Act which was signed into law as part of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. This also follows her column earlier this year in the Dubuque Telegraph Herald, urging the military to do more to prevent sexual assault. To read the full letter, click here or see below. January 25, 2017 Heather L. PringleBrigadier General, USAFCommander, 502nd Air Base Wing and Joint Base San AntonioSan Antonio, TX 78234 Brigadier General Pringle: I write to you today as a follow-up to my November 18, 2016, visit to Fort Sam Houston, which was focused on investigating military sexual assault. My discussions with servicemembers were both informative and productive, and I believe we identified a number of ways to better address these heinous crimes. One of those ways involves instituting a mandatory buddy pair system. I was surprised to hear that the Air Force was the only service that did not require such a system for all of its students in training status. Specifically, the Air Force does not require students in training status on JBSA-Ft. Sam Houston or JBSA-Randolph to travel in a buddy pair. This is disappointing, as the buddy pair system not only can reduce vulnerabilities for sexual assault, but also helps young servicemembers make better decisions. When I deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom as a captain, all servicemembers on our base were required to travel in pairs, including myself. As we continue to see sexual assault plague institutions around the country, it is my hope that the military will continue to take concrete steps to improve and become a leading example for how to effectively curb this problem. Therefore, I request that you consider making a buddy pair system mandatory for all Air Force personnel in a training status on Joint Base Sam Antonio. I appreciate your consideration of this request and look forward to hearing your thoughts on your decision. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst # # #
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today questioned President Trump’s nominee for Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon, at her confirmation hearing. Senator Ernst noted the need for regulatory reform to provide much-needed relief to our small businesses, which provide 97 percent of the jobs in Iowa. Additionally, the Iowa Senator stressed the importance of her legislation, the Prove It Act of 2016, which passed through the committee last year, and would increase transparency in the federal rulemaking process and incentivize agencies to work together to improve the quality of their small business analysis when writing a rule. Mrs. McMahon expressed interest in learning more about the Prove it Act, and committed to working with Senator Ernst to give small businesses a stronger voice in Washington. Click here or on the image below to see Senator Ernst’s full questioning. On the Prove It Act: ERNST: “Now, we sat down in my office and talked about a number of issues and one of the issues that I brought up as we sat down was a project that I’ve been working on over the last year, and it’s legislation that gives small businesses a stronger voice in the regulatory process, and it’s called the Prove It Act. “The legislation did pass out of this committee last year and we worked really hard with the folks at SBA in the Obama administration to get their input and feedback because the goal is to make sure that the bill is bipartisan and that it is a success. “So, we did talk about it and the purpose of the Prove It Act is to strengthen the voice of small business owners and provide incentives to agencies to improve the quality of their certifications and analysis when they’re actually writing a rule, and simply put, the Prove It Act says if there is a battle of analysis between different agencies on the economic impacts of a rule than there should be a third party that will step in, review the facts and then issue an objective assessment. “And as you know, the Small Business Office of Advocacy testified in front of this committee last year because they were in disagreement about the analysis that EPA and the Corps—the Corps of Engineers—had completed on the WOTUS rule and believed that the rule would have significant economic impact on small businesses. “And as well, with this Prove It Act, there were a number of organizations that supported it: the NFIB, the Chamber, and the Women Impacting Public Policy. All of those organizations supported it. “And can I get a commitment from you to work with me on this legislation and help implement it, especially given the desire by our President to make sure that we are reducing regulatory reform, especially on small businesses?” MCMAHON: “Senator Ernst, thank you very much, and I did enjoy our meeting, and when you talked to me about this legislation, I thought ‘Wow, isn’t that just a really common sense thing?’ And I think we just need more common sense in government. If you’ve got two sides that can’t agree, you have a referee, you have the third party that comes in. And I liked also what you were telling me about the bill, which is that it actually would make the agencies work together before it had to become like a public event and help with drafting the legislation, so I think that it’s a very good piece of legislation that I would like to learn more about, and look forward to working with you to make sure we can support our small businesses.” # # #
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement following President Trump’s executive actions to advance the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines: “I am thrilled to see this much-needed action today to advance the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines after years of unnecessary delays and red-tape from the Obama administration, which acted above the law. The construction of these pipelines will help create good jobs for the middle class and move us one step closer to energy independence. “Furthermore, conservation and natural resource development do not have to be mutually exclusive. I believe the United States can responsibly take advantage of its abundant natural resources while also emphasizing conservation. I look forward to working with the administration as we move forward on this and other projects to get our country moving again.” About the Keystone XL Pipeline: U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), was an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Keystone XL Pipeline Act. The Keystone XL Pipeline Act passed Congress with bipartisan support in 2015. The cross-border pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast. According to the U.S. State Department, oil would be transported safely with minimal impact to the environment, and cause no disruption to the development of Canadian oil sands. This project contains strong protections and will comply with federal, state and local authorities. The Keystone XL Pipeline sets up basic energy infrastructure for future needs and is necessary to the progress of our country. Construction of the pipeline will stimulate the American economy through the creation of 42,000 new construction jobs and add an estimated $3.4 billion to GDP. This project has been one of the most studied pipelines in history. There is broad-based support behind construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO. About the Dakota Access Pipeline: 1,172 mile project that would carry crude oil produced in the North Dakota Bakken region to southern Illinois. The pipeline is projected to carry 470,000 barrels per day The project was approved by four states (including Iowa) and has followed all the appropriate guidelines as it relates to the Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) Two courts denied the injunction requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe In the September 9th decision by Judge Boasberg, he wrote, “As previously discussed, Lake Oahe is of undeniable importance to the Tribe, and the general area is demonstrably home to important cultural resources. Even here, though, the Tribe has not met its burden to show that DAPL-related work is likely to cause damage. The Corps and the Tribe conducted multiple visits to the area earlier this year in an effort to identify sites that might be harmed by DAPL’s construction. While the Tribe identified several previously undiscovered resources during those visits, these sites are located away from the activity required for the DAPL construction. Ultimately, the Corps considered these findings and determined that they would not be affected by the permitted activity.” On page 48 of the same decision, “Plaintiff’s last point on the merits is that the Corps failed to offer it a reasonable opportunity to participate in the Section 106 process as to the narrow scope of the construction activity that the Corps did consider to be an effect of the permitted waterway activities. The factual proceedings recited in exhaustive detail in Section I.D., supra, tell a different story. The Corps has documented dozens of attempts to engage Standing Rock in consultations to identify historical resources at Lake Oahe and other PCN crossings. To the reader’s relief, the Court need not repeat them here. Suffice it to say that the Tribe largely refused to engage in consultations. It chose instead to hold out for more – namely, the chance to conduct its own cultural surveys over the entire length of the pipeline. In fact, on this record, it appears that the Corps exceeded its NHPA obligations at many of the PCN sites. For example, in response to the Tribe’s concerns about burial sites at the James River crossing, the Corps verified that cultural resources indeed were present and instructed Dakota Access to move the pipeline to avoid them. Dakota Access did so. Furthermore, the Corps took numerous trips to Lake Oahe with members of the Tribe to identify sites of cultural significance. Colonel Henderson also met with the Tribe no fewer than four times in the spring of 2016 to discuss their concerns with the pipeline. Ultimately, the Corps concluded that no sites would be affected by the DAPL construction at Lake Oahe, and the State Historic Preservation Officer who had visited that site concurred. # # #
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today at a hearing entitled “Defense Budget for Fiscal Year 2018 and Onwards” questioned defense policy experts on the importance of budgeting for and maintaining a strong relationship with Kosovo through the State Partnership Program (SPP), noting the key role Iowa’s National Guard plays in Kosovo’s security. Both Dr.Thomas Mahnken, President and Chief Executive Officer at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments as well as Dr. Lawrence Korb, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress agreed with Senator Ernst’s assessment of the critical need to budget for and maintain the State Partnership Program. Dr. Mahnken noted: “in an era, when, for good reason many of those relationships have been disrupted, I think things like the National Guard Partnership have really filled a key role and I think going forward establishing and maintaining those relationship with not just our allies, but our partners, is going to be all the more important. So, I’m fully behind programs like that.” While Dr. Korb reiterated that “this is very critical, we’re not in this alone. The threats that we face are global and we work with, you know, various countries at different times.” He also emphasized “the National Guard and the Reserves are not just strategic, they are operational, and I have fought that for years to get it funded. In fact, before this committee General Keane and I almost came to blows one time when he objected to my saying that, and I think that’s so critical because it is a total force. And as we found out during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even today, those folks can add to the capacity that we have.” Additionally, Senator Ernst went on to stress the importance of countering the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia, and questioned Dr. Mahnken on how we can better prepare our forces to combat the growing threat. Senator Ernst’s questioning today follows her efforts to strengthen the National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP) and her accomplishment in the FY2017 NDAA where she permanently authorized the program. It also continues her efforts to spotlight the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia. Click here or on the image below for video of Senator Ernst’s questioning. FULL TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: To you Dr. Mahnken, I know that while you were serving as a Navy reservist you deployed to Kosovo, and I want to thank you for that service very much. Kosovo is important to me personally, but also to the state of Iowa as well. Iowa’s National Guard and Kosovo work together through the State Partnership Program—a program that was started to strengthen our security in the region after the fall of the Soviet Union. I believe it is a great, great program with a lot of impact in that area. Last year, I was pleased that my efforts ensured this program was permanently authorized, and going forward, I want to make sure that it is properly funded. To you then, Dr. Mahnken, would you agree that we need to ensure our budget properly funds programs like the National Guard State Partnership Program, and then if you could in regards to Kosovo specifically, can you talk about how important it is to have those relationships in that area for their own security? DR. MAHNKEN: Thank you Senator and good catch on my bio, that seems like a lifetime ago but I do appreciate you bringing that back. Look, I do think that programs like that are very important and I do think they really leverage expertise in the reserve component and build enduring relationships. I think one of the problems we’ve encountered, one of the challenges that’s come with our operational deployment pattern over the last 15 years is a lot of habitual relationships have been disrupted. I mean, traditionally it wasn’t just National Guard Special Forces we relied upon to develop habitual relationships with partner militaries across the world, and in an era, when, for good reason many of those relationships have been disrupted, I think things like the National Guard Partnership have really filled a key role and I think going forward establishing and maintaining those relationship with not just our allies, but our partners, is going to be all the more important. So, I’m fully behind programs like that. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you very much, and I know Dr. Korb you had stated we needed to involve more partners and I think this is a way of developing some of those partnerships with nations that really share a lot of our same values. Do you have any input on that? DR. KORB: Well I do, and I think as Dr. Mahnken pointed out, this is very critical, we’re not in this alone. The threats that we face are global and we work with, you know, various countries at different times. At the beginning of the Obama administration, the United States worked with Russia to allow our supplies to go through Russia to go to Afghanistan, so there are areas that we can work on. We’ve had arms control agreements going back to the Nixon administration. The other thing that I think is important to keep in mind is that the National Guard and the Reserves are not just strategic, they are operational, and I have fought that for years to get it funded. In fact, before this committee General Keane and I almost came to blows one time when he objected to my saying that, and I think that’s so critical because it is a total force. And as we found out during the height of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and even today, those folks can add to the capacity that we have. SENATOR ERNST: …You’re the author of a book entitled “Strategy in Asia,” and one of my greatest concerns is the Islamic State and its spread into Southeast Asia. If you could talk a little bit about our forces and how you would say we budget and prepare those forces to deal with issues like ISIS in Southeast Asia. DR. MAHNKEN: Well I think that’s just one area where we have some very strong partners, and including non-allies like countries like Singapore, and Malaysia and others. But I think by and large, have been doing a very good job by bolstering the identity of their citizens and hardening their citizens against influence by groups like ISIL. So I think working with partners is absolutely key. I think we can play a role. I think largely that role is behind the scenes supportive, and I think that’s as it should be. But as I look at kind of the global campaign against ISIL, Southeast Asia largely still remains a success story and I want it to remain that way. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you gentlemen very much. Thank you Mr. Chair. Senator Ernst’s questioning today follows her efforts to call attention to the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia. ###
01.24.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Senate confirmed South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley to be the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations: “As the Governor of South Carolina, Nikki Haley has united the people of her state through compassionate and decisive leadership. When tragedy struck Charleston at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, Governor Haley stood firm in the face of hate and displayed the type of grace and integrity indicative of a strong and steady leader. She has also worked diligently to promote economic engagement around the world, traveling abroad on a number of economic development missions. “After years of rocky U.S. diplomacy abroad and the United Nations in dire need of reform, I look forward to the leadership Governor Haley will bring to this post, and I am pleased to support her confirmation as United States Ambassador to the United Nations.” # # #
01.23.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on President Trump’s executive action to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP): “I am disappointed in today’s executive action to withdraw the United States from TPP. With one in five jobs in Iowa dependent on trade, access to new markets is critical to our state’s economy. “However, we must not let this stop our country from pursuing increased trade opportunities for our exporters. With the growing demand for our agricultural products across the world, it is imperative that we ensure a level playing field for American farmers and manufacturers to have a fair opportunity to compete in these markets. “Under this new administration, I will continue to advocate for ways to work together toward a stronger trade agenda on behalf of Iowans.” Last December, Senator Ernst penned a column stressing the critical need for expanded trade opportunities for Iowa. # # #

Congressman Pompeo understands that the threats of ISIS and other radical groups continue to grow, and our nation faces increasing state threats like an aggressive Russia and Iran. His military experience and service on the House Intelligence Committee gives him the necessary background to lead members of our intelligence community as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I look forward to working with him to ensure the defense of our homeland and our interests abroad.” # # #

In both my meeting with him and at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, General Mattis made clear he understands the bigger picture and the ever-evolving threats our nation is facing. He will lead with strength and fortitude. Specifically, I was glad to hear General Mattis agreed to work with me to combat military sexual assault, and counter the rise of ISIS in areas like Southeast Asia. “Additionally, after having the opportunity to meet with General Kelly and discuss my priorities, I know he will serve our nation thoughtfully and with unwavering dedication. From pursuing Sarah’s Law to strengthening our security at home, he has vowed to protect the sanctity of our nation and its citizens. Importantly, General Kelly committed that he and his department will lead where the prior administration has failed. “I am grateful we were able move on these critical positions within the new administration on day one, and I look forward to working with and General Mattis and General Kelly in their new roles.”
01.20.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, President Donald J. Trump was sworn in at the United States Capitol during the 58th Presidential Inauguration. Following her attendance at the inauguration, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement: “Iowans and folks all across the country made their voices heard on November 8th, and now is the time for action. This is an opportunity to take the long-overdue steps that Iowans have been calling for, including: rolling back the WOTUS rule; pursuing Sarah’s Law; cutting wasteful spending; providing regulatory relief for our farmers, manufacturers and small businesses; ensuring our veterans get the timely, quality care they deserve; and strengthening our nation’s security and defense capabilities. “I look forward to taking all of this feedback that I receive from Iowans on my 99 county tour and working to translate it into action to ensure a government that works for everyone. “As we head into a new administration, Washington must put the will of the people ahead of partisan politics. This is an opportunity for folks to come together on a path forward to keep our nation safe and secure and to grow our economy. “I have been encouraged to hear that President Trump shares these priorities, and I look forward to working with him on advancing the issues most important to Iowans.”
01.19.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, issued a statement today following President-elect Trump’s announcement that he has nominated former Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue to be Secretary of the Department of Agriculture: “Throughout the last eight years, the picture painted of the state of our agriculture economy is far rosier than the realities on the ground,” said Ernst. “Iowans lead our nation in pork, soybean and corn production, and folks want strong leadership and forward thinking in the Department of Agriculture. Too often, agricultural priorities fall to the wayside, and we need to address head-on the many urgent issues that plague our farmers and producers. “As a veterinarian, Mr. Perdue understands the agriculture industry, and has executive branch experience as a former governor. I look forward to thoroughly vetting him for this position before our committee.” # # #
01.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today continued her questioning of President-elect Trump's nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, at his confirmation hearing. Senator Ernst expanded upon the importance of not moving the point of obligation within the RFS, and highlighted the overregulation of the EPA, specifically when it comes to the expanded definition of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule. Senator Ernst’s comments follow her earlier questioning of Mr. Pruitt on the importance of the RFS and the public distrust of the EPA. Click here or on the image below to watch the Senator’s questioning. On RFS (:01 - 2:00 mark): “The proposal to change the point of obligation under the RFS is an example of a regulatory change that would destabilize the policy environment if adopted, and what’s interesting with the point of obligation, we have two sides that normally oppose each other that have actually come together. So, both biofuel producers and the American Petroleum Institute oppose this change. Both groups. And, I would like to submit a letter for the record showing the united opposition to moving the point of obligation. Mr. Chair, if we could have that entered into the record. And, I’d like to revisit this, if you can, yes or no, as Administrator, will you oppose changes to the point of obligation?” On WOTUS Rule: (2:00 - 5:25 mark) “This is a chart of the state of Iowa, and as you can see, with the expanded definition as provided by the EPA, 97 percent of the state of Iowa is now considered Waters of the U.S. “So if you are in an area like mine, Southwest Iowa here—I live in a Waters of the U.S. Most of the state is covered by the Waters of the U.S. and I bring that up because in a moment I am going to show you another picture of the consequences of the EPA defining what a Water of the U.S. is. “Last Congress, this committee examined the scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction EPA and the Corps of Engineers claim today – even without the new WOTUS rule. The Committee found that EPA and the Corps are already expanding their jurisdiction using the concepts that they codified in WOTUS – they are just doing it by a case by case basis. “The jurisdictional claims that are already being made are very troubling. For example, the Obama EPA told the public that they will not regulate puddles. They will not regulate puddles. However, we learned that the Corps is already regulating puddles – by claiming that a puddle in a gravel parking lot is, in quotes, a ‘degraded wetland.’ A degraded wetland. “The Obama EPA also told farmers not to worry about being regulated because ordinary farming activities have a statutory exemption. We learned that the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice have decided that plowing is not an ordinary farming activity. Explain that to my dear deceased grandfather and my father, whose activities in farming include plowing. “According to the Obama administration, any plowing that pushes soil into furrows is not an exempt farming activity because the tops of plowed furrows can dry out. “According to a brief filed by the United States, in quotes, ‘The furrow tops now serve as small mountain ranges.’ Right there folks. Small mountain ranges. ‘These furrow tops now provide conditions that are not conducive to growth and development of wetland plant species. They are ‘mini uplands.’” “This is a picture of the ‘small mountain ranges’ from the government’s expert report. Mr. Pruitt, will you commit to me that if confirmed, EPA will work with the Corps and DOJ to make sure that federal agencies stop trying to regulate ordinary farming practices?” On Examples Of WOTUS Rule Hurting Farmers: Click here or on the image below to see Senator Ernst share examples of how WOTUS is hurting farmers. “I had gone through a series of examples of examples of overreach by the government with the expanded definition of Waters of the U.S. and the Ranking Member had stated that he had a letter that he had received from Administrator Gina McCarthy. And I have no doubt that she was answering those questions honestly because she wasn’t the one making the statements. The statements I presented came from the Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice. Now, I know this to be true, these are not as implied from some obscure website off of the internet done by some blogger in a basement somewhere. “The comments actually came from this committee. Case studies from this committee, September of 2016. These are examples of case studies from all across the United States, and I will cite just one that I opened up to: ‘…a landowner in California received an investigation letter from the Corpsinforming him that disking performed by a tenant farmer on his land may have resulted in anunauthorized discharge into WOTUS and that regulators had opened a case against thelandowner….’ “They are being implemented case-by-case… ‘…This letter came as a surprise to the landowner, who had been disking thisparticular site periodically over the past 15 years to sustain grazing conditions for his cattle, apractice he believed was ‘normal’ until he received this notice. The Corps told the landowner’sconsultant that “all disking for any purpose and at any depth within any ‘potential WOTUS’ is adischarge into WOTUS and in the absence of a permit represents an unauthorized discharge andviolation of the Clean Water Act.”’ “This is an actual letter from the Corps that was submitted to this committee—the EPW Committee—last year. So this is not made up. This is a very real impact to all Americans, and so I appreciate your stance, Attorney General Pruitt, that if you are confirmed, you will work with those that wish to continue farming normal practices. But this is not made up folks, and we just need everyone to understand that the Corps, the DOJ, and the EPA have gone beyond what we consider to be reasonable application of the law.” # # #
01.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today issued the following statement upon being named the Subcommittee Chair on Emerging Threats and Capabilities: “I am honored to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. As a combat veteran, I look forward to drawing on my experiences to implement policy that strengthens our nation’s defense capabilities, both at home and across the globe. “The threats of ISIS and other radical groups continue to grow, all while our nation faces increasing state threats like an aggressive Russia and Iran. We must utilize our international partnerships and allies as we confront these challenges; they too share the responsibility of improving global stability. Additionally, our military must be prepared to address the threats we currently face, as well as any potential future threats. “As Subcommittee Chairman, I will focus on technology advancements that can upgrade our servicemembers’ weapons systems, ways to counter Russia’s increased aggression, and addressing the rising threat of ISIS’s emerging activities in regions like Southeast Asia. In addition, I look forward to conducting oversight of leading Department of Defense commands, such as Special Operations Command. Each aspect of this subcommittee is of critical importance to our men and women in uniform as well as the safety and security of our nation.” Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities: Responsibilities: Policies and programs related to intelligence, counter-terrorism, and homeland security. Special additional areas: counter-narcotics, technology base and special operations. Oversight of budget accounts: Technology base RDT&E; operational test and evaluation; RDT&E and procurement supporting special operations; counterdrug programs; RDT&E supporting low-intensity conflict, and peacekeeping operations; combating terrorism; chemical and biological warfare defense; chemical demilitarization; train and equip programs.

01.18.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, today questioned President-elect Trump's nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, at his confirmation hearing. Senator Ernst began her questioning of Mr. Pruitt by stressing the importance of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and seeking his commitment to upholding the RFS in accordance with congressional intent. Ernst also recalled the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report that found the EPA’s social media campaign to promote its flawed expansion of the Waters of the U.S. Rule (WOTUS) broke the law and called on Mr. Pruitt to improve the relationships EPA has with hardworking folks across the country. To view the full video of the first part of Senator Ernst’s questioning, please click here or on the image below. Senator Ernst: As you know, Iowa is home to 43 ethanol refineries. We are the largest producer of ethanol west or east of the Missouri River. President-elect Trump reiterated his support for biofuels while he was campaigning across Iowa and all across the Midwest, and those areas of the country overwhelmingly supported his candidacy and led to his victory. And thank you for stating, once again, that you would honor his commitment to biofuels by carrying out the RFS as intended by Congress. Policy certainty is key for economic growth, and this is something we discussed in my office. Unfortunately, as a result of uncertainty surrounding the EPA’s renewable fuel volume targets in 2014, 2015, and 2016, second generation biofuel investment decreased and proposed projects moved overseas. Fortunately, the EPA has recently changed its course and released updated volume targets for the RFS that meet the levels prescribed by Congress. If confirmed as Administrator, what will you do to continue to provide certainty so that investment can continue to happen right here at home in the United States? Mr. Pruitt: You know Senator, as you indicated in our meeting, the importance of the infrastructure of the investment that has occurred in reliance upon the law that was passed in 2005 and updated in 2007, and as I indicated earlier to Senator Fischer’s question, the latitude discretion that has been given to the EPA Administrator with respect to waiving those statutory targets should be judiciously used. It shouldn’t be automatic, it should be something that the EPA Administrator seeks to comply to and adhere to because of the will of this body. So I think those waivers obviously are in order but with respect to market conditions, we have less consumption today, more fuel efficient vehicles; market conditions have changed since 2005. But despite that, the EPA Administrator should not use that to undermine or to somehow put into question the commitments made by this body in the Renewable Fuels Standard statute. Senator Ernst: Thank for you for your commitment to the RFS and the intention of Congress. The Iowa Senator also emphasized the need to repair the distrust the EPA has created with many Iowans: Senator Ernst: When I’m home in Iowa I host town halls all across the state and just want to hear what’s going on in their communities, and what I hear, without fail, at these town halls is that folks are frustrated with the EPA and the ‘gotcha’ mentality that has stemmed from the agency. My constituents tell me the EPA is out to get them rather than work with them and there is a huge lack of trust between many of my constituents and the EPA, and if we take a look specifically at the WOTUS rule, Iowans truly feel that the EPA ignored their comments and concerns, threw them under the rug and then just moved forward. We know now, the EPA relied on gimmicky mass emails and social media events to prop up their message and then used those tactics to insinuate that anyone who had reasonable concerns about the WOTUS rule are somehow in favor of dirty water, which is absolutely ridiculous, and this type of culture that was created under the Obama Administration has no place here. So Mr. Pruitt, what do you plan to do in your first days as the administrator to improve the relationships EPA has with hardworking folks across the country? Mr. Pruitt: Well, Senator, as I indicated in my opening statement, this paradigm that we live within today that if you’re pro-energy, you’re anti-environment, if you’re pro-environment, you’re anti-energy is something that I think is just a false narrative. We can do better than that. In fact, this country has shown for decades that we can grow our economy and be a good steward of our air, land, and water and we need to get back to that. Cooperative federalism is at the heart of many of the environmental statutes that have been passed by this body, and the reason for that is, it’s the states many times that have the resources, the expertise, and understanding what the unique challenges are for the environment and improving our water and our air – it’s not that they don’t care about it. Senator Whitehouse indicated a devolution of authority to the states would create a problem, that’s not what I’m advocating and I think we hear in the marketplace we need a partnership, a true partnership, between the EPA performing its role, along with states in performing theirs. If we have that partnership as opposed to punishment, as opposed to uncertainty and duress that we currently see in the marketplace, I think we’ll have better air, better water quality, as a result. Senator Ernst also recently met with Mr. Pruitt, where she outlined and discussed her priorities with the nominee.
01.17.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today met with President-elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of Energy, former Texas Governor Rick Perry. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “Governor Perry’s tenure leading one of our largest energy producing states gives him a unique understanding of how to cultivate our resources to maximize our country’s energy production. “I emphasized to Governor Perry the importance of continuing to develop wind energy and renewable fuels as we pursue a comprehensive energy approach that increases our country’s production and promotes energy independence. It is critical we work to cut through much of the red tape that hinders our energy production so we can create an environment for job growth, and provide safe and affordable energy for all Americans. I also took a moment to chat with Governor Perry about the many challenges that our 17 national labs address and solve every day, specifically the work done at the Ames Lab. “I enjoyed the productive conversation with Governor Perry and I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet him in the Senate for the position.” # # #
01.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), both members of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, introduced a resolution that expresses the need to vacate the Obama administration’s “Waters of the United States” or WOTUS rule. The resolution signifies the senators’ intent to continue working to roll back the harmful rule once the new administration takes office. “We all want clean air and clean water, but the federal overreach we saw with the WOTUS rule was completely unprecedented,” said Senator Fischer. “This rule would hurt all Nebraskans: families, communities, ag producers, and businesses. This resolution signifies our intent to quickly get to work to stop WOTUS in its tracks once the new administration takes office.” “I’ve heard from farmers, manufacturers, and small business owners across the state of Iowa about the confusion and burdensome red-tape the expanded WOTUS rule creates, and the urgency for it to be scrapped immediately,” said Senator Ernst. “That’s why I led an effort in 2015 to disapprove this rule. It is imperative we relieve hard-working Americans from this power grab, and allow Iowans to care for their land without the heavy hand of the EPA determining their every move. Today’s action reaffirms that Iowans’ voice will be heard in Washington and stresses the need to protect our rural communities from this federal overreach.” The senators’ resolution expresses a sense of the Senate that the final rule expanding the definition of WOTUS must be withdrawn or vacated. It also recognizes that the Clean Water Act (CWA) is critical to protecting water resources, but the final WOTUS rule goes too far, blatantly violating the original intent of the CWA. In October 2015, the Sixth Circuit federal court of appeals issued a stay immediately blocking the implementation of WOTUS nationwide. The ruling demonstrates the dubious legality of the rule and further underscores the need for the rule to be withdrawn. Click here to read the text of the resolution. # # #
01.12.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today the United States Senate took a step toward repealing ObamaCare. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and Senate Committee on Finance will now work on advancing repeal and replace solutions. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after voting in support of this measure: “Throughout my 99 county tour across Iowa, I hear countless stories from Iowans facing premium increases, as well as skyrocketing out of pocket costs like deductibles and copays that they simply cannot afford. Folks have been demanding relief from ObamaCare, and made that clear when they sent me to Washington in 2014, and they reiterated that call in 2016. It’s time to act. “The action taken by the Senate is a step towards repealing this disastrous health care law. Iowans deserve affordable health care coverage that meets individuals’ and families’ needs, instead of Washington deciding what is needed in your health care plan. “As we work to repeal and replace this bill, I recognize that it is critical to have a stable transition period in place and to ensure that folks with pre-existing conditions are not denied coverage. “Moreover, we must provide choice and flexibility, instead of one-size-fits-all mandates and taxes. This can be done by making coverage more portable, allowing folks to buy insurance across state lines, and encouraging small businesses to come together to negotiate health plans. “Today marked an important step in repairing the damage caused by ObamaCare so we can replace it with affordable, patient-centered solutions.” # # #
01.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Cory Gardner (R-CO) re-introduced the Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act, paving the way for contraceptives to be sold over-the-counter without a prescription. Additionally, Congresswomen Mia Love (R-UT) and Barbara Comstock (R-VA) introduced the companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. The Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act incentivizes manufacturers of routine-use contraceptives to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to sell their products over the counter (OTC). These incentives apply to any contraceptive the FDA deems to be safe and effective for routine OTC use and available to adults over the age of 18. Additionally, the legislation repeals the Affordable Care Act’s restriction on the use of health, medical, and flexible savings accounts to purchase over-the-counter drugs without a prescription. "The Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act is straightforward: it gives women the ability to purchase contraception over-the-counter,” said Senator Ernst. “Women wear many hats in their increasingly busy, daily lives; they should have the ability to access routine use contraception directly from their local pharmacy. This bill provides them with the opportunity to do just that.” “It’s important that Congress adopt a modern and commonsense approach to contraception,” said Senator Gardner. “Selling safe and effective oral contraceptives over-the-counter to adults will inevitably drive down costs and afford women the convenience to access their medication on their time. Our legislation recognizes the need to make contraceptives affordable and accessible, and it’s time that Congress put politics aside to allow women the ability to make their own decisions about safe, effective, and long-established methods of contraception.” “American women deserve to have safe, affordable, convenient and effective options for contraceptives available to them without the expense and hassle of government barriers,” said Congresswoman Love. “This bill would provide more options and better access. It’s time to put women in the driver’s seat of their own health care decisions.” “I join Senators Ernst and Gardner and my House colleague Congresswoman Mia Love (R-UT), in support of legislation to make birth control pills available over-the-counter for adult women,” said Congresswoman Comstock. “Allowing over-the-counter sales of oral contraceptives would enhance women’s access, put decisions in their hands, modernize the health care system, and lower birth control costs. It is a common sense solution that could bring people together and help in ending birth control politics.” Key provisions of the Allowing Greater Access to Safe and Effective Contraception Act: Incentivizes manufacturers of contraceptives to file an application for a prescription-to-over-the-counter switch (Rx-to-OTC switch) by: o Allowing priority review for contraceptive Rx-to-OTC switch applications. o Waiving the FDA filing fee for contraceptive Rx-to-OTC switch applications. Makes these incentives available to: o Contraceptives intended for routine-use that, if found to be safe and effective for OTC use by the FDA, would be made available OTC to adults aged 18 and above. Allows women greater access and ability to save for their health care needs by: o Repealing the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) prohibition on the use of health savings accounts, medical savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts (FSAs) to purchase OTC drugs without a prescription. o Repealing the ACA’s annual limits on FSA contributions. # # #
01.11.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, issued a statement today following President-elect Trump’s announcement that he will nominate Dr. David Shulkin to serve as the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA): “Our nation has an important responsibility to ensure veterans receive the benefits they were promised and a quality of care we can all be proud of. We simply cannot turn our backs on those who served our country, or accept repeated failures from the department that cares for them. “Over the last few years, some of my priorities for veterans have included: improving access to mental health care to address the unacceptable, ongoing challenges with suicide and addiction issues, expanding access to telehealth, and ensuring the VA management is held accountable for the systemic failures at VA facilities across the nation. I will continue to push tirelessly for these improvements. “Dr. Shulkin must be willing to take the significant steps needed to vastly improve the department and honor our commitment to veterans and I will be thoroughly vetting him for this position.” ###
01.10.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today met with President-elect Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Army, Vincent Viola, a former U.S. Army infantry officer. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “Mr. Viola’s military experience allows for an invaluable foundation and an understanding of the needs of our soldiers defending our freedoms across the globe. “I took the opportunity to talk with Mr. Viola about how he intends to seek out ways to better leverage our forces and ensure soldiers have the best equipment possible. I made sure he is aware of the unique capabilities in the National Guard that could be better utilized in our nation’s defense. With threats growing across the world, we must ensure we are leveraging our forces wisely and efficiently. Our soldiers deserve the best equipment in a cost effective and timely manner in order to achieve our mission and return home safely. “As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look forward to continuing the discussion of these priorities and more while thoroughly vetting Mr. Viola for this position.” Senator Joni Ernst meets with Mr. Vincent Viola. ###
01.06.2017	U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today met with President-elect Trump's nominee to head the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), U.S. Representative John Michael “Mick” Mulvaney of South Carolina. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “It was great to meet with Representative Mulvaney who has a track-record of standing firm in his belief of smaller government and more accountability to the American people. “As we discussed ways to make the federal government more efficient and accountable, I asked for him to ensure the implementation of my bipartisan Program Management and Accountability Act that was signed into law by President Obama last month. This legislation has the potential to save billions of taxpayer dollars by requiring the federal government to utilize best practices from the private sector so we can increase accountability and prevent the lax oversight that leads to headline grabbing government failures. Streamlining operations procedures is one of the many ways we can eliminate waste in the federal government and it’s my hope that Rep. Mulvaney would push this initiative in this new administration. “Rep. Mulvaney and I share a commitment to restore integrity, fiscal responsibility, and efficiency in the federal government. I look forward to continuing the vetting process for Rep. Mulvaney and ensuring he will provide a common-sense fiscal blueprint for our nation moving forward.” Senator Joni Ernst meets with Representative Mick Mulvaney. ###
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and Ben Sasse (R-NE), today re-introduced Sarah’s Law – legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed nearly one year ago by a drunk driver in the country illegally – in the 115th Congress. Since first introduced in June 2016, support for Sarah’s Law has grown with the addition of new original cosponsors: Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pat Roberts (R-KS), John Thune (R-SD), Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Jim Inhofe (R-OK). Congressman David Young (R-IA) will lead a House companion bill. “It is unconscionable that nearly one year after Sarah’s death, Edwin Mejia remains at-large, and the fact remains that today U.S. immigration law does not require federal immigration authorities to detain those here illegally who harm American citizens,” said Senator Ernst. “Although nothing can bring Sarah back to her family or heal the wounds of such unimaginable loss, we have an obligation to the American people to ensure that no citizen falls victim to this injustice again. Sarah’s Law is about honoring Sarah, and her legacy; I have already had conversations with the incoming administration, and am hopeful that they will work with Congress to pursue this legislation and finally get some long-overdue justice for the Root family.” “No family should be forced to endure the pain that the Roots have felt since last year,” said Senator Grassley. “First, young Sarah’s life was cut short by an immigrant who disregarded the rule of law and decided to get behind the wheel after drinking. Then the Obama Administration refused to take custody of Sarah’s killer because it didn’t consider him a priority, allowing him to disappear into the shadows. The Roots have been robbed of their daughter, and at least for now, they have been robbed of justice. Our legislation, named in Sarah’s memory, will ensure that those who harm or kill Americans will be taken into custody and removed while also ensuring that victims and their families get the information they deserve from the government as they pursue justice.” “Almost one year after Sarah’s tragic death, our prayers are with the Root family,” said Senator Fischer. “We’re continuing our efforts to address the failed policies that allowed Sarah’s killer to escape. Through Sarah’s Law, Congress can help keep our families and our communities safe.” “Mr. Mejia has been on ICE’s Most Wanted List for more than nine months — that’s time he should have been behind bars,” said Senator Sasse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. “Congress has an opportunity to make sure this never happens again. Sarah’s Law would make it absolutely clear that ICE must immediately detain any illegal alien who kills someone.” “We are sadly hearing of these instances far too often,” said Senator Roberts. “If the Obama administration won’t protect our citizens, Congress will make it clear illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes will be detained. We must do everything possible to prevent the pain Sarah’s loved ones and too many others have endured.” “Sarah Root’s story is a heartbreaking one, which is why I support sensible immigration reforms like Sarah’s Law that can help ensure justice is served and our communities are made safer,” said Senator Thune. “I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the Trump administration to enact these necessary changes so our immigration system operates more efficiently.” “The failure to fix America’s broken immigration system puts lives at risk and justice out of reach,” said Senator Moran. “Sarah’s Law has the potential to reduce crime and save lives. This legislation would require the federal government to better prioritize its responses to individuals charged with violent crimes while in this country illegally – correcting current policies that leave unchecked criminals free to reoffend. I am glad to join this effort to keep our communities safe and will push for the bill’s passage in the 115th Congress.” “The last eight years under the Obama Administration have seen a disastrous deterioration of the rule of law and an unwillingness to justly prosecute those who break our laws,” said Senator Cruz. “But now we have an extraordinary chance to reverse that course, secure our border, and strengthen our immigration laws. I am proud to be a sponsor of Sarah’s Law and other similar law enforcement measures that will deter illegal immigration, and ensure those who disregard our immigration laws and bring harm to our citizens are held accountable.” “It is unacceptable that after a tragic event in which a young life was taken too soon, the out-going administration failed to act and an illegal alien with a criminal record now remains at-large,” said Senator Inhofe. “Sarah’s Law gives us an important opportunity to reform the immigration system and bring about due justice. My thoughts and prayers are with Sarah’s family and I look forward to advancing this legislation that protects our communities.” About Sarah’s Law: Sarah’s Law is in honor of Sarah Root, a twenty-one year-old Iowan who was struck and killed in Omaha by Edwin Mejia, who entered the country illegally and was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit – and drag racing. Following state criminal charges of motor vehicle homicide and outreach by local law enforcement, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) declined to use its discretion to issue a detainer, and Mejia subsequently posted bond and has since disappeared. Now, nearly one year later, Mejia still remains at-large. Sarah’s Law would amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the federal government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally, violated the terms of their immigration status, or had their visa revoked and is thereafter charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. The legislation also requires ICE to make reasonable efforts to identify and provide relevant information to the crime victims or their families. Under this law, Mejia would have been detained, not been allowed to flee from justice, and the Root family would be kept up-to-date on Mejia’s status and federal immigration authorities’ efforts to remove him from the United States. # # #
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, today met with President-elect Trump's Small Business Administration nominee, Linda McMahon. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “Ms. McMahon and I had a productive meeting discussing the challenges America’s small businesses are facing, and sharing our visions for a path forward. Small businesses make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa, and I enjoyed hearing how Ms. McMahon will go to the mat for our small businesses and work to create an environment where job creators and our entrepreneurs can thrive again.” “We also discussed my legislation, the Prove It Act, which gives small businesses a stronger voice in the regulatory process. The Prove It Act is one step we can take to provide regulatory relief for some of America’s most dedicated and hard-working entrepreneurs. “As a member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I look forward to continuing the vetting process for Ms. McMahon and ensuring that small businesses have a strong voice in the new administration." Senator Joni Ernst mmets with Ms. McMahon ###
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on “Foreign Cyber Threats to the United States”, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed the Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command and Director of the National Security Agency, Admiral Michael Rogers, on the use of National Guard units’ cyber capabilities. During her questioning, Senator Ernst followed up with Admiral Rogers from a previous hearing where he was unable to answer why the Department of Defense (DOD) was not tracking National Guard Cyber Capabilities in a new system, as required by law and highlighted by a recent Government Accountability Office report. Today, Senator Ernst reiterated her question about whether DOD is able to track these capabilities, and Admiral Rogers responded, “...I am the first to acknowledge that after talking to OSD and the services, that I don’t have a good answer for you and I will get you something in writing in the next week or so.” “OSD” refers to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Senator Ernst responded: I do appreciate that because – how long have the United States been experiencing [cyber]attacks from entities outside of the United States? Admiral Rogers: You could argue that we’ve been experiencing these attacks in the cyber domain for about over a decade. It’s gotten worse. Senator Ernst: A decade. But we have taken the steps of developing Cyber Command and the capabilities that exist in both our reserves, National Guard, and active component units to become faster and more agile. We need to know what those capabilities are. So – if you have a solution to that on how we can track those capabilities, we need to figure that out. Many of these units have the capability of defending our networks and yet we’re not utilizing those capabilities and we don’t know where they exist. Admiral Rogers: Please don’t take from my comment that we don’t think the role of the Guard and Reserve is important. If you look at the last 12 months, we’ve got two cyber protection teams from the Guard that have been mobilized, we’ve brought online, in the Guard and Reserve, national mission teams for the first time in the last year. It’s great to see how the Guard and Reserve are developing more and more capability. That’s a real strength for us. Senator Ernst: Absolutely. And we will continue to see those develop even more in the future, but you need to be able to utilize those capabilities that exist out there. You know that many of our best soldiers in the National Guard and Reserve come from the private sector – I know this from some of my own Guardsmen that worked full time in computer technology and cyber technology. You stated in September that you were trying to figure out how better to leverage the National Guard. Do you have a response for that now? Have you thought of ways that we might be able to use those Guard units more readily? Admiral Rogers: This is a topic I was just talking to General Lengyel, the Director of the Guard Bureau, a few weeks ago. Saying ‘Hey look, this something in 2017 I want us to sit down on.’ I think there are a couple specific mission areas where the capabilities of the Guard and Reserve are really well optimized. I’d be the first to admit the answer can’t be, every time we just throw the active component at this. I don’t think that’s an optimal approach for us to do in business. You will see this play out for us in 2017. We got to work throughout the title 32 versus title 10 issue. What role, what’s the right way to do this? Do we put it within the defense support to civil authority construct? I like that because it’s a framework that we already have. I am a big fan of let’s not reinvent the wheel when it comes to cyber. How do we take advantage of structures we already have and authorities that are already in place? That’s one thing you’ll see some specific changes on within the department, we are working through right now that you’ll see on the policy side. Senator Ernst: I appreciate it. I look forward to working with you on that, Admiral Rogers. To watch Senator Ernst’s questioning, click here or the image below. ###
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, today met with President-elect Trump's Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) nominee, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Following the one-on-one meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “I greatly appreciate Mr. Pruitt’s time today to visit about a number of important issues to Iowans from scrapping the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, to our state’s wind energy industry, to upholding the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in accordance with congressional intent. “In regards to RFS, it is imperative that the law is followed. I received assurances from Mr. Pruitt that he intends to do so, and I will hold him to that commitment. I was pleased to hear that President-elect Trump made it clear to Mr. Pruitt that he cares about the RFS. Mr. Pruitt told me in our meeting that the role of the EPA is to enforce the law as written by Congress, and not undermine the RFS. "I stressed that a strong and robust RFS encourages consumer choice, investment, and innovation. The RFS is a major driver of alternative fuels and economic development, and I will always protect and promote it in the Senate. “We also discussed increasing concerns over the environmental regulations coming out of the EPA. Overall, we had a thoughtful conversation about the need to do everything possible to fix these federal overreaches and get the EPA back on track to operating within the congressional intent of our laws, acknowledging the federal-state partnerships that exist and faithfully considering the comments of the public. “As a member of the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works, I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet him for this position and ensuring he will focus on these objectives of major importance to Iowans." Senator Ernst also invited Mr. Pruitt to Iowa to visit an ethanol plant and see the impact WOTUS could have on farmers, landowners and small businesses. Similarly, Senator Ernst previously invited the current EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer.
01.05.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) has co-sponsored the Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act in the 115th Congress which requires Congress to carefully review and approve major rules and regulations issued by federal agencies that have an economic impact of $100 million or more annually. “Over the last eight years, we have seen unelected bureaucrats morph the congressional intent of our nation’s laws to impose economically harmful regulations that ignored the concerns of communities most impacted by the rule,” said Ernst. “We must work to increase transparency and hold regulatory agencies accountable by allowing Congress to review sweeping rules and regulations that will impact folks across Iowa and the country. This legislation gives folks across the country a voice in the process and is a step in the right direction to rein-in burdensome, out-of-control government regulations that interfere in Iowans everyday lives.” The U.S. House of Representatives is likely to consider the REINS Act this week. About The REINS Act: Designates a ‘major rule’ as any rule or regulation that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines to have a yearly economic impact of $100 million or more and likely to result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment, or productivity. Requires Congressional approval before any new ‘major rule’ can be enacted. Requires Federal agencies to publish information in the Federal Register that led to the result of the rule, such as data, scientific and economic studies, cost-benefit analyses and information on how the public can access this information online. Gives Congress the ability to provide oversight to potentially burdensome new rules and regulations imposed by federal agencies. Restrains the power and broad discretion of federal agencies to impose significant ‘major rules’ without public discussion. Paves the way for transparency and accountability within the federal rulemaking process. ###
01.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today met with President-elect Trump's Secretary of Homeland Security nominee, retired General John Kelly. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued this statement: “I had a great conversation with General Kelly this morning about a number of issues critical to Iowans. “In particular, I stressed the urgent need to pursue Sarah’s Law, legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed nearly a year ago by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The problems with the current administration’s enforcement priorities and lack of engagement with victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is completely unacceptable. It is my hope that the new administration will work with Congress to implement this legislation. “Additionally, I underscored my increasing concerns over the rise of ISIS in Latin America, which I previously expressed to President Obama. We must not turn a blind eye to this emerging threat and the potential for international terror groups to exploit smuggling routes used by drug cartels. As the former Commander of the United States Southern Command, I sought assurances from General Kelly that the new administration would lead where this current administration has failed. “I am grateful for the thoughtful, productive dialogue today, and I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet General Kelly for this position in the Senate.” Senator Ernst meets with General Kelly###
01.04.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today joined U.S. Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Ben Cardin (D-MD) in introducing a Senate resolution objecting to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334, as well as all efforts that undermine direct, bilateral negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians for a secure and peaceful settlement. They are joined in this effort by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and Senators Michael Bennet (D-CO), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Bob Casey (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Dean Heller (R-NV), John McCain (R-AZ), Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Bill Nelson (D-FL), Rob Portman (R-OH), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), and Todd Young (R-IN). “By refusing to veto the UN Security Council’s resolution, the Obama administration failed to uphold its commitment to not only our ally, Israel, but our long-standing practice that allows and promotes direct, bilateral peace negotiations between the two parties,” said Ernst. “Our nation absolutely cannot tolerate one-sided, anti-Israel resolutions at the UN Security Council, and we must remain diligent in our efforts to stand with Israel. Today I stand with my colleagues in the Senate in expressing our utter disapproval of the Obama administration’s actions and its disregard for the historic practice of opposing and vetoing UN Security Council resolutions that attempt to dictate parameters on the peace negotiations.” A PDF of the resolution is available here. The resolution: Expresses grave objection to United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 (2016); Calls for United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to be repealed or fundamentally altered so that it is no longer one-sided and allows all final status issues toward a two-state solution to be resolved through direct bilateral negotiations between the parties; Rejects efforts by outside bodies, including the United Nations Security Council, to impose solutions from the outside that set back the cause of peace; Demands that the United States ensure that no action is taken at the Paris Conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict scheduled for January 15, 2017, that imposes an agreement or parameters on the parties; Notes that granting membership and statehood standing to the Palestinians at the United Nations, its specialized agencies, and other international institutions outside of the context of a bilateral peace agreement with Israel would cause severe harm to the peace process, and would likely trigger the implementation of penalties under sections 7036 and 7041(j) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 (division K of Public Law 114–113); Rejects any efforts by the United Nations, United Nations agencies, United Nations member states, and other international organizations to use United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to further isolate Israel through economic or other boycotts or any other measures, and urges the United States Government to take action where needed to counter any attempts to use United Nations Security Council Resolution 2334 to further isolate Israel; Urges the current presidential administration and all future presidential administrations to uphold the practice of vetoing all United Nations Security Council resolutions that seek to insert the Council into the peace process, recognize unilateral Palestinian actions including declaration of a Palestinian state, or dictate terms and a timeline for a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; Reaffirms that it is the policy of the United States to continue to seek a sustainable, just, and secure two-state solution to resolve the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians; and Urges the incoming Administration to work with Congress to create conditions that facilitate the resumption of direct, bilateral negotiations without preconditions between Israelis and Palestinians with the goal of achieving a sustainable agreement that is acceptable to both sides # # #
01.03.2017	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today met with President-elect Trump's Secretary of Defense nominee, retired General James Mattis. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “It was an honor to visit with General Mattis this afternoon. There is no question that he has served as an extraordinary leader in our military in the United States Marine Corps, and as the former Commander of U.S. Central Command and coauthor of the Counterinsurgency Field Manual. “During our meeting, we discussed a wide-range of topics, including my priority of the need to combat sexual assault in the military. We also talked about the many threats rising around the globe, including Asia and Europe. I look forward to asking General Mattis more questions and getting his public confirmation to work with me on my priorities during his upcoming confirmation hearing. I am extremely concerned about the rising threat of ISIS in areas like Southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as many other threats that the incoming administration needs to address. “As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I look forward to continuing to thoroughly vet him for this position and ensuring he will focus on these objectives and more in this position." Senator Joni Ernst meets with General James Mattis. ###
12.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – After traveling the state and hearing from Iowans firsthand on her second 99 county tour as Iowa’s U.S. Senator, Joni Ernst (R-IA) has worked to turn that feedback into results, wrapping up the year with a series of legislative initiatives and victories on behalf of Iowans, including five of her bills signed into law in 2016. “Throughout the year, I have seen firsthand the effects reckless government intrusions have on the lives of Iowans, and I have worked to make sure that Iowans’ voices are heard in Washington, D.C.,” said Senator Ernst. “This year, out of my seven bills that made it to the president’s desk, five were signed into law. The legislation I put forward focuses on Iowans’ priorities: honoring the service and benefits of our nation’s veterans and ways to improve their mental health care, cutting wasteful spending, keeping our nation safe, getting burdensome regulations out of the way, as well as finding solutions to make our government run more efficiently. I am pleased with the progress we have made, but there is a lot more work to do. I look forward to more improvements as we head into the next Congress.” In November, Senator Ernst completed her second 99 county tour as a U.S. Senator, traveling across the state and visiting farms, agribusinesses, hospitals, schools, manufacturers, small businesses and more. Ernst also met and visited with thousands of Iowans to hear their questions and ideas at town meetings and roundtable discussions. Click here to view the 2016 tour. In the 114th Congress, Ernst served on four Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship. Throughout 2016, Senator Ernst took on an active role within her committees. In addition to her committee work, Senator Ernst this year joined the Whistleblower Protection Caucus and the Post 9/11 Veterans Caucus. Additionally, Senator Ernst led and worked on a number of initiatives on behalf of Iowans: Agriculture: SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, Ernst held a hearing on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rural development programs and their economic impact across America. This marked the only subcommittee hearing held in the committee this year. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst and Senator Jerry Moran (R-KS) introduced the Agriculture Students Encourage, Acknowledge, Reward, Nurture (EARN) Act (S. 2774). The legislation amends the tax code to exclude from gross income the first $5,000 earned by students who are 18 years old or younger on agricultural projects completed under the supervision of 4-H or FFA. AG TOUR: In October, Senator Ernst visited over a dozen ag businesses, including family farms, to hear about the true state of the agriculture economy in Iowa. She visited with crop and livestock farmers, equipment dealers, farmer cooperatives, fertilizer manufacturers, processing plants and research facilities to listen to their concerns. Senator Ernst led a letter with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) to Treasury asking that USDA and FDA be included in the CFIUS review of the ChemChina – Syngenta deal. On May 17 they announced they would do so. During a Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hearing on “The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Current State of the Farm Economy,” Senator Ernst highlighted concerns with the USDA’s proposed Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) Rule that would inflict high costs on the livestock industry, and erect a barrier to young, beginning and small farmers’ ability to get into livestock production. Importantly, during Senator Ernst’s questioning, Secretary Vilsack agreed to provide a public comment period for stakeholders to express their updated concerns for the proposed GIPSA Rule if implemented by the administration. Senator Ernst (R-IA) supported the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, which is bipartisan legislation that creates a national standard for labeling of food containing biotechnology ingredients. Senator Ernst supported the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016 which included meaningful reforms that scale back some of the burdensome federal requirements for school lunches, return broad program oversight to local and state authorities, and safeguard taxpayer dollars. Budget/Spending: SIGNED INTO LAW: Senators Ernst and Heidi Heitkamp’s (D-ND) bipartisan legislation, the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act, was signed into law by President Obama. This bill takes an important step forward in making the federal government more productive and cost-effective by streamlining management procedures to increase accountability, and preventing cost overruns and lax oversight. In fact, this legislation has the potential to save billions of dollars that could otherwise have been wasted on large government programs that failed to meet their objectives. SENT TO PRESIDENT’S DESK (VETOED): The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act passed both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate with bipartisan support this year. This legislation would cut the perks and spending that subsidize wealthy former presidents’ lives to the tune of millions of dollars. However, President Obama vetoed this legislation, choosing to cost taxpayers money and benefit wealthy former presidents’ personal careers and post-presidency life. Beginning this year, every month, Senator Ernst gives out her “Squeal Award,” which highlights a Washington expense, program or concept that has proven to be wasteful and must be acted upon in an effort to hold Washington more accountable for their reckless actions. Click here to take a look at the award recipients. Education: PASSED SENATE: Senators Ernst and Grassley’s Iowa Community Colleges Resolution passed the Senate. The resolution offers congratulations to the community colleges of Iowa for 50 years of outstanding service to the state of Iowa, the United States, and the world. Throughout the year, Senator Ernst continued to stress at events the need to combat sexual assault on college campuses, urging passage of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. This bipartisan legislation would protect students, professionalize the response to and reporting of sexual assault cases, and provide colleges and universities with incentives to solve the problem of sexual assault on their campuses. Energy/Environment: PROVISION INCLUDED: In December, President Obama signed Congress’ water infrastructure bill into law, which includes Senator Ernst’s provision to urge the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the Cedar Rapids flood control project. Senator Ernst also secured a commitment for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the benefit-cost ratios for flood mitigation projects. Additionally, at her request, Senator Ernst met with the head of the United States Army Corps of Engineers to discuss and urge the prioritization for funding the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, as well as the outstanding Cedar Falls 408 permitting request for levee and floodwall system improvements. Senators Ernst and Grassley sent letters to the Army Corps of Engineers demanding answers on why they have neglected to complete flood mitigation projects in the Cedar Rapids region. The letters can be viewed here and here. Senator Ernst has also sent letters in support of requests for a federal major disaster declaration for eight northeast Iowa counties following the severe storms, heavy rain, and flooding that took place in Iowa. Throughout the year, Senator Ernst has been calling on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose 2017 ethanol and 2018 biodiesel Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) consistent with enacted law. Earlier this year, the Iowa Senator called for the EPA to follow Congressional intent when the proposed rule was initially released earlier this year. In addition, Ernst joined a bipartisan group of 39 senators in June, and sent a letter to the EPA encouraging the agency to set the RVO at the level directed by Congress. In November, after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their final Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVO) for 2017 at 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuel, meeting the requirements Congress approved in 2007, Ernst said, in part that she was “pleased the EPA has finally listened to the American people as well as the comments my colleagues and I have pushed forward, and set the final volume requirements for conventional biofuels for 2017 at appropriate and congressionally approved levels. The RFS is critical in reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and provides consumers with choices at the pump. Most importantly, it spurs investment and research in renewable fuels and supports our rural economy in Iowa.” Healthcare: PROVISION INCLUDED: The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) was signed into law this year. The bipartisan law focuses on equipping local law enforcement, health care stakeholders, and community groups with the tools they need to fight the opioid epidemic. As part of the debate on this issue, Senator Ernst raised the issue of barriers to the existing federal prescription drug take back program. Thanks to her efforts, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) will conduct a thorough review of the program and report to Congress with recommendations to address the barriers to participation that local pharmacies face. The request for the review was based on feedback from Iowa pharmacists, and these recommendations will help Congress to find appropriate ways to maximize participation in the program and ensure that this important service to the community is widely available. Senator Ernst supported the 21st Century Cures Act, a bipartisan law that provides additional critical resources to support medical research and includes important reforms that will help patients and their families access new and innovative medicines and devices more quickly. The 21st Century Cures Act also marks important progress in addressing the need to improve access to mental health and substance use disorder services. By promoting more strategic planning among federal programs and improving grant programs that provide community based services, this law will help ensure folks can get the care they need. Senator Ernst also supported a number of bills this Congress focused on ensuring access to health care services for rural America. Several of these bills were included in the 21st Century Cures Act, including an extension of the rural hospital demonstration program, regulatory relief for critical access hospitals, and temporary relief for medical suppliers from Medicare reimbursement cuts. Homeland Security: FIELD HEARING: In addition, Senator Ernst led a field hearing with Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) entitled “From Crop to Craft Beer: Federal Regulation’s Impact on America’s Food and Agriculture” in Dubuque. Throughout the hearing, the senators heard from Iowa and Wisconsin farmers and businessmen that regulations often have unintended consequences that harm Americans in unforeseen ways. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst introduced Sarah’s Law along with Senators Grassley, Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Ben Sasse (R-NE). This legislation honors Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed earlier this year by a drunk driver in the country illegally. Sarah’s Law would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and is charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Joining Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Johnson (R-WI), Senator Ernst helped introduced the Fair Chance Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would give formerly incarcerated people a fairer chance at securing employment by prohibiting federal contractors and federal agencies from asking about the criminal history of a job applicant until an applicant receives a conditional offer of employment. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: A bipartisan bill, the Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of 2016, introduced by Senators Ernst, Johnson (R-WI), and Booker (D-NJ) aimed at combating the use of social media by terrorists was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. A version of the bill was included in the FY 2017 Department of State Operations Authorization and Embassy Security Act, which the President signed into law this month. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst introduced the Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act which passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. This legislation aims to help reduce the risk of another breach like the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach and protects the personal information of American citizens. This bill ensures that federal government agency heads have the tools they need to secure their IT networks through restricting access to certain websites on government computers without first having to engage in collective bargaining with federal employee unions. PASSED COMMITTEE: The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee passed two measures introduced by Senators Ernst and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) to strengthen security against foreign fighters traveling into and out of the United States. Senator Ernst supported the Backpage.com Civil Contempt Resolution, legislation that directs the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce the subpoena issued by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (“PSI”) to the CEO of Backpage.com, a website that has been under investigation for nearly a year due to its reported links to human trafficking. Senator Ernst also backed the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act, legislation that requires the FBI, working with DHS and the intelligence community, to ensure that any refugee seeking to enter the United States does not pose a security threat to American citizens. Jobs, Economy, and Regulations: SENT TO PRESIDENT’S DESK (VETOED): Senator Ernst’s resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to end the expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule passed the House with bipartisan support. This legislation would scrap the expanded WOTUS rule and would stop this blatant EPA power grab. Ultimately, President Obama sided with an unchecked federal agency over the livelihoods of those in rural communities who say this rule must be stopped, and vetoed the legislation. Iowa's U.S. Senators Ernst and Chuck Grassley, along with Representatives Rod Blum (R-01), David Young (R-03) and Steve King (R-04) recently sent President-elect Donald J. Trump a letter urging him to scrap the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule in the first few days of his presidency. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: In a bicameral effort, Senators Ernst and Ron Johnson (R-WI) joined Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) in introducing legislation to prevent a surge in costly federal regulations as a United States President’s term comes to a close. The Midnight Rule Relief Act would protect hard working families and small businesses from significant regulations that are often politically motivated and imposed between Election Day and Inauguration Day. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: The Prove It Act of 2016 passed out of the Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee. This legislation introduced by Senator Ernst increases transparency within the federal rulemaking process, especially when there is a disagreement between agencies over the economic impact of a rule on small businesses. In particular, this proposal designates a third party to review the facts and issue a publicly available objective assessment. If it is determined that the proposed rule would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the bill requires the federal agency to go back and complete additional regulatory analyses. Senator Ernst supported the Protecting Workplace Advancement and Opportunity Act as well as a congressional resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res.34) to reverse the Department of Labor’s one size fits all overtime regulatory rule. Implementation of the regulation has since been temporarily halted by the courts. National Defense: SIGNED INTO LAW: Several of Senator Ernst’s provisions were included in the final Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Summary of Ernst Measures Included in the NDAA: Seeks to end retaliation against sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military. Creates a pilot program for military lawyers to enhance criminal justice within the military and provide more effective defense and prosecution for servicemembers. Implements a delay in requiring the National Guard to convert some of its Dual Status Military Technicians to federal civilian status. Makes permanent the National Guard State Partnership Program which enhances our military and diplomatic efforts around the world. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the career progression track for female servicemembers. Requires the DoD to report on its acquisition of contracts which would enhance congressional oversight to ensure the DoD is getting the best value for taxpayer dollars. Seeks to reduce drunk driving and provide employment opportunities to military families by requiring the DoD to develop a policy to afford base access to transportation companies. Enhances whistleblower protections for those servicemembers and DoD employees who report wrongdoing at the DoD. Requires the DoD to report on the progress of women in previously closed combat positions. Provides funds for much needed renovations at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Provides funds to the Army and Marine Corps to enhance the small arms and ammunition capabilities of our Soldiers and Marines. Requires a review of the Defense Intelligence Enterprise and seeks to eliminate unnecessary overhead, waste, and mismanagement, as well as to enhance intelligence support to our warfighters. Maintains suicide prevention programs in the Army Reserves and National Guard. Improves federal government program and project management practices by requiring the development of government wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program management. SIGNED INTO LAW IN NDAA: Bipartisan legislation, Military Retaliation Prevention Act, introduced earlier this year by Senators Ernst and Claire McCaskill (D-MO) to build on historic reforms to curb sexual assaults in the military and better protect survivors from retaliation cleared a key hurdle with its inclusion in the annual National Defense Authorization Act. PASSED SENATE: Senator Ernst led a bipartisan bill to reauthorize leasing authority at arsenals passed the Senate. Additionally, Senators Grassley , Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) also supported the Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority which would reauthorize the leasing authority at Department of Defense arsenals and military instillations for unused office space to outside tenants. PASSED SENATE: Senators Ernst, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and Marco Rubio’s (R-FL) resolution expressing the need for U.S. support and assistance to arm the Kurdish Peshmerga passed the Senate. PASSED SENATE: Senator Ernst introduced a resolution to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), which passed the Senate unanimously. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst joined Kirk (R-IL), Grassley and Durbin (D-IL) in introducing legislation to expand manufacturing opportunities for Army arsenals. The Army Arsenal Revitalization Act, S. 2516, would provide Army arsenals, such as Rock Island Arsenal, the tools they needed to be more competitive, including the ability to adjust their own labor rates and to better seek new opportunities to compete for manufacturing contracts within the Department of Defense (DoD). Senator Ernst, along with Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), David Perdue (R-GA), and Mike Rounds (R-SD), raised serious concerns about the need for support of the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) continued care and shelter for hundreds of thousands of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) as they fight to combat ISIS on the ground. The senators called on the State Department to enhance its efforts to engage American allies in Baghdad and the broader Middle East to secure appropriate resources for the KRG. Through her position on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Ernst raised questions and discussed the military’s implementation timetable of their gender integration policy. INTRODUCED RESOLUTION: Following the announcement that U.S. special operations forces conducted a raid which resulted in the capture of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) leader, Senator Joni Ernst joined several of her fellow senators in introducing a resolution to detain ISIS fighters at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst joined her senate colleagues in introducing the Detainee Transfer Transparency Act, legislation that would require the Secretary of Defense to make available to the public the intended transfer or release of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba at least 21 days in advance. Senator Ernst (R-IA) supported the bipartisan North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, which expands sanctions. Senator Joni Ernst supported the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which would extend for 10 years sanctions authorities against Iran before they expire at the end of the year. Over the last several months Senator Ernst has been raising serious concerns to the Obama administration over the growing influence of ISIS in Latin America, and Southeast Asia, urging him to take action. Poverty: A group of conservative Senators this year launched the Senate Opportunity Coalition, a new initiative aiming to ensure every family across our nation has access to the American Dream. Senator Ernst and a group of senators who have joined together in an effort to relieve poverty and ensure opportunity by sharing first hand experiences from their constituents, highlighting the issues facing low-income families, and working towards conservative solutions to make sure every American has the chance to succeed. Protecting Life: Senator Ernst led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell expressing opposition to the Department’s new proposed rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program. The letter questioned HHS’ assertion that providers with a reproductive health focus are more “effective” than other health care providers which offer more comprehensive care for women and men. This dubious claim, if pushed through, would all but establish a nationwide mandate that these more narrow providers receive priority for the receipt of Title X subawards - at the expense of other entities like comprehensive primary care providers and community health centers. In its final rule, HHS acknowledged its inability to measure the “effectiveness” of providers. Following Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s decision to refer the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, its affiliates, and fetal tissue procurement organizations to the FBI and the Department of Justice for an investigation into whether they engaged in the buying and selling of harvested organs of unborn babies in violation of federal law, Senator Ernst reiterated the critical need for federal funding to be redirected to other eligible providers of women’s health care, such as community health centers and hospitals which provide greater preventative and primary health care services. Senator Ernst addressed tens of thousands of people from across the country at this year’s March for Life rally. At the rally, Senator Ernst discussed this year’s theme: “Pro-Life and Pro-Woman Go Hand-In-Hand.” Second Amendment: From the start of the year, Senator Ernst pushed back against President Obama’s executive actions that would restrict law-abiding Iowans' Second Amendment rights. Ernst stated her opposition to the president’s overreaching and unilateral actions and stressed that the American people must have a voice through their elected representatives in Congress. CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the Social Security Beneficiary 2nd Amendment Rights Protection Act CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst also co-sponsored the Export Control Reform Act of 2016. Seniors: INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senators Ernst, Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced the Credit for Caring Act, which would provide up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit to working family caregivers for qualified expenses. According to AARP, there are an estimated 40 million family caregivers in the United States, and 317,000 in Iowa. Most of these caregivers spend approximately 18 hours per week providing critical support to a family member. This bipartisan legislation ended the year with 11 Senate cosponsors (eight Democrats and three Republicans). The Credit for Caring Act has also earned the support from: AARP, Association of University Centers on Disabilities (AUCD), Autism Speaks, Autism Society, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Caregiver Action Network, Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness - Altarum Institute‎, Family Caregiver Alliance - National Center on Caregiving, Family Voices, Home Care Association of America, Lutheran Services in America, Lutheran Services in America Disability Network, National Alliance for Caregiving, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, National Council on Aging, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and The Arc. Trade: Following the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), Senators Ernst and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) led a bipartisan letter along with Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Al Franken (D-MN), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), John Thune (R-SD), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) to United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asking for increased efforts to end discrimination against American turkey exports by addressing unscientific import requirements imposed by two U.S. trading partners. In December, the USDA responded, and was grateful for the advice and support, and noted that they will continue to work on removing the unscientific barriers during future discussions with these trading partners. In a recent column, Senator Ernst stressed the important need for expanded trade opportunities for the state. Transportation: The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, which reauthorizes Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) programs, passed with Senator Ernst’s support. CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst signed on as an original co-sponsor of Senator Gary Peter’s (D-MI) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Mission Protection Act. This bipartisan legislation prevents the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from disqualifying an airport for an Airport Improvement Project grant solely because the airport provides a nominal lease to a military component. Ultimately, part of this legislation was included in the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill. Additionally, the House version of this legislation was signed into law. Senator Ernst questioned Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator, Peter V. Neffenger, in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing regarding wasteful spending at TSA and the impact on the agency’s ability to address long security lines while at the same time keeping our nation safe. Following reports exposing the TSA’s expenditure of tens of thousands of dollars on a mobile application called the “randomizer” that simply shows an arrow on the screen of an iPad telling passengers to go to a right or left security line, the Iowa Senator highlighted this irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars in April with her monthly Squeal Award to highlight government waste. Veterans: SIGNED INTO LAW: In an overdue victory for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), President Obama signed bipartisan, bicameral legislation into law to restore the inurnment rights of the WASP at Arlington National Cemetery. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Congresswomen Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Susan Davis (D-CA) offered this legislation to return the right to these heroic women. SIGNED INTO LAW: In June President Obama signed into law the Iowa delegation’s legislation to name a Cedar Rapids post office after Sergeant First Class (SFC) Terryl L. Pasker, an Iowa National Guardsman who was killed in action in Afghanistan. The Iowa Congressional delegation, led by Senator Ernst in the Senate, and Representative Blum (R-IA) in the House, introduced this legislation in March. SIGNED INTO LAW: A bipartisan bill, introduced by Senators Ernst and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) which would establish a patient self-scheduling appointment system at Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities was signed into law by the President. A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments. Other hospitals and health systems are now leveraging technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used. The bipartisan Faster Care for Veterans Act directs the Secretary of the VA to commence a pilot program under which veterans could use the internet to schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities. SIGNED INTO LAW: Bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Ernst, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) in the House, known as the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act (S. 2487), was signed into law. This bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify the most effective programs and approaches in reducing suicide rates among female veterans. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst introduced the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment (SAVE) Act, along with the support of Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). The bipartisan Military SAVE Act puts military sexual trauma (MST) survivors in control of their health care by giving them the opportunity, flexibility and discretion to choose treatment options that best suit their needs. INTRODUCED LEGISLATION: To reaffirm and revive our nation’s longstanding commitment to Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Families, Senators Ernst and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced legislation to re-issue the “Gold Star” stamp recognizing and honoring families who have lost a child or family member in service to the nation. The U.S. Post Office Department first issued a stamp honoring Gold Star Mothers in 1948. OFFERED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst offered amendments to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs including withholding all bonuses directed to executives of the benefits administration, and redirecting those funds toward reducing the veterans’ disability appeals claims backlog. Another amendment would have prohibited funding for the procurement of art work or art related consulting services, including new construction, until the Secretary of the VA alerts Congress that the appointment backlogs for veterans seeing primary care has been eliminated. She offered this proposal ahead of a report by a non-profit organization which states that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has spent $20 million on costly artwork between 2004 and 2014. Unfortunately, these amendments were ultimately not adopted. CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION: Senator Ernst was a co-sponsor of the No Veterans Crisis Line Call Should Go Unanswered Act. Offered by Congressman David Young (R-03), the legislation was signed into law. Senator Ernst continues to focus on ensuring Iowa veterans receive the timely quality care they deserve and is pushing for unanswered questions: Senator Ernst continues to press for answers over the deaths of Iowa veterans Brandon Ketchum and Mr. Curtis Gearhart. Senators Ernst and Grassley sent a letter and are demanding answers over the care given to veteran Alan Meisel. Senator Ernst visited the Iowa City VA to tour the facility. The Iowa Senator also held five veterans roundtables across the state to hear firsthand from veteran about their experiences and quality of care. Senator Ernst is seeking specific answers on the steps the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Michael Missal is taking to improve their review process of whistleblower complaints made through the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) Hotline. Senators Ernst and Jon Tester (D-MT) urged Secretary of Defense Ash Carter to address the growing rate of suicide among Guardsmen and women. ###
12.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after President Obama signed the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, which included several of her provisions. “The signing of the National Defense Authorization Act makes our government more efficient and provides our men and women in uniform with the critical and necessary tools to protect our great nation,” said Senator Ernst. “I am pleased that my provisions included in the bill will now be enacted into law, including sweeping reforms to modernize and streamline operations at the Department of Defense, as well as legislation I introduced with Senator Claire McCaskill to protect military sexual assault survivors from retaliation. I am grateful that this bipartisan effort will ensure our servicemembers are properly equipped to face the ever-evolving challenges at home and abroad.” Summary of Ernst Measures Included in the NDAA: Seeks to end retaliation against sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military. Creates a pilot program for military lawyers to enhance criminal justice within the military and provide more effective defense and prosecution for servicemembers. Implements a delay in requiring the National Guard to convert some of its Dual Status Military Technicians to federal civilian status.

12.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst announced her four Senate committee assignments for the 115th Congress. The Iowa Senator will serve on the following Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Environment and Public Works. Senator Ernst said of the committee assignments: “I am thrilled to continue working on the issues that impact Iowans in these respective committees,” said Ernst. “Throughout my time on the Senate Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship committees, I have worked to ensure Iowans’ voices and priorities are heard. I look forward to continuing to advocate on our state’s behalf to find ways to grow our agricultural economy, cut burdensome regulations, and ensure our nation remains safe and secure. “Additionally, my placement on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will allow me the opportunity to bring a greater focus on our state’s infrastructure needs, including the very critical flood projects, protecting against overreach by the EPA on things like WOTUS, and defending the RFS. I look forward to working with my colleagues and voicing Iowans’ concerns as part of the Environment and Public Works Committee in this next Congress.” The 115th Congress will begin on January 3, 2017. # # #
12.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced today she will kick off her 99 county tour for 2017 on Saturday, January 7th. The events below are open to the public. “Each year, one of my top priorities is to complete a 99 county tour of Iowa so I can hear directly from folks across the state,” said Senator Ernst. “As we head into the new Congress with a new president, I look forward to continuing to take all of the feedback I will receive from Iowans and translating it into action to ensure a government that works for all Iowans and all Americans.” Details for the events are as follows: Montgomery CountyMontgomery County Town MeetingSaturday, January 7, 20179:00 AM CTMontgomery County Family YMCA 101 East Cherry StreetRed Oak, IA Warren CountyWarren County Economic Development RoundtableSaturday, January 7, 201712:30 PM CTWarren County Administration301 North Buxton StreetIndianola, IA Madison CountyCoffee with JoniSaturday, January 7, 20172:30 PM CTNorthside Café61 East Jefferson StreetWinterset, IA At the end of each event, Senator Ernst will have a few minutes to speak with press.

12.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement after President Obama signed the Water Infrastructure Improvements Act for the Nation (WIIN) into law, which includes the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). This legislation includes her provision to urge the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the Cedar Rapids flood control project. “I am so pleased that the president has signed this important water infrastructure bill into law. This bill contains the authorization of Army Corps of Engineers’ projects that are important to Iowa for flood damage reduction and water resources infrastructure in addition to addressing the water quality issues many of our communities face across the country. Additionally, the legislation also includes my provision to direct the Corps to prioritize the Cedar Rapids flood control project. As I have made clear, the Corps must fulfill their obligation to assist in completion of this project to protect the people of Iowa from another disaster. Now, this law will direct the Corps to do so in a timely manner.” Senator Ernst also previously secured a commitment for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the benefit-cost ratios for flood mitigation projects. Ernst Provision Included in Section 1322 of the Bill: Section 1322 of the bill directs Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of four already-authorized projects for flood damage reduction and flood risk management. One of those four projects is the Cedar Rapids project. The Cedar Rapids project was previously authorized in the 2014 Water Resources Development Act so there is no need to reauthorize it. This provision does not create a new budget or spending authority. Rather, it emphasizes that this is an authorized project that should be completed. Ernst GAO Study Provision Secured: The study will examine the methodology and performance metrics used to calculate cost-benefit ratios and evaluate construction projects. The study will address: Whether and to what extent the current methodologies and performance metrics place small and rural geographic areas at a competitive disadvantage; Whether the value of property for which damage would be prevented as a result of a flood risk management project is the best measurement for the primary input in benefit-cost calculations for flood risk management projects; Any recommendations for approaches to modify the metrics used to improve benefit-cost ratio results for small and rural geographic areas; and Whether a reevaluation of existing approaches and the primary criteria used to calculate the economics benefits of a Corps of Engineers construction project could provide greater results for small and rural geographic areas without putting a strain on the budget of the Corps of Engineers. Water Resources Development Act Impact on Iowa: Authorizes a study of the levees along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers on a system-wide basis, to evaluate the flood damage risks on a basin-wide basis. This review was recommended by the Corps in a 2008 study and by the Secretary in a 2009 letter to Congress to address the fact that a rehabilitation of a levee at a single location often cannot be cost-justified but each location is an integral part of a levee system that provides essential flood protection benefits. Authorizes a study of the Dubuque local flood protection project for flood damage reduction. Allows the Army Corps of Engineers to increase the level of protection when rebuilding a levee if the additional costs are paid by the non-Federal interest and the Corps determines it is in the public interest. ###
12.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) released the following statements after their bipartisan legislation, the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act, was signed into law by President Obama. “I am thrilled that President Obama has signed our bipartisan Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act into law,” said Senator Ernst. “Iowans sent me to Washington with a mission to make the federal government less wasteful and more efficient, and the passage of this legislation is an important step in doing just that. The Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act reduces cost overruns and increases accountability to create a more productive government through better management procedures. I am pleased we were able to make meaningful progress in safeguarding our taxpayers’ hard-earned tax dollars, and remain committed to continuing to look for new ways to eliminate waste.” “Our bipartisan bill becoming law is a win for accountability and transparency. The federal government will now do more to make sure federal programs are well managed – saving taxpayers money and reducing waste,” said Senator Heitkamp. “It’s an important step for North Dakota communities and businesses that rely on federal programs, whether in agriculture, energy, or beyond. Good management practices can make all the difference in guaranteeing efficient, effective federal programs and making sure they are well implemented locally.” The signing of the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act marks the fourth piece of Senator Ernst’s legislation signed into law, and the sixth to be sent to the President’s desk, this year. Click here to read the bill text. About Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act: Establishes a leader within each agency that is focused on program management. Creates an inter-agency Program Management Council to drive improvements through portfolio reviews of agency programs and encourages communications between agencies and program management professionals. Requires the development of a specific job category with distinct qualification for project managers. Requires the federal government to adopt widely-accepted program management best practices and standards. Requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report three years after the bill’s enactment on its overall effectiveness and impact on program management in the federal government. Works directly with the Department of Defense to improve their current procedures while making sure to not duplicate existing efforts. # # #
12.16.2016	A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments; other hospitals and health systems have developed technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used Klobuchar, Ernst bipartisan bill directs the Secretary of the VA to create a pilot program that will allow veterans to use available technology to self-schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities WASHINGTON, DC— U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced that their bipartisan bill that would establish a patient self-scheduling appointment system at Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities was signed into law by the President today. A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments. Other hospitals and health systems are now leveraging technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used. The bipartisan Faster Care for Veterans Act directs the Secretary of the VA to commence a pilot program under which veterans could use the internet to schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities. “Excessive wait times can put veterans’ lives at risk, but state-of-the art technology that makes it easier to schedule appointments already exists and is being used in other hospital systems,” said Senator Amy Klobuchar. “Our veterans have earned the right to use the same technology to schedule their medical appointments without unnecessary red tape and delays. Now that our bill has been signed into law, we have taken an important step forward in ensuring that our brave men and women who have sacrificed so much have access to the medical care they need and deserve.” “Our veterans shouldn’t be forced to wait weeks on end for an appointment at the VA,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “The Faster Care for Veterans Act will allow veterans to schedule and confirm their appointments at VA centers online, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Modernizing the appointment process means quicker and more accessible service. I am pleased that this new law will help to uphold our commitment to provide quality and timely care for our nation’s veterans.” Under the Faster Care for Veterans Act, the VA is required to commence an 18-month pilot program that would allow veterans to self-schedule, confirm, and modify outpatient and specialty care appointments in real time through the internet. This technology allows veterans to immediately schedule appointments canceled by other veterans and schedule appointments 24 hours per day, seven days per week. ###
12.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, today announced that she has nominated 32 Iowa students to be considered for appointments at United States service academies. “It’s a tremendous honor to nominate so many outstanding Iowa students who work tirelessly in their classrooms and throughout their communities to make a difference,” said Senator Ernst. “This nomination is the next step in their admissions process. Today, I congratulate and thank them for their leadership and willingness to take a significant step forward and serve their country.” Each year, Senator Ernst has the honor and responsibility of nominating Iowa students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The admissions process at the service academies is incredibly competitive and the Iowa Senator encourages students to apply for more than one academy.

Senator Ernst retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard after 23 years of military service. # # #
12.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley’s decision to refer the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, its affiliates, and fetal tissue procurement organizations to the FBI and the Department of Justice for an investigation into whether they engaged in the buying and selling of harvested organs of unborn babies in violation of federal law: “I appreciate the diligent work of Chairman Grassley and the Senate Judiciary Committee in conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations surrounding Planned Parenthood’s role in the procurement and transfer of the organs of unborn babies. While I am still reviewing the extensive report, I hope that the Committee’s decision to make a criminal referral to the FBI and Department of Justice for investigation and potential criminal prosecution will serve as an important step in Congress’s efforts to get to the bottom of the serious legal questions that have been raised. “Regardless, taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for roughly a half a billion dollars annually for an organization exhibiting such disrespect for human life. Rather, this federal funding should be redirected to other eligible providers of women’s health care, such as community health centers and hospitals which provide greater preventative and primary health care services regardless of a person’s ability to pay.” Last year, Senator Ernst introduced legislation to protect women’s health and defund Planned Parenthood (S.1881), which received bipartisan support. ###
12.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst released the following statement today after the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) released its interim final rule to broaden the scope of the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, which could cause harm to family farms in Iowa. “This is another last-ditch effort by this administration to insert big government into the livelihoods of Iowa’s hard-working farmers,” stated Ernst. “This GIPSA rule would inflict high costs on livestock producers and make it more difficult for folks to obtain credit to begin livestock farming. The pork industry alone is looking at an additional $350 million in annual costs as a result of this rule. “At a time when the realities on the ground are far different than the rosy picture painted by the USDA, the government needs to be giving our farmers certainty and stability to move upwards, instead of implementing costly rules that smother competition. “Additionally, the ‘midnight rule’ – a costly federal regulation that takes shape as a United States President’s term comes to a close – is a flawed and shameful approach to governing, and our family farms should not be the brunt of last-minute political gain. Earlier this month, more than 20 senate colleagues and I wrote President Obama and asked that his administration stop issuing non-emergency rules and regulations in the final weeks of his term. I am disappointed to see that today, our request was ignored, and it is politics as usual in Washington, D.C.” In September, Senator Ernst questioned USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack on the harmful effects farmers, ranchers, land owners, and consumers face in Iowa from costly and burdensome federal regulations on the agriculture industry, including the GIPSA rule that was implemented today. At the September hearing, Secretary Vilsack committed to Senator Ernst that he will provide a 60-day public comment period, allowing farmers and producers to submit their comments on the rule. In addition, earlier this year Senator Ernst, along with U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) introduced bicameral legislation to prevent a surge in costly federal regulations as a United States President’s term comes to a close. The Midnight Rule Relief Act would protect hard working families and small businesses from major regulations that are often politically motivated and hastily imposed between Election Day and Inauguration Day.
12.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued a statement today following President-elect Trump’s announcement that he has nominated retired General John Kelly to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security: “General Kelly has led an extraordinary career of service to our country with over four decades in the United States Marine Corps, and most recently as the Commander of the United States Southern Command,” said Ernst. “With the rise of ISIS in Latin America and continued concerns about the security of our borders, I am pleased our President-elect has chosen someone with such a deep level of experience to lead the Department of Homeland Security and address these challenges. I look forward to thoroughly vetting him for this position in the Senate.”
12.12.2016	WASHINGTON— U.S. Senator Joni Ernst joined more than 20 senators in writing to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert McDonald to urge him to comply with the Emergency Care Fairness Act (ECFA). The ECFA was enacted in 2010 and directed the VA to cover veterans with private health insurance when that insurance doesn’t cover the full amount of non-VA emergency care. Yet since 2010, the VA has not complied with the law, denying hundreds of thousands of veterans’ reimbursement claims for emergency care. Earlier this year, a federal court ordered the VA to write regulations that comply with the ECFA. In addition to urging the VA to comply with the law, the senators also requested that the agency fix its mistake and re-open all previously-denied claims. “Congress’s clear intent in passing the ECFA was to expand veteran eligibility for reimbursement for emergency treatment furnished to veterans in non-department facilities,” wrote the senators. “Specifically, congressional intent was to require the VA to act as a secondary payer for emergency treatment costs not covered by the veteran’s third-party insurance. It is evident that the VA has ignored congressional intent. Most troubling is the fact that those who are most affected by the VA’s non-compliance with the ECFA are our elderly veterans, many of whom are living on fixed incomes and have limited resources to pay medical bills.” The letter was signed by Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Al Franken (D-Minn.), John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The letter is supported by The American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Full text of the letter is below: The Honorable Robert McDonaldSecretary of Veterans AffairsDepartment of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald: We write today to express our support for the Veterans Emergency Care Fairness Act of 2009 (ECFA). Six years after enactment of the ECFA, our nation’s veterans continue to bear the burden of emergency treatment costs not covered by veterans’ third-party insurance. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) continued denial of these claims is deeply troubling. Congress’s clear intent in passing the ECFA was to expand veteran eligibility for reimbursement for emergency treatment furnished to veterans in non-department facilities. Specifically, congressional intent was to require the VA to act as a secondary payer for emergency treatment costs not covered by the veteran’s third-party insurance. It is evident that the VA has ignored congressional intent. Most troubling is the fact that those who are most affected by the VA’s non-compliance with the ECFA are our elderly veterans, many of whom are living on fixed incomes and have limited resources to pay medical bills. Often, these veterans find themselves dealing with collection agencies as a result of emergency care received in the community. This potentially increases stress for these veterans, causes them to lose faith in the VA and keeps them from seeking future medical attention out of fear of acquiring additional medical bills for which they would be financially responsible. As you are aware, on April 8, 2016, in the case of “Staab v. Secretary McDonald,” the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims agreed with the appellant’s contention that the VA’s application of 38 U.S.C. § 1725 frustrates the intent of Congress to reimburse veterans who are not wholly covered by a health-plan contract or other third-party recourse. In its decision, the court ruled that “Congress clearly intended that the VA be responsible for the cost of the emergency treatment which exceeds the amount payable or paid by the third-party insurer.” The court further found the VA’s regulations regarding the ECFA to be invalid and wholly inconsistent with the statute. As a result, the court ruled that 38 C.F.R. § 17.1002(f) is held invalid and directed it to be set aside. Based upon this ruling, we strongly urge you to bring the VA into compliance with P.L. 111-137 and to amend any policy, regulation or other barrier that results in denial of veterans’ claims for reimbursement for non-department emergency care. We further urge you to re-open all previous claims of veterans that were denied because of the VA’s non-compliance with congressional intent and the law. Thank you for your attention to our concerns regarding this important issue. We look forward to working closely with you to fully serve the veterans of our great nation. Sincerely, ###
12.12.2016	A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments; other hospitals and health systems have developed technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used Klobuchar, Ernst bipartisan bill would direct the Secretary of the VA to create a pilot program that will allow veterans to use available technology to self-schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities WASHINGTON, DC— U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced that their bipartisan bill that would establish a patient self-scheduling appointment system at Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities has passed the Senate and is headed to the President’s desk to be signed into law. A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments. Other hospitals and health systems are now leveraging technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used. The bipartisan Faster Care for Veterans Act would direct the Secretary of the VA to commence a pilot program under which veterans could use the internet to schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities. “Excessive wait times can put veterans’ lives at risk, but state-of-the art technology that makes it easier to schedule appointments already exists and is being used in other hospital systems,” said Klobuchar. “Our veterans have earned the right to use the same technology to schedule their medical appointments without unnecessary red tape and delays. This bipartisan bill will take an important step forward in ensuring that our brave men and women who have sacrificed so much have access to the medical care they need and deserve.” “The long wait times our veterans face are simply unacceptable,” said Ernst. “This bipartisan legislation takes important steps towards modernizing the VA’s scheduling process, adopting practices successfully used in the private sector to allow veterans to schedule and confirm their appointments online. I am pleased that my colleagues in both the Senate and the House have recognized the urgency in giving our veterans faster, hassle-free access to service. I urge the President to sign this bill into law as quickly as possible.” Upon enactment of the Faster Care for Veterans Act, the VA would be required to commence an 18-month pilot program that would allow veterans to self-schedule, confirm, and modify outpatient and specialty care appointments in real time through the internet. This technology allows veterans to immediately schedule appointments canceled by other veterans and schedule appointments 24 hours per day, seven days per week. ###
12.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) released the following statement after the Senate passed their bipartisan legislation, the Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority, to reauthorize the leasing authority at Department of Defense arsenals and military instillations for unused office space to outside tenants: “I am pleased the Senate passed this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to reduce government costs, which boosts our local economies,” said Ernst. “Importantly for the Quad Cities, this would allow the Rock Island Arsenal to resume their leasing authority, which expired in 2012, and continue attracting new businesses and jobs to the region. While I am disappointed this will not get a vote in the House this year, I will continue to fight through all possible routes to restore this authority for Rock Island Arsenal. This includes introducing this legislation again next year if necessary.” “It took a lot of work and negotiation by our bi-state delegation to get to this point,” said Grassley. “I’m glad the Senate has now acted on our legislation to allow the Rock Island Arsenal to continue leasing unused office space to tenants that bring value to the arsenal while offsetting costs. I look forward to working with our House counterparts and the Army to see workable leasing authority implemented in the near future.” "This legislation provides the kind of thoughtful, engaged approach we need to ensure the continued health of Rock Island Arsenal since lease revenue is an important piece of its long-term economic sustainability," said Durbin. "I’m proud to have worked alongside my colleagues in the Illinois and Iowa Congressional Delegations on this important legislation, and I will continue to fight for federal investment for Rock Island in order to provide the Arsenal with the necessary tools to unlock its own economic potential‎." "The Arsenal will now have the flexibility to attract more jobs to the Quad Cities as unnecessary bureaucratic red tape is eliminated,” said Kirk. “This legislation will encourage private investment and provide the Arsenal with more resources and personnel to maintain its strength and role as a leader in the defense industry." “I am very pleased that the Senate passed this bill to protect the Watervliet Arsenal and its relationship with the community,” said Gillibrand. “The Watervliet Arsenal is a key part of the Capital Region’s history and economy and a very important tool in our national defense. I will continuing pushing for this legislation so that the Watervliet Arsenal can continue to thrive for many years to come.” Today’s Senate passage of the Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority follows its introduction in September. Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives is no longer in session, and therefore, the legislation is unable to receive a vote in the chamber. About the Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority: Affords Department of Defense arsenals the flexibility to reutilize excess space through leases or contracts with private sector entities under the following conditions: Contracts or leases help maintain the viability of manufacturing arsenals and any military installations on which they are located. Contracts or leases eliminate or reduce the cost of government ownership of the manufacturing arsenals, to include cost of operations/maintenance, environmental remediation or other costs. Contracts or leases leverage private investment at manufacturing arsenals through long-term facility use contracts, property management contracts, leases, or other agreements.
12.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after her provision to urge the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the Cedar Rapids flood control project was included in Senate passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements Act for the Nation (WIIN), which includes the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). The legislation now heads to the President’s desk to be signed into law. “I was pleased to see that WRDA contains the authorization of Army Corps of Engineers’ projects that are important to Iowa for flood damage reduction and water resources infrastructure in addition to addressing the water quality issues many of our communities face across the country. “This legislation also includes my provision to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to make completion of the Cedar Rapids flood control project a top priority. It is critical that the Corps fulfill their obligation to assist in completion of this project to protect the people of Iowa from another disaster, and this legislation will direct them to do so in a timely manner. “While not included in the final bill, I have secured a commitment for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on the benefit-cost ratios for flood mitigation projects. This study will direct GAO to closely examine whether solely using property values to determine the necessity of construction projects is an appropriate and fair metric for our small and rural communities. “I urge the President to swiftly sign this legislation into law so we can begin to work on these necessary improvements moving forward.” Ernst Provision Included in Section 1322 of the Bill: Section 1322 of the bill directs Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of four already-authorized projects for flood damage reduction and flood risk management. One of those four projects is the Cedar Rapids project. The Cedar Rapids project was previously authorized in the 2014 Water Resources Development Act so there is no need to reauthorize it. This provision does not create a new budget or spending authority. Rather, it emphasizes that this is an authorized project that should be completed. Ernst GAO Study Provision Secured: The study will examine the methodology and performance metrics used to calculate cost-benefit ratios and evaluate construction projects. The study will address: Whether and to what extent the current methodologies and performance metrics place small and rural geographic areas at a competitive disadvantage; Whether the value of property for which damage would be prevented as a result of a flood risk management project is the best measurement for the primary input in benefit-cost calculations for flood risk management projects; Any recommendations for approaches to modify the metrics used to improve benefit-cost ratio results for small and rural geographic areas; and Whether a reevaluation of existing approaches and the primary criteria used to calculate the economics benefits of a Corps of Engineers construction project could provide greater results for small and rural geographic areas without putting a strain on the budget of the Corps of Engineers. Water Resources Development Act Impact on Iowa: Authorizes a study of the levees along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers on a system-wide basis, to evaluate the flood damage risks on a basin-wide basis. This review was recommended by the Corps in a 2008 study and by the Secretary in a 2009 letter to Congress to address the fact that a rehabilitation of a levee at a single location often cannot be cost-justified but each location is an integral part of a levee system that provides essential flood protection benefits. Authorizes a study of the Dubuque local flood protection project for flood damage reduction. Allows the Army Corps of Engineers to increase the level of protection when rebuilding a levee if the additional costs are paid by the non-Federal interest and the Corps determines it is in the public interest.
12.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the short term spending bill that funds the government through April 28, 2017. “While this is not the process through which our government should be funded, it is a temporary bridge to the spring when we can put common-sense legislation on our new president’s desk that otherwise would have been vetoed by this current administration. “Currently, every Iowan’s share of the national debt exceeds $60,000, so Congress must work to ensure our government is running efficiently. In staying true to our commitment to preventing excessive spending, this bill includes blocking any pay raises for Members of Congress. The bill also permits the USDA Farm Service Agency to make loans to farmers in proportion to demand during the winter and spring months when loan demand peaks, to avoid the application backlog previously experienced. “Additionally, this bill strengthens critical aspects of our national defense, including funding to continue supporting the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, who are a critical partner to the United States in our fight against ISIS. “We must work together to cut spending and make the tough decisions that the American people elected Congress to make. Although I do not approve of this process to fund our government, I am optimistic about the year ahead, which I hope will begin a new era for the American people, one where we can usher in fiscal responsibility, as well as a renewed focus on our national security.”
12.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the final Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which now heads to the president’s desk. The report included several of the Iowa Senator’s measures, and passed with bipartisan support. “The final passage of the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act is important in providing certainty not only for our nation’s defense, but for our servicemembers. The legislation ensures our men and women serving on the front lines of battle have the tools they need to defend our nation and the health care they deserve. “This NDAA makes sweeping reforms to modernize the Department of Defense and includes my measure to streamline operations and encourage greater efficiency and effectiveness through reforming program management standards across Government to prevent cost overruns and lax oversight. I am also pleased that legislation I offered with Senator Claire McCaskill to prevent retaliation against military sexual assault survivors, was included. This measure would make retaliation its own crime in the military, increases transparency, enhances training, and implements best practices to protect sexual assault survivors. “I am grateful Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure our servicemembers are properly equipped to face the ever-evolving challenges at home and abroad. It’s my hope that President Obama signs this crucial legislation as quickly as possible.” Summary of Ernst Measures Included in the NDAA: Seeks to end retaliation against sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military. Creates a pilot program for military lawyers to enhance criminal justice within the military and provide more effective defense and prosecution for servicemembers. Implements a delay in requiring the National Guard to convert some of its Dual Status Military Technicians to federal civilian status. Makes permanent the National Guard State Partnership Program which enhances our military and diplomatic efforts around the world. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the career progression track for female servicemembers. Requires the DoD to report on its acquisition of contracts which would enhance congressional oversight to ensure the DoD is getting the best value for taxpayer dollars. Seeks to reduce drunk driving and provide employment opportunities to military families by requiring the DoD to develop a policy to afford base access to transportation companies. Enhances whistleblower protections for those servicemembers and DoD employees who report wrongdoing at the DoD. Requires the DoD to report on the progress of women in previously closed combat positions. Provides funds for much needed renovations at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Provides funds to the Army and Marine Corps to enhance the small arms and ammunition capabilities of our Soldiers and Marines. Requires a review of the Defense Intelligence Enterprise and seeks to eliminate unnecessary overhead, waste, and mismanagement, as well as to enhance intelligence support to our warfighters. Maintains suicide prevention programs in the Army Reserves and National Guard. Improves federal government program and project management practices by requiring the development of government wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program management. ###
12.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined “Varney & Co.” on Fox Business to discuss President Obama’s “surprise” reaction to ISIS, President-elect Trump’s nominations to his administration, and the Iowa Governor and Lieutenant Governor. When asked for her reaction to President Obama’s statement that the intel community didn’t put ISIS on his radar, Senator Ernst stated: “I am truly shocked that the president would state that when Director Clapper as well as General Flynn outlined those threats that ISIS presented. For the president to say that now is disheartening, I think it shows a total lack of reality within this administration at the harm that ISIS can do, not only abroad but to our own country.” Click here or the photo above to watch the full interview. # # #
12.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement today following President-elect Trump’s announcement that he has nominated Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to serve as the United States Ambassador to China and on Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds’ future role as Governor: “President-elect Trump has made an excellent choice in nominating Governor Terry Branstad as the United States Ambassador to China; his experience with China speaks for itself and he will excel in this new role,” stated Ernst. “Having worked alongside the Governor for many years, I know he will exemplify the same leadership, thoughtfulness, and dedication in his role as Ambassador to China on behalf of the United States as he did for the people of Iowa. I’d like to congratulate Terry, his wife Chris, and their children, and wish them the very best as they embark on this new adventure. “Additionally, I am thrilled to congratulate Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds who will become the first woman to serve our state as governor. The Lieutenant Governor is a tireless advocate for Iowa and travels around our great state to ensure she is hearing directly from those who know best: Iowans. Iowa has been, and will continue to be, in good hands under her leadership.” ###
12.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) voted in support of the 21st Century Cures Act, legislation that provides additional critical resources to support medical research and includes important reforms that will help patients and their families access new and innovative medicines and devices more quickly. The 21st Century Cures Act also authorizes funding for states to address the ongoing opioid crisis across the country as well as a number of mental health reforms similar to the Mental Health Reform Act, which Senator Ernst cosponsored in the United States Senate. Importantly, these reforms will help strengthen and improve access to community based mental health services and also equip local law enforcement with added training and resources to help in responding to mental health crises. “Increasing our investment in medical research will have a significant impact in addressing complex health care conditions and improving the lives of millions,” said Senator Ernst. “With this additional support for the important work at the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, there is more hope to find cures, improve treatments, and better understand the diseases impacting our nation and the world.” “Moreover, the 21st Century Cures Act addresses the need to improve access to mental health and substance use disorder services. By promoting more strategic planning among federal programs and improving grant programs that provide community based services, this legislation will help ensure folks can get the care they need.” The 21st Century Cures Act also contains an extension of the rural hospital demonstration program and provides regulatory relief for critical access hospitals; both of which the Iowa Senator has been actively engaged on and are important in ensuring Iowans in rural areas have access to needed health care. It also provides temporary relief for medical suppliers from Medicare reimbursement cuts. Senator Ernst added, “This comprehensive and bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act puts patients and their families first. I am proud to support of this legislation and encourage the president to quickly sign it into law.” # # #
12.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, issued a statement on President-elect Trump’s announcement that he has nominated Linda McMahon to serve as head of the Small Business Administration. “As a member of the Small Business Committee, I look forward to thoroughly vetting Ms. McMahon as the nominee to lead the Small Business Administration,” stated Ernst. “For the last eight years, small businesses have been pinned against the ropes thanks to the current administration’s burdensome regulatory agenda. Small businesses make up 97 percent of all employers in Iowa, so it is my hope that Ms. McMahon will discuss how we can free our small businesses from government overreach and instead create an environment where job creators can thrive again.”
12.05.2016	Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senator Cory Gardner (R-CO) and more than 20 Senate colleagues in sending a letter to President Obama requesting his Administration stop issuing non-emergency rules and regulations in the final weeks of his term. The senators stressed to the President that the American people made it clear on November 8th that they expect regulatory relief. The letter reads in full: Dear Mr. President: We write to request your Administration cease issuing new, non-emergency rules and regulations given the recent election results of November 8. In a clear and direct repudiation of consistent regulatory overreach by federal agencies, the American people have, for the first time since 2007, handed control of both the executive and legislative branches of government to the same majority. It is our job now to determine the right balance between regulation and free market principles and make sure that our federal government no longer stands between Americans and financial success. Whether it is the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule unfairly burdening our farmers and ranchers, the anti-coal rules eliminating thousands of jobs and driving up household energy costs, or the Dodd-Frank rules denying our small businesses access to capital, federal agencies continue to produce reams of new regulations that hurt our job creators and cripple our economy. But this flawed approach to governance has been rejected by the people. Today, we have the opportunity to return to commonsense principles of regulation and curb unnecessary government interference in the private sector. In doing so, we will grow the economy, create jobs, and, above all, help the people who have been overlooked the past eight years. To this end, we respectfully request you honor the will of the American people and refrain from working on or issuing any new, non-emergency regulations while carrying out your remaining term in office. The letter was also signed by Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Mike Lee (R-UT), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Deb Fischer (R-NE), John Barrasso, M.D. (R-WY), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jerry Moran (R-KS), James M. Inhofe (R-OK), John Hoeven (R-ND), John Thune (R-SD), Roger F. Wicker (R-MS), Michael B. Enzi (R-WY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Ted Cruz (R-TX), David Perdue (R-GA), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Bill Cassidy, M.D. (R-LA), and Dan Sullivan (R-AK). In addition, earlier this year Senator Ernst, along with U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI) and Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) introduced bicameral legislation to prevent a surge in costly federal regulations as a United States President’s term comes to a close. The Midnight Rule Relief Act would protect hard working families and small businesses from major regulations that are often politically motivated and hastily imposed between Election Day and Inauguration Day. # # #
12.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement in response to reports that President-elect Donald Trump has invited Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte to the White House for a meeting next year: “I have urged President Obama to focus on the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia and am optimistic that President-elect Trump will work with President Duterte to stop the clearly growing threat in the region. “It is my hope that fighting ISIS in Southeast Asia will be a main point of discussion as terrorist activity continues to increase. Just this week we have witnessed an attempted bombing near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, and a terrorist attack on President Duterte’s advance security team in the southern Philippines; both of which appear to have been carried out by Islamic extremist groups affiliated with ISIS and add to the lengthy list of ISIS linked attacks in the region. “Continuing bilateral military training exercises with the Philippines and ensuring our long standing military relationship stays strong will be a key part to success in the region. The southern Philippines was a critical foothold for al Qaeda linked groups early in the Global War on Terror, and it is a place U.S. Special Forces worked hand in hand with the Philippine Government to fight terrorism. It is clear now that ISIS is attempting to take root in this region, and we cannot underestimate their rise in Southeast Asia as President Obama’s administration did in the Middle East.” Senator Ernst’s statement today follows her efforts to call attention to the alarming rise of ISIS in Asia: On August 23, 2016, Senator Ernst penned a column in Time warning of the growing threat of ISIS in Asia. On September 1, 2016, Senator Ernst urged President Obama ahead of his trip to the Philippines to discuss the rise of ISIS with President Duterte, and consider solutions to counter it. On September 22, 2016, Senator Ernst pressed Department of Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford on the need for a comprehensive plan to counter the dangerous actions of ISIS in Asia. On September 27, 2016, Senator Ernst questioned Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Nicholas Rasmussen, Director of the FBI James Comey, and Department of Homeland Security Director Jeh Johnson on the impact of the rise of ISIS in Asia on our national security. On October 1, 2016, following the U.S./ASEAN meeting, Senator Ernst argued that more progress needed to be made in putting forth a strategy to counter ISIS’ expansion in Asia. ###
12.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued the following statement on President-elect Trump's intention to nominate retired General James Mattis as the Secretary of Defense: "General Mattis has led an extraordinary career in the United States Marine Corps, and as the former Commander of U.S. Central Command and coauthor of the Counterinsurgency Field Manual, he is clearly knowledgeable on many of the important issues our country faces today. He has served our country well throughout his more than four decades in the military. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will thoroughly vet him for this position. He has been a tremendous military leader, and I look forward to ensuring he can accomplish the same in this position." # # #
12.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs’ Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management hearing entitled “Examining Two GAO Reports Regarding the Renewable Fuel Standard,” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) stressed the importance of maintaining a strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to continue to grow the rural economy in Iowa, and bring consumer choice at gas pumps across the country. As Senator Ernst noted, the RFS “really has spurred investment in domestic energy production, it’s helped grow our economy throughout the Midwest, especially in those rural areas, and it’s brought a lot of competition--needed competition—to the gas pump, and saves American consumers money and reduces reliance on foreign oil sources.” Ernst pointed to a GAO report which illustrated that bolt-on cellulosic technology at existing plants is the most cost-effective means for generating advanced biofuels. Specifically, the Iowa Senator highlighted a stop on her 99 county tour in Galva, Iowa, in which she explained the facility is “using corn fiber, which is a by-product of the ethanol process to create cellulosic ethanol. This is a great example of what this was originally intended to do; it was to support the expansion of conventional biofuels, as a springboard for those advanced biofuels.” The Iowa Senator also cited her concerns over premature criticism of the RFS, “If we create further uncertainty about the future of the RFS and our commitment to biofuels, it will only serve to slow our research and investment down towards attaining those goals originally set by Congress.” Senator Ernst’s remarks today follow her comments over the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) recent release of their final RFS renewable volume obligations (RVO) for 2017 at the Congressionally-approved level of 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuel.

12.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) released the following statements on their bipartisan legislation, the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act heading to the President’s desk. “Congress has come together in a bipartisan manner to eliminate waste, and make government more effective and efficient,” said Senator Ernst. “Our legislation takes an important step forward in making the federal government more productive and cost-effective by streamlining management procedures to increase accountability, and preventing cost overruns and lax oversight. Taxpayers deserve a more efficient use of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and I encourage the President to sign this bill into law, and put these reforms into action.” “Good management leads to efficient, effective federal programs – and our bipartisan bill will promote improved management across federal agencies,” said Senator Heitkamp. “After working hard with Senator Ernst to get this bipartisan bill across the finish line, it will now go to the president’s desk to be signed into law. The goal of our bill is to reduce waste and save taxpayers money. That’s something we can all agree on. Better managed federal programs that deal with agriculture, energy, and so much more are good news for communities and businesses across North Dakota.” Click here to read the bill text. About Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act: Establishes a leader within each agency that is focused on program management. Creates an inter-agency Program Management Council to drive improvements through portfolio reviews of agency programs and encourages communications between agencies and program management professionals. Requires the development of a specific job category with distinct qualification for project managers. Requires the federal government to adopt widely-accepted program management best practices and standards. Requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report three years after the bill’s enactment on its overall effectiveness and impact on program management in the federal government. Works directly with the Department of Defense to improve their current procedures while making sure to not duplicate existing efforts. # # #
12.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in favor of the Iran Sanctions Extension Act, which would extend for 10 years sanctions authorities against Iran before they expire at the end of the year. “Iran is the world’s leading state-sponsor of terrorism, and their aggression remains undeterred following President Obama’s misguided nuclear deal. Extending sanctions authorities against this untrustworthy regime will give our President-elect the ability to apply renewed pressure on Iran at a time when they continue to pursue development of ballistic missiles and encourage acts of terror in the Middle East and across the globe. “Today’s Senate passage of this extension sends a clear signal to Iran that there will be zero tolerance for their hostile actions towards our nation and our allies. I urge President Obama to swiftly sign this extension into law, and look forward to working with our President-elect to ensure our nation’s security in the face of Iranian aggression.” Last year, Senator Ernst spoke out against the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran, and earlier this year co-sponsored legislation to impose tough sanctions on Iran in response to their ballistic missile violations. ###
12.01.2016	WASHINGTON – In another bipartisan achievement, this year’s national defense bill will include a plan by U.S. Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joni Ernst of Iowa to further curb sexual assault in the military. McCaskill and Ernst—both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee—introduced the bipartisan Military Retaliation Prevention Act targeting stubbornly high rates of survivors who report that they have been retaliated against by their peers after coming forward. Those rates of experienced retaliation remain high, even as the number of assaults has dropped and reporting by victims has gone up, following a slate of historic reforms overhauling the military justice system. The legislation, which was included in the Senate version of the National Defense Authorization Act earlier this year has now been included in the final version negotiated with the U.S. House. “This is just another step in what's been an historic overhaul strengthening how our military handles these crimes,” said McCaskill, a former prosecutor of sex crimes. “We’ve worked hard to empower survivors to report these crimes and come out of the shadows, and to hold commanders accountable. This plan will offer new tools to help bring down the stubborn rates of retaliation against survivors who report and speak up.” “The inclusion of our Military Retaliation Prevention Act in the NDAA is an important step forward in changing the culture surrounding sexual assault in the military,” said Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate. “Sexual assault anywhere and of any kind is absolutely unacceptable, and the survivors in our military should be empowered to come forward and report the attack, without fear of retaliation by their peers, so that we can work together to ensure these horrible acts are prosecuted fully and are not continued in our military.” The Senators’ bipartisan bill (summary available online HERE, and full bill text available online HERE) would target retaliation in a number of ways: Strengthen the military response by making retaliation its own unique offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (where retaliation is currently punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ, a broader article to punish failure to obey an order or regulation) Increase transparency by requiring victims be notified of how their complaint was decided—and requiring the Pentagon collect and publish data on retaliation complaints. Require specific training for investigators, including all military criminal investigators, IG investigators, or any personnel assigned by commanders to investigate the complaints Ensure each of the services adopts best practices by establishing metrics for measuring the outcomes of their efforts to prevent and respond to instances of retaliation The Senators’ plan was informed by recommendations made by the Judicial Proceedings Panel (which is chaired by former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, author of the federal rape shield law and former member of the Response Systems Panel) and the Military Justice Review Group. Initial data has demonstrated concrete progress in curbing sexual violence in the military as a result of reforms passed by Congress over the past few years. The Fiscal Year 2014 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military shows that incidents of unwanted sexual contact dropped by 29 percent from 2012 to 2014. The total number of reports (restricted and unrestricted) are up 11 percent from the previous year and up 70 percent from FY12. About 1 out of 4 survivors reported in FY14, up significantly from 1 out of 10 survivors reporting in FY12, and the highest reporting rate ever. Increased reporting occurred in all categories—unrestricted reports, restricted reports, and reports that survivors converted from restricted to unrestricted. And 82 percent of survivors surveyed agreed that their unit commander supported them, 73 percent were satisfied with their unit commander’s response, and 73 percent said they would recommend others report if they were a survivor of a sexual assault. However that same data found that 62 percent of the women who reported an incident of unwanted sexual contact reported experiencing some form of retaliation. The majority, 53 percent, categorized their experience as “social” retaliation. 32 percent indicated they experienced professional retaliation. The most recent Report on Sexual Assault in the Military showed that 68 percent of survey respondents indicated that they had experienced some sort of “negative reaction” to reporting a sexual assault. Among the more than 30 reforms already passed into law over the past few years: Commanders have been stripped of the ability to overturn convictions, and are now held accountable under rigorous new standards. Every survivor who reports a sexual assault now gets their own independent lawyer to protect their rights and fight for their interests—a reform that has no parallel in the civilian justice system. Civilian review is now required if a commander decides against a prosecution in a case in which a prosecutor wants to go to trial. Dishonorable discharge is now a required minimum sentence for anyone convicted of a sexual assault. The pre-trial “Article 32” process, which came under scrutiny following a case at the Naval Academy, has been reformed to better protect survivors. The statute of limitations in these cases has now been eliminated, a particularly important development in a sustained battle against sexual assaults. The “good soldier” defense for servicemembers accused of sexual assault has been eliminated under most circumstances. Survivors are now allowed formal input on whether their case is tried in military or civilian court. Sexual assault survivors are now allowed to challenge their discharge or separation from service. The role of the prosecutor in advising commanders on going to court-martial has been strengthened. ###
11.30.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) received two letters that provided an update on the ongoing investigation and inquiries into the deaths of Iowa veterans Mr. Brandon Ketchum and Mr. Curtis Gearhart from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General (IG) Michael Missal. Senator Ernst has written several letters to VA IG Michael Missal, who leads the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG), requesting an investigation into the VA’s handling of the medical treatment for Mr. Ketchum. Additionally, the Iowa Senator wrote VA IG Missal following the death of Mr. Gearhart on November 15th, 2016, to request an investigation into the alleged denial of treatment by the VA. In IG Missal’s response on Mr. Ketchum, he stated he expects a final report on the investigation in the Spring of 2017. In addition, the VA OIG detailed that it has requested additional information to determine whether or not a formal investigation into Mr. Gearhart’s treatment is necessary: “We will assess all the information and determine our next steps based on our analysis of the matter. We expect this initial process could take up to two months.” Following the update provide by IG Missal, Senator Ernst said, “It’s critical that we receive these reports as quickly as possible in order to move swiftly and correct any flaws in the system in hopes of preventing future tragedies. “I intend to continue closely monitoring these investigations as we head into the transition into a new administration. Too many of our nation’s veterans have fallen through the cracks of the VA’s system and we must be able to hold the VA accountable for whatever the IG might find. We cannot allow any questions surrounding the deaths of Mr. Gearhart and Mr. Ketchum to go unanswered.” Click here to read the VA IG’s response regarding Mr. Brandon Ketchum.

11.30.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At her request, today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst met with the head of the United States Army Corps of Engineers to discuss and urge the prioritization for funding the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, as well as the outstanding Cedar Falls 408 permitting request for levee and floodwall system improvements. Following the meeting, Senator Ernst stated: “I am grateful for the Army Corps of Engineers’ time today. I emphasized the issues Iowa faces with the benefit to cost ratio formula and how it is imperative that the Corps not overlook the values of life and property in Iowa. I made clear to the Corps that Cedar Rapids is the second largest city in Iowa and their concerns matter just as much as the concerns of those who live in our nation’s largest cities and along the coasts.” “Overall, it was a productive meeting with the Corps. They assured me they will be following up with me by the end of January 2017 after taking a closer look at the cost and benefit issues in Iowa and after examining if there are other potential opportunities to secure the funding Cedar Rapids deserves. I look forward to hearing more soon.” “The Corps also assured me that the 408 permit application Cedar Falls submitted has an anticipated final approval of April 2017. I plan on holding them accountable to make sure this permit is approved in a timely manner.” Eight years have passed since Cedar Rapids endured the 500-year flood event in 2008 that devastated the community. Since then, the city worked with the Corps to develop a project to address that flood risk, and worked with Congress to get it authorized. Due to the Corps’ refusal to budget for this project, despite significant public safety concerns, Cedar Rapids experienced another major flood event this year without the needed levee improvements. Iowa Senators Ernst and Grassley have sent two letters to the Army Corps since the flooding this year urging the prioritization of the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project, and both letters have gone unanswered. Additionally, after the same historic flood in 2008, Cedar Falls identified levee and floodwall system improvements that needed to be made. The city submitted a 408 permit application in May 2015 after three years of navigating the complexities of Army Corps process. While the city has the funds in place to construct this vital flood protection, they have since been forced to spend emergency dollars on preventative measures while they wait for the permit to be approved by the Army Corps. ###
11.29.2016	Earlier this year, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) introduced the bipartisan Credit for Caring Act, which would provide up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit to working family caregivers for qualified expenses. As National Caregivers Month comes to a close, this critical legislation has continued to gain support from folks across the country. Just this week, the Alzheimer’s Association endorsed the Credit for Caring Act in a letter detailing that “Nearly half of care contributors – those who are caregivers of someone with Alzheimer’s and/or contribute financially to their care – cut back on their own expenses (including food, transportation and medical care) to pay for dementia-related care of a family member or friend. On average, care contributors spend more than $5,000 per year of their own money (out-of-pocket) to provide care for someone with Alzheimer’s or another dementia. Care contributors are 28 percent more likely than other adults to eat less or go hungry because they cannot afford to pay for food. And, among caregivers, 74 percent report they are ‘somewhat’ to ‘very’ concerned about maintaining their own health since becoming a caregiver. The Credit for Caring Act would provide working families with a credit for 30 percent of caregiving expenses up to a maximum of $3,000 per year, which would help ease the financial burden many caregivers face.” This endorsement by the Alzheimer’s Association follows support from the AARP, Association of University Centers on Disabilities, Autism Speaks, Autism Society, American Heart Association/American Stroke Association Caregiver Action Network, Center for Elder Care and Advanced Illness (Altarum Institute), Family Caregiver Alliance (National Center on Caregiving), Family Voices, Home Care Association of America, Lutheran Services in America, Lutheran Services in America Disability Network, National Alliance for Caregiving, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, National Council on Aging, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, and The Arc. In addition, the Credit for Caring Act is also cosponsored by Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Angus King (I-ME), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Edward Markey (D-MA), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), and John Tester (D-MT). As Senator Ernst noted earlier last week in her column that appeared in the Cedar Rapids Gazette: “If you ask them, family caregivers would not trade their role for anything, but they would appreciate a bit of additional help and support. That is why it is so important we honor National Family Caregivers Month this November, and take time to be grateful for the more than 317,000 Iowans, and 40 million people across the country, serving as family caregivers at any given time during the year. Offering a bit of additional help and support is also why I have proposed the bipartisan Credit for Caring Act, which would provide up to a $3,000 non-refundable tax credit for working family caregivers supporting a loved one in need of long-term care.” To learn more about the Credit for Caring Act, click here. ###
11.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement on the death of Fidel Castro: "The death of Fidel Castro brings about new opportunity for basic human rights and democracy throughout Cuba – something that he and his brother consistently refused to provide. "Now is the time to eliminate the oppression that has consumed Cuba for decades. It's my hope that the U.S. and Cuba can work together to chart a new path forward and ensure freedom and equality for all its people."
11.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – United States Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and John Barrasso (R-WY) departed from Afghanistan and Qatar today after spending Thanksgiving with U.S servicemembers stationed at Bagram Air Force Base. In addition, the senators traveled around Afghanistan to witness the continued mission and tour various work sites with troops from their home states. Senator Ernst, a former company commander in the Iowa National Guard and veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, met with the 211th Aviation Battalion and the 185th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion (CSSB) of Iowa. During her 23 years of military service, Senator Ernst Commanded the 185th CSSB, based out of Johnston, Iowa and served as the Support Operations Officer in the Battalion Headquarters for the 211th Aviation Battalion. Prior to the base visits, Senator Ernst spoke at the Sisters in Arms event for female North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) leaders in Kabul, Afghanistan. Following their visit, Senator Barrasso, and Senators Ernst and Fischer, both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the following: “It was a tremendous honor to spend Thanksgiving with Iowans who are sacrificing so much in defense of our freedoms - particularly so far from home during the holidays,” said Ernst. “I had the opportunity to speak with Iowans in the 248th Aviation Battalion and visit with some familiar faces in the 185th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion, as well as travel to work sites to see their efforts on the front lines. I am thankful to have shared this precious time with our outstanding Iowa servicemembers and I thank them - as well as their families - for their faithful service to our grateful nation.” “I was humbled and honored to spend this Thanksgiving with service members from Nebraska currently stationed in Qatar and Afghanistan,” said Fischer. “These brave service members are far away from their homes and loved ones this holiday season. I cherished the time I spent with each and every one of them. I know I join all Nebraskans when I say how thankful we are for the sacrifices they and their families make to keep us safe.” “The men and women of Wyoming have a proud record of military service to our country. This year is no exception. Right now, we have members of the Wyoming National Guard from across the Cowboy State stationed in both Qatar and Afghanistan,” said Barrasso. “It was an honor to bring a little bit of Wyoming to them this Thanksgiving. We enjoyed talking about their families back home and how excited we are to cheer on the Cowboy football team as they wrap up their winning season this fall. Everyone can be proud of the outstanding job our Wyoming troops are doing to keep our country safe.” Ernst with the 211th Aviation Battalion and the 185th Combat Support Sustainment Battalion of Iowa in Afghanistan. Fischer with Nebraska servicemembers in Qatar. Barrasso in Qatar with Wyoming servicemembers.
11.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released their final Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) renewable volume obligations (RVO) for 2017 at 15 billion gallons of conventional biofuel, meeting the requirements Congress approved in 2007: “I am pleased the EPA has finally listened to the American people as well as the comments my colleagues and I have pushed forward, and set the final volume requirements for conventional biofuels for 2017 at appropriate and congressionally approved levels. The RFS is critical in reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and provides consumers with choices at the pump. Most importantly, it spurs investment and research in renewable fuels and supports our rural economy in Iowa. “Iowa is a leader in ethanol and biodiesel production and retail, and maintaining a strong RFS aligned with congressional intent is critically important to our state and our country. As we move into a new Congress, I remain committed to promoting innovation in this field while protecting our domestic energy security. Earlier this year, the Iowa Senator called for the EPA to follow Congressional intent when the proposed rule was initially released earlier this year. In addition, Ernst joined a bipartisan group of 39 senators on June 26, 2016, in sending a letter to the EPA encouraging the agency to set the RVO at the level directed by Congress.
11.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) tonight expressed dissatisfaction and frustration after receiving a preliminary response from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), more than four months after her initial letter to the agency, in which she demanded answers from the VA following the death of Brandon Ketchum, a veteran who committed suicide after allegedly being denied care. In their response, the VA wrote in part, “Please note that the Office of Inspector General conducted a preliminary fact finding site visit at the Iowa City VA Health Care System (HCS) on August 4 and 5, 2016. In addition, a protected peer review has been initiated for the Iowa City HCS to be conducted by a separate VA medical center as well as a non-VA facility. All results from these investigations are pending at this time. VA’s local policies and procedures for admitting Veterans to inpatient mental health care at the Iowa City HCS are consistent with national policies. All results from these investigations are pending at this time." In response, Senator Ernst issued the following statement: “The response from the VA is completely inadequate and unacceptable. It is ludicrous to prematurely conclude that the VA policies were not only followed, but were also the absolute appropriate steps before even completing the full investigation. Clearly, when veterans are taking their own lives after being denied care, the policies must be more closely examined, even if they are being followed. “Our veterans need better than this status quo, and deserve quality and timely care that they can rely on. I will remain vigilant in continuing to press the VA for specific answers over Mr. Ketchum's death, as well as how they plan to fix their policies moving forward to prevent these horrific tragedies from happening.” The VA did not specify when the investigation will be complete. Today’s response from the VA follows a November 10th letter Senator Ernst sent the VA OIG demanding an update on the investigation. Previously, Senator Ernst also sent personal letters to both VA Inspector Michael Missal and VA Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin seeking answers as to why Mr. Ketchum was allegedly denied treatment. Senator Ernst also sent the VA OIG a letter on November 15th, inquiring about yet another investigation into the death of Iowa veteran Curtis Gearhart, who also took his own life after allegedly being denied care from the VA.

11.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) completed her second annual 99 county tour of Iowa with a town meeting in Cherokee County. As part of her tour this year, Senator Ernst held town meetings and roundtables as well as visited numerous schools, hospitals, farms, manufacturers, and small businesses along the way. Following the completion of her tour, Senator Ernst released the following statement: “Across Iowa, folks are fed up with a federal government that is too big, too burdensome, and spends too much. Rather, Iowans want the freedom to raise their families and grow their businesses without costly, overbearing bureaucratic interference. “From harmful rules like Waters of the United States (WOTUS) that hurt our farmers and manufacturers, to burdensome red-tape hampering our small businesses, to costly mandates like ObamaCare that are cutting into the paychecks of families and individuals struggling to make ends meet, to ensuring our veterans receive the quality and timely care they deserve, it is clear that bureaucrats in Washington do not know better than Iowans what is best for our state. “With this feedback in hand, I will continue to work to translate it into action as we move into the next Congress, and I remain committed to getting government out of the way of Iowans’ everyday lives.” Senator Ernst talks with folks at a town meeting in Cherokee County, her last 99 county tour stop of the year To explore this year’s tour of Iowa’s 99 counties, click here. ###
11.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Iowa's U.S. Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley and Representatives Rod Blum (R-01), David Young (R-03) and Steve King (R-04) sent President-elect Donald J. Trump a letter urging him to scrap the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule in the first few days of his presidency. In the letter, members of the Iowa delegation wrote, “This misguided WOTUS rule is an economic assault on small businesses, manufacturing and agriculture, and threatens the very livelihood of our fellow Iowans. These industries are the backbone of this country, especially in rural America. The election results signaled that Americans are ready for the last eight years of EPA’s power grabbing mentality to come to an end.” They added, “Last year, both the Senate and the House passed a resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res.22), led by Senator Ernst to scrap this harmful rule. It passed each chamber with bipartisan support, but our current president vetoed it anyway.” The members urged strong action, concluding, “… we strongly encourage you to use all the tools at your disposal to free the American people from this blatant overreach. We also respectfully urge you to direct your EPA to craft a common-sense rule that clarifies the scope of the CWA and does so by taking into consideration the input of all stakeholders.” Click here or see below to view the full letter to President-elect Donald J. Trump. November 21, 2016 The Honorable Donald TrumpThe President-electTrump Tower725 5th AveNew York, NY 10022 Dear Mr. Trump: We write to you today to express our strong concern about the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Waters of the U.S. rule (WOTUS), and we respectfully urge you to do everything within your power as chief executive to stop this harmful rule in the first days of your presidency. This misguided WOTUS rule is an economic assault on small businesses, manufacturing and agriculture, and threatens the very livelihood of our fellow Iowans. These industries are the backbone of this country, especially in rural America. The election results signaled that Americans are ready for the last eight years of EPA’s power grabbing mentality to come to an end. As you know, the Clean Water Act (CWA) was created to address pollution problems in the nation’s navigable waters and improve water quality through a local-state-federal partnership. While we fully support this goal, the scope of the expanded WOTUS definition far exceeds what was originally intended by Congress when it enacted the CWA. Under the guise of protecting clean water, the current administration’s EPA is not just seeking to expand its jurisdiction over waters not originally covered under the CWA, but also on private land. For example, the WOTUS rule could give EPA extensive power to regulate activities on 97 percent of the land in Iowa. This rule will no doubt leave our nation’s job creators in a wave of legal uncertainty, compliance burdens, and increased costs. Last year, both the Senate and the House passed a resolution of disapproval (S.J.Res.22), led by Senator Ernst to scrap this harmful rule. It passed each chamber with bipartisan support, but our current president vetoed it anyway. Thankfully a nationwide stay has been placed on the rule by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, but it could be years until this litigation is settled. Meanwhile the business owners, farmers, ranchers, and private landowners in communities across the country are left with uncertainty, and are concerned that the EPA will continue to take steps to implement the rule through a piecemeal approach. As mentioned above, we strongly encourage you to use all the tools at your disposal to free the American people from this blatant overreach. We also respectfully urge you to direct your EPA to craft a common-sense rule that clarifies the scope of the CWA and does so by taking into consideration the input of all stakeholders. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst Chuck Grassley United States Senator United States Senator David Young Rod Blum United States Congressman United States Congressman Steve King United States Congressman # # #
11.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General Michael Missal to express her continued frustration and disappointment over the death of yet another Iowa veteran, Mr. Curtis Gearhart. Mr. Gearhart, a 32-year-old U.S. Army veteran from Ankeny, Iowa served two tours in Iraq as a combat engineer and tragically committed suicide on Monday, November 7, 2016, after he was allegedly told by the VA he would have to wait for treatment. The death of Mr. Gearhart follows that of fellow Iowans Mr. Brandon Ketchum earlier this year, and Mr. Richard Miles in 2015, both who took their own lives after failing to receive adequate and timely care from the VA. In the letter, Senator Ernst wrote: “Mr. Gearhart, Mr. Ketchum, Mr. Miles, and all of our veterans we’ve tragically lost to suicide, deserved better from the VA. It is unacceptable that veterans are being told to wait, especially when seeking care for combat-related injuries. If immediate care cannot be provided by the VA itself, it is absolutely imperative our veterans be made aware of other health care options available to them outside of the VA. It is simply unacceptable that anyone who has courageously served this great nation is sent home without being given options that exist for receiving qualified, outside care. I simply cannot accept that the Iowa VAs continue to allow veterans such as Mr. Gearhart to slip through the cracks of the system.” Additionally, the Iowa Senator called for an immediate investigation into Mr. Gearhart’s treatment, stating “I demand that the VA OIG conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Mr. Curtis Gearhart, focusing both on why Mr. Gearhart was denied care, and what steps must be taken to prevent this from happening ever again. I hope I make myself clear when I say, I do not want to have to write to you again regarding the loss of yet another Iowa veteran who has died because they did not receive adequate care from the VA.” Click here or see below to view the full letter to VA Inspector General Michael Missal. November 15, 2016 The Honorable Michael J. MissalInspector GeneralU.S. Department of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420 Dear Inspector General Missal: I cannot begin to describe my continued frustration, disappointment, and sadness that I must again write to you demanding answers about the loss of yet another promising, young Iowa veteran. Just as I wrote in February 2015, and yet again in July of this year, I am increasingly concerned about the mental health care treatment and subsequent recovery coordination provided to our veterans through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Expanding recovery and coordination activities for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as well as improving care management service, is something I fear is not happening quickly enough in the VA healthcare system. In February of 2015, I wrote to then Acting Inspector General, Mr. Richard Griffin, expressing great concern over the death of Richard Miles, an Iraq War veteran who was found dead at Water Works Park in Des Moines, Iowa. Prior to taking his own life, Mr. Miles sought mental health treatment from the VA. Immediately following Mr. Miles’ death, I requested that your office investigate the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health program, and I instructed my staff to monitor and assist in the investigation as necessary. The investigation concluded that Mr. Miles had not received adequate mental health care from the VA. In July of 2016, the VA’s mental health care services failed another Iowa veteran, Mr. Brandon Ketchum. Mr. Ketchum, a combat veteran who served in both the Marine Corps and Army National Guard, sought mental health care from a psychiatrist at the Iowa City VA Medical Center. Despite having been flagged for suicide risk multiple times in the past, the VA denied Mr. Ketchum the healthcare services he urgently needed and requested. I write to you today because during the week of Veterans Day, I learned that yet another Iowa veteran, a young soldier by the name of Curtis Gearhart, committed suicide after the VA allegedly failed to provide timely care. Mr. Gearhart served two tours in Iraq as a combat engineer, the same theater we are sending our young men and woman to today. It is being reported that Mr. Gearhart was told to wait more than a month for treatment, despite needing health care attention immediately. Mr. Gearhart, Mr. Ketchum, Mr. Miles, and all of our veterans we’ve tragically lost to suicide, deserved better from the VA. It is unacceptable that veterans are being told to wait, especially when seeking care for combat-related injuries. If immediate care cannot be provided by the VA itself, it is absolutely imperative our veterans be made aware of other health care options available to them outside of the VA. It is simply unacceptable that anyone who has courageously served this great nation is sent home without being given options that exist for receiving qualified, outside care. I simply cannot accept that the Iowa VAs continue to allow veterans such as Mr. Gearhart to slip through the cracks of the system. Additionally, I find alarming that despite the VA’s rhetoric of being “open and transparent”, I have not been able to get basic information regarding Mr. Gearhart’s care. While hiding behind the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the VA claims to not be able to share any information. Even though Mr. Ketchum posted that the VA refused to provide him treatment on Facebook, the VA still only gave basic information to the Congressional delegation. I am extremely disappointed that it appears the VA only offers information when they are required to go on the defensive to counter posts that have exposed their failures on social media platforms, such as Facebook. Instead of worrying about public appearance, the VA should make an effort to work with Congress to address the tragedy at hand, regardless of the media coverage. The lives of our veterans come before the VA’s public relations front. I demand that the VA OIG conduct a thorough investigation into the death of Mr. Curtis Gearhart, focusing both on why Mr. Gearhart was denied care, and what steps must be taken to prevent this from happening ever again. I hope I make myself clear when I say, I do not want to have to write to you again regarding the loss of yet another Iowa veteran who has died because they did not receive adequate care from the VA. I remain committed to working to end the epidemic of veteran suicide. I urge you to work to improve veterans’ services at the Veterans Health Administration throughout Iowa, but also nationwide. In addition to the results of your thorough investigation, I expect a written response from your office detailing concrete steps that will be taken to prevent tragedies such as Mr. Gearhart’s from ever happening again. As you know, this Administration is quickly coming to a close and I expect to see a response before the end of the year. I speak for all Iowans when I say that our veterans deserve better. If you have any questions concerning this request, please contact my staff via Katherina Dimenstein at (202) 224 -3254 or Katherina_Dimenstein@Ernst.Senate.Gov. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator # # #
11.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst sent a letter today to President Obama ahead of his upcoming trip to Peru underscoring her concerns over the growing influence of ISIS in Latin America, urging him to take action. In the letter, Senator Ernst wrote: “ISIS and its sympathizers are growing more overt in Latin America. Their increased use of messaging in Spanish and Portuguese, coupled with calls for terror in the region, exemplify ISIS’s unwavering determination to change and imbed in new surroundings… I echo the message from your SOUTHCOM Commander, and his predecessor, who have raised concerns about the growth of extremism in Latin America and urge you to make this issue a top priority for your travel this month.” In addition, the Iowa Senator listed three questions she encouraged the president to discuss with Latin American leaders; she requested the president to explain how he will encourage more Latin American countries to join the U.S.-led Coalition to Counter ISIS, to detail U.S. missions in Latin America to counter the growth of ISIS, and to lay out his steps taken to urge more anti-terrorism cooperation and counter terrorism efforts. This letter follows a recent column Senator Ernst penned for CNN that points to Latin America as another region the administration has failed to properly counter ISIS and the need for the President to work with our partners and encourage others in the region to join the fight. Click here or see below to view the full letter to President Obama. November 14, 2016 President Barack Obama 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, DC 20500 President Obama: I write to you today regarding your upcoming trip to Peru and the increasing presence of Islamic extremist groups operating in Latin America. As you know from my recent letter to you pertaining to the rise of terrorism in the Asia-Pacific region, I remain very concerned about ISIS’s ability to spread and adapt to new environments across the globe. ISIS and its sympathizers are growing more overt in Latin America. Their increased use of messaging in Spanish and Portuguese, coupled with calls for terror in the region, exemplify ISIS’s unwavering determination to change and imbed in new surroundings. A Brazilian extremist group pledging allegiance to ISIS, Ansar al-Khilafa Brazil, will likely not be the last, and the increasing rise of ISIS fighters leaving the Caribbean should indicate to you that this is not a narrowly focused problem. I echo the message from your SOUTHCOM Commander, and his predecessor, who have raised concerns about the growth of extremism in Latin America and urge you to make this issue a top priority for your travel this month. With decades of violence and illicit activity throughout Latin America, it remains fertile ground for extremist groups, like ISIS, to prosper. Indeed, we have failed to assist our allies in addressing places like the tri-border region of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, which was cited by your own State Department in 2014 for “remaining an important regional nexus of arms, narcotics, and human smuggling, counterfeiting, pirated goods; and money laundering—all potential funding sources for terrorist organizations.” With ISIS setting its sights on global expansion, and a history of Islamic extremism in the region, we cannot afford to continue turning a blind eye to these threats emerging right here in our own hemisphere. It should be clear to you by now that I do not support your measuring of our success against ISIS by the land they lose in the Middle East, as it is not an accurate representation of the progress we are making against Islamic extremist groups that wish to do us harm. For this reason, in your upcoming meetings with Latin American officials, I ask that you discuss ways to address the growing fight against ISIS and consider the following: 1) Panama, who lacks a standard military, is the only country in the region to join the U.S.-led Coalition to Counter ISIS. How can you encourage more Latin American countries to join the coalition? 2) SOUTHCOM has, and is able to, conduct counter terrorism. What U.S. missions in Latin America can you increase or refocus to ensure we are interrupting and halting any growth of ISIS? 3) New anti-terrorism laws were cited as being a key component for stopping terrorist attacks from being carried out at the Olympic Games in Brazil. What steps are you taking to urge more anti-terrorism cooperation and expand existing U.S. counter crime and security assistance to incorporate counter terrorism efforts? I remain firm in my belief that your administration must broaden its horizons to effectively combat the spread of radical Islamic terrorism and I look forward to your response. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator

11.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – United States Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to the Inspector General of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Michael Missal, to seek specific answers on the steps his office is taking to improve their review process of whistleblower complaints made through the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) Hotline. During a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing in 2015, it was discovered that the VA OIG’s office was only able to review a portion of the approximately 40,000 complaints it receives annually to its Hotline, which serves as a critical tool for veterans and VA employees to report allegations of VA wrongdoing. This issue was raised again during Senator Ernst’s questioning of Inspector General Missal during his nomination hearing in January, where she pressed him for a commitment to oversight, accountability, and protection of whistleblowers within the VA. Following the May 31, 2016, HSGAC hearing in Tomah Wisconsin, Senator Ernst received VA IG Missal’s responses to questions she had submitted to the record. Unfortunately, Mr. Missal’s responses left a lot of questions unanswered. In her letter today, Senator Ernst said, “You have now been in office approximately six months, and I would appreciate an overview of any ‘enhancements’ or other policy changes you have made pursuant to your review.” The Iowa Senator also sought details on whether the VA has been aggressively pursuing Hotline case referrals, asking: “Of the external case referrals to the VA in FY 2015, how many resulted in the VA substantiating allegations? Of those where allegations were substantiated, how often did the VA take corrective action?” Click here or see below to view the full letter to VA Inspector General Michael Missal. November 10, 2016 The Honorable Michael J. Missal Inspector General Department of Veterans Affairs 810 Vermont Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20420 Dear Inspector General Missal: I am writing to follow up on the July 22, 2016, responses you provided to Questions for the Record following the May 31, 2016, Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee field hearing in Tomah, Wisconsin. First, in one of your responses to a question posed by my colleague, Senator Baldwin, you stated: "I am in the process of reviewing current OIG policies, workloads, and priorities with respect to our Hotline and will make any enhancements as appropriate." You have now been in office approximately six months, and I would appreciate an overview of any "enhancements" or other policy changes you have made pursuant to your review. In addition, I would like to take the opportunity to raise a number of specific questions about your responses. Also in response to a question from Senator Baldwin, you stated that "[b]ecause the number of allegations we receive each year far exceeds the number we can accept for review, the OIG must be highly selective in the cases we accept." That appears to be reflected in the FY 2015 Hotline data you provided in response to one of my questions. You indicated that 38,098 contacts were made to the OIG Hotline during FY 2015. My understanding of your explanation as to how those contacts were addressed is as follows: 1,764 - external referral to VA 497 - non-case referrals to VA 1,000 - lack of consent, so no further action 33,000 - no further action for various reasons (i.e., outside OIG jurisdiction) Collectively, these numbers add up to 36,261, which is 1,837 short of the 38,098 contacts you indicated were made in FY 2015. In your response, you also indicated that the OIG's Office of Investigations, Office of Audits and Evaluations, and Office of Healthcare Inspections collectively opened 225 cases as a result of Hotline contacts. Do these cases account entirely for the 1,837 remaining Hotline contacts? Also with respect to the total number of contacts made to the OIG Hotline in FY 2015, does the OIG collect demographic data on who made the contact - i.e., whether the contact was made by a VA employee, veteran (who is not a VA employee), or someone else? If so, please share those metrics. If not, why not? Could the VA OIG reasonably begin collecting that information? In addition to providing me with a clear accounting of the FY 2015 contacts to the VA OIG Hotline, please respond to the following questions about the OIG's external case referrals to the VA: In your response to a question from Senator Baldwin, you stated "When we close an external referral that originated through the Hotline, we contact the complainant in writing to advise them how to request the results through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request." According to the VA's website, it aims to acknowledge a FOIA request within 20 working days of receipt, though the custodian of any responsive records may not be prepared to respond to a request at that time if he or she has a backlog. Why must the complainant go through what may tum out to be a lengthy FOIA process, as opposed to receiving appropriate information about the VA's review directly from the OIG? If the OIG accepts a case itself, does it directly provide a complainant with appropriate information upon the case's closure? According to VA Directive 0701, Office of Inspector General Hotline Complaint Referrals - which you cited in your responses - "[t]he OIG protects the identity of complainants and will not disclose the complainant's identity outside the OIG without consent, unless the Inspector General or designee determines that the release of the complainant's identity is unavoidable during the course of an investigation. Unless this exception applies, the OIG will not divulge the source of the complaints without a written consent to release identity signed by the individual." Particularly with respect to external referrals to the VA, why is this "exception" ever necessary? Put simply, why can't the OIG's office in every case procure written consent to release identity if there are concerns that the release of the complainant's identity may be unavoidable during the course of an investigation? Of the external case referrals to the VA in FY 2015, how many resulted in the VA substantiating allegations? Of those where allegations were substantiated, how often did the VA take corrective action? Finally, if the OIG had more resources and/or a reduced workload, would the OIG conceivably accept some of the cases that it is currently referring to the VA? Thank you for your time and attention to these questions. I would appreciate a response no later than December 10, 2016. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
11.10.2016	“We simply cannot continue to operate with a business as usual attitude when 20 of our brave service men and women are committing suicide every single day. Since my letter on July 15th, 118 days have gone by.” WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst sent a letter today to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Inspector General Michael Missal requesting an update on their open investigation of the events surrounding the death of Iowa veteran, Brandon Ketchum. Mr. Ketchum, a 33-year-old combat veteran of Bettendorf who served two tours with the Marine Corps in Iraq and a deployment to Afghanistan with the Army National Guard, was seeking medical health care from the Iowa City VA Medical Center. Mr. Ketchum tragically succumbed to suicide on July 8, 2016, after claiming that the VA had turned him away. Senator Ernst, who has sent multiple letters to the VA calling for an investigation into Mr. Ketchum’s death, sent another letter today to the Office of Inspector General pressing for an update on Brandon Ketchum's case. In the letter, Senator Ernst wrote, “I continue to be dismayed that Mr. Ketchum’s request to be admitted for inpatient services was not taken seriously, and believe that his death was an unnecessary casualty of a VA system that still allows our veterans seeking help to slip through the cracks.” The Iowa Senator continued, “We simply cannot continue to operate with a business as usual attitude when 20 of our brave service men and women are committing suicide every single day. Since my letter on July 15th, 118 days have gone by. Therefore, I again write to you requesting an update and prompt response regarding the investigation of the Iowa City VA Medical Center’s apparent failure or refusal to properly treat Mr. Ketchum.” Click here or see below to view the full letter to VA Inspector General Michael Missal. November 10, 2016 Mr. Michael J. Missal Inspector General U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (50) 810 Vermont Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20420 Mr. Missal: I write to you today formally requesting an update on the progress of the OIG report regarding the Brandon Ketchum case. As you know, I wrote to you in July of this year, requesting that this issue be addressed immediately. Since writing you with my initial request for a thorough investigation, I have also joined with other Senators who are demanding answers. I continue to be dismayed that Mr. Ketchum’s request to be admitted for inpatient services was not taken seriously, and believe that his death was an unnecessary casualty of a VA system that still allows our veterans seeking help to slip through the cracks. We simply cannot continue to operate with a business as usual attitude when 20 of our brave service men and women are committing suicide every single day. Since my letter on July 15th, 118 days have gone by. Therefore, I again write to you requesting an update and prompt response regarding the investigation of the Iowa City VA Medical Center’s apparent failure or refusal to properly treat Mr. Ketchum. While the VA has informally updated my staff that the case is progressing, we have received no official timeline or expectation of a report. Again, I want to reiterate that in addition to the results of your thorough investigation, I expect a written response from your office detailing concrete steps that will be taken to prevent tragedies such as Mr. Ketchum’s from ever happening again. I speak for all Iowans when I say that our veterans deserve better. If you have any questions concerning this request, please contact my staff via Katherina Dimenstein at (202) 224 -3254 or Katherina_Dimenstein@Ernst.Senate.Gov. Sincerely, Senator Joni K. Ernst

11.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on the loss of two Iowa police officers who were killed in the line of duty, in an apparent ambush attack: "My thoughts and prayers are with the two Iowa police officers who were killed in the line of duty, as well as their families and the entire Iowa law enforcement community as they face this devastating loss. "Although the investigation is still unfolding, what appears to be an ambush attack of police in the line of duty is an attack on the community at large and all of the men and women who risk their lives every day to protect us. This was a senseless act of violence and it cannot be tolerated."
11.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released a statement after President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for 19 counties in the State of Iowa, following the high winds, severe thunderstorms, heavy rains, hail, and flash flooding that resulted in riverine flooding in Iowa between September 21 and October 3, 2016. This comes following a letter of support sent by the Iowa delegation to the President for a major disaster declaration after Governor Branstad’s request. “I am glad President Obama fulfilled Governor Branstad’s request and issued a major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa following the devastating storms and flooding many of our eastern Iowa counties suffered in September and October,” said Senator Ernst. “However, it is imperative that the Army Corps of Engineers complete flood mitigation projects in Eastern Iowa to help prevent damage from these storms in the future and to avoid the continued need for emergency assistance,” continued Ernst. “Unfortunately, tapping into federal emergency funds has become routine rather than investing in fixing the levees to help protect our communities. I will continue to stress the urgent need for prioritization of this project until the Corps completes the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation projects, as called for under our provisions included in the Water Resources Development Act of 2016.” The federal disaster declaration will allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist Allamakee, Benton, Black Hawk, Bremer, Buchanan, Butler, Cerro Gordo, Chickasaw, Clayton, Delaware, Des Moines, Fayette, Floyd, Franklin, Howard, Linn, Mitchell, Winneshiek, and Wright Counties, and all areas in Iowa will be eligible for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. # # #
10.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst released a statement following yesterday’s confirmation by the Obama administration that there would be, on average, a 25 percent increase for ObamaCare plans. “Iowa’s businesses and families alike continue to struggle under the crushing weight of ObamaCare. Years ago, President Obama promised health insurance premiums would go down under ObamaCare. They haven’t. Now, the Obama administration cannot ignore the facts; premiums continue to rise and choice continues to dwindle. These rising costs once again prove the Affordable Care Act is anything but affordable.” This announcement comes after Senator Ernst recently highlighted Iowans’ concerns over rising ObamaCare costs at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing. The Iowa Senator is also an original cosponsor of S.339 to repeal the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” which authorizes full repeal 180 days after enactment in order to allow a six-month window to replace ObamaCare with patient centered, affordable, quality solutions. # # #
10.21.2016	WASHINGTON – The entire Iowa congressional delegation today urged President Obama to support Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad’s request to declare 19 Iowa counties a federal disaster area. The declaration would make the counties eligible to receive federal aid for the damage inflicted by high winds, severe thunderstorms, heavy rains, hail and flash flooding and resulted in riverine flooding from Sept. 21 through Oct. 3, 2016. “The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed,” the delegation wrote. “In many locations, the flooding was at a near record level, second only to the flood of 2008.” The 19 counties included in this request are Allamakee, Benton, Black Hawk, Bremer, Buchanan, Butler, Cerro Gordo, Chickasaw, Clayton, Delaware, Des Moines, Fayette, Floyd, Franklin, Howard, Linn, Mitchell, Winneshiek, and Wright. Signing the letter were Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Steve King, Rep. Dave Loebsack, Rep. Rod Blum and Rep. David Young. The signed letter is available here. The text is copied below. October 21, 2016 The Honorable Barack Obama President of the United States of America The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We respectfully ask that you grant the request made by Governor Terry Branstad for a declaration of a major disaster for the State of Iowa as a result of severe weather that produced high winds, severe thunderstorms, heavy rains, hail, flash flooding, and resulted in riverine flooding from September 21 through October 3, 2016. This weather caused significant damage to public infrastructure and private property. The nineteen counties included in this request are Allamakee, Benton, Black Hawk, Bremer, Buchanan, Butler, Cerro Gordo, Chickasaw, Clayton, Delaware, Des Moines, Fayette, Floyd, Franklin, Howard, Linn, Mitchell, Winneshiek, and Wright. The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed. In many locations, the flooding was at a near record level, second only to the flood of 2008. Thank you for your prompt consideration and declaration of this major disaster for the State of Iowa. Sincerely, Senator Chuck Grassley Senator Joni K. Ernst Representative Steve King Representative David Loebsack Representative Rod Blum Representative David Young
10.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following the White House's release of an updated “Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued a statement expressing disappointment in the administration's lack of progress with efforts to counter violent extremism and continued failure to release a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ use of social media. "It is shocking that after multiple attacks on U.S. soil, the Obama administration appears to be at the very beginning stages of a coordinated effort to counter violent extremism. Its updated Strategic Implementation Plan includes tasks such as cataloging existing CVE research, identifying promising CVE programs, and inventorying initiatives relevant to CVE. The fact that these basic initial tasks have yet to be completed is unfathomable and quite frankly, unacceptable. "What is more, the updated Strategic Implementation Plan continues the Obama administration's failure to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ use of social media to spread violent extremism. Despite the fact that a 2011 version of the plan committed to the development of 'a separate, more comprehensive strategy for countering and preventing violent extremist online radicalization,' the administration has yet to do so. Accordingly, earlier this year, I joined Senators Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) in introducing the Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of 2016 (S. 2517), which passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously in February and now awaits full Senate consideration. At a time of continued threats and attacks, we simply cannot afford to delay." The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act requires the president to prepare: A report on terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media and an evaluation of current government efforts to combat such use. A comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media. The bipartisan legislation is the companion to H.R. 3654, introduced by Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) along with House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-CA) and Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-NY), and passed by the House in December 2015. ###

10.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced that her office is seeking Iowa college students and recent graduates for internship opportunities in her Washington, D.C. and Iowa offices for the spring 2017 semester. “An internship in our Iowa or Washington, D.C. offices is a great opportunity to get firsthand experience in public policy, communications, and constituent services,” said Senator Ernst. “I encourage young Iowans who are interested in serving the great State of Iowa to consider applying for our spring internship program.” Interns will have the opportunity to experience a wide-range of responsibilities. In the Iowa offices, interns will assist constituents and attend local events. In the Washington, D.C. office, interns will learn about the legislative process, give tours of the U.S. Capitol and help with constituent services. Internship applications are available here. Applications for fall and spring semester internships are reviewed on a rolling basis and can be submitted to Ernst_Internships@Ernst.Senate.Gov. For student/parent questions, please contact Tyler Brown at Tyler_Brown@Ernst.Senate.Gov. All media inquiries should be directed to Press@Ernst.Senate.Gov. Senator Ernst was elected as the first woman to serve in federal elected office from the State of Iowa and also became the first female combat veteran elected to serve in the United States Senate. In Washington, Senator Ernst serves on four Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship. # # #
10.11.2016	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley and Sen. Joni Ernst today pressed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to explain the flawed policy that leads to the downgrading of flood control projects in Iowa cities for funding prioritization. Grassley and Ernst cited Cedar Rapids and Des Moines as losing priority under the broken formula. “It appears that the budget prioritization process may be biased against smaller cities and towns,” Grassley and Ernst wrote to the Corps. “In addition to failing to give adequate weight to the public safety risk, refusing to fund flood damage reduction and risk management projects in smaller cities and towns can be penny wise and pound foolish. Without sufficient flood risk management structures, the flood damages to a small city or town recur again and again. Millions of dollars are spent to implement temporary protection measures and billions of dollars are spent to pay for emergency recovery efforts after-the-fact. As a result, the city centers face economic development issues and property values can decrease.” Grassley and Ernst pressed for answers to a series of questions, such as whether the Corps considers the economic losses of temporary flood control measures instead of permanent steps and how public safety and loss of life are considered in the decision-making process to budget for and fund flood risk reduction projects. They asked for “concrete examples” of past decisions showing how the Corps considers public safety and loss of life in the decision-making process and for a complete list of pending projects. Earlier, Ernst and Grassley demanded answers from the Corps on why the Cedar Rapids flood control project hasn’t been completed. Grassley gave a speech on the Senate floor expressing frustration with the Corps’ bureaucracy. The Grassley-Ernst letter is available here. -30-
10.07.2016	Washington, D.C. – Rep. Steve King, Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Rod Blum, Rep. David Young, and Rep. Dave Loebsack sent a letter to Governor Terry Branstad supporting the State of Iowa in its response and recovery efforts underway for the severe weather and flooding event starting September 21st. The delegation states in the letter, “The State of Iowa and its federal partners have coordinated well to mitigate the impact of this flooding; however, much remains to be done. While we do not yet have a clear picture of the full scope of the damage, assessments are underway, and we will soon know more about the extent of the impact of these weather events. The initial damage assessment reports have been sobering, though losses may have been even greater and more devastating if not for the outstanding efforts made by the emergency managers of each of the affected counties, and we would like to recognize and thank them for their commendable work.” Iowans are smart, hardworking and resilient people working diligently to put their lives back together. The delegation wishes to express their full and undivided support for any request made by the Governor to the President to declare the affected areas a federal disaster, should final damage assessments prove that such a request is justified. To view the original letter, click here. The text follows: October 7, 2016 Governor Terry Branstad Office of the Governor 1007 East Grand Avenue Des Moines, IA 50319 Dear Governor Branstad, As you well know, severe weather and flooding, starting on the evening September 21st of this year, has affected nearly one-third of Iowa. This disaster has damaged homes, businesses, agricultural land and resources and disrupted the lives and livelihoods of thousands. The weather events on September 21st and September 22nd included torrential rainfall, with as much as 10 inches of rain falling in one location within a few hours, localized flash flooding, damaging winds, hail, and at least one tornado. Areas directly affected by severe flooding include, but are not limited to, nearly the entirety of the Upper Mississippi River Basin in Iowa. More specifically, this includes flooding within the Coon-Yellow Watershed, the Upper Iowa Watershed, the Turkey Watershed, the Grant-Little Maquoketa Watershed, the Upper Wapsipinicon Watershed, the Shell Rock Watershed, and the majority of the Cedar River Basin, including areas along the Iowa River in the Upper Iowa and Middle Iowa watersheds. This unprecedented flooding resulted in a record crest of the Shell Rock River at Greene and Shell Rock, 1.1 feet above the previous record crest set in 2008. The State of Iowa and its federal partners have coordinated well to mitigate the impact of this flooding. We appreciate the many updates throughout the response and now during the recovery process. However, we know much remains to be done. While we do not yet have a clear picture of the full scope of the damage, we know that the joint damage assessments are underway. The initial damage assessment reports have been sobering, though losses may have been dramatically greater and more devastating if not for the outstanding efforts made by the state, cities, and county emergency managers of the affected areas. We would like to recognize and thank everyone for their commendable work. As the smart, hardworking, resilient people of Iowa work diligently to put their lives back together and move forward, we express our full and undivided support for any request that you may make of the President to declare these areas a federal disaster, should final damage assessments prove that such a request is justified. Sincerely, Rep. Steve King Sen. Chuck Grassley Sen. Joni K. Ernst Rep. Rod Blum Rep. David Young Rep. Dave Loebsack

10.01.2016	WASHINGTON, DC - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Service Committee, today made the following statement on the Obama Administration and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' (ASEAN) discussion on ISIS in Asia: "I am pleased to see Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations were able to come together in Hawaii. Working to ensure we can collaborate to counter ISIS in Southeast Asia is important as we see our common enemy spread. Secretary Carter's request for a 2017 workshop on counter terrorism in Southeast Asia to identify critical strategy gaps is a step in the right direction, but ‎we must do more." Last week, Senator Ernst pressed Secretary Carter and General Dunford on the rise of ISIS in the region. They concurred with the Senator's assessment of the threat and noted this would be a top topic for the ASEAN meeting. Ernst added, "I will continue to stress the importance of countering ISIS in Southeast Asia as we strike them in the Middle East to the Obama Administration. We must show American leadership through support of our allies to destroy an enemy wishing to strike our homeland. ISIS is adapting, it's time the strategy to defeat them does, too. " Senator Ernst this week raised concerns with Nicholas Rasmussen, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center; James Comey, Director of the FBI; and Secretary Johnson on the alarming rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia and its impact on our national security. Additionally, the Senator pressed Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford on the need for a strategy to combat ISIS in Asia.

09.30.2016	WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst, Rep. Steve King, Rep. Dave Loebsack, Rep. Rod Blum, and Rep. David Young are asking the top House and Senate committee leaders to retain Iowa projects in the final version of the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 for potential congressional consideration later this fall. The Iowa projects are: Cedar River, Cedar Rapids. The language calls for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of the authorized project for flood damage reduction and flood risk management. Cedar Rapids endured a 500-year flood in 2008 and worked with the Corps of Engineers to develop a project to address that flood risk. Congress authorized the project in the Water Resources and Reform Act of 2014. To date, no construction funds for this project have been budgeted. This provision clearly shows the intent of Congress for this project to be a priority at the Corps of Engineers. This provision was included in both the Senate and House versions of the bill. Corps levees that affect community-owned levees. The bill language says that where federally owned and operated levees increase flood risk and compromise the accreditation of community-owned local flood protection systems, it shall be the policy of the Corps of Engineers to act expeditiously with actions required to authorize, fund, identify, and implement improvements to reduce and negate negative impacts to community-owned flood protection system accreditation. Des Moines’s DM-I levee is hydraulically connected to the Red Rock Reservoir Remedial Works – Southeast Des Moines/Southwest Pleasant Hill Remedial Works (SEDM) Levee. The SEDM levee is primarily operated and maintained by the Corps of Engineers Red Rock Project Office. FEMA considers the DM-I and SEDM levees as part of the same system of flood control so it is required that SEDM be accredited in order for DM-I to be accredited. This provision instructs the Corps of Engineers to act expeditiously with all actions that impacts Des Moines’ flood protection system accreditation. This provision was included in the House version of the bill. Dubuque. The bill language calls for a study to determine the feasibility of modifying the flood protection system to increase the level of flood protection and reduce flood damages. Dubuque is actively working on addressing all of its flood protection needs. This study will assist Dubuque’s efforts by determining if additional protection or modifications are needed along the Mississippi River. This provision was included in both the Senate and House versions of the bill. A Government Accountability Office study on the Corps of Engineers’ methodology and performance metrics used to calculate benefit-cost ratios and evaluate construction projects. There are concerns with projects in Iowa, such as in Cedar Rapids, and across the country regarding the methodology used to calculate benefit-cost ratios during the feasibility study portion of construction projects. This ratio is used by the Office of Management and Budget to prioritize projects. This study will review the methodology and performance metrics used to calculate the benefit-cost ratios used by the Corps of Engineers. This provision was included in both the Senate and House versions of the bill. Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers Comprehensive Flood Risk Management. The bill language calls for a study of the levees along the upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers on a system-wide basis, to evaluate the flood damage risks on a system-wide rather than local basis, and justify projects on that basis. This review was recommended by the Corps of Engineers in a 2008 study and by the Secretary of the Army in a 2009 letter to Congress to address the fact that a rehabilitation of a levee at a single location often cannot be cost-justified but each location is an integral part of a levee system that provides essential flood protection benefits. This provision was included in the Senate version of the bill. The delegation letter to the leaders of the relevant committee leaders is available here.
09.30.2016	Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released a statement after President Obama issued a federal disaster declaration for 8 counties in the State of Iowa, following the severe storms and flooding that occurred in northeast Iowa between August 23 and 27, 2016. This comes on the heels of the Senator's letter of support to the President for a major disaster declaration after Governor Branstad’s request. “I am pleased that President Obama issued a major disaster declaration for the State of Iowa following the damaging storms and flooding many of our northeast counties experienced in August,” said Senator Ernst. “This will allow these areas to receive the much-needed funds and assistance they need as they work to repair their communities.” The federal disaster declaration will allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to assist Allamakee, Chickasaw, Clayton, Fayette, Floyd, Howard, Mitchell, and Winneshiek Counties through the Public Assistance program, and all areas in Iowa will be eligible for assistance under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program. # # #

09.29.2016	[WASHINGTON, D.C.] – To reaffirm and revive our nation’s longstanding commitment to Gold Star Mothers and Gold Star Families, U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced legislation to re-issue the “Gold Star” stamp recognizing and honoring families who have lost a child or family member in service to the nation. The U.S. Post Office Department first issued a stamp honoring Gold Star Mothers in 1948. “Gold Star Families are national heroes. Their extraordinary contribution is beyond measure – not merely for their loss, but the comfort they selflessly provide others, and their model of service and sacrifice,” Blumenthal said. “Their strength, courage, resolve, and resilience are remarkable beyond words. Reissuing the Gold Star Stamp is a small token of our gratitude that will serve as a constant reminder of their sacrifice.” “There is no greater grief than losing a child, spouse, or family member, and no greater sacrifice a family can make than losing their family member in service to our country,” said Ernst. “Gold Star Families carry both of these incredible burdens every day. In my home state of Iowa, the Sullivan family of Waterloo lost five sons in 1942 when an enemy torpedo sank the cruiser all five were on during World War II. To honor their five sons’ courage and sacrifice, Mrs. Sullivan became the first recipient of the Gold Star Mothers commemorative stamps in 1948. Today, we carry on that tradition by reintroducing the Gold Star Families commemorative stamp so that we may all have the opportunity to demonstrate our profound appreciation and respect for our fallen servicemembers’ families, and their sacrifices to our country.” In 1947, President Harry S. Truman signed into law legislation establishing the first Gold Star Mothers stamp. The original Gold Star Mothers stamp became available on September 21, 1948. The first sheet of stamps were presented to Mrs. Thomas F. Sullivan of Waterloo, Iowa, who lost five sons when an enemy torpedo sank the cruiser Juneau on November 13, 1942. “It has been nearly 70 years since the release of the first and only postage stamp honoring Gold Star Families and remembering their personal family sacrifices. Creation of the Gold Star Families Forever Stamp will help education the general public that freedom is not free,” said Candy Martin, National President of American Gold Star Mothers. Because the Gold Star Mothers stamp was designated as a special series commemorative stamp, rather than a permanent stamp, it was eventually discontinued. In 1993, a “Gold Star Loss” stamp was issued as part of a series of stamps marking the 50th anniversary of World War II. Blumenthal wrote Postmaster General Megan Brennan in August to urge the United States Postal Service to reissue the stamp after he was contacted with the idea by constituent Joseph (Joe) Kaliko, of Greenwich, Connecticut. Although the Postmaster General has the authority to issue a stamp, Congress may also approve the issuance of specific stamps, leading to the introduction of this legislation. The full text of Blumenthal’s letter is available here. This is the second piece of legislation Blumenthal has introduced this week to honor the sacrifice of Gold Star Families. Blumenthal also introduced legislation to expand the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project to allow for the sharing of information on the lives of servicemembers who are missing in action or who have died as a result of their service. The Gold Star Families Voices Act would allow the parents, spouses, siblings and children of servicemembers who are missing or killed in action to participate in the VHP by telling the stories of their loved ones. -30-
09.28.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement following her vote in favor of H.R. 5325: “Today, Congress finally moved forward on a measure to ensure funding to combat the Zika virus, provide quality care for our veterans, and ensure our troops out on the front lines have the resources they need to protect the nation. “Since being sent to the Senate however, I have been disappointed in the continued dysfunction in Washington that has prevented Congress from being able to put forth fiscally responsible funding measures. Iowans are frustrated by the political games, and rightfully so. Washington’s business as usual of legislating from one last minute crisis to another has gone on long enough. We must start working together in a bipartisan manner to put forward fiscally responsible and balanced budgets for a safer, more prosperous America. Adding a commonsense Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution would facilitate a significant change in the way Washington does business.” Senator Ernst is a co-sponsor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, introduced by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT). # # #
09.27.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), sent a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers demanding answers on why they have neglected to complete flood mitigation projects in the Cedar Rapids region and have put the public’s safety at risk. As the Senators noted, “In 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act authorized approximately $73 million in funding for the Cedar River project for flood risk management. To date, no construction funds for this project have been budgeted. The community has relied on federal disaster assistance and state and local dollars to rebuild the downtown area and improve infrastructure. Yet assistance from the Corps remains vital to complete necessary flood mitigation projects. … As you know, the economic benefits of flood control projects are based on the value of the property that is protected. If this is the only metric used, the Corps and the Administration consider building beaches in front of multi-million dollar oceanfront homes to be a higher priority than protecting the people of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, (the second most populous city in the state).” The Senators also called attention to the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 (WRDA), which recently passed the Senate and included two Ernst-Grassley provisions that call on the Corps to prioritize completion of the Cedar Rapids flood mitigation project and calls for a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on whether the value of a property for which damage would be prevented as a result of flood mitigation efforts is the best measurement for the primary input in benefit-cost calculations for these projects. As the Senators concluded, “With all due respect, it is no longer sufficient to say that your hands are tied and that nothing short of a congressional earmark can help communities like Cedar Rapids that have lower property values. You have some discretion to help and have simply made the decision to forego that assistance even though the community endured a 500-year flood event in 2008, worked with the Corps to develop a project to address that flood risk, and worked with Congress to get it authorized. Due to your refusal to budget for this project, Cedar Rapids is now facing another major flood event without the needed levee improvements. We cannot emphasize enough that the current events are the worst fear for city officials and all those who live and work in the community. They have been advocating for assistance from the Corps for the last eight years to prevent the very disaster situation that has transpired. We respectfully ask you to do everything in your power to help this community build essential infrastructure to prevent another event like this from occurring.” To view the full letter, click here or see below. September 27, 2016 The Honorable Jo Ellen Darcy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) 108 Army Pentagon Washington, D.C. 20310-0108 Lieutenant General Todd T. Semonite Commanding General and Chief of Engineers U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 441 G Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20314-1000 Dear Secretary Darcy and General Semonite: Once again, eastern Iowa is experiencing major flooding, including the community of Cedar Rapids. As you know, this is the second major flood event in less than a decade and the community remains frustrated about the lack of urgency from the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to complete important flood mitigation projects for the region. In 2014, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act authorized approximately $73 million in funding for the Cedar River project for flood risk management. To date, no construction funds for this project have been budgeted. The community has relied on federal disaster assistance and state and local dollars to rebuild the downtown area and improve infrastructure. Yet assistance from the Corps remains vital to complete necessary flood mitigation projects. According to the recent Statement of Administration Policy issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the House Water Resources Development Act of 2016, H.R. 5303, the Administration believes that: “New project and study authorizations should be limited to those most likely to provide high economic or environmental returns to the Nation or address a significant risk to public safety within the Corps’ three main mission areas.” If that is the case, can you please explain to us why the Army and OMB ignore public safety when deciding what projects to include in the President’s budget? For example, in E.C. 11-2-210, the USACE Civil Works Direct Program Development Policy Guidance for Fiscal Year 2018 (guidance for the development of the Corps’ FY 2018 budget) the Corps is asked if a new start recommendation is based on national economic development benefits or environmental restoration and protection benefits – there is no question about safety. Moreover, it is our understanding that for new starts the threshold benefit to cost ratio is arbitrarily set by OMB and may differ from year to year. For example, in FY 2010 the benefit to cost ratio was set at 3.2 to 1 for new starts. In the Corps FY 2016 budget request, there were only two new construction starts proposed, one had a benefit to cost ratio of 3.5 to 1. The other did not require economic justification because it was an ecosystem restoration project. In the Corps’ FY 2017 budget request there was only one new construction start – a fish passage project that did not require economic justification. Nowhere do we see any consideration of public safety in making new start construction decisions for flood damage reduction projects. As you know, the economic benefits of flood control projects are based on the value of the property that is protected. If this is the only metric used, the Corps and the Administration consider building beaches in front of multi-million dollar oceanfront homes to be a higher priority than protecting the people of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, (the second most populous city in the state). According to the January 2011 report of the Chief of Engineers, the benefit to cost ratio for the Cedar Rapids project is 1.2 to 1 and the project will have net annual benefits of about $1,000,000. This benefit to cost ratio does not take into account human impacts like public safety – it only reflects the fact that property has a lower value in smaller communities in the Midwest. If projects are only viewed through the narrow lens of economic benefit to cost ratios, communities like Cedar Rapids in less populous states will likely never receive federal assistance and the high level of expertise from the Corps. We strongly urge the Corps to address the negative impact that its budget development policies have on these types of communities. Recently, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2016 (WRDA). Included in this legislation were two provisions that we wish to bring to your attention. In section 3005 of Senate WRDA 2016 is a provision that calls on the Corps to prioritize the completion of the Cedar River flood mitigation project. It is important to note that in the last two years, Congress has felt this project to be so imperative that it has been referenced in two WRDA bills, one which is now law, and the other was passed by the Senate on September 15, 2016. The second provision we would like to bring to your attention is a study that we requested to be completed by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). This study would examine the current methodologies of the benefit to cost ratios and ask GAO to determine among other things, whether the value of property for which damage would be prevented as a result of a flood risk management project is the best measurement for the primary input in benefit-cost calculations for flood risk management projects. With all due respect, it is no longer sufficient to say that your hands are tied and that nothing short of a congressional earmark can help communities like Cedar Rapids that have lower property values. You have some discretion to help and have simply made the decision to forego that assistance even though the community endured a 500-year flood event in 2008, worked with the Corps to develop a project to address that flood risk, and worked with Congress to get it authorized. Due to your refusal to budget for this project, Cedar Rapids is now facing another major flood event without the needed levee improvements. We cannot emphasize enough that the current events are the worst fear for city officials and all those who live and work in the community. They have been advocating for assistance from the Corps for the last eight years to prevent the very disaster situation that has transpired. We respectfully ask you to do everything in your power to help this community build essential infrastructure to prevent another event like this from occurring. Sincerely, Chuck Grassley Joni K. Ernst United States Senator United States Senator # # #
09.27.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing, “Fifteen Years After 9/11: Threats to the Homeland,” Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Jeh Johnson for updates on the whereabouts of Edwin Mejia. Mejia is an illegal immigrant who struck and killed 21-year-old Iowan Sarah Root while driving drunk and drag racing, and has since disappeared after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) declined to detain him as an enforcement priority. Senator Ernst: “Do you have any updates from the Department on where Mejia is located?” Secretary Johnson: “I know from my communications with Senator Sasse, as I told him, we along with local law enforcement are looking for him.” Senator Ernst: “Do you believe him to be in the country or elsewhere?” Secretary Johnson: “I could not say.” Senator Ernst also sought answers on whether ICE has since updated their so-called “enforcement priorities” to ensure that an illegal immigrant charged with killing an American is considered a priority for detention and deportation. The Senator’s questioning follows her introduction of Sarah’s Law earlier this year, which would require ICE to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person, and her multiple inquiries to ICE and the Department of Health and Human Services seeking answers on Mejia’s whereabouts and the reason he was not detained by ICE. In addition, Senator Ernst questioned witnesses Nicholas Rasmussen, the Director of the National Counterterrorism Center; James Comey, Director of the FBI; and Secretary Johnson on the alarming rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia and its impact on our national security. Rasmussen, who recently returned from the region, echoed the Senator’s concern that the ISIS ideology “could find fertile ground” in places like Southeast Asia. Rasmussen emphasized that “in the period after 9-11, Southeast Asia was a very active theatre for al-Qaeda and the al-Qaeda affiliated organization Jemaah Islamiyah, posed a major threat in Southeast Asia to U.S. interests and to the interests of our partners. So, we have known looking back that this was always a potential hot zone where ISIL might find the possibility to take root.” Rasmussen also warned that “there are foreign fighters from that region who have made their way into Iraq and Syria, those individuals seek to identify individuals to send back to or to connect with back in their home countries. So the same phenomenon that the Europeans are dealing with, that our other partners are dealing with is being seen in Southeast Asia.” Senator Ernst’s questioning today follows a hearing last week with Secretary of Defense Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph Dunford where she pressed them on a strategy to combat ISIS in Asia, and recent remarks on the Senate floor as well as her column in TIME on the spread of ISIS in Asia.

09.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Last week, The Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report on whether the Patient-Centered Community Care (PC3) networks – known as Health Net in Iowa –were developed and awarded accurately. Health Net is the VA contract recipient that covers Iowa and many of its neighboring states; unfortunately the service to veterans is flawed and inadequate, while the PC3’s gain huge financial benefits. The OIG found that the $9.4 billion of contracts the VA gave to the PC3’s were found to have, “weaknesses in the planning, evaluation, and award of the PC3 contracts.” Upon reviewing the report, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), issued the following statement: “Health Net was supposed to help veterans seeking care outside of the VA get the appointments with community healthcare providers. Instead, veterans faced a complicated bureaucratic system many described as more difficult than dealing directly with the VA,” said Senator Ernst. “While Health Net has repeatedly put in place measures to improve their poor performance, they have failed to provide adequate services for our nation’s veterans. This report confirms that the process through which the VA chose to award Health Net billions of dollars lacks accountability, adequate oversight and sufficient planning. This is unacceptable. Health Net, and the VA must do better for our veterans.” Findings in the OIG report: OIG found that the $9.4 billion of contracts the VA gave to the PC3’s were found to have, “weaknesses in the planning, evaluation, and award of the PC3 contracts.” PC3 contracts were not developed or awarded in accordance with acquisition regulations and VA policy (which are intended to ensure services acquired are based on need and at fair and reasonable prices). VA contracting officials solicited proposals from vendors without clearly articulating VA’s requirements, setting the contracts up to fail. Contract costs were negotiated at higher rates than those originally proposed. Only the VA would have the total incompetency to negotiate the price of an offer up – ending with a more expensive contract. The OIG noted that the acquisition team increased potential costs for the Health Net contract by over $16.8 million, all of which could have easily been prevented had pricing documents been reviewed. OIG found that there was no senior executive at the VA accountable for this contracting process, therefore the process lacked accountability. The report was so unfavorable that the OIG recommendations are broad generalities, recommending improvements in oversight, accountability, and ensuring sufficient planning on complex acquisitions. # # #
09.23.2016	“Iowa is ready to assist the cities and towns impacted or threatened by flooding,” said U.S. Senator Joni Ernst. “The Governor has made clear that we will do everything we can to get the communities the resources they need. I share the Governor’s commitment and as a member of the Iowa Army National Guard, I was in Eastern Iowa in 2008 when the terrible floods hit, and Iowans worked tirelessly, side-by-side to repair the damage that was done; I will be there to assist however I can again. “It is critical that amid the flooding, Iowans remain vigilant and exercise caution around standing water. For those in need of assistance, or those who are able to lend a helping hand, please see the list of resources below.” (photo from the National Weather Service) Resources on Flooding in Eastern Iowa Preparation: FEMA: How to prepare for a flood: https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1409002852888-3c5d1f64f12df02aa801901cc7c311ca/how_to_prepare_flood_033014_508.pdf Ready.gov: https://www.ready.gov/floods Iowa Department of Public Health: http://www.idph.iowa.gov/flooding National Weather Service Flood Safety: http://www.floodsafety.noaa.gov/ Alerts: Iowa Flood Center: http://www.iowafloodcenter.org City of Cedar Rapids: http://cedar-rapids.org/alert_detail.php City of Cedar Falls: http://www.cedarfalls.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?aid=860&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed National Weather Service Watches, Warnings, and Advisories: http://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=arx&wwa=flood%20warning National Weather Service Des Moines Blog: http://www.weather.gov/dmx/blog Iowa Department of Transportation Traveler Information: www.511ia.org Option for Volunteering: Volunteer Iowa: www.volunteeriowa.org Additional Information from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA): Be Informed/Know the Danger: Keep track of severe weather and flood forecasts, and take them seriously. To do that: Monitor newspaper, radio and TV reports of current and predicted weather conditions; Keep a NOAA Weather radio turned on and charged up to get alerts around the clock; Set mobile devices to alert with the latest weather information. Make it easy by downloading and using a free FEMA app, which provides real-time weather alerts from the National Weather Service for up to five locations anywhere in Iowa or the nation. The app also provides valuable safety tips to help families prepare for, and recover from, more than 20 natural and man-made hazards, including how to make a family communication plans, a customizable checklist of emergency supplies and maps of open shelters and disaster recovery centers. Plan for the Worst: Severe weather can strike suddenly so have a plan to stay safe and take life-saving action if needed. The plan should include: Actions to take if it’s necessary to shelter-in-place; Where each person/pet will go to get out of danger; How each person/pet will get to a place of safety; How family and friends will communicate with one another if evacuation to or from different locations becomes necessary. For more information on creating an emergency plan, visit www.Ready.gov or www.beready.iowa.gov. Be Ready: Gather essential items in one place if evacuation is needed. Those should include: Wallets, purses, car/house keys, eyeglasses, cash, credit cards; Medicine and basic first-aid supplies; Daily living supplies for infants/young children, family members who are elderly or have access and functional needs, and pets; Important information such as numbers for bank accounts, insurance policies (health, auto and property) and credit cards; Important phone numbers of relatives, employers, schools and medical professionals such as pharmacies, physicians and veterinarians; Chargers for mobile devices; One or more changes of clothes. Include long pants, socks, boots and/or sturdy shoes; Bottled water and high-protein, non-perishable food such as a peanut butter, tuna and nuts. Talk through the emergency plan with all family members so that everyone knows what to do. If there is time, consider making a more complete emergency supply kit for homes and cars. To learn how, visit www.Ready.gov or www.beready.iowa.gov. Know What to Do: Understand severe weather terms and know what to do for each. Watch means a specific type of threat (flooding, tornadoes) could be forming; Warning means take action. Life/property threatening conditions are occurring or imminent. Heed emergency instructions. If told to evacuate, go immediately! Move immediately to higher ground if flash flooding is possible. Don’t wait to be told. DO NOT DRIVE THROUGH FLOOD WATER, even if you know the road. Turn around, don’t drown! Abandon mobile homes. They offer little to no protection, even if tied down. Don’t touch downed power lines or objects in contact with downed lines. Report electrical hazards, downed lines and gas leaks to the police and utility companies. Don’t re-enter damaged structures without first checking to see if they are safe.
09.23.2016	“Rarely do the American people benefit when the federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for that of state or local governments – particularly when the criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Congressman Diane Black (R-TN) led a bipartisan, bicameral letter to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell expressing their opposition to the Department’s new proposed rule to amend regulations implementing the Title X Family Planning Program. The letter questions HHS’ assertion that providers with a reproductive health focus are more “effective” than other health care providers which offer more comprehensive care for women and men. This dubious claim, if pushed through, would all but establish a nationwide mandate that these more narrow providers receive priority for the receipt of Title X subawards - at the expense of other entities like comprehensive primary care providers and community health centers. In the letter to Secretary Burwell, the lawmakers stated, “If HHS cannot clearly define an ‘effective’ or ‘high quality’ provider, it is unclear to us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also therefore unclear how HHS will be able to determine in every case whether state or local project recipients – who are generally closer to and more familiar with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical region – have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for that of state or local governments – particularly when the criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts.” The letter was also sent by Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James Inhofe (R-OK), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), David Vitter (R-LA).

Read the full letter below or by clicking here. The Honorable Sylvia Mathews Burwell Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue, S.W. Washington, D.C. 20201 Dear Secretary Burwell, We write to express our strong opposition to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) September 7, 2016, notice of proposed rulemaking titled “Compliance with Title X Requirements by Project Recipients in Selecting Subrecipients.” Although we appreciate the Department’s intent to follow proper regulatory procedure pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Act, HHS’s purpose for engaging in the rulemaking appears on its face to be an attempt to subvert the will of elected representatives. Moreover, apart from the Department’s impetus for the notice of proposed rulemaking, we also question whether the Department’s stated rationale adequately supports its conclusion that providers with a reproductive health focus are more “effective” than other health providers that offer comprehensive care for women and men. Nowhere in the proposed notice of rulemaking does HHS clearly define what it means to provide Title X services in an “effective” manner. It does appear to assert that a number of factors – such as the range of contraceptive methods on-site, the number of clients in need of publicly funded family planning services served, and the availability of preconception care – distinguish providers with a reproductive health focus as more “effective” and “high quality” than other types of providers. However, that list of factors falls far short of all of the attributes and recommendations included in the Centers for Disease Control and Office of Population Affairs report entitled “Providing Quality Family Planning Services: Recommendations of CDC and the US Office of Population Affairs.” To further complicate the argument about quality and effectiveness, the data cited in the notice of proposed rulemaking is not adequate for determining patient outcomes. The Department relies heavily on utilization and demographic statistics, but appears to lack hard data regarding actual patient outcomes and need, as the Department does not require grantees to track patients or verify their income. As you know, the issue of inadequate data has previously been raised by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), after the HHS Office of Family Planning in 2007 asked IOM to provide a critical review of the Title X Family Planning Program. In addition to finding “no clear, evidence-based process for establishing or revising program priorities and guidelines,” IOM stated the following in its May 2009 Report Brief: “The committee concludes that the program does not collect all the data needed to monitor and evaluate its impact. Therefore, the committee proposes a comprehensive framework to evaluate the program and assess how well clinics meet the family planning needs of the program’s clients. The committee concludes that additional data will be needed in the areas of client needs, structure, process, and outcomes in order to assess the program’s overall progress.” We welcome evidence that this recommendation has been fully adopted, but are unaware of any clear evidence confirming that to be the case. If HHS cannot clearly define an “effective” or “high quality” provider, it is unclear to us how state and local project grantees are supposed to do so in order to comply with this proposed rule. It is also therefore unclear how HHS will be able to accurately determine in every case whether state or local project recipients – who are generally closer to and more familiar with subrecipients and the patient base in their geographical region – have considered inappropriate criteria in evaluating subrecipients. Rarely do the American people benefit when the federal government attempts to substitute its judgment for that of state or local governments – particularly when the criteria used to inform that judgment are unclear, and that judgment is not supported by coherent and impartial facts. Finally, if HHS is going to assert the authority to adapt its rules in order to address changing circumstances, we implore HHS to consider the recent general shift in health care policy toward comprehensive care. As HHS states on its website, in addition to assisting individuals and couples in planning and spacing births, part of the mission of Title X is to contribute to “improved health for women and infants.” HHS’s suggestion that subrecipients like federally qualified health centers – which provide greater preventive and primary health care services than providers with a reproductive health focus – are per se less “effective” than providers with a reproductive health focus does not comport with that stated mission. We urge HHS to reconsider this overreaching and ill-supported rule. We will continue to closely monitor this proposed rulemaking, and intend to submit this letter as a formal comment. We look forward to a detailed response from your Department. Sincerely,
09.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on “U.S. National Security Challenges and Ongoing Military Operations,” Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, pressed Department of Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Joseph Dunford on the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia, and the need for a comprehensive strategy to counter their dangerous actions in the region. As Senator Ernst noted, “[Islamic extremist groups] are also in Southeast Asia and we are not spending much time talking about that. Groups like Abu Sayyaf – they’re now bonding together beneath the flag of ISIS. Yet, we really, like I said, don’t seem to be focusing on this. The Philippine forces lost 44 of their special police in a single battle to these terrorist groups last year. 15 soldiers were killed in a single battle just last month. “It’s clear that this is a very real threat, and President Obama admitted that we have underestimated the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, and what I fear right now is that we are completely underestimating the rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia.” Both Secretary Carter and General Dunford agreed with Senator Ernst’s assessment of the growing threat in the region. Ernst followed by reiterating the critical need “to ensure that we are not taking our eyes off of that region” (see transcript below). Senator Ernst’s questioning follows her recent remarks on the Senate floor as well as her column in TIME on the spread of ISIS in Asia. To watch Senator Ernst’s questioning, click here or the image below. PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT: Senator Ernst: Secretary Carter, are you concerned with what we see as a rise of ISIS in Southeast Asia? Secretary Carter: I am, and I’ll say something and then I want to ask the Chairman also if he’d chime in. When I talked about the metastasis of the cancer of ISIL, you’re absolutely right that Southeast Asia is clearly is a place they aspire to be spreading. I talked to our counterparts there who are concerned about it. We work with them. Just next week I’ll be convening then in Honolulu on a number of issues of Pacific security, but one of them is going to be on counterterrorism and countering ISIL. I’d say Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, you mentioned the Philippines, and other places, but those four come to mind. I’ve spoke to the defense ministers in each of those four countries. They have concerns particularly about the possibility that ISIS could establish a foothold there. In some places it’s already troubled in some way and there are places in all those countries, and it could grab hold there, so it is very much on our agenda. Chairman, please. General Dunford: Senator, I agree with your assessment and concerns. Last week I met with 29 chiefs of defense in the Pacific in Manilla hosted by the Chief of Defense of the Philippine armed forces and we discussed broadly the threat of extremism in Asia and what we need to do to deal with it. To your point, there’s a thousand foreign fighters alone we estimate have come from Indonesia into Syria and Iraq. There are hundreds that came from the Philippines. Other countries as well are dealing with that issue. I think, although it’s not very visible, there’s a significant amount of activity going on to build up the capacity of our partners in the Pacific. We’re trying to work with them to develop a framework within which they can share information, share intelligence, we have a significant maritime domain awareness initiative which will help them understand the movement into the sea. We see, for example, significant cooperation between the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia in the Sulu Sea associated with the movement of people and so forth as part of this violent extremist problem. So, it is a different fight. I call it a requirement for a regional approach in Southeast Asia as opposed to a coalition which is required in Syria and Iraq, but we are absolutely putting pressure on ISIL in Southeast Asia, we are absolutely working very closely with our partners, and frankly the limit of the support we provide is often what they are willing to accept politically. So we’re very keen and we will bring to the President any requests for support, and I think as you know Senator, we are providing some support now to the Philippines—intelligence support—and other support to help them to deal with the extremist problem that they have in the South. Senator Ernst: Thank you General. Thank you gentlemen. I just really want us to ensure that we are not taking our eyes off of that region. We seem to focus very heavily—as we should—on the Middle East and Africa but we do have other footholds for ISIS. # # #
09.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) released the following statements after their bipartisan Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act passed the House of Representatives: “I am pleased that the House of Representatives passed our bipartisan legislation that will help put a stop to the billions of wasted taxpayer dollars that fall victim to mismanagement throughout the federal government,” said Senator Ernst. “By requiring the government to streamline and adopt commonsense management standards, I am confident our bill can help prevent lax oversight, cost overruns, and deficiencies, while also raising the level of accountability for those that manage large federal programs. This is an important step toward making government more cost-effective and efficient. I look forward to continuing to work together with Senator Heitkamp and Congressmen Young and Connolly to ultimately send this much-needed government reform to the President’s desk.” “Making sure federal programs are well managed is key to creating effective and helpful relationships among federal agencies, communities and businesses, whether it’s in energy, agriculture, or any other field,” said Senator Heitkamp. “This bipartisan bill aims to give federal agencies a framework for better managing their programs, helping us reduce waste and promote effective management practices. Now that my bipartisan bill with Senator Ernst has passed in the House, we’ll continue to work to send it to the president’s desk to be signed into law.” Congressmen Todd Young (R-IN) and Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA), who offered the companion bill in the House (H.R. 2144) also said: “During my time in the Marine Corps, I saw firsthand the mismanagement that is prevalent throughout far too many defense programs and projects,” said Congressman Young. “This problem pervades all government agencies, with projects often coming in over budget and past deadline. For the first time, our reform legislation will implement government-wide performance standards derived from the private-sector to eliminate inefficiencies, reduce waste, and ensure projects conclude on time and on budget. The potential cost savings from these reforms are large, and I’m grateful to Senators Ernst and Heitkamp, as well as my Democratic colleague, Congressman Connolly, for their leadership in helping get this legislation across the finish line.” “From my experience in the private sector, I know firsthand that without a clear mission, measureable benchmarks and the empowerment of program managers, federal projects can, unfortunately, expand beyond their original scope, run behind schedule and over budget,” said Congressman Connolly. “Our legislation strengthens project management policy throughout the federal government by requiring consistent project standards and guidelines for program management, demanding accountability at OMB and in federal agencies to capture and implement lessons learned, and requiring clear identification of skills and competencies necessary for effective program management professionals.” About Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act: Establishes a leader within each agency that is focused on program management. Creates an inter-agency Program Management Council to drive improvements through portfolio reviews of agency programs and encourages communications between agencies and program management professionals. Requires the development of a specific job category with distinct qualification for project managers. Requires the federal government to adopt widely-accepted program management best practices and standards. Requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report three years after the bill’s enactment on its overall effectiveness and impact on program management in the federal government. Works directly with the Department of Defense to improve their current procedures while making sure to not duplicate existing efforts.

09.21.2016	Washington – A group of conservative Senators came together today to announce the launch of the Senate Opportunity Coalition, a new initiative aiming to ensure every family across our nation has access to the American Dream. Senators Tim Scott (R-SC), Joni Ernst (R-IA), James Lankford (R-OK), Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) have joined together in an effort to relieve poverty and ensure opportunity by sharing first hand experiences from their constituents, highlighting the issues facing low-income families, and working towards conservative solutions to make sure every American has the chance to succeed. The Senate Opportunity Coalition also released the first of a series of documents today, entitled Paving the Path to a Brighter Future. Each Senator contributed a story from their home state, showing both the wide variety of issues faced by those seeking opportunity and the Senators’ commitment to finding solutions. You can read the entire document here. The Senators wrote, “We are not looking at numbers, but instead meeting with people. Instead of waiting to talk, we are eager to listen. We look to take the lessons learned by those on the ground, grinding out the best living they can, and use those to power a new kind of solution…a brighter, more prosperous future. Moving forward, we will continue to share stories like these and bring our individual solutions already introduced to the table. From these efforts, we will develop new solutions, refine current ones, and forge the path forward.” ###
09.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry hearing on “The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Current State of the Farm Economy,” Senator Ernst (R-IA) pressed Secretary Tom Vilsack on the harmful effects farmers, ranchers, land owners, and consumers face in Iowa from costly and burdensome federal regulations on the agriculture industry. In particular Ernst stressed: “There has been a lot of discussion, not only in this committee, but as I’m traveling around the state back home about the depressed state of our farm economy, and what we can do to really help turn that around, and I’m always of the thought that less federal government involvement is better for our folks back home, not more. And what I’m hearing mostly from our Iowans, especially the farmers, the ranchers, and our land owners, is that it really feels like the federal government is out to get them, and I see that a lot with a number of the rules and regulations that are coming forward.” Senator Ernst also highlighted concerns with the USDA’s proposed Grain Inspection, Packers & Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) Rule that would inflict high costs on the livestock industry, and erect a barrier to young, beginning and small farmers’ ability to get into livestock production. Importantly, during Senator Ernst’s questioning, Secretary Vilsack agreed to providing a public comment period for stakeholders to express their updated concerns for the proposed GIPSA Rule if implemented by the administration: Sen. Ernst: “…for the GIPSA Rule, will you be taking public comment, for that particular rule?” Sec. Vilsack: “Senator, we’ll make sure that we follow the administrative process in terms of what we propose, since we haven’t completed the work, I don’t know what the final product is going to look like, but I can assure you that we’re not going to put out something that doesn’t allow people to review it, understand it, and to give us feedback on it.” Sen. Ernst: “I appreciate that very much, I’ll take that as a ‘yes’ because we have seen a number of agencies in the federal government, EPA is a great example where they have proposed rules and regulations and they’re pushed out in the form of memos and other guidelines where they can circumvent public input, so…” Sec. Vilsack: “That’s not going to be the case here.” To watch Senator Ernst’s questioning, click here or the image below. ###
09.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to President Obama in support of Governor Terry Branstad’s request for a federal major disaster declaration for eight northeast Iowa counties following the severe storms, heavy rain, and flooding that took place between August 23 and 27, 2016. As Senator Ernst wrote, “On September 9, 2016, at the request of the Governor, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) conducted joint Public Assistance preliminary damage assessments for those eight counties. The results of this assessment have led the Governor to determine that the damage warrants federal disaster assistance. I appreciate your immediate consideration of this request.” Those counties include: Allamakee, Chickasaw, Clayton, Fayette, Floyd, Howard, Mitchell, and Winneshiek. The full letter is below, and can be found by clicking here. September 20, 2016 The Honorable Barack Obama President of the United States of America The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: I write to you in support of Governor Terry Branstad’s request for a major disaster declaration. As you may know, between August 23 and August 27, 2016, several counties in northeast Iowa were impacted by severe storms, heavy rain and flooding. These storms left behind significant damage to private property and essential public infrastructure throughout eight counties across the state: Allamakee, Chickasaw, Clayton, Fayette, Floyd, Howard, Mitchell, and Winneshiek. On September 9, 2016, at the request of the Governor, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) conducted joint Public Assistance preliminary damage assessments for those eight counties. The results of this assessment have led the Governor to determine that the damage warrants federal disaster assistance. I appreciate your immediate consideration of this request. Sincerely, Joni K.

09.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, today issued the following statement in response to the attacks over the weekend in Minnesota, New Jersey, and New York: “I want to express my gratitude to our brave men and women in uniform, who have apprehended a man suspected of involvement in the explosions in New Jersey and New York over the weekend. I also want to thank the courageous off-duty officer in Minnesota who stopped the attacker at the shopping mall in St. Cloud. My thoughts and prayers are with those injured and their families. “While we do not yet know the extent of ISIS’s involvement, ISIS claimed credit for the Minnesota attack, and federal investigators are now looking into whether the New Jersey and New York bombings have any link to international terrorism. “As we watch ISIS spread from the Middle East and around the globe to places in South America to Southeast Asia, I will continue to call for a global and comprehensive approach to defeating ISIS. The millions of displaced citizens in the Middle East and we at home cannot wait any longer for a comprehensive strategy to be defined. We must act now to engage our allies, such as the Kurdish Peshmerga; correctly utilize Special Operations Forces; and encourage Congress to debate the use of force in Syria through a new AUMF, as well as end sequestration so our military has the tools necessary to defeat ISIS.” Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces. ###
09.16.2016	WASHINGTON — Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, along with Senators Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Michael Lee (R-Utah), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), David Perdue (R-Ga. ), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) wrote to Secretary of State John Kerry on Thursday, regarding the problems of dangerous synthetic drugs and counterfeit goods entering the United States due to weaknesses in international mail security standards. “There are foreign entities that are threatening the jobs, safety, and well-being of Americans by taking advantage of U.S. customs laws,” the senators wrote. “Deadly synthetic drugs, such as fentanyl, are being imported to the U.S. with relative ease through international mail. This problem goes beyond the critical need to prevent dangerous illicit drugs from entering our nation. Data from the Department of Homeland Security shows that over the last decade, seizures of counterfeit products have nearly doubled. The State Department should focus its efforts on the countries that are the largest producers and exporters of illicit goods.” Non-letter class mail entering the U.S. through foreign postal services is not subject to the same screening standards as packages entering through private carriers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does not receive electronic customs data for the vast majority of this type of mail, which greatly reduces the agency’s ability to intercept illegal drugs and counterfeit goods. The senators went on to ask for a plan to be produced by the administration in collaboration with the committees of jurisdiction to combat trafficking of illegal drugs and counterfeit goods. “We ask that you create a plan to work directly with those countries that CBP deems to be the most significant risk so that U.S. agencies are better able to review electronic and advance customs data for non-letter class mail and packages coming into the U.S. from these countries,” the senators continued. “We respectfully request that you outline such a plan to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senate Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary as soon as possible.” The letter is available here and below: September 15, 2016 The Honorable John F. KerrySecretaryU.S. Department of State2201 C Street, N.W.Washington, DC 20520 Dear Secretary Kerry: We write to express our concern about the possible risks present in international mail. As e-commerce grows, some foreign companies are taking advantage of potential weaknesses in international mail security standards to break U.S. customs laws and regulations by shipping goods that threaten the jobs, health, and safety of Americans. We believe this issue deserves greater attention within the larger foreign policy agenda of the United States, and we would like your commitment to engage with other nations directly to work to prevent bad actors from using international mail to evade U.S. law. Unlike packages entering the U.S. through private carriers, such as United Parcel Service (UPS) or FedEx, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) does not receive electronic customs data for the vast majority of non-letter class mail entering the U.S. through foreign postal services. Electronic customs data allows CBP to identify and focus screening time and resources on those items when they arrive. The ability of a carrier to provide electronic data to CBP also allows CBP to require the submission of select data elements prior to arrival. These data elements, known as advance data, better enable CBP to ensure cargo safety, prevent smuggling, and conduct commercial risk assessment targeting. Access to electronic customs data for international mail has been highlighted recently by several Senate Committees as a key component in enabling CBP to more effectively enforce U.S. customs and trade laws and stop illicit goods from crossing our borders. The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (HSGAC) convened a roundtable on April 19, 2016, to examine international mail security. As highlighted by the Committee’s roundtable, deadly synthetic drugs, including fentanyl, are affecting communities across the U.S., and the raw chemical elements reportedly are being covertly imported to the U.S. with relative ease through international mail. During the roundtable, participants—including officials representing CBP and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)—emphasized that advance data is a critical tool for screening inbound packages and mail and is vital in their effort to prevent dangerous drugs from entering the United States through the mail. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary held a hearing on synthetic drugs on June 7, 2016. Witnesses emphasized the role that international mail plays in the transportation of these deadly substances into our communities. DEA Acting Administrator Chuck Rosenberg testified, “Synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones are almost entirely manufactured in China. They are then imported into the United States through mail services.” Moreover, the threat posed by the presence of these substances is growing exponentially. According to the DEA, substances identified by forensic laboratories as synthetic cannabinoids increased from 23 reports in 2009 to 37,500 reports in 2014. A similar rise in synthetic cathinones has occurred as well, increasing from 29 reports in 2009 to over 14,000 reports in 2014. The importance of electronic data goes beyond the critical task of preventing illicit drugs from entering the U.S. As highlighted in a Senate Committee on Finance hearing on June 15, 2016, counterfeit products are also a growing problem for the United States. Data from CBP and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), show that over the last decade, seizures of counterfeit products by these agencies have nearly doubled from approximately 15,000 seizures in fiscal year 2006 to over 28,000 in fiscal year 2015; fiscal year 2015 seizures represent approximately $1.4 billion of goods. The percentage of counterfeit seizures occurring in the mail environment has also increased dramatically. From fiscal year 2014 to fiscal year 2015, the number of seizures of counterfeit products in the international mail environment has increased 48 percent. With an estimated 340 million pieces of international mail entering the U.S. in 2016, there are legitimate concerns that CBP simply does not have the resources to adequately screen non-letter class mail entering the U.S. from foreign postal services; the agency would benefit greatly from having electronic data to accurately track the bad actors and collect the proper customs duties on goods entering the U.S. We understand that the State Department recognizes the importance of electronic data collection and information sharing. As discussed at the recent HSGAC roundtable, Joseph Murphy, Chief of the International Postal Policy Unit in the Office of Specialized and Technical Agencies within the Department of State, said that the State Department has been working to make advance data sharing a part of international mail standards. Additionally, Julia Frifield, Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs, wrote that “the Department’s activities in this regard center on the Universal Postal Union (UPU), where efforts are underway to strengthen security measures on international mail,” including advance data standards. While we appreciate these efforts, and recognize that there have been advances in security standards within the UPU, a global requirement for advance data sharing remains far from reality while the threat posed by international mail to the American people is felt today. The United States should be a strong leader in international organizations, such as the UPU, on efforts to improve security, but working within the UPU alone is not sufficient to ensure we have all the necessary tools to screen items entering the U.S. adequately and in a timely manner. We urge you to think beyond the global standards in the UPU and make stronger electronic customs data requirements a larger priority of U.S. international policy and engage directly with individual countries. CBP Commissioner R. Gil Kerlikowske said in a May 11, 2016, hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance that past success in preventing synthetic drug chemicals from entering the U.S. has come from the State Department’s direct interaction with the Chinese government. The State Department should focus its efforts on the countries that are the largest producers and exporters of illicit goods. Numerous Federal agencies, including the DEA and CBP, agree that illicit goods, including deadly chemicals and counterfeit goods, are primarily produced in and exported from a small number of countries, including China and India. We ask that you create a plan to work directly with those countries that CBP deems to be the most significant risk so that U.S. agencies are better able to review electronic and advance customs data for non-letter class mail and packages coming into the U.S. from these countries. We respectfully request that you outline such a plan to the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Senate Committee on Finance, and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary as soon as possible.

09.16.2016	WASHINGTON – Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of Iowa this week sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack asking for information on the administration of the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). In their letter, they ask if a competitive analysis is conducted before enrolling acres in CRP and whether there is an emphasis on signing up entire farms versus just the marginal acres of a farm. Grassley and Ernst cited concerns raised by farmers in recent months about entire farms, composed of productive farmland being enrolled in CRP at rental rates many farmers cannot compete with. As landowners decide to enroll more acres in CRP, farmers have lost opportunities to farm some highly productive land. This has hit some young and beginning farmers especially hard. Grassley and Ernst wrote, “CRP is an important program that offers land owners alternative ways to derive value from their land while providing environmental benefits to the surrounding area. However, we must ensure the program is properly administered and stays true to its original intent while using taxpayer dollars in the most effective manner possible.” Below is the text of the letter. The signed copy can be found here. September 15, 2016 The Honorable Tom VilsackSecretaryU.S. Department of Agriculture1400 Independence Ave., SWWashington, DC 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack, Over the last several months, we have heard from a number of farmers concerning the way the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is being administered. Farmers have raised concerns about entire farms, composed of highly productive farmland, being enrolled in CRP at rental rates they cannot compete with. While we understand the three-year average formula that explains the rental rates adjusting slower than the market, we have not been able to explain why so many high quality farms have been enrolled as opposed to more marginal lands. Some young and beginning farmers have lost land as their landlords have decided to enroll their farms in CRP instead of renting it to be farmed. With the competitive nature of farming today, you can imagine how young farmers feel losing productive farmland to CRP. Therefore, we respectfully ask you to respond to the following questions: Does the Department of Agriculture ever enroll acres in the CRP program without conducting a competitive analysis based on the Highly Erodible Land (HEL) index? Does the CRP program put an emphasis on signing up entire farms versus signing up only the marginal acres of a farm? CRP is an important program that offers land owners alternative ways to derive value from their land while providing environmental benefits to the surrounding area. However, we must ensure the program is properly administered and stays true to its original intent while using taxpayer dollars in the most effective manner possible. We look forward to working with you to make certain CRP strikes the right balance for all stakeholders in rural America.
09.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the state of health insurance markets, Senator Joni Ernst raised questions and concerns over rising costs of premiums due to ObamaCare’s one-size-fits-all mandates in Iowa, and across the country. Witnesses included Iowa Insurance Commissioner Nick Gerhart; Lieutenant Governor and Director of the Ohio Department of Insurance State of Ohio, Mary Taylor; Deputy Commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance State of Wisconsin, J.P. Wieske; and Commissioner of the Office of the Insurance Commissioner State of Washington Mike Kreidler. In particular Ernst stressed: “…The stories being shared by our wonderful Iowa families are stories of hardship, and what the ACA has done to their families. We all have very serious concerns about how our families will be able to continue to afford the Affordable Care Act... “…Iowans and folks across the country have been placed in a situation where they’re attempting to decide, ‘do I pay for my mortgage or do I purchase health insurance?’ and I have heard that time and time again – it’s either a mortgage payment because the insurance costs now are so much more than they were previously. Is it a car payment? Is it a truck payment? Is it a tractor payment? I mean, there are so many considerations that families are now making that they didn’t have to make a number of years ago.” Senator Ernst also asked about the particular federal policies that are driving the increase of premiums in the state and what reforms are needed to reverse this unsustainable trend.

09.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) introduced the bipartisan Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority to reauthorize the leasing authority at Department of Defense arsenals for unused office space to outside tenants. This legislation would allow the Rock Island Arsenal to resume their leasing authority, which expired in 2012, and would authorize the Arsenal to approve 25 year leases until September of 2019 – generating jobs and income for the Arsenal until 2044. “Authorizing the continuation of this leasing authority allows otherwise unused space to generate income for the arsenal and reduces cost of government ownership,” said Ernst. “In addition, permitting tenants to lease at the arsenal brings businesses and job opportunities to the Quad Cities communities. We have seen its success over the years, and it’s a common-sense solution to prevent government waste and promote local economies. I’m pleased my colleagues are joining me to call for continued sustainability at these arsenals and military instillations both in Iowa and across the country.” “Our legislation will provide a workable authority for the Rock Island Arsenal to continue leasing unused office space to tenants that bring value to the arsenal while offsetting costs,” said Grassley. “It reflects a lot of discussion between our bi-state congressional delegation, the Rock Island Arsenal Development Group and the Senate Armed Services Committee to achieve a solution that works for everybody, and I look forward to seeing it become law. This is just one piece of our ongoing work to ensure the long-term viability of the arsenal, along with our efforts to increase workload for the factory and build on the impressive logistics capabilities of commands like Army Sustainment Command and Joint Munitions Command.” “Lease revenue is an important piece of Rock Island Arsenal’s long-term economic sustainability. This legislation builds on our ongoing efforts to help the Arsenal adapt to a changing workload and remain competitive,” said Durbin. “I will continue working alongside my colleagues in the Illinois and Iowa Congressional Delegations to bring federal investment to Rock Island and provide the Arsenal with the necessary tools to unlock its own economic potential.” "This legislation will eliminate bureaucratic red tape allowing the Arsenal the flexibility it needs to bring more jobs to the Quad Cities, encourage private investment and will help maintain the viability of our defense industrial base,” said Kirk. “The Arsenal Partnership plays a unique role in connecting the community and Watervliet Arsenal and this leading authority will ensure that the Partnership has the necessary tools to succeed,” said Gillibrand. About the Arsenal Installation Reutilization Authority: Affords Department of Defense arsenals the flexibility to reutilize excess space through leases or contracts with private sector entities under the following conditions: Contracts or leases help maintain the viability of manufacturing arsenals and any military installations on which they are located. Contracts or leases eliminate or reduce the cost of government ownership of the manufacturing arsenals, to include cost of operations/maintenance, environmental remediation or other costs. Contracts or leases leverage private investment at manufacturing arsenals through long-term facility use contracts, property management contracts, leases, or other agreements. # # #
09.15.2016	Ernst Pushes for Completion of Cedar Rapids Flood Control Project in WRDA WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement in support of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which includes her work to urge the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of the Cedar Rapids flood control project, as well as her provision to require a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study on benefit-cost ratios for flood mitigation projects: “The Water Resources Development Act authorizes 29 Army Corps of Engineers projects in 17 states – including Iowa, will strengthen our infrastructure through critical dam restoration and flood mitigation, and provides grants and loans to address water quality issues facing many communities across the country. “Additionally, this legislation includes my work to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of the Cedar Rapids flood control project. The provision emphasizes to the Army Corps of Engineers that Congress wants this project to remain a priority. I will continue working to ensure the Army Corps of Engineers understands the great need for this long-standing project to be completed in a timely and efficient manner. “Furthermore, I am pleased my provision requiring GAO to study the Corps’ methodology for evaluating flood mitigation projects was included. This study would examine whether the best methodology and performance metrics are currently being used to evaluate the construction project needs for small and rural geographic areas. I look forward to seeing the results and working on improvements as we move forward.” Ernst Provision Included in Section 3005 of the Bill: Section 3005 of the WRDA bill directs Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of four already-authorized projects for flood damage reduction and flood risk management. One of those four projects is the Cedar Rapids project. The Cedar Rapids project was previously authorized in the 2014 Water Resources Development Act so there is no need to reauthorize it. This provision does not create a new budget or spending authority. Rather, it emphasizes that this is an authorized project that should be completed. Ernst GAO Study Provision Included in the Bill: Requires a study on the methodology and performance metrics used to calculate cost-benefit ratios and evaluate construction projects. The study will address: Whether and to what extent the current methodologies and performance metrics place small and rural geographic areas at a competitive disadvantage; Whether the value of property for which damage would be prevented as a result of a flood risk management project is the best measurement for the primary input in benefit-cost calculations for flood risk management projects; Any recommendations for approaches to modify the metrics used to improve benefit-cost ratio results for small and rural geographic areas; and Whether a reevaluation of existing approaches and the primary criteria used to calculate the economics benefits of a Corps of Engineers construction project could provide greater results for small and rural geographic areas without putting a strain on the budget of the Corps of Engineers. Water Resources Development Act Impact on Iowa: Authorizes the dredging of shallow drafts ports on the inland Mississippi River to the authorized widths and depths. Authorizes a study of the levees along the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers to evaluate the flood damage risks on a system-wide rather than local basis. This review was recommended by the Corps in 2008 in order to address the fact that rehabilitation of a levee at a single location often cannot be cost-justified, but each location is an integral part of a levee system that provides essential flood protection benefits. Authorizes a study of the Dubuque local flood protection project modifications to determine its utility and what improvements need to be made to ensure a successful flood protection system. Allows the Army Corps of Engineers to increase the level of protection when rebuilding a levee if the additional costs are paid by the non-Federal interest and the Corps determines it is in the public interest. ###
09.12.2016	Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to James Comey, Director of the FBI, and Loretta Lynch, Attorney General of the United States, urging the FBI to begin collecting data on stalking and domestic violence crimes in the United States. Under the FBI’s current system for crime data collection, detailed information and data are collected on a wide range of crimes, from homicide to loitering, but no data are collected on stalking and very limited data are collected on domestic violence – two crimes that disproportionately affect women and families. “The seriousness and devastating effects of these crimes, as well as the propensity for repeat victimization, expose a dangerous gap in the FBI’s crime data collection programs,” the Senators wrote in their letter. “Both stalking and domestic violence crimes have a high level of repeat victimizations, and many times lead to death or serious injury of the victim. The FBI should begin collecting comprehensive crime data on stalking and domestic violence as soon as possible.” The FBI currently collects crime data from state and local law enforcement agencies through two voluntary, nationwide data collection programs: the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The UCR Program, which was built in 1929, collects summary incident and arrest data on 29 categories of crimes, from homicide to drunkenness. NIBRS is a newer system, which collects more information through incident and arrest data on 32 categories of crimes, from homicide to loitering. These programs collect no data on stalking and very limited data on domestic violence. The FBI is already authorized by law to collect data on new crimes without congressional approval, and it has already done so multiple times. For example, in January 2016, the FBI began collecting NIBRS crime data on animal cruelty, with the justification that animal cruelty is an early indicator of violent crime. The full text of the Senators’ letter can be found below or by clicking here: We write to request that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) begin collecting data on stalking and domestic violence crimes in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). As you know, the FBI’s UCR Program and NIBRS are voluntary, nationwide programs used by law enforcement agencies throughout the country to collect and report crime data. The UCR Program, which was established in 1929, collects summary incident and arrest data on 29 categories of crimes, from homicide to drunkenness. NIBRS is a newer system, which collects more information through incident and arrest data on 32 categories of crimes, from homicide to loitering. Together, these two programs help to provide law enforcement, legislators, and other organizations with the data needed to help address crime at various levels. Despite the broad range of crimes covered by these two data collection systems, neither the UCR Program nor NIBRS collects any specific data on stalking and domestic violence. It is estimated that one in six women will experience stalking victimization during their lifetimes. Similarly, an estimated one in four women will experience domestic violence during their lifetimes – an intimate partner crime that has a substantial, destructive effect on the family unit. Domestic violence and stalking also affect men; an estimated one in 19 men have experienced stalking at some point in their lifetimes, and an estimated one in seven men have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetimes. Both stalking and domestic violence crimes have a high level of repeat victimizations, and many times lead to death or serious injury of the victim. The seriousness and devastating effects of these crimes, as well as the propensity for repeat victimization, expose a dangerous gap in the FBI’s crime data collection programs. Without comprehensive crime data, it is difficult for law enforcement, legislators, and researchers to determine with accuracy and precision how often certain crimes occur, the rate of reporting, or the number of prosecutions. It is also difficult to determine whether a particular crime is a gateway to other crimes – for example, the rate at which domestic violence incidents eventually lead to murder, or the rate at which stalking incidents eventually lead to assault, which one study determined is as high as 81 percent. Accordingly, the UCR Program and NIBRS should begin collecting comprehensive crime data on stalking and domestic violence as soon as possible. The FBI has the authority to add and reclassify crimes that have data collected through the UCR Program and NIBRS. Federal law requires the Attorney General to “acquire, collect, classify, and preserve identification, criminal identification, crime, and other records.” This broad authorization provides the FBI with the authority to collect and report data on new crimes without congressional approval, and the FBI has already taken advantage of this broad authority to do so. For example, in January 2016, the FBI began collecting NIBRS crime data on animal cruelty, with the justification that animal cruelty is an early indicator of violent crime. Similarly, throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the FBI expanded its collection of data about the incidents in which law enforcement officers were killed and assaulted. As the FBI develops plans to transition the UCR Program to a NIBRS-only data collection program by January 1, 2021, we request that the FBI take three steps to improve the limited data that have been collected on stalking and domestic violence. First, in an effort to ensure the best and most comprehensive information is collected, we encourage the FBI to continue to work with state and local law enforcement agencies to help prepare them to be able to fully participate in the transition to NIBRS. Second, as the FBI works with these agencies, we urge the FBI to develop a strategy for ensuring that data on the crimes of domestic violence and stalking are reported, and that statistics on those specific crimes are readily ascertainable through NIBRS. If such information is not able to be captured by the existing crime categories available in NIBRS, we urge the FBI to expand its data collection. Lastly, until the transition to a NIBRS-only data collection program is complete, we request that the FBI take appropriate steps to ensure stalking and domestic violence crime statistics can be ascertained from the current UCR Program and NIBRS. We appreciate your consideration and respectfully request that within six months, the FBI respond to this letter with an update detailing (1) the means by which the FBI is attempting to capture stalking and domestic violence crime statistics in advance of the 2021 transition, (2) the means by which the FBI will ensure stalking and domestic violence crime statistics are readily ascertainable after the 2021 transition to the NIBRS-only data collection program, and (3) provide a status update on the FBI’s progress in moving toward a NIBRS-only data collection program at the national level, as well as what the FBI is doing to encourage state and local participation. ###
09.08.2016	CEDAR FALLS, IA – Congressman Rod Blum and Senator Joni Ernst will host a post office renaming ceremony at the Cedar Rapids Post Office to honor the sacrifice of Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker. In June of 2016, President Obama signed into law H.R. 4605 to rename the Cedar Rapids Post Office on 6th Ave SE after Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker for his selfless service and sacrifice to our country. “I am grateful that President Obama signed this bipartisan legislation honoring the memory of Sergeant Pasker, and am looking forward to taking the final step in properly honoring Sergeant Pasker and the entire Pasker family," said Congressman Blum. "Renaming this postal facility after Sergeant Pasker will serve as a permanent reminder of the sacrifice he made on behalf of our country, as well as honoring all those who have served the United States in the armed forces.” “When our state and country called on him to serve, Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms,” said Senator Ernst. “It has been an honor to work with the Cedar Rapids community and Representative Blum in making this dedication a reality. While we can never thank him and his family enough for their service and sacrifice, I am pleased the ‘Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker Post Office’ will now be a permanent tribute to his heroism.” Sergeant First Class Pasker enlisted in the Army in 1990, and in 1995, he joined the Iowa National Guard. He first deployed to Afghanistan from 2004 to 2005, and again chose to return in 2010 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. He and several other Iowa Guardsmen from his unit were responsible for mentoring Afghan police and military leadership. On July 9th, 2011, Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker gave his last full measure of devotion to his country when, at a checkpoint in Panjshir Province, Afghanistan, he was killed at the age of 39, only days before the end of his combat tour. He is survived by his wife, Erica; parents, Mary and David; brother, Andrew, and two sisters, Christine and Rebecca. Where: Cedar Rapids Post Office When: Saturday September 17th from 1-2PM Address: 615 6th Ave SE, Cedar Rapids, IA 52401 *In the event of rain, the ceremony will be moved to the Veterans Memorial Hall Ballroom located at 50 2nd Ave Bridge, Cedar Rapids, IA Rod Blum is the Republican Congressman in Iowa’s 1st District. He is a member of the Budget and Oversight & Government Reform Committees. Joni Ernst is Iowa’s junior Senator and first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate. She services on four Senate committees: Armed Services; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship.
09.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after again supporting the conference report on the Zika Prevention and Response Act, the Fiscal Year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon/VA) Appropriations Act, and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act: “Today the Senate again took up legislation that would provide funding to combat the Zika virus, provide quality care for our veterans, and ensure our troops out on the front lines have the resources they need. Unfortunately, rather than work across the aisle on these important measures, Senate Democrats continue to play politics at the expense of public health as well as the health and safety of veterans and our troops. “As Zika spreads and the number of Zika-infected Americans reaches the thousands, Senate Democrats must set aside the political rhetoric and support these commonsense measures. It is imperative we act now to provide funding to treat and combat this terrible virus. “In addition, Senate Democrats blocked funding for the safety of our troops and care of our veterans by voting down the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, and the Department of Defense Appropriations Act. Our servicemembers and veterans do not fail us, yet Senate Democrats are willingly failing our men and women by refusing to do their job. “These are critically important issues to the American people and I will continue to support fiscally responsible solutions. It is my hope that my Democratic colleagues will put politics aside and work with us.” ###
09.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today sent a letter to President Obama ahead of his meeting with the president of the Philippines during his trip to Asia. In addition to the growing human rights concerns and increasing Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, Ernst urged the president to also focus on “crafting strategies and discussing policies to best counter the rise of ISIS in the region.” In the letter, the Iowa Senator wrote, “Shortly after the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, U.S. Special Operations Forces were operating in the Philippines in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. When the Joint Special Operations Task Force officially concluded its operations in 2014, the U.S. had successfully helped the Philippines take great steps forward to curb the rise of Islamic extremist groups, like Abu Sayyaf. Unfortunately, much of the progress that was made has been lost as we continue to see these groups regain strength, increase aggression and alarmingly unite beneath the flag of ISIS. This is most recently and tragically highlighted by the death of 15 Filipino soldiers in a battle against ISIS linked militants this week. The Islamic extremist groups in the southern Philippines, following their pledge to ISIS, have publically called for others to join them.” Specifically, in addition to focusing on human rights issues, Senator Ernst requested that President Obama discuss the rise of ISIS with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and consider the following questions: How can the U.S. and the Philippines leverage the five new bases recently announced for U.S. personnel in the region to counter the rise of ISIS? The U.S. has continued to increase its presence in the region to counter the rise of China in the South China Sea. How can those same U.S. forces already in the region provide support to counter the rise of ISIS? The use of U.S. Special Operations Forces training the Filipino forces has a successful track record in the region. Additionally, annual training exercises, such as Balikatan, continue to be successful each year. What steps can be taken to resume, increase, or alter existing training for Filipino forces to ensure ISIS does not increase its footprint in the region? Ernst concluded, “As we continue to witness the growing threat of ISIS at home and abroad, I believe we must do all that we can to support our allies and show U.S. strength to stop the spread of Islamic extremism.” Click here to read Senator Ernst’s recent column in TIME on the rise of ISIS in Asia.

President Barack Obama 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NW Washington, DC 20500 President Obama: I write to you today regarding your upcoming trip to Asia and the rise of Islamic extremism under the flag of ISIS in the region. While I understand there are many pressing issues to discuss with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, including growing human rights concerns and increasing Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, I urge you to also focus on crafting strategies and discussing policies to best counter the rise of ISIS in the Philippines. Shortly after the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001, U.S. Special Operations Forces were operating in the Philippines in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. When the Joint Special Operations Task Force officially concluded its operations in 2014, the U.S. had successfully helped the Philippines take great steps forward to curb the rise of Islamic extremist groups, like Abu Sayyaf. Unfortunately, much of the progress that was made has been lost as we continue to see these groups regain strength, increase aggression and alarmingly unite beneath the flag of ISIS. This is most recently and tragically highlighted by the death of 15 Filipino soldiers in a battle against ISIS linked militants this week. The Islamic extremist groups in the southern Philippines, following their pledge to ISIS, have publically called for others to join them. In June of this year, they released a video in which they stated, “If you can’t get to Syria, join the mujahedeen in the Philippines.” Following the death of 44 Filipino Special Action Police in a single battle against these militants last year, it is clear these are not mere criminal gangs or disorganized rebels, but rather a mirror of the violent Islamic extremists we are seeing throughout the Middle East. For these reasons, I believe we must take strong steps forward to address this growing threat. I have continued to urge you for stronger support of our allies in the Middle East in their fight against ISIS, specifically the Kurdish Peshmerga. Today, I call upon you for an increased focus in Asia. In your upcoming meeting with President Duterte, I ask you to discuss ways to help the Philippine Government in their growing fight against ISIS and consider the following: How can the U.S. and the Philippines leverage the five new bases recently announced for U.S. personnel in the region to counter the rise of ISIS? The U.S. has continued to increase its presence in the region to counter the rise of China in the South China Sea. How can those same U.S. forces already in the region provide support to counter the rise of ISIS? The use of U.S. Special Operations Forces training the Filipino forces has a successful track record in the region. Additionally, annual training exercises, such as Balikatan, continue to be successful each year. What steps can be taken to resume, increase, or alter existing training for Filipino forces to ensure ISIS does not increase its footprint in the region? I thank you for the consideration of these options in your discussion with President Duterte on your upcoming trip to Asia. As we continue to witness the growing threat of ISIS at home and abroad, I believe we must do all that we can to support our allies and show U.S. strength to stop the spread of Islamic extremism. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator
08.30.2016	Senator Joni Ernst today issued the following statement on reports that “at least 25 militants and 15 soldiers have been killed in a series of skirmishes in recent days”: "Tragically, the events over the past few days only continue to highlight the alarming growth of ISIS in the region. The loss of 15 Filipino soldiers in a battle yesterday against the Abu Sayyaf militants, who have pledged allegiance to ISIS, is a sobering reminder of the Philippine Government’s ongoing battle in Asia. Additionally, this weekend’s jail break of eight terrorists arrested for their allegiance to ISIS and another Islamic extremist group pledging allegiance to ISIS – both in the Philippines – should be a wakeup call for us all. In case you missed it, Senator Ernst, a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, recently penned a column in TIME about the weakness in our fight against ISIS in Asia (below). In Case You Missed It… The U.S. Can’t Ignore ISIS in Asia By Senator Joni Ernst, guest columnist August 23, 2016 As an Iraq war veteran, the horrific rise of ISIS has long been a focus of my work on national security in the United States Senate. From Syria, to Afghanistan, to San Bernardino, California, I have pushed for better policies in our fight against an enemy that is spreading at an alarming rate. Over the past year and a half, I have fought for providing more lethal aid to the Kurdish Peshmerga in Iraq, ensuring we have adequate support on the ground in Afghanistan, and I continue to support a new authorization for the use of military force against ISIS – one that does not tie the hands of our military commanders. As we continue to watch the global expansion of terrorism, we cannot allow for weaknesses in our strategy. I view the failure to address ISIS’s expansion into Asia as one of those weaknesses. The January 2016 attack in Jakarta, Indonesia was sadly only a small example of what ISIS is capable of in the region. Islamic extremist groups in Asia, like Abu Sayyaf, have carried out worse attacks in the past. Often viewed as disorganized and fighting against each other, these groups have now started to band together beneath the flag of ISIS. Unfortunately, much like the Middle East, the groups now fighting for ISIS are not new faces to U.S. troops on the battlefield in Asia. Shortly after the horrific attacks on September 11, 2001 U.S. special operations forces were already quietly operating in Asia, a place Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was found to have used as a planning ground for the attack against the U.S., and a region riddled with Al Qaeda linked terrorist groups. Deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, U.S. troops excelled at advise and assist missions in the Philippines. Efforts to establish an Indonesian counterterrorism unit were hailed as a success. With an annual budget less than the cost of one new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, there was reason to believe our efforts were making a positive impact in a region plagued by decades of Islamic extremism. The decision in 2014 to officially end operations in the Southern Philippines left a void that ISIS has started to fill. The United States officially ending its Joint Special Operation Task Force led to, on a smaller scale, something much like we witnessed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Just as Al Qaeda in Iraq became ISIS, we are now seeing Abu Sayyaf follow suit in Asia. While it is easy to dismiss these groups as mere criminal gangs and disorganized rebels, the Philippines lost 44 of its Special Action Police in a single battle against them last year. And in June of this year, they released a call for other fighters to join them. The video, proudly displaying the black flag of ISIS, states “if you can't get to Syria, join the mujahedeen in the Philippines.” Despite efforts to curb the rise of ISIS from the Filipino government through negotiations, peace agreements and military action, the violence only continues. In April of this year, the Filipino Army lost 18 soldiers in an attack quickly claimed by ISIS. Most alarmingly, the terrorists are following the same tactics with civilian executions. Tragically, this was most recently witnessed with the beheading of a Canadian citizen in June. Last month, Bangladesh unfortunately joined the list of Asian countries that have fallen victim to ISIS infiltration. Terrorist attacks, like the 20 innocent civilians killed in Dhaka, Bangladesh, cannot become a common trend in a region already plagued by natural disasters, a nuclear North Korea and a rising China. While the United States moves forward in addressing many threats in Asia apart from terrorism, we cannot turn a blind eye to the threat of ISIS. I applaud the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense – an anti-ballistic missile system – to South Korea, our increased freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea, and the announcement of five new U.S. bases in the northern Philippines. However, none of these directly take aim at addressing ISIS. Addressing terrorism in the region will contribute to our larger policy objectives of showing strength in the region and pivoting to the Pacific. The U.S. operations from 2001 – 2014 were not done in a vacuum, they helped build partnerships and were carried out through supporting our allies in the region. These are tactics we strongly need to reevaluate for future operations. With Japan joining the global coalition to counter ISIS, and the Philippines continuing to fight terrorism in its own backyard, it is clear we have allies to work with. It is time we do so.

08.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Associated Press today reported that the “State Dept. says $400 million cash payment to Iran was contingent on American prisoners' release.” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement following the news: “The confirmation from the State Department today that $400 million to Iran was contingent on the release of American prisoners sends a dangerous message throughout the world. The Obama Administration has continued to prove it will appease our adversaries and fill the pockets of a regime responsible for the deaths of American soldiers on the battlefield in Iraq, and a government that calls for the destruction of our closest ally, Israel. “The most alarming impact of this $400 million is not the possibility that Iran may use it to build more improvised explosives to kill American troops, or continue their pursuit of a nuclear weapon, it is the impact it has on Americans around the world whose enemies now know the price they’re worth to this Administration if held captive. “As I have stressed before, the bottom line is that Iran cannot be trusted, which is why we should not have made the misguided deal that sets them on a path toward acquiring nuclear weapons and puts Americans and our allies at risk.”
08.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) held field hearing entitled “From Crop to Craft Beer: Federal Regulation’s Impact on America’s Food and Agriculture” in Dubuque, Iowa. Iowa and Wisconsin farmers and businessmen told the senators that regulations often have unintended consequences that harm Americans in unforeseen ways. What They Are Saying About Sens. Johnson, Ernst’s Hearing… Politico: “With the waters of the U.S. now firmly in the purview of the court system, agriculture representatives and lawmakers are pointing to the EPA’s draft ecological risk assessment of atrazine and OSHA’s decision to scrap an exemption for retailers from strict fertilizer storage rules as the example du jour of what they say is unbridled regulatory overreach by the Obama administration. The two issues held the spotlight at a field hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held Wednesday in Dubuque.” (Politico, 8/18/16) The Hawk Eye: “For more than an hour, the men described experiences and hardships, while Ernst and Johnson diligently took notes and asked questions.” (The Hawk Eye, 8/17/16) The Hawk Eye: “It just feels like someone, with the stroke of a pen, thinking they’re going to solve something and do not have a full understanding of the magnitude of the challenges they’re creating and the economic burdens on people,” Vaughan said.” (The Hawk Eye, 8/17/16) The Hawk Eye: “Richard Williams, director of the regulatory studies program at George Mason University, noted the “enormous” cost — in time and money — the business owners must dedicate nowadays to dealing with government regulations.” (The Hawk Eye, 8/17/16) The Hawk Eye: “Giving business owners the leverage to run their companies effectively and responsibly will be key to strengthening America’s economy for the future, Ernst said during her final remarks of the hearing. (The Hawk Eye, 8/17/16) Radio Iowa: “Senator Ernst says the increasing regulations follow a pattern of the current administration that is hurting the economy.” (Radio Iowa, 8/18/16) KDTH: “Ernst says hearings like the one held in Dubuque will have an impact on reducing the number of regulations placed on farmers.” (KDTH, 8/17/16) KCRG: “The panelists spoke of how, they say, some unnecessary government regulations on things like anhydrous ammonia are forcing businesses to cut jobs or even close. They talked about how some specific F.D.A and O.S.H.A regulations are impacting their company's bottom line.” (KCRG, 8/17/16) KCRG: “The Senators said that topic impacts all Americans as an average American household spends almost $15,000 each year to comply with federal regulations.” (KCRG, 8/17/16) Dubuque Telegraph-Herald: “Burdensome regulations are having a detrimental impact on everyone from crop producers to craft beer brewers, according to a panel Wednesday at Grand River Center in Dubuque.” (Dubuque Telegraph-Herald, 8/17/16) Video of the full hearing is available here.Click here for more information on yesterday’s hearing, “From Crop to Craft Beer: Federal Regulation’s Impact on America’s Food and Agriculture”. ###
08.17.2016	Video of the full hearing is available here: http://bit.ly/2bHGQPa DUBUQUE, Iowa — Regulations often have unintended consequences that harm Americans in unforeseen ways, Iowa and Wisconsin farmers and businessmen told Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in Dubuque on Wednesday. The hearing, “From Crop to Craft Beer,” examined the effects of federal regulations on agriculture and food producers. Total federal regulatory burden now exceeds $2 trillion dollars, according to leading estimates, a sum of more than $14,000 per American household each year. Johnson and Ernst heard how that translates into economic reality. “Overreaching rules and regulations are burdening our employers and our businesses,” said Ernst, "and we’re not growing our economy like we could be and should be because of that.” Federal regulators are drastically reducing the allowable level of atrazine that farmers can use. Atrazine, a herbicide in use for more than 50 years and found safe by more than 7,000 studies, would in effect be banned by the new standard, said Jim Zimmermann, a farmer from Rosendale, Wis., who is on the board of the National Corn Growers Association. That, he said, endangers water quality. Farmers who use conservation tillage methods see much less erosion of their soil, keeping silt out of waterways. But using safe herbicides such as atrazine is crucial to the effectiveness of conservation tillage, said Zimmermann. “If you’re not able to use atrazine, you’re less likely to use conservation tillage?” ask Johnson. “Yes,” said Zimmermann. Ernst asked about the effects of new restrictions on the handling of anhydrous ammonia, a commonly used fertilizer. The regulations, said Rick Vaughan, CEO of Innovative Ag Services, a co-op based in Monticello, Iowa, were motivated by faulty logic. And their cost is likely to drive small cooperatives out of the business of offering the product. His cooperative, which is larger, can better handle the cost, but it, too, might make the fertilizer available at fewer locations, leading to more truck traffic on rural roads. David Fritz heads the Potosi Foundation, a nonprofit that reopened a long-defunct brewery in Potosi, Wis., and now brews and sells craft beers throughout the region. He noted that the craft brewing movement faces strong regulatory headwinds, especially from health care costs under Obamacare and from the threat of a mandated $15 an hour minimum wage, which hits small brewers that rely on part-time and manual labor to do packaging work that is automated at larger breweries. Johnson noted that a sharp rise in the minimum wage would hit at a time of unusually low interest rates, making it harder for small companies to resist borrowing to automate. “If you’re worried about providing job opportunities,” said Johnson, “…the last thing you want to do is increase the cost of labor.” Fritz agreed with the analysis. “Craft brewers value quality,” he said. "They’ll take care of quality. Just don’t overburden with excessive costs.” ###
08.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent letters to Network Director for the VA Midwest Health Care Network Janet Murphy and Iowa City VA Health Care System Director Judith Johnson-Mekota calling for answers following the release of a VA Office of Inspector General’s report that found that the Iowa City VA assigned patients to “ghost panels”, or primary care providers who are no longer employed with the VA, which is in violation of Veterans Health Administration policy. Specifically, the report found that the Iowa City VA Health Care System assigned 1,245 active patients to “ghost panels”. As Senator Ernst wrote to Directors Murphy and Johnson-Mekota, “I cannot emphasize enough how upsetting it is that of the many primary care providers in the VISN 23 region, the Iowa City VA HCS would participate in the abhorrent practice of ‘ghost panels’. While the report does not say that any of the 1,245 veterans were denied timely care, this raises red flags that they may have been placed outside of the system that allows for accurate and honest measures of wait times.” Senator Ernst requested a “concrete plan of action describing exactly how and when these 1,245 veterans will be re-assigned or re-distributed to quality care providers. These veterans deserve to know whether they were assigned to primary care providers who do not even work at the VA, and I request that these servicemembers be notified immediately of their status of care.” Click here to read the full letter to Director Murphy and here to read the full letter to Director Johnson-Mekota. ###

08.15.2016	(Senate) – U.S. Senators Jon Tester and Joni Ernst are urging Secretary of Defense Ash Carter to address the growing rate of suicide among Guardsmen and women. In a letter to the Secretary, the Senators expressed their frustration with the consistent high rates of suicide among all branches of the military and the National Guard in particular. Tester and Ernst pointed out that Guardsmen and women are often left without access to behavioral or mental health care provided by the VA and suicide continues to be a problem for all of our brave service members. “We refuse to accept this as anything normal or acceptable,” the Senators wrote. “We urge you to take immediate action, and request greater accountability of the funding for mental health and suicide prevention programs under your direction.” Tester has been pushing for increased access to mental health care for military members. Tester introduced the CARE for Reservists Act which would allow for the DOD to fund needed behavioral or mental care, regardless of whether a reservist is within his or her pre-deployment window. Ernst introduced the Prioritizing Veterans to Mental Health Care Act to provide options for our veterans to receive immediate authorization for non-VA mental health treatment if he or she felt they could not receive timely or adequate care at the VA. The Senators’ letter to Secretary Carter can be found HERE. ###
08.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on the passing earlier this week of Retired Major General Warren “Bud” Lawson of Ankeny, the 26th Adjutant General of Iowa. “I am deeply saddened by the passing of General Lawson and my thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Bobbie, daughter Laurie, and their entire family. General Lawson was a true hero, dedicating his life to our great state and country through his more than 44 years of military service in the U.S. Army and Iowa National Guard. General Lawson was responsible for more than 9,500 Iowa National Guard Soldiers and Airmen during his 14 years as the Adjutant General of Iowa, and made an invaluable contribution to the state of Iowa. On behalf of Iowa, I am thankful to him and his family for his years of service.”
08.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee, and Ron Johnson (R-WI), Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued the following statement on the ‎ new interim report of the House of Representatives Joint Task Force on U.S. Central Command Intelligence Analysis:‎ "Pursuant to whistleblower and media reports, Senator Johnson and I have called on the Department of Defense Inspector General to investigate whether military intelligence reports on ISIS have been altered or selectively disseminated in order to paint an unduly favorable picture of events on the ground,” said Senator Ernst, a combat veteran. “This interim report released by the Joint Task Force is alarming and fuels my concerns that we may not be receiving a clear picture of our ongoing fight against ISIS. As the report states, ‘analytic integrity is crucial to good intelligence, and good intelligence is crucial to making informed policy judgements.’ Any actions or structural or cultural deficiencies resulting in an inaccurate picture of the situation on the ground would prevent Congress and our military leaders from making the best decisions possible in our continued fight against ISIS. It would also deny the American people of their right to know the truth. I will continue to follow this matter closely and look forward to the final conclusion of what I hope will be a full and robust investigation by the DOD IG." “The fact that intelligence reports were apparently manipulated to paint a rosy picture of the war against ISIS is unacceptable,” said Chairman Johnson. “The job of intelligence analysts is to produce objective, fact-based assessments, which then serve as a basis for informed national security and foreign policy decisions. Doctoring and denying reality has no place in national and military intelligence, which require objectivity and candor. President Obama owes it to the American people to be transparent and provide an accurate assessment of our national security threats rather than turning a blind eye to the dangers that face America, our troops abroad and our allies around the world.” Last September, the senators sent letters to those with potential knowledge of the allegations of manipulation of intelligence assessments, including James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, and Jon Rymer, the Department of Defense Inspector General. According to its press release, the House Joint Task Force on U.S. Central Command Intelligence Analysis "found that intelligence products approved by senior CENTCOM leaders typically provided a more positive depiction of U.S. anti-terrorism efforts than was warranted by facts on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis produced by other elements of the Intelligence Community. It further determined that numerous process changes implemented at CENCTOM as well as leadership deficiencies resulted in widespread dissatisfaction among CENTCOM analysts who felt their superiors were distorting their products.” ###
08.11.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after the Department of Veteran Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) confirmed their decision to review the circumstances surrounding the death of Iowa veteran Brandon Ketchum, who committed suicide after being denied care at the Iowa City VA Medical Center. The VA OIG’s decision to review the case follows two letters sent to VA officials by Senator Ernst on July 15th, and an additional request on August 2nd from Senators Ernst, Grassley (R-IA), and Johnson (R-WI) to investigate the incident. “The tragic loss of Brandon underscores how critical it is that every veteran is receiving quality and timely care from the VA. I am pleased that the VA OIG has answered our calls for an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Brandon’s death, including the alleged denial of urgent treatment, so we can determine what went wrong and take the steps necessary to ensure this never happens again.” Click here to read the VA Inspector General’s response to the senators’ request.

08.03.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, issued a statement following news that the Obama administration reportedly gave $400 million to Iran as four Americans detained in Tehran were freed: “It is incredibly concerning that at the same time the Iranian government was releasing four Americans that were detained in Tehran, this administration reportedly proceeded to give $400 million to Iran and kept it secret from the American people. The timing of this cash transfer is too coincidental and is another sign that this administration is willing to accommodate people who wish us harm. Not only have they taken the sanctions off of Iran’s radical revolutionary Islamic regime which funds terrorists all around the world and calls for the destruction of both the United States and our closest ally Israel, the Administration now reportedly provides a cash incentive to hold American citizens hostage. “The bottom line is that Iran cannot be trusted, which is why we should not have made the misguided deal that sets them on a path toward acquiring nuclear weapons and puts Americans and our allies at risk.” ###
08.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - ‎U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) is today demanding answers from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) after failing to receive a response over her initial letters regarding the death of Mr. Brandon Ketchum of Bettendorf, Iowa. Mr. Ketchum, a 33 year old combat veteran, served two tours with the Marine Corps in Iraq, and a deployment to Afghanistan with the Army National Guard, was seeking mental health care from the Iowa City VA Medical Center. The VA allegedly turned him away and Mr. Ketchum tragically succumbed to suicide on July 8, 2016. On July 15, 2016, Senator Ernst sent a personal letter to both VA Inspector General Michael Missal and VA Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin demanding answers as to why Mr. Ketchum was allegedly denied treatment, and expressing concern over the oversight and management of the Iowa City VA Medical Center if these allegations prove true. Ernst wrote, “From both of you, I request an immediate and thorough investigation of the Iowa City VA Medical Center’s apparent failure or refusal to properly treat Mr. Ketchum. “Expanding recovery and coordination activities for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), as well as improving care management service, is something I fear is not happening quickly enough in Iowa’s VA system. I am deeply concerned that too little is being done to hold Veterans Integrated Service Network Directors accountable for providing comprehensive case management in accord with Veterans Heath Administration (VHA) policy.” As a result, Senator Ernst today joined Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) in sending another letter to VA Inspector General Michael Missal to investigate why Mr. Ketchum was allegedly denied in patient assistance from the Iowa City VA Medical Center. The Senators wrote, “In light of what has transpired, we strongly urge your office to examine the facts and circumstances of Mr. Ketchum’s interactions with the Iowa City VA Medical Center on July 7, 2016 to determine what, if any, steps can be taken in the future to better protect our veteran population, including potential changes to VA policy, if applicable. It is also important for policymakers within the VA and in Congress to know if this is an isolated incident, how often veterans seeking inpatient mental health care are turned away, and how often this leads to adverse consequences.” Click here and here to read the letters Senator Ernst sent to VA Inspector General Michael Missal and VA Under Secretary for Health David Shulkin on July 15th.

08.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, applauded the signing of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard into law, which is bipartisan legislation that creates a national standard for labeling of food containing biotechnology ingredients. “Since I was sworn into the United States Senate, we have been working towards a solution for the labeling of foods containing biotechnology ingredients. I am pleased that this commonsense legislation has now been signed into law which will provide clarity to our farmers, food manufacturers and consumers, and ensure access to safe and affordable food. “Biotechnology products are critical to Iowa’s food economy, and benefit our workers and consumers alike. With the national food labeling standard, we are avoiding a patchwork of state labeling laws that could have resulted in over $1,000 a year in increased food costs for hardworking Iowa families. “I am glad to have worked on this important bipartisan legislation with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and I am pleased that it has now become law.” About the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard: Immediately preempts the Vermont labeling law, as well as all other state biotech labeling laws. Implements mandatory labeling requirements within two years, with the options of text, symbol, or electronic links. Meat, poultry, and egg products are exempted from the labeling requirements when they are the main ingredient. Additionally, it prohibits any food product from an animal to be classified as a biotechnology ingredient solely because the animal may have eaten food with biotechnology ingredients. # # #
08.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she will hold a roundtable discussion in Cedar Falls with Iowa veterans and community leaders. “Our veterans have made incredible sacrifices in defense of our freedoms and way of life, and it is critical that they receive the benefits they were promised,” said Senator Ernst. “These veterans roundtables are a great opportunity to hear directly from our veterans so we can ensure they have access to the timely, quality care they deserve.” The roundtable is open to the public.

08.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following the outbreak of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI), U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) led a bipartisan letter along with Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Joe Donnelly (D-IN), Al Franken (D-MN), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), John Hoeven (R-ND), John Thune (R-SD), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) to United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack asking for increased efforts to end discrimination against American turkey exports by addressing unscientific import requirements imposed by two U.S. trading partners. The Senators wrote in part, “As a result of last year’s outbreak, certain countries are requiring that all poultry exported from the U.S. be hatched and raised in this country. The most significant markets in question are South Africa and the Republic of Korea. As currently included in import requirements for both countries, the phrase ‘must be hatched and raised in the United States’ is causing significant disruption to trade even though there is no scientific evidence for its existence and sets a negative precedent for future trade negotiations with other nations. They continued, “The impact of the 2015/2016 HPAI outbreak has left long-lasting, undesirable consequences for the poultry industry, and the ‘hatched and raised’ requirement is one that needs attention. This new restriction appears to represent a non-scientific trade barrier that limits the turkey industry’s ability to export abroad.” The full text of the letter is below, and can be found by clicking here. The Honorable Thomas J. VilsackSecretary of AgricultureU.S. Department of Agriculture1400 Independence Avenue SWWashington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack, We would like to express continued gratitude for your diligence in working to eliminate Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in domestic poultry in 2015 and again this year. We are pleased with the improvements USDA implemented, in collaboration with the poultry industry, in the area of disease prevention and overall response since the first positive test last year. However there are still some issues that must be addressed, and we would like to highlight one in particular. As a result of last year’s outbreak, certain countries are requiring that all poultry exported from the U.S. be hatched and raised in this country. The most significant markets in question are South Africa and the Republic of Korea. As currently included in import requirements for both countries, the phrase “must be hatched and raised in the United States” is causing significant disruption to trade even though there is no scientific evidence for its existence and sets a negative precedent for future trade negotiations with other nations. Notably, these markets are not extending this requirement to all countries that were affected by HPAI, and there does not appear to be justification for this differentiation. For example, meat from a poult hatched in the U.S. and then raised and processed in Canada can still be exported to both of these markets, but meat from a poult born in Canada and raised in the U.S. is not eligible for export to the same markets. It is important to note that the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) is already recognized as the gold standard around the world for ensuring that no products from diseased poultry enter the marketplace. As a result, customers both in the U.S. and abroad can be confident they are purchasing poultry products from birds free of disease. We appreciate the work the Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) and the Foreign Agriculture Service (FAS) have done in creating an Export Verification (EV) program which allows companies to trace back and validate that poults are hatched and raised in the U.S. so that they are eligible for export to those markets. While this program is helping to re-open the Republic of Korea and South Africa markets to some U.S. turkey exports, we believe this is a short-term solution. The impact of the 2015/2016 HPAI outbreak has left long-lasting, undesirable consequences for the poultry industry, and the “hatched and raised” requirement is one that needs attention. This new restriction appears to represent a non-scientific trade barrier that limits the turkey industry’s ability to export abroad. Right now, just two important markets are affected, but we are concerned that this language could be requested by additional countries in the future. We look forward to hearing from you about this important matter. We specifically ask that you provide an assessment of the effectiveness of the EV program and the Department’s perspective on its use in future trade negotiations. Additionally, we ask that you consider raising the problematic “hatched and raised” language in future bilateral discussions with the Republic of Korea and South Africa. Sincerely, Senator Joni Ernst Senator Amy Klobuchar Senator Roy Blunt Senator John Boozman Senator Richard Burr Senator Joe Donnelly Senator Al Franken Senator Heidi Heitkamp Senator John Hoeven Senator John Thune Senator Thom Tillis ###
07.29.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – A new government spending report by a non-profit organization states that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has spent $20 million on costly artwork between 2004 and 2014. Earlier this year, Senator Ernst offered an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that would prohibit funding for the procurement of art work or art related consulting services, including new construction, until the Secretary of the VA alerts Congress that the appointment backlogs for veterans seeing primary care has been eliminated. Unfortunately, the amendment was ultimately not taken up or adopted. “It is appalling that instead of using $20 million of taxpayer money to reduce the backlog and ensure quality and timely care for our veterans, the VA chose to spend that money on decorative artwork,” stated Ernst. “This is another example of why folks across the country are fed-up with the VA and this administration: they are failing time and time again to make our veterans a priority. I call on Secretary McDonald to halt this excessive spending and focus on eliminating the backlog so our veterans can get the help they deserve.” ###
07.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - ‎President Obama today vetoed the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act which passed both the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate with bipartisan support. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) - who introduced legislation in the Senate along with Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Marco Rubio (R-FL), while Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) introduced a bill in the House - issued the following statement over the President’s veto:‎ “When I came to Washington, I pledged to identify the wasteful spending coming from both sides of the aisle, and make Washington squeal. That includes cutting the perks and spending that subsidize wealthy former presidents’ lives to the tune of millions of dollars. I realize this may not be popular among former presidents, but reducing this spending is the right thing to do. “The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would reform this flawed benefit system by cutting many of these unnecessary perks, while making certain that the security given to former presidents and their families is in no way impacted. “I am so disappointed that at a time when past presidents receive well-compensated book deals and speaking fees, hardworking Americans are also expected to foot the bill for their personal staff, office expenses, and much more. “By continuing with the status quo - despite the bipartisan support in Congress - President Obama has chosen to keep measures in place that unnecessarily cost taxpayers money and benefit wealthy former presidents’ personal careers and post-presidency life. “This is truly outrageous, particularly at a time when every citizen’s individual share of the national debt is nearly $60,000. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would have cut many of these unnecessary and costly presidential perks. I hope President Obama will reconsider and work with us to protect taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars.” About the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president.‎ In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act (S. 1411) was introduced by Senators Joni Ernst, Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) on May 21, 2015. The House companion bill (H.R. 1777) was introduced by Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD). The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. S. 1411 passed out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on February 10, 2016. Legislation ‎passed the Senate on June 21, 2016. H.R. 1777 passed the House on July 8, 2016.
07.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on the passing of U.S. Congressman Mark Takai, representative for Hawaii’s first district: “I am deeply saddened over the loss of Congressman Mark Takai. Mark served our country and the state of Hawaii with profound integrity, and exemplified the best qualities of those who bravely defend our freedom in the National Guard. I am fortunate to have served alongside him and to call him my friend. My prayers go out to his wife Sami, their children, and all his family and friends as they celebrate his life.”
07.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Gary Peters (D-MI) sent a letter to Secretary of the Navy Raymond Mabus seeking answers on the Navy’s dependence on electronic devices for navigation. The Senators questioned why the Navy has failed to mandate basic celestial training for its enlisted personnel, as well as why they lack requirements for U.S. ships to keep updated paper maps aboard at a time when our electronic navigational systems are increasingly targeted by our adversaries. As the Senators wrote, “This vulnerability to failure directly threatens the safety and security of our sailors. As the Sergeant Major of the Army stated in his recent efforts to return soldiers to their navigational roots ‘It’s pretty tough to mess with a map, a protractor, a pencil and a compass.’ We owe it to our sailors, enlisted and officer, to ensure these skills are being taught and our sailors are being held to the highest standard before we send them to the fleet. It is imperative that this standard is kept throughout the service.” The full text of the letter is below, and can be found by clicking here. July 14, 2016 The Honorable Raymond E. Mabus, Jr. Secretary of the Navy1000 Navy Pentagon, Room 4E686Washington, DC 20350-1000 Dear Mr. Secretary: We write to you today to express our concern with the Navy’s dependency on electronic devices for navigation. This February, it was reported that the Navy finally returned to teaching celestial navigation skills to its commissioned sailors. I However, despite this step forward, the Navy still fails to mandate basic celestial training for its enlisted personnel and alarmingly lacks a requirement for U.S. Navy ships to keep updated paper charts aboard at all times. ii As you know, Global Positioning Systems, and many other electronic devices used today, are increasingly targeted by our adversaries. Additionally, the satellites they depend on are also susceptible to damage or inaccuracies due to naturally occurring phenomena, like emissions from the sun known as space weather. This vulnerability to failure directly threatens the safety and security of our sailors. As the Sergeant Major of the Army stated in his recent efforts to return soldiers to their navigational roots “It’s pretty tough to mess with a map, a protractor, a pencil and a compass.” iii We owe it to our sailors, enlisted and officer, to ensure these skills are being taught and our sailors are being held to the highest standard before we send them to the fleet. It is imperative that this standard is kept throughout the service. The Army and Marine Corps both have started to take increased steps to enforce basic navigational skills for their personnel, and we ask today for the Navy follow suit. Earlier this year, the Commandant of the Marine Corps stated “We have a generation of Marines that have grown up assuming that the electromagnetic spectrum would be there for them; that they would turn on their gear and it would work 100 percent of the time, and it would be accurate.”[iv] We would argue sailors today have the same assumptions. We ask that you report back to us as soon as possible about any support the Navy may need in order to enforce the basic training in navigational skills for its sailors, and we request an update on what steps the Navy will be taking to ensure its sailors are properly trained in this area. Though celestial and nautical navigation skills are more challenging to acquire, they are absolutely critical for our sailors who find themselves aboard ships in geographically desolate locations.

07.15.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) applauded the bipartisan Senate passage of their resolution expressing the need for U.S. support and assistance to arm the Kurdish Peshmerga. “The Kurdish Peshmerga forces have been a critical partner to the United States in our fight against ISIS, and they need our support,” said Senator Ernst. “Now more than ever, we need to unite behind these forces to combat the radical ideology and acts of terror carried out by an enemy we now know all too well. These horrific attacks cannot become the new normal and we must come together with our allies to achieve our common goal: to destroy ISIS.‎ This resolution recognizes that we must provide increased assistance to the Iraqi Kurds with additional U.S. weapons, and I remain committed to ensuring our country stands behind this important ally.” “The Kurds are our strong ally and the most effective force we have fighting ISIL,” said Senator Boxer. “I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously passed this resolution to help ensure they get the support they need.” # # #
07.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2017, which was blocked by Senate Democrats: “At a time when our country faces increased threats from ISIS and our adversaries continue to test our strength around the world, it is outrageous that Senate Democrats would block necessary funding for our national defense. It’s truly astonishing that they would have the gall to block a bill to fund our military while our troops – and servicemembers I served beside – are currently out on our front lines. “This was a bipartisan bill. The Senate version cleared the committee by a vote of 30-0. In addition, this legislation takes important steps to ensure we are being fiscally responsible. “But now, Democrats are playing politics at the expense of all of our safety. We cannot afford to delay any longer on passing a bill so critical to our national security. It is our job to pass this appropriations bill, and I’m so disappointed that Senate Democrats are refusing to do their job.” To watch Senator Ernst’s colloquy on the Senate floor regarding the importance of passing this legislation, click here and here to view her remarks from earlier this week, and here to view her comments from today. ###
07.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) tonight released the following statement regarding the terrorist attack in Nice: “My prayers are with France and the victims of this horrific terrorist attack. We have continued to witness heartbreaking attacks in Europe and it is my hope we are able to come together to address the root causes of this violence with the strongest hand possible. While the investigation is ongoing, this has all the signs of a problem we sadly know all too well. "We must resolve as a nation in cooperation with our allies to take decisive action to break this senseless cycle of violence.” The following information is from the U.S. Consulate General Marseille: We urge U.S. citizens in Nice to contact family members and loved ones to notify them that you are safe, avoid the area, to monitor local press for updates, and to exercise caution if you are in the vicinity.

07.14.2016	[WASHINGTON, DC] – Today, U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) called on the Department of Defense (DoD) to end U.S. reliance on Russian-made helicopters to support the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF). For more than a decade, DoD has supplied the ANDSF with Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters, but ongoing sanctions resulting from Russian aggression have beleaguered the program and halted the flow of aircraft, parts, and supplies. Today, the Senators urge DoD to develop an American-made alternative helicopter for the ANDSF before the problem becomes more acute. American-made helicopters, like the Sikorsky Black Hawk made in Connecticut, would provide the ANDSF with a reliable air-lift capability as they seek to bring stability to the region. “As utility helicopters remain in high demand for mobility and close air support of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF), and Russia’s aggression remains unabated, our nation must definitively and permanently end reliance on Russian-made defense articles like the Mi-17,” the Senators wrote. “We urge DoD to develop a plan to field an American alternative to prevent such a problem from arising again.” Full text of the letter is available here and below: Dear Secretary Carter: We write regarding reports that the Department of Defense (DoD) is experiencing challenges in supporting the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) with sustainment of its fleet of Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters, in part because of U.S. sanctions on Russia. We commend President Obama’s 2014 Executive Order 13661, which bans U.S. business with the Russian arms industry as a result of Russia’s illegal annexation and invasion of Crimea. In turn, this action has impacted DoD’s ability to continue to support a shrinking fleet of Afghan Mi-17 helicopters. As utility helicopters remain in high demand for mobility and close air support of the ANDSF, and Russia’s aggression remains unabated, our nation must definitively and permanently end reliance on Russian-made defense articles like the Mi-17. We request detailed information regarding DoD’s strategy for supporting the requirements of the ANDSF for helicopters and supplying an American-made helicopter to the ANDSF going forward. As threats in Afghanistan remain high, including from the Taliban, ISIL, and al Qaeda, the ANDSF relies on U.S. assistance and its own organic airpower to provide an asymmetric advantage over its adversaries. The need for airlift capability in a country such as Afghanistan is particularly critical with mountainous terrain and limited infrastructure. As helicopters are an essential element in the effort to secure Afghanistan, DoD must work to address this issue before the need for aviation capability becomes even more acute. The U.S. began procuring Mi-17 helicopters in 2005 to help build the capacity of the ANDSF. While the current capability may serve as a temporary bridging solution, a more sustainable aviation fleet is required. Rosoboronexport is the sole exporter of Russian military articles, but sanctions prevent the U.S. from acquiring Mi-17 helicopters, parts, and supplies for the ANDSF. With Russia’s continued and increasing aggression, it is unlikely that sanctions will be lifted. Therefore, we urge DoD to develop a plan to field an American alternative to prevent such a problem from arising again. Thank you for your consideration and we look forward to working with you on this matter. Sincerely, Senator Richard Blumenthal Senator Joni Ernst ###
07.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the conference report on the Zika Prevention and Response Act and the Fiscal Year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon/VA) Appropriations Act: “I am deeply disappointed my colleagues in the Senate once again blocked critical funding to combat the Zika virus and provide quality care for our veterans. It is our responsibility to move the American people’s priorities forward – in a fiscally responsible way – and not succumb to partisan politics, especially at the expense of those in need of immediate care and assistance.” # # #
07.13.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – Senators Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Steve Daines (R-MT), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) today joined in a colloquy on the Senate floor to speak about the Democratic filibuster of the FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Bill. The funding bill came out of the Senate Committee on Appropriations with the unanimous support of Democrat and Republican members. However, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said that his members are blocking critical funding for our troops so that his party wouldn’t be at the “mercy” of Republicans. As all of the members said in the colloquy, this filibuster comes at a time when we have seen dramatic developments, just in the past week, relating to global security — North Korean submarine missile test, the deployment of 560 additional troops to Iraq, continued provocations by Russia, Chinese live-fire exercises in the South China Sea, and the President’s announcement that more troops will be staying in Afghanistan than he previously committed. To watch Senators Sullivan, Ernst, Tillis and Daines colloquy, click on the photo above. “In one of the most volatile times in our history, Minority Leader Harry Reid is blocking this critical funding to try and gain political leverage. It’s a disgrace,” Senator Dan Sullivan said. “Our enemies and our adversaries are the ones who truly gain leverage when we in Congress don’t commit to funding our troops. I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do the right thing for our troops and for our national security.” “The fact that we would reject funding for our forward deployed soldiers is appalling to me,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “These are my brothers and sisters. These are my friends, my neighbors, my colleagues. They are fighting on behalf of the United States. But the United States is now turning its back, with a filibuster, on these troops. How dare our colleagues block a bill to fund our military while our troops are deployed.” "We need to make sure our military forces have the tools they need to win,” said Senator Steve Daines. “Our enemies aren’t waiting around for Senate Democrats to fund our military to make it a fair fight.” “The Democratic conference has decided to say ‘no’ to funding our troops. They have decided to say ‘no’ to funding important training that is necessary to make sure they can complete highly dangerous and complex missions wherever a threat may occur,” said Senator Thom Tillis. “There are more than 100,000 active duty soldiers in North Carolina. What do I tell them when I go home? In spite of all of these threats, politics is above the principal of funding our troops and protecting our nation? This is politics at its worst. We need to send this bill to the President’s desk and show respect to the men and women who have sworn an oath to lay down their life for the cost of freedom.” ###
07.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded the passage of the conference report for the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which passed the Senate today with strong bipartisan support. “The tragic opioid epidemic across the country continues to tear apart families, devastate our communities, and cause unnecessary loss of precious life,” said Ernst. “It’s critical that we combat it head-on.” “Passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act is a positive step forward that will help equip law enforcement, health care stakeholders, and other key groups with the necessary tools to craft local solutions that are most appropriate within communities. CARA also provides critical treatment and recovery options for individuals suffering from substance use disorders. “In addition, this legislation includes a number of specific provisions aimed at improving pain management practices at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) so that our veterans do not fall victim to this opioid epidemic. It also includes key reforms to help improve VA health care by establishing greater support for veterans in need of care, expanding VA community outreach, and requiring greater accountability of VA health care providers. “I would also like to thank my colleague, Senator Chuck Grassley, for his leadership in combating this devastating opioid epidemic, and urge the President to swiftly sign CARA into law.” Iowa Statistics: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 264 people in Iowa died of drug overdoses in 2014. In 2014, 1 out of every 11,000 deaths could be traced to drug overdoses in Iowa. According to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a total of 94,000 Iowans used prescription pain medications for non-medical purposes in 2014, including 10,000 youth (ages 12-17). In 2014, 52,000 Iowa residents needed treatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive it, including 7,000 youth (ages 12-17). In 2014, the Iowa Department of Public Health reported 1,555 opioid-related emergency department visits compared to 519 in 2006. # # #
07.12.2016	Washington, DC – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), today introduced a resolution with Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), John McCain (R-AZ), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Dan Sullivan (R-AK) calling for all parties to respect the arbitral tribunal ruling with regard to the South China Sea and to express U.S. policy on freedom of navigation and overflight in the East and South China Seas. Earlier today, an international arbitral tribunal issued a binding ruling in the case of the Republic of Philippines against the People’s Republic of China regarding the dispute over the maritime jurisdiction of the South China Sea. The tribunal, which sided with the Philippines and invalidated China’s “nine-dash line,” concluded in its decision “as between the Philippines and China, China’s claims to historic rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, with respect to the maritime areas of the South China Sea encompassed by the relevant part of the ‘nine-dash line’ are contrary to the Convention and without lawful effect.” In addition to formally supporting the tribunal ruling, the resolution “urges all parties take action to implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and take steps towards early conclusion of a meaningful Code of Conduct, which would provide agreed upon rules of the road to reduce tension among claimant states.” The legislation also opposes any actions in the South China Sea to change the status quo through coercion or force; calls on China to cease all reclamation and militarization activities in the South China Sea; reaffirms the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the U.S. and the Philippines; urges the Secretary of State to use all diplomatic channels to communicate U.S. support for freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea; and urges the Secretary of Defense to routinely enforce freedom of navigation and overflight in the East and South China Seas. In reaction to the release of the ruling, Senator Ernst stated, “Today’s ruling reaffirms the United States’ right for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and I join my colleagues in urging China to abide by this ruling. It is abundantly clear that China’s land reclamation and militarization in the region must continue to be opposed, and that they must not continue down the path of destabilization in such a critical region. The United States will continue to stand with the Philippines against China’s actions.” The text of the resolution can be found here. ###
07.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in favor of the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard, bipartisan legislation to create a national standard for labeling of food containing biotechnology ingredients. “During my 99 county tour, I’ve had the opportunity to speak with many folks and industries across Iowa. It’s clear that our food manufacturers need standard guidance, and Iowans want safe and affordable food. This bipartisan legislation accomplishes both: it creates a national standard for biotechnology labeling, avoiding the confusing and costly patchwork of state laws that would threaten to raise food prices for the average household by over $1,000 a year. “Scientifically proven safe biotech products are grown and processed across Iowa, providing the base to over a quarter of our state’s economy. By establishing standards for consumers and manufacturers, we can avoid price increases and confusion so that Americans can have affordable access to food.” About the National Bioengineered Food Disclosure Standard: Immediate preemption of the Vermont labeling law, as well as all other state biotech labeling laws. Would implement mandatory labeling requirements within two years, with the options of text, symbol, or electronic links. Meat, poultry, and egg products would be exempted from the labeling requirements when they are the main ingredient. Additionally, it would prohibit any food product from an animal to be classified as a biotechnology ingredient solely because the animal may have eaten food with biotechnology ingredients. # # #
07.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) applauded the U.S. House of Representative’s passage of the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act today. The legislation reforms the system for providing former U.S. presidents certain benefits and perks. On June 21, 2016, H.R. 1777 passed the Senate after being modified to include provisions from Senator Ernst’s companion bill, S. 1411. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act now heads to the President’s desk. “With our nation drowning in $19 trillion in debt, we must tighten our belts and find ways to cut wasteful spending,” said Ernst. “The millions in expenditures and subsidies in presidential perks do not line up with the realities of post-presidential life. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act removes the unnecessary and outdated presidential perks and better reflects the spending needs of our time.” About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act (S. 1411) was introduced by Senators Joni Ernst, Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Marco Rubio (R-FL) on May 21, 2015. Legislation ‎passed the Senate on June 21, 2016. H.R. 1777, passed the House on July 8, 2016 and will now be sent to the President to be signed into law. According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president.‎ In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. # # #
07.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting to start Senate consideration of the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act and Kate’s Law. Senator Ernst also offered her newly introduced legislation, Sarah’s Law, as an amendment to these two bills, but the Senate failed to proceed to the underlying bills, and Sarah’s Law did not receive a vote. “Reports indicate there are around 300 cities, counties, and states that can currently be considered ‘sanctuary jurisdictions.’ In an effort to prevent more tragedies like the untimely deaths of Kate Steinle and Sarah Root, we must promote cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal immigration officials by ensuring that local law enforcement are protected from liability stemming from such cooperation. We must also do more to deter repeated illegal reentry into the United States – particularly by convicted felons. It is unacceptable for those who enter our country illegally, and repeatedly, to commit crimes and be released. “These bills work to keep law-abiding, U.S. citizens safe. They clear the way for state and local cooperation with the Department of Homeland Security and stiffen the penalty for illegal immigrants who re-enter the county after deportation. “While I am disappointed in the Senate’s failure to advance this commonsense legislation, I remain committed to seeking justice for the Steinle and Root families.” Information on the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act: The bill withholds certain federal funding from jurisdictions known as “sanctuary cities” that defy Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detainer requests or forbids the sharing of information with federal immigration officials. Addresses state and local government concerns about potential liability by providing that local officials who comply with detainers are deemed an agent of DHS in regard to any action necessary to comply with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) detainer. Accordingly, any lawsuit filed on the basis of an erroneous immigration detainer is brought against DHS and not state or local law enforcement. However, state and local law enforcement remains liable for any illegal action outside of compliance with an immigration detainer. The bill moreover preserves an individual’s right to sue for violations of their civil or constitutional rights. Does not affect a jurisdiction’s ability to have a policy providing that victims or witnesses of crimes will not be reported to federal immigration officials. Information on Kate’s Law: The bill increases the penalties for illegal reentry into the United States by: o Increasing the maximum criminal penalty for illegal reentry from two to five years. o Creating a new penalty of up to 10 years for any person who has been denied admission or deported three or more times and then illegally reenters the country. o Creating a five-year mandatory minimum for anyone convicted of illegal reentry, who (1) had an aggravated felony prior to removal, or (2) has been convicted of illegal reentry twice before. Information on Sarah’s Law: On June 29, 2016, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and Ben Sasse (R-NE), introduced Sarah’s Law, legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed earlier this year by a drunk driver in the country illegally. ICE thereafter declined to detain the individual. Sarah’s Law requires ICE to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and is charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. # # #
07.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, applauded the signing of their bill, the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act (S. 2487), into law. This bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Ernst, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) in the House, requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify the most effective programs and approaches in reducing suicide rates among female veterans. The President signed the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act on June 30th, 2016. “We lose 22 veterans to suicide each day and tragically, female veterans commit suicide at six times the rate of non-military females,” said Senator Ernst. “We must do more to help those who sacrificed so much for our freedoms. I am pleased that our legislation was signed into law, and thank my colleagues in the Senate and House for their hard work to make this initiative a reality.” “The alarming rate of suicide among female veterans demanded immediate action,” said Senator Boxer. “I am proud that President Obama has signed into law our bill to help ensure women veterans get the mental health care and support they need at the VA. These courageous women deserve nothing less.” "Improving access to quality mental health care programs and professionals is a critical part of supporting our veterans when they return home," said Senator Brown. "This new law will ensure that the VA assesses mental health programs to more effectively serve female veterans." “Now that it has been signed into law, our bipartisan bill will help literally save lives by ensuring VA is providing the care, counseling and outreach our women veterans need to combat the invisible wounds of war,” said Senator Blumenthal. “This measure will help address the staggering rate of suicide among female veterans by ensuring that VA’s mental health and suicide prevention programs meet the gender-specific needs of our nation's women veterans.” "I thank President Obama for signing this important bill, which will save women’s lives," said Congresswoman Brownley. "The new law will help us to better understand the factors that contribute to the alarmingly high suicide rates among women veterans so that we can design more effective suicide prevention programs.” Background on the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act: Introduced by Senators Ernst, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) on February 3, 2016 Passed the U.S. Senate on June 8, 2016 Passed the U.S. House of Representatives on June 21, 2016 Signed into Public Law on June 30, 2016 # # #
06.30.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), and Ben Sasse (R-NE), introduced Sarah’s Law, legislation to honor Sarah Root, an Iowan who was killed earlier this year by a drunk driver in the country illegally. Sarah’s Law would require U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take custody of an individual who is in the country illegally and is charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. On the night of her graduation, Sarah Root, a twenty-one year-old Iowan from Council Bluffs, was struck and killed in Omaha by Edwin Mejia, who entered the country illegally and was driving drunk – three times over the legal limit – and drag racing. Following state criminal charges of motor vehicle homicide and outreach by local law enforcement, ICE declined to use its discretion to issue a detainer requesting that local authorities hold the individual until it could take custody. Mejia subsequently posted bond and has since disappeared. Nearly five months later, Mejia still remains at-large. Sarah’s Law would amend the mandatory detention provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act to require the federal government to take custody of anyone who entered the country illegally, violated the terms of their immigration status, or had their visa revoked and is thereafter charged with a crime resulting in the death or serious bodily injury of another person. The legislation also requires ICE to make reasonable efforts to identify and provide relevant information to the crime victims or their families. “As a mother and a grandmother, I cannot fathom the anguish Sarah’s family is feeling knowing Edwin Mejia was released and remains at-large,” said Senator Ernst. “It is an outrage that our immigration system has become so convoluted that someone who came here illegally or overstayed their visa and is responsible for the death of an American citizen, is not considered an enforcement priority and is not detained. While nothing can relieve the Root family of their pain, we must honor Sarah and ensure that this injustice never happens again. Under this law, Mejia would have been detained by ICE and held accountable for his actions. Sarah’s Law brings us one step closer toward restoring justice.” “Sarah Root was a bright, talented, energetic young woman whose life was taken far too early. The devastation felt by her family and friends is unimaginable. Her opportunity to make a mark on the world was cut short in part because of the reckless enforcement priorities of the Obama administration. By refusing to take custody of illegal criminal immigrants who pose a clear threat to safety, this administration is putting Iowans at risk,” said Senator Grassley. “Criminals must be taken off the streets. It’s time for this administration to rethink its policies and start enforcing the law.” “Sarah Root and her family deserve justice for her tragic and untimely death,” said Senator Fischer. “Unfortunately, they may never see it because of ICE’s flawed policies. Edwin Mejia is an illegal immigrant who had previously been cited for multiple driving offenses. He should be in custody following the tragic crash that killed Sarah Root, but ICE failed to detain him and he escaped. This bill will mandate circumstances when ICE must detain illegal immigrants charged with serious crimes. It’s my hope that through this legislation we can help strengthen our laws and limit the chances of these tragedies from happening in the future.” “Since February, my office has held the administration’s feet to the fire to get answers for the Root family and the public,” said Senator Sasse. "While the Administration still refuses to answer basic questions about why ICE let Ms. Root’s killer go free, Congress can make it absolutely clear that federal law requires ICE to immediately detain any illegal alien who kills or seriously injures someone. As I’ve said before: Mr. Mejia shouldn’t be on ICE’s Most Wanted List, he should be behind bars.” “Our family would like to express our sincere gratitude to Senator Grassley, Senator Ernst, Senator Sasse, and Senator Fischer as well as their supporting staff for all of their efforts in introducing Sarah’s Law,” said the Root Family. “This law will not change the devastating outcome that our family and Sarah have endured, but it will help the next family avoid the pain of knowing that the person responsible for their loved one’s death remains at large. Requiring the mandatory detention of an illegal immigrant who commits motor vehicle homicide or causes serious bodily injury is necessary due to their increased flight risk. In addition, Sarah’s law will require ICE to provide victims’ families information about the custody status of the person who committed a crime against their loved one. Our family is thankful for all of the support from our community throughout this tragedy. Sarah’s Law will not only bring justice for Sarah, but to every American that is put in this unimaginable situation that our family has encountered.” Click here to read the text of the bill. Joint-Efforts by the Iowa and Nebraska Senators to Obtain Justice for Sarah Root: On March 25, 2016 the Iowa and Nebraska Senators demanded answers from ICE Assistant Secretary Sarah Saldana on why the agency did not detain Edwin Mejia after he killed Sarah Root in a drunk driving incident. On April 27, 2016 the Iowa and Nebraska Senators sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell demanding to know who was monitoring Edwin Mejia as he entered the country illegally as an unaccompanied minor. # # #
06.29.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued a statement in response to the Government Accountability Office’s (GAO) report on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Veterans Crisis Line (VCL). The VCL is available for veterans experiencing suicidal thoughts, or concerned friends and family, to connect with VA responders through a 24-hour hotline, online chat, or text. The GAO’s report found that the VA failed to meet its call response time goals and has not developed measurable targets and time frames for its performance indicators, such as the number of abandoned calls or ignored text messages. “The GAO’s report is incredibly concerning because the Veterans Crisis Line is no place for error,” said Ernst. “In February, I sent VA Secretary McDonald a letter expressing my outrage over the VA Inspector General’s report that 23 veterans who contacted the VCL were transferred to a voicemail system and were never called back. The GAO report released just this week stated that four out of 14 text messages went unanswered. We absolutely cannot tolerate these failures when lives are on the line. “While the VA might point to some improvements, the VCL still fails to meet response time goals and must be held accountable. I am calling on Secretary McDonald to inform the public as to how the VA is going to address these findings and implement the GAO’s recommendations. The VA must immediately correct these shortcomings outlined in the GAO report and performance standards. Our veterans deserve much, much better.” # # #
06.28.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the conference report on the Fiscal Year 2017 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon/VA) Appropriations Act and the Zika Prevention and Response Act: “I’m disappointed that my colleagues would stand in the way of passage of critical appropriations for Military Construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs, as well as emergency funding to combat the Zika virus. “As we honor and celebrate our nation’s independence, we are reminded of the promises made to our servicemembers and veterans who have sacrificed so much for our freedom. This legislation includes funding that works to provide quality care for our veterans through reforms to improve claims processing, support for veterans’ caregiver services, homeless veterans’ assistance, added whistleblower protections, and the construction of military hospitals and health facilities. “Additionally, it is imperative that we work to treat and prevent the spread of the Zika virus. This emergency provision will provide additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control, and incentivizes manufacturers to develop vaccines and treatments for the virus. The legislation will also boost mosquito control by removing layers of bureaucracy so our local communities can more efficiently and effectively tackle this problem. “Finally, this legislation includes necessary accountability measures to ensure fiscal responsibility and effective oversight of the taxpayer funds spent to address this important public health issue. I urge my Democratic colleagues to put politics aside and work with us to pass this these critical measures.” # # #
06.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement on the United Kingdom’s (UK) decision to leave the European Union (EU): “The people of the United Kingdom have spoken today and I respect their decision to leave the European Union. The UK is one of our oldest and most important allies, and our special relationship will not be impacted by this decision. It is critical that the Obama Administration – and the next – work to ensure there is no disruption in the close partnership we enjoy with the UK." ###
06.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard and member of the Senate committees on Armed Services, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, voted again today to keep weapons out of the hands of terrorists and called for immediate action to defeat and destroy ISIS. Senator Ernst supported the Johnson Amendment, which would prevent suspected terrorists from obtaining a gun for up to 23 business days, during which time the FBI is able to investigate the individual, confirm or rule out the identity and suspected nexus to terrorism of the individual, and file an emergency petition in court to prevent the gun transfer. If the court grants the petition, the individual is provided an opportunity to appeal. This process ensures that law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment and constitutional due process rights are appropriately protected. This is particularly important because of the widely reported flaws with the numerous terrorist watch lists – including the no-fly list – kept by the U.S. Government that may wrongfully implicate innocent American citizens. For example, a 2007 report by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that roughly 38% of records tested “continued to contain errors or inconsistencies that were not identified through the Terrorist Screening Center’s quality assurance efforts.” “We cannot sit back and watch repeated terrorist attacks here at home and around the globe,” said Senator Ernst. “The FBI Director has made clear that ISIS is present in all 50 states.” Ernst continued, “I have voted numerous times in support of measures that prohibit terrorists’ ability to obtain a gun. However, the multiple terrorist watch lists kept by the government are flawed, which is why we must also make certain that law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment and constitutional due process rights are protected. “Unfortunately, laws alone will not stop terrorists from pledging allegiance to radical Islamic groups and hurting Americans which is why we must act immediately to improve our efforts to counter violent extremism, defeat ISIS, and end the humanitarian crisis affecting the region and the world.” BACKGROUND: Senator Ernst Voted Numerous Times To Prevent Terrorists From Obtaining Weapons: S. Amdt. 2912 (December 3, 2015) S. Amdt. 4749 (June 20, 2016) S. Amdt. 4859 (June 23, 2016) The Washington Post "The list is itself almost necessarily a slippery slope.”: “The San Bernardino attack also demonstrated the risk of over-inclusion. At least one news outlet confused the male shooter -- Syed Rizwan Farook -- with his brother, Syed Raheel Farook. ‘They have the same name except for the middle name,’ Sparapani pointed out, meaning that including a ‘Syed Farook’ on the list might block either from flying. (The shooter's brother is a decorated Navy veteran.) There's also the challenge of converting Arabic names into English writing. Consider the former leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi. Or Qaddafi. Or Gadhafi. Do you put all three names on the list? Get the letters wrong, and some people will be banned who shouldn't be...The list is itself almost necessarily a slippery slope." “ISIS Present In All 50 States, FBI Director Says” (ABC7, February 25, 2015) Senator Ernst Voted For Senator Grassley’s Amendment To Improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System Without Unlawfully Infringing On Law-Abiding U.S. Citizen’s Second Amendment Rights: S. Amdt. 4751 (June 20, 2016) # # #
06.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL) applauded Senate passage of the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act, legislation to reform the system for providing former U.S. presidents certain benefits and perks. “At a time when we are more than $19 trillion in debt, taxpayers should not be forced to foot the bill for the perks of former presidents to the tune of millions of dollars,” said Senator Ernst. “We have got to cut spending, and subsidizing former president’s expenses—when they don’t even need it—is just downright wasteful. This bipartisan bill reforms and cuts many of the perks given to former presidents to better reflect the realities of today’s post-presidential life.” "Cutting wasteful spending is a key priority of mine to protect taxpayers and identifying outdated measures in our government should be a top priority for Congress,” said Senator Kirk. "I applaud the passage of this bipartisan bill to reform the allowance of former presidents by setting real restrictions to prevent further misuse of taxpayer funds.” "Times have changed, and it’s become clear that taxpayers no longer need to foot the entire bill for all the endeavors presidents undertake after leaving office,” said Senator Rubio. “We remain grateful for the service of our former presidents, but this reform that Joni Ernst has passed through the Senate makes all the sense in the world.” Senator Ernst introduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act last spring, and it passed with bipartisan support out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in February. Original co-sponsors of her bill included Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL). The House companion bill was introduced by Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD). About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president. In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. # # #
06.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran, today applauded passage of the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act (S. 2487) in the U.S. House of Representatives. This bipartisan legislation, introduced by Senators Ernst, Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Congresswoman Julia Brownley (D-CA) in the House, would require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify the most effective programs and approaches in reducing suicide rates among female veterans. The bill previously passed the Senate and now, following House passage, heads to the President’s desk. “Each day, we lose 22 veterans to suicide, and the suicide rate among our female veterans is higher than that of male veterans when compared to the general population,” said Senator Ernst. “One veteran’s life lost to suicide is too many, and we absolutely must do better for our veterans to ensure they have the quality and timely mental health care they need to transition back to civilian life. I am thankful to Representative Brownley for her work in the House, and encourage President Obama to quickly sign this important legislation into law.” "I'm so pleased this legislation is on its way to the President's desk because it will save lives among our nation's female veterans," said Congresswoman Brownley. "The Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act will lead to a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the alarmingly high suicide rates among women veterans so that we can design more effective suicide prevention programs.” “The current rate of suicide among women veterans is heartbreaking and unacceptable,” Senator Boxer said. “I am proud that the House and Senate have come together to pass this bipartisan bill to help ensure that female veterans get the mental health care and the support they need at the VA.” Click here to read more about the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act. # # #

06.20.2016	A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointments for health care or never received appointments; private sector hospitals and health systems have developed technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used The bipartisan bill would direct the Secretary of the VA to create a pilot program that will allow veterans to use available technology to self-schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities WASHINGTON, DC— U.S. Senators Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) have introduced a bipartisan bill that would establish a patient self-scheduling appointment system at Veterans Affairs Medical Facilities. A June 2014 internal audit by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) found that more than 120,000 veterans waited at least 90 days for appointment for health care or never received appointments. Private sector hospitals and health systems are now leveraging technology to eliminate wait times and ensure that every available appointment is used. The bipartisan Faster Care for Veterans Act would direct the Secretary of the VA to commence a pilot program under which veterans could use the internet to schedule and confirm appointments for health care at VA medical facilities. “Excessive wait times can put veterans’ lives at risk, but state-of-the art technology that makes it easier to schedule appointments already exists and is being used in the private sector,” said Klobuchar. “Our veterans have earned the right to use the same technology to schedule their medical appointments without unnecessary red tape and delays. This bipartisan bill would take an important step forward in ensuring that our brave men and women who have sacrificed so much have access to the medical care they need and deserve.” “Our veterans deserve timely and quality care,” said Senator Ernst. “This bill takes the needed steps to live up to that promise by implementing a long overdue pilot program to allow veterans to schedule and confirm their appointments at VA centers online. While we still have work to do to address long wait times at the VA, this legislation is an important step toward reforming and modernizing the VA appointment process to provide greater choice and faster service for our veterans.” Upon enactment of the Faster Care for Veterans Act, the VA would be required to commence an 18-month pilot program that would allow veterans to self-schedule, confirm, and modify outpatient and specialty care appointments in real time through the internet. This technology allows veterans to immediately schedule appointments canceled by other veterans and schedule appointments 24 hours per day, seven days per week.
06.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard and member of the Senate committees on Armed Services, and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, today voted to prevent terrorists from obtaining weapons, and renewed her call for more aggressive efforts to defeat and destroy ISIS. The Iowa Senator supported the Cornyn Amendment, which prevents suspected terrorists from obtaining a gun for up to three business days, during which time the FBI is able to investigate the individual, confirm or rule out the identity and suspected nexus to terrorism of the individual, and determine whether to file an emergency petition in court to prevent the gun transfer. This process ensures that law-abiding Americans’ Second Amendment and constitutional due process rights are protected. Unlike the Feinstein Amendment, the Cornyn Amendment includes due process protections – notice and an opportunity to be heard in a court of law – before the U.S. Government can deny an individual’s Second Amendment right. This is particularly important because of the widely reported flaws with the numerous terrorist watch lists – including the no-fly list – kept by the U.S. Government that may wrongfully implicate innocent American citizens. For example, a 2007 report by the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Inspector General (OIG) concluded that roughly 38% of records tested “continued to contain errors or inconsistencies that were not identified through the Terrorist Screening Center’s quality assurance efforts.” In addition, Senator Ernst supported the Grassley Amendment, which would improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) without unlawfully infringing on law-abiding U.S. citizen’s Second Amendment rights. Senator Ernst issued the following statement on today’s votes: “The horrific attack in Orlando made clear that we must work harder and do more to defeat terrorism here at home and around the globe. “The numerous terrorist watch lists kept by the U.S. Government, including the no-fly list, are flawed. That is why I support an effective solution to prevent terrorists from obtaining a gun without violating innocent Americans’ constitutional rights. In addition, I support Senator Grassley’s measure to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System without unlawfully infringing on law-abiding U.S. citizen’s Second Amendment rights. “However, that is not enough. Laws will not deter terrorists from pledging allegiance to radical Islamic groups and harming Americans. In response to this tragedy, we must renew our resolve to combat terrorism. “The FBI has said that ISIS is present in all 50 states, and we saw a tragic example of that in Florida. President Obama must develop a comprehensive strategy to completely defeat ISIS that includes contributions by all members of the U.S.-led coalition to full-spectrum military, diplomatic, and development operations. We must get serious about finding ways to improve our efforts to counter violent extremism, defeat ISIS, and end the humanitarian crisis affecting the region and the world. We simply cannot afford to sit back and wait for the next attack to take place.” BACKGROUND: The Washington Post last year noted that "The list is itself almost necessarily a slippery slope.”: “The San Bernardino attack also demonstrated the risk of over-inclusion. At least one news outlet confused the male shooter -- Syed Rizwan Farook -- with his brother, Syed Raheel Farook. ‘They have the same name except for the middle name,’ Sparapani pointed out, meaning that including a ‘Syed Farook’ on the list might block either from flying. (The shooter's brother is a decorated Navy veteran.) There's also the challenge of converting Arabic names into English writing. Consider the former leader of Libya, Muammar Gaddafi. Or Qaddafi. Or Gadhafi. Do you put all three names on the list? Get the letters wrong, and some people will be banned who shouldn't be...The list is itself almost necessarily a slippery slope." # # #

06.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which included several of her measures, and passed with bipartisan support. “This bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act ensures that our military has the resources and equipment they need to take on the numerous global threats our country faces, from combatting the spread of terrorism to protecting our nation from ballistic missile systems. This legislation also looks out for our servicemen and women returning from the battlefield by improving and expanding access to health care. “Importantly, this bill also takes concrete steps to change the culture surrounding sexual assault in the military. The NDAA includes my bipartisan work with Senator Claire McCaskill to prevent retaliation against military sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military, increasing transparency, enhancing training, and implementing best practices. Furthermore, it includes my provision to provide quality legal counsel to military sexual assault survivors by creating a career track for Judge Advocate General Corps (JAGs) to specialize in criminal justice to provide more effective legal counsel for servicemembers. “Additionally, the NDAA makes sweeping reforms to modernize the Department of Defense (DoD), including my provision to update DoD policies to provide transportation and ridesharing companies, like Uber and Lyft, access to military installations. The legislation also includes my measures to streamline operations and encourage greater efficiency through reforming program management standards to prevent cost overruns and lax oversight. “I am grateful to my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee for their work to put forward this legislation that ensures the continued success of our military and protection for our servicemembers. I am pleased it passed the Senate, and look forward to making sure we send the legislation to President Obama as quickly as possible.” Click here to watch Senator Ernst speak on the Senate floor about her amendments to the NDAA. Summary of Ernst Measures Included in the NDAA: Seeks to end retaliation against sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military.

Makes permanent the National Guard State Partnership Program which enhances our military and diplomatic efforts around the world. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the career progression track for female servicemembers. Improves federal government program and project management practices by requiring the development of government wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program management.

Requires the DoD to report on the progress of women in previously closed combat positions. Provides funds for much needed renovations at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Provides funds to the Army and Marine Corps to enhance the small arms and ammunition capabilities of our Soldiers and Marines. Requires the Army to reevaluate increases in overhead at military intelligence headquarters which seeks to eliminate unnecessary overhead, waste, and mismanagement, as well as to enhance intelligence support to our warfighters. Requires the Army to certify it was using certain military intelligence funds correctly in order to ensure the proper spending of Americans’ tax dollars. Urges the Army to enhance its military intelligence capabilities by keeping track of its intelligence professionals who have regional and academic expertise in certain geographical regions of the globe. Maintains suicide prevention programs in the Army Reserves and National Guard. Requires the DoD to report on its acquisition of sole source contracts which would enhance congressional oversight to ensure the DoD is getting the best value for taxpayer dollars. Requires the military service senior intelligence officers to have an active security clearance. Urges the DoD to enhance its military intelligence leadership by assigning general officers with military intelligence experience to serve as the military services senior intelligence officers. Authorizes the Navy to award historical World War II and Korea War era rifles to Marines and Sailors who win military marksmanship competitions. Ensures our military leaders set physical standards for servicemembers, instead of political appointees. # # #
06.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released the following statement on the terrorist attack in Orlando, Florida: “Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this horrific tragedy, and their loved ones who are suffering unimaginable loss. Let us also express our utmost gratitude to our first responders who put their lives on the line to save others. “This tragedy underscores that we must do more in our fight to defeat terrorism here at home and across the globe. We have already been told that ISIS is present in all 50 states. We simply cannot afford to sit on the sidelines as attacks on Americans, powered by Islamic terrorism, continue to take place. “Now is the time to stand united against this evil, and prevent future acts of terror from happening here at home.” # # #
06.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after President Obama signed into law the Iowa delegation’s legislation to name a Cedar Rapids post office after Sergeant First Class (SFC) Terryl L. Pasker, an Iowa National Guardsman who was killed in action in Afghanistan. The Iowa Congressional delegation, led by Senator Ernst in the Senate, and Representative Blum (R-IA) in the House, introduced this legislation in March. “Sergeant First Class Pasker made the ultimate sacrifice for our state and our country in defense of our freedoms,” said Senator Ernst. “While we can never thank him and his family enough for his service, I am proud that our community will be able to recognize his heroism with this tribute to him. I am grateful that the president signed this legislation into law, as well as to my Iowa colleagues – especially Congressman Blum – for their work to ensure Sergeant First Class Pasker and his family receives the recognition he deserves.” **Click to watch Senator Ernst speak on the importance of honoring SFC Pasker during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee business meeting last month.** About the Legislation to Rename a Cedar Rapids Post Office for SFC Pasker: This bill designates the facility of the United States Postal Services located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the “Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker Post Office Building”. SFC Terryl L. Pasker was born in Anamosa, Iowa, enlisted in the US Army in 1990, and joined the Iowa National Guard in 1995. While serving in the Guard, he deployed to Afghanistan from 2004, and again in 2011 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. SFC Pasker gave the ultimate sacrifice to his country when he was killed in a green-on-blue attack in Panjshir Province, Afghanistan on July 9, 2011, near the end of his tour. SFC Pasker was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He is survived by his wife, Erica; parents, Mary and David; brother, Andrew, and two sisters, Christine and Rebecca. Today’s bill signing follows its passage by the full Senate on May 26. It was introduced in the Senate by Senator Ernst, along with Senator Chuck Grassley, in March, and went on to pass unanimously through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee before it went to the Senate floor for full consideration. The Ernst-Grassley bill is the Senate version of Representative Rod Blum’s (R-01) bill, cosponsored alongside Iowa Representatives Dave Loebsack (D-02), David Young (R-03) and Steve King (R-04). # # #
06.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), an alum of the Iowa State University United States Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC), released the following statement after her resolution to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States Army ROTC passed the Senate unanimously last night. “For a century, the United States Army ROTC has played a critical role in training our young men and women to lead and protect our national security and way of life. The Army ROTC is now available at over 1,100 colleges and universities in all 50 states, and has become an essential program for the training of our next generation of leaders and defense of our nation. I am pleased my Senate colleagues have joined me in commemorating 100 years of the Army ROTC’s extraordinary service and achievements.” The Army ROTC program was established under the National Defense Act of 1916. Senator Ernst received her undergraduate degree from Iowa State University where she joined the university’s ROTC program. After graduating, Ernst was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserves, and after a few years in the Reserves, transferred to the Iowa National Guard. In 2003, she served as a company commander in Kuwait and Iraq, leading 150 Iowa Army National Guardsmen during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Senator Ernst retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard in November 2015 after more than 23 years of military service. # # #
06.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today took to the Senate floor to encourage her colleagues to support the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed out of the Senate Armed Services Committee with bipartisan support last month and is now being considered by the full Senate. Additionally, the Iowa Senator spoke about several of her amendments that are included in the bill, including provisions to improve program management and measures to combat sexual assault in the military. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s full remarks TRANSCRIPT: For more than 23 years, I had the great honor of serving in the Army Reserve and National Guard. It was during this time I was able to gain a first-hand experience of working alongside the unbelievable men and women in uniform whose character, honor, and love of our country has led them to sacrifice so selflessly for it. During my time in the military, I had the honor of serving a tour in Kuwait and Iraq. As a company commander during Operation Iraqi Freedom, what was so important to me—other than bringing everyone home—was ensuring my troops received what they needed, when they needed it. Unfortunately, given the nature of war and the learning curve our military had in its first large scale deployment since Operation Desert Shield/Storm, that did not always happen. However, as the war went on, our military adapted and our troops were able to receive the equipment they needed to do the job. Even though I am now retired from the military, I still have the privilege of serving our men and women in uniform, just in a different capacity, as a United States Senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee. It has been an honor to work with Chairman McCain, Ranking Member Reed, and the other distinguished members of the committee on another vital annual defense bill. Over the past year, my colleagues and I have worked to produce a bill which enhances the capabilities of our military to face current and future threats. This bill will impart much needed efficiencies in the Department of Defense which will result in saving American taxpayer dollars and allow the Department to provide greater support to our warfighters through eliminating unnecessary overhead, streamlining department functions, reducing unnecessary General officer billets, and modernizing the military health care system. Furthermore, we have found ways to enhance the capabilities of our warfighters, ensuring our troops have the training opportunities in order to be prepared to execute their assigned missions. This means more rotations to national training centers and more effective home station training for our troops who are being sent into harm’s way around the world. Our military leaders have stressed that readiness is their top priority. Adequately funding their requests for readiness keeps faith with our servicemembers and ensures our men and women in uniform have the best chance to come home to their loved ones. However, while we have adequately funded the Department's readiness needs, sequestration has led us to prioritize readiness over DoD modernization. I believe this is a risky proposition with respect to ensuring our servicemembers will have the advanced equipment, vehicles, ships, and aircraft to confront technologically advanced adversaries like Russia and China in a potential future conflict. Unfortunately, I believe many have taken our decades-long technological dominance for granted. If we continue to fail to adequately fund modernization, our servicemembers may pay the price for that decision with their lives, something none of us want. While I fully agree with the need to identify and reduce government spending and especially eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse in the DoD, we also must ensure funds are allocated in the proper areas so our troops have the resources they need so they are not outclassed by our adversaries who are currently modernizing their capabilities with aims to defeat our country in a potential conflict. Due to sequestration and the Bipartisan Budget Act, this bill is short of what our troops need to defend our country this year, and in upcoming future years. I believe it is important to keep that in mind while we consider this bill. I was sorely disappointed that the Senate did not come together in a bipartisan fashion and stop shortchanging our troops and their families through the arbitrary caps set through sequestration. That was a missed opportunity. The threats the nation and our troops face are too great for partisan bickering, shortsightedness, and the abdication of one of our core responsibilities which is to provide for our military. I’d also like to talk about just a few of the provisions included in the NDAA which I crafted. During the process, I was able to author nearly two dozen provisions ranging from improving the professionalism of our military judge advocates and military intelligence professionals, to making retaliation against sexual assault victims its own crime, to enhancing DoD program management. As I’ve stated repeatedly, one area of focus for me is working to prevent sexual assault in the military. And while we have seen progress, there are still steps that must be taken to improve the system and the overall culture. One of my provisions would help enhance the military prosecutors and JAGs, to better ensure victims of sexual assault and other crimes can know their case is in good, well-trained and experienced hands. Also included in this bill is a provision I authored with Senator McCaskill which combats retaliation within our military. We cannot allow any retaliation against survivors who come forward seeking justice, and this provision will work to curb the culture of retaliation in our ranks. Other provisions I pushed included in the Committee report seek to bring greater military intelligence support to our warfighters by ending growth in headquarters elements and pushing that support from those headquarters elements down to those military intelligence units providing direct support to our warfighters. Not only do these report language provisions seek to enhance support to our men and women defending our nation on those front lines, but would also create safeguards which will help ensure your taxpayer dollars are being spent properly within the DoD. This bill also includes my Program Management Improvement Accountability Act, which is a bipartisan piece of legislation that solves problems with program and project management that have plagued the federal government for decades, especially in the Department of Defense. We have read about these failures in the media, IG reports and the GAO High Risk List. Many projects are grossly over budget, delayed, or do not meet previously stated goals. Ultimately, by strengthening its program management policies, the DoD and other federal agencies will better account for and utilize taxpayer dollars. It will also improve its ability to complete projects on time and on budget which leads to getting our troops the advanced equipment and weapons they need as soon as possible. In closing Mr. President, I want to again thank my colleagues for their work on this bill, but most of all—I want our men and women in uniform to know that we stand with them in their defense of this great country and all that it stands for. And with that Mr. President, I yield the floor. # # #
06.08.2016	WASHINGTON, DC – U.S. Senators Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Cory Gardner (R-CO) returned this week from a congressional delegation trip to South Korea, Burma, Singapore, Taiwan and Japan focused on critical issues underpinning U.S. relations in the region, including strengthening our security ties, growing trade opportunities to bolster American exports, and promoting homegrown American energy. To view photos from the trip, click here. “Our visit reinforced that America has a wealth of allies, especially in Asia, and this wealth is a comparative advantage over our adversaries,” said Senator Dan Sullivan. “However, America’s allies in this region face some of the most serious geopolitical challenges in a generation – from the escalating threats made by the rogue and unstable North Korean regime, to an aggressive military build-up by the Chinese amid the busy shipping lanes of the South China Sea. Now is the time to hold faith with our friends, whose stability and strength hold the key to peace in this region where more than 30 percent of the world’s people reside.” "As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I all too often hear from world leaders about the lack of leadership coming from the White House. Throughout the week, we heard time and again from countries who felt that this administration has let them down," said Senator Joni Ernst. “Many of these countries are critical partners, not only for our strategic national defense interests, but also for our economic growth as we work to develop new trade avenues for American goods and services. Our focus throughout the trip was to reaffirm Congress' commitment to these nations. I look forward to continuing to work to strengthen our partnership for years to come.” “I appreciated the opportunity to meet with top government officials and military commanders to discuss economic and security challenges in the Pacific region and the role of the United States in addressing them,” said Senator Cory Gardner. “In South Korea, military experts and government leaders echoed many of my grave concerns regarding North Korea’s recent ballistic missile tests and continued aggression. South Korean leaders were encouraged by the implementation of my North Korea Sanctions legislation, but urged additional pressure on the regime. I reiterated my commitment to working to ensure the Obama Administration fully implements the sanctions outlined in my legislation, including sanctions against human rights violators and individuals responsible for malicious cyber-attacks. As Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on East Asia, the Pacific, and International Cyber Security Policy, I look forward to continuing to work with our allies in the region to address the challenges impacting the Pacific and the U.S. relationship.” REPUBLIC OF KOREA: While in Korea, the delegation met with General Brooks, commander of U.S. Forces - Korea about the security situation on the peninsula, visited the Demilitarized Zone – the border between South and North Korea – and also met with a recent high-level North Korean defector. BURMA: In Burma, the delegation visited the capital city of Naypyidaw and met with senior level government officials as well as Nobel Peace prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi and discussed the ongoing transition to democracy. SINGAPORE: In Singapore, the congressional delegation joined Armed Services Committee Chairman Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and several other U.S. senators in attending the Shangri La Dialogue (SLD) – an annual regional security forum that brings together defense ministers from over 20 Asia-Pacific countries to discuss on-going security issues in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. At the SLD, the U.S. delegation met with the ministers of defense for Japan and Korea, and encouraged improving trilateral cooperation between our three countries to more effectively respond to contingencies in the Pacific and on the Korean peninsula. TAIWAN: In Taiwan, the delegation met with the newly elected President, Ms. Tsai Ing-wen. JAPAN: On their return trip to the United States, the delegation briefly visited Japan and met with U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy. ‎ ###
06.08.2016	Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today praised the Senate's unanimous passage of the Female Veteran Suicide Prevention Act. The bill requires the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to include specific metrics on female veterans in its annual evaluation of mental health and suicide prevention programs and requires them to identify which programs are the most effective and have the highest satisfaction rates among female veterans. In a recent VA study, researchers tracked over 174,000 veteran and nonveteran suicides from 2000 to 2010 and found that the rate of suicide among female veterans increased 40 percent during that time period. The data also revealed that women veterans-who now account for ten percent of the veteran population-commit suicide at nearly six times the rate of civilian women. The risk doubles for young female veterans between 18-29 years old. "The current rate of suicide among women veterans is heartbreaking and unacceptable," Senator Boxer said. "I am proud that the Senate has unanimously passed this bill to help ensure that female veterans get the mental health care and support they need at the VA. The women who courageously served our country deserve nothing less." "I'm grateful that the Senate has acted and taken the important steps to pass this bipartisan legislation, which will require the VA to identify the most effective mental health and suicide prevention programs for our female veterans," said Senator Ernst. "We lose 22 veterans to suicide every day, and suicide among female veterans is higher than that of male veterans when compared to the general population. We can and must do better for our men and women alike. Our servicemembers have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms. We absolutely must ensure that our veterans are prepared to transition back to civilian life, and that includes access to the quality and timely mental health care they deserve." "Senate passage of this bipartisan measure builds on the progress made by legislation I was proud to help lead, the Clay Hunt SAV Act. It is critical to ensuring the VA's mental health and suicide prevention programs meet the gender-specific needs of our nation's women veterans," Senator Blumenthal said. "With suicide among women veterans occurring at an alarming rate, this bill will help literally save lives by ensuring VA is providing the care, counseling and outreach these veterans need‎." "Improving access to quality mental health care programs and professionals is a critical part of supporting our veterans when they return home," said Senator Brown. "This bill will ensure that the VA assesses mental health programs to more effectively serve female veterans." There are more than two million women veterans in the United States, making them the fastest growing subpopulation of veterans treated by the VA. While the VA has made strides to improve and expand mental health and suicide prevention programs aimed at women, there is no gender-specific data available on the efficacy of these programs. Similar legislation authored by Congresswoman Julia Brownley (CA-26) passed the House on February 9, 2016. The Senate bill will now head to the House for final passage. ###

06.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today questioned Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator, Hon. Peter V. Neffenger, in a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing regarding wasteful spending at TSA and the impact on the agency’s ability to address long security lines while at the same time keeping our nation safe. Following reports exposing the TSA’s expenditure of tens of thousands of dollars on a mobile application called the “randomizer” that simply shows an arrow on the screen of an iPad telling passengers to go to a right or left security line, the Iowa Senator highlighted this irresponsible use of taxpayer dollars in April with her monthly Squeal Award to highlight government waste. Senator Ernst continued to demand accountability from the agency at today’s hearing, stating: “This is the epitome of wasteful Washington spending and what we would like to hear is how you will assure us and the American people that TSA will take those taxpayer dollars and be responsible stewards of those dollars.” In response, she received a commitment from Administrator Neffenger to improve TSA’s acquisition process going forward to ensure the agency is using its resources properly to keep passengers travelling safely and efficiently.

Senator Ernst retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard in November 2015 after more than 23 years of military service. # # #
06.03.2016	WASHINGTON – Led by Sen. Chuck Grassley, all six members of the Iowa congressional delegation today expressed alarm to the Labor Department over a regulation that could limit a retirement income tool that is popular with American families. The Administration’s new fiduciary regulation subjects fixed indexed annuities to a level of stricter regulation than other forms of fixed annuities without explaining the basis for the change, raising the prospect that some financial agents might stop offering fixed indexed annuities altogether. “This is concerning to us because annuities play an important role for many Americans in ensuring a secure retirement,” Sen. Grassley, Sen. Joni Ernst and Reps. David Young, Dave Loebsack, Rod Blum and Steve King wrote to Labor Secretary Thomas Perez. “Annuities are often attractive for this purpose due to their unique ability to provide a guaranteed income stream that cannot be outlived. To ensure that annuities remain a viable option, it is important to maintain a strong, robust, and competitive market for all annuity products. … We urge DOL to work with the fixed indexed annuity providers to fashion … a workable solution that will protect the best interest of consumers while preserving the distribution network for these annuities.” The delegation members said the Labor Department not only disregarded their previous recommendations on how to handle fixed indexed annuities in the regulation, but also went in the opposite direction to restrict them. “This complete one hundred and eighty degree turn on the treatment of fixed indexed annuities in the final regulations raises questions as to whether the comment period garnered sufficient input on this subject for DOL to make an informed decision,” the delegation members wrote. In addition, it is unclear on what legal basis the Labor Department determined it was proper to distinguish between types of fixed annuities, the letter states. “In fact, Congress affirmatively weighed in on this issue during the 2010 financial reform bill with the adoption of an amendment that effectively rebuffed a similar effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to single out fixed indexed annuities from other fixed annuities,” the letter says. Last year, American families bought more than $53 billion of fixed indexed annuities. More than a third of those annuities were bought from Iowa-based insurers.

05.28.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the Weekly Republican Address, Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), delivers a Memorial Day tribute honoring our nation’s fallen heroes, servicemembers, and veterans, including the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) from World War II. Sen. Ernst, the Senate’s first female combat veteran and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, discusses her efforts to recognize the service and sacrifice of the historic WASP women, “Unfortunately, these pioneers of aviation have long struggled to gain the recognition and honor they earned. With this in mind, I helped introduce bipartisan legislation along with Senator Barbara Mikulski and Congresswomen Martha McSally and Susan Davis to ensure the WASP ashes could be inurned at Arlington National Cemetery…This Congress passed this legislation honoring these historic women and it is now law.” Sen. Ernst says, “Now, this Congress is getting to work on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This legislation includes measures to make sure our men and women have access to the top equipment and training they need on the battlefield. The NDAA includes many critical provisions to help keep our military members safe so they do return home to their families.” **Click here or on the image below to watch. ** The audio of the address is available here.** TRANSCRIPT “Hi, I’m Joni Ernst and I have the honor of serving the great state of Iowa in the United States Senate. “It’s a long way from Red Oak, Iowa to Washington, D.C., but often I think back to even more distant places I’ve traveled to like Kuwait and Iraq, where I served as a company commander, leading 150 Iowa Army National Guardsmen during Operation Iraqi Freedom 13 years ago. I also often think of the nearly 4,500 Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice to our nation during the Iraq War. “I have been so fortunate that my 23 years of service in the military has introduced me to some of the most patriotic and selfless Americans who woke up each day willing to put their lives on the line in defense of our freedom. “Unfortunately, all too often folks hear in the media talking about a divided America. But this Memorial Day, I implore you to push past the 30 second sound bites and instead join me in honoring those who have given the ultimate sacrifice for our nation since its founding in 1776. “While Memorial Day is a day to honor our fallen heroes, I would also like to say a few words about our veterans whose sacrifices must never be forgotten. “From those who responded after the shocking attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, to those sent around the globe after the tragic events of September 11th 2001, we honor them. “This Congress recognizes the service and sacrifice that veterans like the Women Airforce Service Pilots, also known as WASP, made during the 1940s. “You see, during World War II, these bold, revolutionary women flew non-combat service missions for the Army Airforce to free up their male counterparts for combat duty overseas. “The WASP willingly put their lives on the line for this country during a time of war. This work wasn’t easy and in fact, 38 WASP died in service to our great nation, such as Beverly Moses, who was born in Des Moines; and Gleanna Roberts who grew up near Iowa City. “These women served our nation with great honor – and put their lives on the line. “You and I know that their sacrifice and love for this nation deserves to be celebrated, and always remembered. Unfortunately, these pioneers of aviation have long struggled to gain the recognition and honor they earned. “With this in mind, I helped introduce bipartisan legislation along with Senator Barbara Mikulski and Congresswomen Martha McSally and Susan Davis to ensure the WASP ashes could be inurned at Arlington National Cemetery. A seemingly simple thing, that means so much. “This Congress passed this legislation honoring these historic women and it is now law. “Now, this Congress is getting to work on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This legislation includes measures to make sure our men and women have access to the top equipment and training they need on the battlefield. The NDAA includes many critical provisions to help keep our military members safe so they do return home to their families. “We’ve already gotten to work on the NDAA, and later this summer, the Senate will consider the Defense Appropriations Act. These measures will provide some level of certainty to our brave service members now serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and in other places around the world. “As Memorial Day approaches, let us pause and remember all of the men and women who have given their lives so we can be free. “Let’s pause and honor the families of the fallen who have also given so much. “On Memorial Day—and every day—let us give thanks for these outstanding heroes. They serve as a testimony to the character of America. “May God always bless you, our servicemen and women who have given the ultimate sacrifice, the great state of Iowa, and these wonderful United States of America.” ###
05.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee yesterday passed two measures introduced by U.S. Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) to strengthen security against foreign fighters traveling into and out of the United States. One amendment, which is based on the Foreign Fighter Review Act that passed the House of Representatives with unanimous support in February, would require the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a review of foreign fighters who have traveled or attempted to travel to a conflict zone in Iraq or Syria from the U.S to join or provide material support or resources to a terrorist organization. The other amendment, which is based on the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel Act that also passed the House of Representatives with unanimous support in February, would require the administration to develop and submit to Congress a national strategy to combat terrorist travel. “As we work to combat threats from around the world, the federal government should do everything possible to prevent foreign fighters and terrorists from traveling to train and fight with Islamist terrorists and potentially to Europe or the United States to carry out attacks,” said Senator Ayotte. “I’m pleased that we were able to pass these amendments by a bipartisan, unanimous vote that will improve our capabilities to ensure that foreign fighters and terrorists cannot exploit identified security vulnerabilities.” “The world is an increasingly dangerous place, and we must remain vigilant in defending our citizens from ISIS-led or inspired terrorist attacks,” said Senator Ernst. “These amendments, which received bipartisan support, work to ensure that the U.S. has a clear system in place to both monitor and combat foreign fighter and terrorist travel.” ###
05.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Congressman Rod Blum (R-01) today released the following statements after legislation to rename a Cedar Rapids post office after Sergeant First Class (SFC) Terryl L. Pasker, an Iowa National Guardsman who was killed in Afghanistan, passed the Senate. “Sergeant First Class Pasker dedicated his life in service to our great state and country, and was killed in the line of duty defending our freedoms,” said Senator Ernst. “As Memorial Day approaches, I am so pleased that we are able to express our gratitude to him and his family for the sacrifices they made, and honor his heroism. I am thankful for my colleagues’ support on this measure, and encourage the President to swiftly sign it into law.” “Sergeant First Class Pasker served our country and lost his life on our behalf,” said Senator Grassley. “In turn, we should honor his service in every possible way, including the recognition of a community fixture named for him. It’s especially fitting to pass this bill just before Memorial Day.” “I introduced this legislation to honor the sacrifice of Sgt. 1st Class Pasker and all those who have served our country in the armed forces, and I am glad to see it pass the Senate today,” said Congressman Blum. “I am grateful to Senator Ernst and the entire Iowa delegation for their support of this measure and I urge President Obama to sign this bill into law as soon as possible. Enacting this legislation will be a lasting tribute to the life and sacrifice of Sgt. Pasker, and will serve as a permanent reminder of the courage and dedication shown by the members of our military and their families.” **Click to watch Senator Ernst speak on the importance of honoring SFC Pasker during yesterday’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee business meeting.** About the Legislation to Rename a Cedar Rapids Post Office for SFC Pasker: This bill would designate the facility of the United States Postal Services located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the “Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker Post Office Building”. SFC Terryl L. Pasker was born in Anamosa, Iowa, enlisted in the US Army in 1990, and joined the Iowa National Guard in 1995. While serving in the Guard, he deployed to Afghanistan from 2004, and again in 2011 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. SFC Pasker gave the ultimate sacrifice to his country when he was killed in a green-on-blue attack in Panjshir Province, Afghanistan on July 9, 2011, near the end of his tour. SFC Pasker was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He is survived by his wife, Erica; parents, Mary and David; brother, Andrew, and two sisters, Christine and Rebecca. Today’s passage of H.R.4605 by the full Senate follows introduction of the companion bill by Senator Ernst, along with Senator Chuck Grassley, in March, and its unanimous passage through the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee yesterday. The Ernst-Grassley bill is the Senate version of Representative Rod Blum’s (R-01) bill, cosponsored alongside Iowa Representatives Dave Loebsack (D-02), David Young (R-03) and Steve King (R-04). ###
05.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, two of U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) measures passed the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee: The House companion legislation to rename a Cedar Rapids post office after Sergeant First Class (SFC) Terryl L. Pasker, an Iowa National Guardsman who was killed in Afghanistan, and the Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act of 2016. Both bills passed the committee with bipartisan support and head to the full Senate for consideration. “I am grateful for the bipartisan support to rename a Cedar Rapids post office in honor of Sergeant First Class Terryl Pasker. On July 9, 2011, SFC Pasker gave the ultimate sacrifice to his country in defense of our freedoms, and this is one way we can recognize his heroism and service to our country. “Additionally, in light of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach, which impacted a number of Iowans, I am pleased we are able to advance in a bipartisan manner the Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act which aims to help reduce the risk of another breach and protect the personal information of American citizens. This bill ensures that federal government agency heads have the tools they need to secure their IT networks through restricting access to certain websites on government computers without first having to engage in collective bargaining with federal employee unions. Our cybersecurity cannot be up for negotiation, and our agencies must have the ability to act quickly to respond to threats and vulnerabilities in their IT systems.” **Click to watch Senator Ernst speak on the importance of these measures during today’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee business meeting.** About the Legislation to Rename a Cedar Rapids Post Office for SFC Pasker: This bill would designate the facility of the United States Postal Services located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the “Sergeant First Class Terryl L.

About the Federal Information Systems Safeguards Act of 2016: Following a 2014 Federal Labor Relations Authority decision effectively establishing that federal agency heads have to negotiate with federal employee unions before restricting access to certain websites on government computers for cybersecurity reasons, this bill would make clear that agency heads do not have to engage in collective bargaining before taking steps to secure their IT networks. As OPM Acting Director Beth Cobert has stated before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, webmail services like Gmail is “the way a lot of threats come in” to government networks. According to a recent OMB report, federal agencies reported more than 77,000 cyberattacks on government networks during Fiscal Year (FY) 2015, a 10 percent increase from FY 2014.

05.25.2016	U.S. SENATE — U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-MT), Mark Warner (D-VA), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) Joni Ernst (R-IA) Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) today introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that directs the president to elevate Cyber Command to a Combatant Command. U.S. Cyber Command is currently a subordinate unit to Strategic Command. Congress established US Special Operations Command to address a rapidly growing need, strengthen the warfighter, and to unify forces. Today, with cyber threats being one of the fastest growing national security threats we face, the need for another Combatant Command is no different. The amendment will elevate the command so it can respond to one of the fastest growing threats facing our nation and ensures that Cyber Command is a national commitment receiving sufficient support to complete the ever expanding cyber missions our warfighters face. “As ISIS is recruiting more and more followers online, CYBERCOM needs the ability to react quickly and engage the enemy effectively,” Daines stated. “Elevating Cyber Command will ensure that our military is always one step ahead of our adversaries in light of the increased global threats today.” “We should give our military the tools they need to do battle in the 21st century, whether it takes place on the field or in cyberspace,” Warner stated. “I agree with Adm. Rogers that elevating CYBERCOM to a Combatant Command will improve mission outcomes, and allow us to respond more nimbly to defend against 21st century threats.” “We live in a digital world where the online battlefield can be as dangerous as the front lines. We need to make sure our military is always ready and able to fend off continuing and relentless attacks from terrorist organizations, foreign governments, criminals and others who wish to steal, corrupt, or manipulate our critical digital and traditional infrastructure,” said Senator Ben Cardin, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Elevating the U.S. Cyber Command is an essential step toward protecting our national security. It also recognizes the stellar work being done at Fort Meade protecting American citizens and our military around the globe.” “America is fighting a cyber war every hour of every day. Maryland is our nation’s epicenter of cyber security,” Mikulski stated. “Ft. Meade already is home to the U.S. Cyber Command, NSA, the U.S. Navy’s 10th Fleet and the Defense Information Systems Agency. Elevating CYBERCOM to a Combatant Command will give those charged with the defense of our nation more of the tools they need to protect .mil. It also means more cyber jobs at Fort Meade making the nation safer and Maryland’s economy stronger.” “In the 21st century, with the stroke of a key, our adversaries can have the types of strategic impacts which in the past could only be made through large scale military operations,” Ernst stated. “It’s time we recognize the significant role cyber plays in current and future conflicts, as well as the unique capabilities of our cyber warriors who defend our nation in this new dimension of warfare. Our efforts to create a Cyber Combatant Command does just that.” “Cyber attacks are an ever-growing threat to our national security,” Blumenthal stated. “As the internet touches more aspects of our work and daily lives, our military must be equipped to defend and protect our nation. Elevating CYBERCOM to a Combatant Command will enhance its ability to protect Americans from cyber threats.” “At a time when cyber threats are evolving and increasing, we must ensure that our military remains vigilant and agile in cyberspace,” Bennet said. “This amendment recognizes the serious and growing threat of cyber war and takes important steps to boost our cyber defense and give our warfighters the resources and capabilities they need to fight. Elevating CYBERCOM sends a clear message that we will be ready to fight any and all cyber attacks.” The amendment is similar in the House NDAA and requires the President, with the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, through the Secretary of Defense, to establish a unified combatant command for cyber operations forces responsible for assigned cyber missions. The full text is available below: ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIFIED COMBATANT COMMAND FOR CYBER OPERATIONS. (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF CYBER COMMAND Chapter 6 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new section: ESTABLISHMENT.—With the advice and assistance of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the President, through the Secretary of Defense, shall establish under section 161 of this title a unified combatant command for cyber operations forces. The principal function of the command is to prepare cyber operations forces to carry out assigned missions. ###
05.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate, released the following statement calling for the resignation of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert McDonald: “Secretary McDonald’s dishonorable remarks yesterday make clear that he fails to take seriously the need for timely and quality care for our veterans. He blatantly dismissed the heart ache and pain that our veterans face while awaiting basic care, and illustrated his compete disregard for the incredibly serious issues facing the VA. “It’s no secret that there is deep corruption within the VA system, leading to more failure and abuse. Secretary McDonald is at the helm, and instead of taking charge to clear out bad actors, he has stood idly by. Any government agency or organization takes on the attitude of their leadership, and Secretary McDonald has been too willing to look the other way. We simply cannot allow the misconduct and poor care to continue without repercussions. That’s why today, I am calling for Secretary McDonald’s resignation immediately. “As I have stated, too many veterans have died while waiting to receive assistance from the VA, yet the very person our men and women are counting on, the person who is tasked with fixing the serious wait times, is making fun of the problem. “Our veterans deserve better than a completely incompetent VA. Our men and women have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms and deserve nothing less than timely and quality care.” Click here to read Senator Ernst’s statement on Secretary McDonald’s comparison to veterans’ wait times at the VA to lines at Disneyland. ###
05.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of H.J.Res.88, a measure to disapprove of and eliminate the Department of Labor’s fiduciary rule. “It’s important that folks have access to financial advisors, particularly when it comes to planning for retirement. However, the Department of Labor’s costly, 1,000 page fiduciary rule makes it more difficult for families to do just that by imposing more mandates that will ultimately prevent Iowans from accessing the financial advisor of their choice. “At an estimated cost of more than $31 billion, the most expensive regulation thus far in 2016, the fiduciary rule is yet another example of the federal government’s top-down, Washington-centered overreach harming hardworking, middle-class Americans, and must be stopped.” Senator Ernst is an original cosponsor of S.J.Res.33, the Senate companion legislation to H.J.Res.88. ###
05.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), the first female combat to serve in the U.S. Senate, issued the following statement after Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald compared veterans’ wait times at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to lines at Disneyland: “Waiting to be seen at the VA for something as serious as life threatening illnesses simply cannot be compared to waiting in line to visit the Magic Kingdom. I’m absolutely appalled by Secretary McDonalds’ callous and completely out of touch comparison of the long VA wait times to lines at Disneyland. “In November 2014 testimony before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, the VA’s chief consultant for mental health said, the average wait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days. More recently, we have heard that wait times have increased further. This is entirely unacceptable. Too many veterans have died while waiting to receive assistance from the VA, yet the Secretary himself appears to be living in Fantasyland. He is clearly completely oblivious to the pain and suffering our veterans are going through, made worse by to the VA’s complete incompetence. Our veterans deserve better. “These men and women have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms, and our way of life. They deserve nothing less than timely and quality care we can all be proud of.” ###
05.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today took to the Senate floor to speak about her legislation to restore the inurnment rights of Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) at Arlington National Cemetery, which was signed into law by President Obama last Friday. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, I am pleased to report that last week, bipartisan legislation to restore the rights of the Women Airforce Service Pilots—or WASP— to have their ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery was signed into law. I was proud to have led the Senate’s effort with Senator Mikulski to honor this group of revolutionary women who courageously served our country. I thank Congresswomen Martha McSally and Susan Davis for their leadership spearheading this bill in the House. On the heels of Pearl Harbor, these trailblazing women bucked the status quo and made tremendous sacrifices for this nation. They joined ground-breaking flight training programs for women, flying non-combat service missions for the Army Airforce to free their male counterparts for combat duty overseas. The WASP willingly put their lives on the line for this country during a time of war. This work wasn’t easy and certainly contained peril. In fact, 38 WASP died in service to our great country during WWII. Their sacrifice and love for this nation deserves to be celebrated, and always remembered. Iowa was, at one time or another, home to at least 25 courageous WASP.‎ While they were eventually granted veteran status in 1977, it was not until 2002 that the Army allowed these women to have their ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. In 2015, that honor was inexplicably and wrongly revoked by the Army. With less than a hundred WASP still living, time was short to do what was right and honor these women for their selfless sacrifice and service to our nation. They were role models for women in the military like me and proved their strength and fortitude in the missions they carried out. I want to take this time to honor these extraordinary women, and thank them for their remarkable military service. As Memorial Day approaches, I am grateful that we can restore a basic honor to them and their families through this law. Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor. ###
05.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the bipartisan Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act: “I am grateful to Senator Grassley for his leadership and work on this important, bipartisan legislation which reauthorizes federal programs to improve the tracking of sex offenders and introduces new rights for victims of sexual assault. “Under the Adam Walsh Reauthorization Act, state, local, and tribal governments will continue to receive federal support in their efforts to implement and improve sex offender registries, promote a heightened awareness of these criminals, and ultimately ensure greater public safety. “In addition, this legislation provides added rights and protections to victims of sexual assault. The bill creates a joint working group to collaborate on best practices for treating survivors of sexual assault, and it also extends the statute of limitations for child survivors to file civil lawsuits against perpetrators. “We absolutely must do all we can to both protect the survivors of sexual assault and try to prevent such heinous crimes from happening in the first place.” ###
05.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In an overdue victory for the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP), President Obama today signed bipartisan, bicameral legislation into law to restore the inurnment rights of the WASP at Arlington National Cemetery. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), and Congresswomen Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Susan Davis (D-CA) offered this legislation to return the right to these heroic women. “Today is a victorious occasion for a revolutionary group of women who deserve to be celebrated and remembered by all. The Woman Airforce Service Pilots were early pioneers in military aviation. They willingly put their lives on the line in service to our great country, and made tremendous sacrifices to join a ground-breaking flight program to free up their male counterparts for combat duty, during World War II. “Restoring what was once the right of the WASP to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery is undoubtedly the right thing to do in honoring these extraordinary women for their remarkable military service. “The WASP stand in history as role models for women in the military, proving their strength and fortitude in the missions they carried out. I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Mikulski and Congresswomen McSally and Davis to honor the legacy of these truly remarkable female trailblazers within our military.” Iowa was at one time or another, home to at least 25 courageous WASPs.‎ While the WASP were eventually granted veteran status in 1977 “for the purposes of all laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration,” it was not until 2002 that the Army allowed these women to have their ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. In 2015, that honor was revoked by the Army. The family of Elaine Harmon, a WASP who passed away one year ago, has been working tirelessly to reverse the Army’s decision. Ernst Efforts to Restore WASP Inurnment Rights: In January, Senator Ernst helped introduce bipartisan legislation with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to restore the inurnment rights. A recent policy change made by the Army now prevents WASP, who flew domestic military missions during World War II, from being inurned at Arlington. In March, Senator Ernst led a bipartisan, bicameral press conference with Representative McSally (R-AZ) to call on the Army to reinstate the WASP at Arlington. As the Iowa Senator noted, “Iowa was at one time or another, home to at least 25 courageous WASPs.” Following the press conference, Senator Ernst pressed Defense Secretary Ash Carter on this issue, noting “…it is a travesty that these women, who are pioneers in military aviation, had the honor of having their ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery revoked last year, during the same year that historically you opened up positions that had been previously closed in combat to women.” In late March, Senator Ernst applauded passage of U.S. Representative Martha McSally’s (R-AZ) legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to reinstate the Women Airforce Service Pilots’ (WASP) right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors. In May, the legislation championed by Senators Joni Ernst and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to reinstate inurnment rights for Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) at Arlington National Cemetery, passed the Senate unanimously. # # #
05.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Senator Joni Ernst released the following statement, after voting in support of the combined Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act and the Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act: “It is imperative that our country lives up to the promises made to our veterans and to ensure they receive a quality of care that we can all be proud of. This bill includes funding for veterans reform priorities, including construction of military hospitals and health facilities, improvements to benefit claims processing, added whistleblower protections, support for veterans’ caregiver services, homeless veterans’ assistance, and medical and prosthetic research. I’m especially pleased with the accountability measures provided to ensure taxpayer money is spent wisely. “Building on my efforts to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs, I offered an amendment to withhold all bonuses directed to executives of the benefits administration, and redirect those funds toward reducing the veterans’ disability appeals claims backlog. While I’m disappointed my amendment was not adopted, it underscores my commitment to put the focus back on our veterans and improve the care they deserve. “In addition, I’m pleased this funding proposal includes improvements for our transportation, urban development and housing needs – including added support for Iowa’s roadways. “I take seriously the responsibility Iowans have entrusted in me to make our government more competent and less wasteful. This funding proposal makes concerted efforts to prioritize what is needed and move away from hasty spending decisions.” Ernst Amendments Offered to Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act Section (ultimately not adopted): An amendment to withhold all funds dedicated to Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) senior executives’ bonuses and instead to be put towards reducing the veteran disability appeals claim backlog. An amendment to prohibit Congressional funding for administrative leave that falls outside of standard administrative leave, as defined by Office of Personnel Management (OPM) guidelines. An amendment to prohibit bonuses for the VA senior executives and leadership staff until the Secretary of the VA reports on a VA plan to address the 2012 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report concerning the lack of analytic support and flawed savings estimates. An amendment to prohibit bonuses for the VA senior executives and the Office of Construction and Facilities Management’s senior leadership until the Secretary of the VA reports on how the VA will reduce their GAO designations as “high-risk” in federal real property portfolios, due to longstanding problems with excess and underutilized property and overreliance on leasing. An amendment to prohibit funding for the procurement of art work or art related consulting services, including in new construction, until the Secretary of the VA alerts Congress that the appointment backlogs for veterans seeking primary care has been eliminated. Ernst Amendments Offered to Transportation, Housing, Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act Section (ultimately not adopted): An amendment to bring funding for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program back down to the level of the President’s request of $500,000 from the $5,000,000 included in this bill. An amendment to eliminate funding for the Native Hawaiian Housing Block Grant program. An amendment to prohibit funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission to eliminate this duplicative program that only serves a certain region of the country. ###
05.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst released the following statement today, after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced proposed volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for conventional biofuels in 2017 and biomass-based diesel in 2018: “I am once again disappointed with the EPA’s decision to reduce volume requirements for conventional biofuels, despite having clear direction from Congress. Unfortunately, this was not a surprise, as this agency under the Obama administration has repeatedly ignored congressional intent when administering the RFS. “The RFS is about encouraging investment and research in renewable fuels, providing consumers with choices at the pump, and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Yet these volume levels will only discourage investment in next generation biofuels, and hurt an already struggling agricultural economy in Iowa and across the nation. “I was encouraged to see the levels for biomass-based diesel set as high as they were, but by reducing the congressionally mandated levels for conventional biofuels, the EPA has sent a clear message that they are willing to break the promises made by Congress to farmers and renewable energy producers years ago. “I remain committed to promoting investment and innovation in this sector, and protecting our domestic energy security while supporting our hardworking farm families throughout Iowa.” In January, Senator Ernst joined the Iowa delegation in a letter to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy encouraging the agency to follow congressional intent and set volumes for conventional biofuels at 15 billion gallons as well as an “aggressive” biomass-based diesel level for 2018. ###
05.13.2016	WASHINGTON – Bipartisan legislation from U.S. Senators Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joni Ernst of Iowa to build on historic reforms to curb sexual assaults in the military and better protect survivors from retaliation today cleared a key hurdle with its inclusion in the annual National Defense Authorization Act. McCaskill and Ernst—both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee—introduced the bipartisan Military Retaliation Prevention Act, targeting stubbornly high rates of survivors who report that they have been retaliated against by their peers after coming forward. Those rates of experienced retaliation remain high, even as the number of assaults has dropped and reporting by victims has gone up, following a slate of historic reforms overhauling the military justice system. The provision, along with the entire annual defense bill, now heads to the full U.S. Senate. “This is a critical next step in our sustained effort to curb sexual assault in the military and protect the brave survivors who come forward,” said McCaskill, a former prosecutor of sex crimes. “We’ve worked hard to empower survivors to come out of the shadows and report these crimes, but we’ve got to do a better job of stamping out the stubborn rates of retaliation, whether professional or social, they still face. I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues to get this commonsense proposal across the finish line.” “I am so pleased that our provision to protect survivors of sexual assault crimes from retaliation is one step closer to being enacted. I applaud Senator McCaskill for her hard work on this important legislation and our colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee for their support,” said Senator Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate. “Any retaliation against a sexual assault survivor within our military is utterly unacceptable and we simply cannot stand idle. I encourage all my Senate colleagues to stand with us in working to change the culture surrounding sexual assault in the military, and focus on preventing this trauma from happening in the first place.” The Senators’ bipartisan bill (summary available online HERE, and full bill text available online HERE) would target retaliation in a number of ways: Strengthen the military response by making retaliation its own unique offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (where retaliation is currently punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ, a broader article to punish failure to obey an order or regulation) Increase transparency by requiring victims be notified of how their complaint was decided—and requiring the Pentagon collect and publish data on retaliation complaints. Require specific training for investigators, including all military criminal investigators, IG investigators, or any personnel assigned by commanders to investigate the complaints Ensure each of the services adopt best practices by establishing metrics for measuring the outcomes of their efforts to prevent and respond to instances of retaliation The Senators’ plan was informed by recommendations made by the Judicial Proceedings Panel (which is chaired by former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, author of the federal rape shield law and former member of the Response Systems Panel) and the Military Justice Review Group. Initial data has demonstrated concrete progress in curbing sexual violence in the military as a result of reforms passed by Congress over the past few years. The Fiscal Year 2014 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military shows that incidents of unwanted sexual contact dropped by 29 percent from 2012 to 2014. The total number of reports (restricted and unrestricted) are up 11 percent from the previous year and up 70 percent from FY12. About 1 out of 4 survivors reported in FY14, up significantly from 1 out of 10 survivors reporting in FY12, and the highest reporting rate ever. Increased reporting occurred in all categories—unrestricted reports, restricted reports, and reports that survivors converted from restricted to unrestricted. And 82 percent of survivors surveyed agreed that their unit commander supported them, 73 percent were satisfied with their unit commander’s response, and 73 percent said they would recommend others report if they were a survivor of a sexual assault. However that same data found that 62 percent of the women who reported an incident of unwanted sexual contact reported experiencing some form of retaliation. The majority, 53 percent, categorized their experience as “social” retaliation. 32 percent indicated they experienced professional retaliation. The most recent Report on Sexual Assault in the Military showed that 68 percent of survey respondents indicated that they had experienced some sort of “negative reaction” to reporting a sexual assault. Among the more than 30 reforms already passed into law over the past few years: Commanders have been stripped of the ability to overturn convictions, and are now held accountable under rigorous new standards. Every survivor who reports a sexual assault now gets their own independent lawyer to protect their rights and fight for their interests—a reform that has no parallel in the civilian justice system. Civilian review is now required if a commander decides against a prosecution in a case in which a prosecutor wants to go to trial. Dishonorable discharge is now a required minimum sentence for anyone convicted of a sexual assault. The pre-trial “Article 32” process, which came under scrutiny following a case at the Naval Academy, has been reformed to better protect survivors. The statute of limitations in these cases has now been eliminated, a particularly important development in a sustained battle against sexual assaults. The “good soldier” defense for servicemembers accused of sexual assault has been eliminated under most circumstances. Survivors are now allowed formal input on whether their case is tried in military or civilian court. Sexual assault survivors are now allowed to challenge their discharge or separation from service. The role of the prosecutor in advising commanders on going to court-martial has been strengthened. ###
05.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after several of her measures were included in the Senate Armed Services Committee markup of the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill will now head to the Senate for further consideration. “The FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act continues to build on recent reforms that strengthen our national security and ensure success in potential future conflicts with technologically sophisticated adversaries. This NDAA includes priorities that drive innovation within the Department of Defense to build advanced weapon systems; make sure our men and women have access to the top equipment they need on the battlefield as well as the health care they deserve; improve U.S. capabilities to defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups; and protect our nation from ballistic missile systems. “I am pleased that several of my provisions to encourage greater efficiency and fiscal restraint were adopted, including reforming program management standards across the DoD to correct widespread deficiencies, lax oversight, and unnecessary cost overrun incurred by preventable delays in meeting stated goals and deadlines. Additionally, my provision to modernize DoD policies to provide transportation and ridesharing companies like Uber access to military installations was adopted. “Moreover, the FY17 NDAA includes my work to prevent retaliation against military sexual assault survivors by making it a punishable crime; ensure our military leaders set physical standards for our servicemembers instead of political appointees; mandate a report to Congress implementation of women into combat roles in the Army, Marines, and Special Operations; oversight language designed to improve military intelligence support to our warfighters through more effective spending of taxpayer dollars and eliminating unnecessary military headquarters overhead; and also create a career track for JAGs to specialize in criminal litigation for their entire careers to provide skilled counsel for our servicemembers. As I have made clear, I am committed to working to change the culture surrounding sexual assault in the military, and focus on the overall prevention of sexual assault in order to stop this trauma in the first place. “All of these powerful reforms included in NDAA are the product of a bipartisan effort on the Senate Armed Services Committee to put our nation on a strong path forward. I look forward to the continued discussion with my colleagues on the Senate floor in the time ahead.” Summary of Ernst Measures Included in the NDAA: Seeks to end retaliation against sexual assault survivors by making retaliation its own crime in the military. Creates a 5-year pilot program for a litigation track for military lawyers to enhance criminal justice within the military and provide more effective defense and prosecution for servicemembers. Provides additional workload at Rock Island Arsenal to turn no longer used military weapons into materials for new weapons. Implements a one year delay in requiring the National Guard to convert some of its Dual Status Military Technicians to federal civilian status. Makes permanent the National Guard State Partnership Program which enhances our military and diplomatic efforts around the world. Requires the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a report on the career progression track for female servicemembers. Improves DoD program and project management practices by requiring the development of government wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program management. Seeks to reduce drunk driving and provide employment opportunities to military families by requiring the DoD to develop a policy to afford base access to network transportation companies. Enhances whistleblower protections for those servicemembers and DoD employees who report wrongdoing at the DoD. Requires the DoD to report on the progress of women in previously closed combat positions. Provided funds for much needed renovations at the Women in Military Service for American Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery. Provides funds to the Army and Marine Corps to enhance the small arms and ammunition capabilities of our Soldiers and Marines. Requires the Army to reevaluate increases in overhead at military intelligence headquarters which seeks to eliminate unnecessary overhead, waste, and mismanagement, as well as to enhance intelligence support to our warfighters. Requires the Army to certify it was using certain military intelligence funds correctly in order to ensure the proper spending of Americans tax dollars. Urges the Army to enhance its military intelligence capabilities by keeping track of its intelligence professionals who have regional and academic expertise in certain geographical regions of the globe. Maintains suicide prevention programs in the Army Reserves and National Guard. Requires the DoD to report on its acquisition of sole source contracts which would enhance congressional oversight to ensure the DoD is getting the best value for taxpayer dollars. Requires the military service senior intelligence officers to have an active security clearance. Urges the DoD to enhance its military intelligence leadership by assigning general officers with military intelligence experience to serve as the military services senior intelligence officers. Authorizes the Navy to award historical World War II and Korea War era rifles to Marines and Sailors who win military marksmanship competitions. Ensures our military leaders set physical standards for servicemembers, instead of political appointees. ###
05.12.2016	WASHINGTON – This evening, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution honoring the life and legacy of Officer Kerrie Orozco of the Omaha Police Department. Senators Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced the resolution earlier this week. Officer Orozco was killed in the line of duty on May 20, 2015, while serving an arrest warrant in Omaha. Her death was an enormous loss for the surrounding community, where she was known for her volunteer work and service to local organizations. Senator Fischer released the following statement: “Officer Kerrie Orozco was a proud police officer, beloved wife, and caring mother. This month we mark the first anniversary of her death, but her memory and service to Omaha live on in the hearts of all Nebraskans. By honoring her life and legacy in the U.S. Senate, we can share her remarkable story with the nation and inspire others to ‘Kerrie On.’” Senator Sasse released the following statement: “Nebraskans are grateful for the life and service of Officer Orozco — someone who personified public service and taught our kids what courage and sacrifice mean. She led by example and will be remembered as a hero.” Senator Grassley released the following statement: “In so many aspects of her life, Officer Kerrie Orozco exemplified what it means to serve your community. Whether volunteering at area youth organizations or putting on a badge to protect and serve, she was, and continues to be, an important role model of what community is all about. We will forever be grateful for her selflessness and courage.” Senator Ernst released the following statement: “Officer Kerrie Orozco was a respected member of the Omaha Police Department, a devoted member of her community, and beloved by her family. She paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. I am pleased the Senate recognized the incredible sacrifice and memory of Officer Orozco.” Officer Kerrie Orozco was the first female to die in the line of duty while serving in the Omaha Police Department. Officer Orozco was killed one day before she was scheduled to bring her 3-month-old daughter Olivia home from the hospital and begin her postponed maternity leave. Kerrie was an active member of the Omaha community, where she coached baseball through the North Omaha Boys and Girls Club and volunteered with Special Olympics. A native Iowan, Officer Orozco resided in Council Bluffs, Iowa with her family.

05.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the Energy & Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act: “I take seriously the responsibility Iowans have entrusted in me to make Washington more competent and less wasteful. That is why I fought to scale back Washington’s runaway spending by offering up an amendment to cut $200 million in duplicative, wasteful programs. While this might not sound like a lot of money to some in Washington, in Iowa, we know these are dollars we simply cannot afford to waste. “I also co-sponsored an amendment that would have scrapped the expanded definition of the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule. This burdensome rule breeds uncertainty and confusion, while adding more red tape that threatens the livelihoods of many in Iowa and across the country. “While I am disappointed my amendments were not adopted, this legislation includes critical provisions for our nuclear security programs, including weapons activities, naval reactors, and defense nuclear nonproliferation. Protecting our homeland from threats and ensuring our nation is fully prepared and equipped at all times must always be the top priority of the federal government. “I am pleased that the Senate is working to take up spending bills in a very deliberate and transparent manner. I remain committed to identifying and cutting areas of waste, curbing reckless spending, and working to make our government run more effectively and efficiently.” Click on the images below to watch Senator Ernst discuss her amendment.
05.11.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) Prove It Act of 2016 today passed out of the Senate Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee and now heads to the full Senate for consideration. The Prove It Act increases transparency within the federal rulemaking process, especially when there is a disagreement between agencies over the economic impact of a rule on small businesses. In particular, this proposal designates a third party to review the facts and issue a publicly available objective assessment. If it is determined that the proposed rule would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the bill requires the federal agency to go back and complete additional regulatory analyses. “Today’s committee passage of the Prove It Act is an important step to help our small businesses who are stymied under the weight of burdensome federal rules and regulations,” said Senator Ernst. “By encouraging federal agencies to carefully consider the impact a rule may have on small businesses, it brings us a step closer to preventing harmful rules like the expanded definition of WOTUS, while also incentivizing better rulemaking to free up our job creators. I encourage my Senate colleges to support this commonsense proposal that streamlines our regulatory system and helps our small businesses focus on growing their business and creating jobs, rather than worrying about costly regulations.” Background: In the case of the expanded Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, the Prove It Act could have worked to incentivize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy to resolve their differences on whether the rule would have a direct and significant economic impact on small businesses. In 2014, the Office of Advocacy submitted a regulatory comment letter that requested EPA to withdraw the WOTUS rule and conduct additional analysis in light of these concerns. The Prove It Act: Gives small businesses a stronger voice and requires agencies to prove their regulatory analysis if the SBA Office of Advocacy Chief Counsel disagrees with the agency’s decision to certify that the rule would not have a significant economic impact. Calls for the request for review to be published in the Federal Register and on the SBA Office of Advocacy’s website to ensure transparency. Requires the federal agency that issued the proposed rule to also publish a response to the SBA Office of Advocacy’s request for an OIRA review and disclose it in the Federal Register and on its website. Mandates that OIRA submit the results of the review to the SBA Chief Counsel and publish those results in the Federal Register and on OIRA’s website. Ensures that if OIRA determines that the proposed rule will in fact have a significant economic impact, the agency would be required to perform an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) and subsequently a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA). The Prove It Act is also supported by the National Federation of Independent Business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Women Impacting Public Policy. ###

05.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, legislation championed by U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to reinstate inurnment rights for Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) at Arlington National Cemetery, passed the Senate unanimously. This bill, sponsored by Congresswomen Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Susan Davis (D-CA), is a companion measure to S.2437 which Ernst and Mikulski introduced earlier this year. A policy change made by the Army in 2015 currently prevents the WASP, who flew domestic military missions during World War II, from being inurned at Arlington. Between 1942 and 1944, the WASP flew countless U.S. Army Air Force planes for non-combat service missions to free up their male counterparts for combat duty, totaling 1,704 women pilots. Iowa was at one time or another, home to at least 25 courageous WASP. Unfortunately, 38 WASP lost their lives in the line of duty. While the WASP were eventually granted veteran status in 1977 “for the purposes of all laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration,” it was not until 2002 that the Army allowed these women to have their ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. In 2015, that honor was revoked by the Army. The family of Elaine Harmon, a WASP who passed away one year ago, has been working tirelessly to reverse the Army’s decision. **Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks on Senate passage** “The WASP were trailblazers, and put their lives on the line in service of their country,” said Senator Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate. “Today, the Senate has acted, and we will soon be calling on President Obama to join us in honoring these extraordinary women for their courageous military service by restoring their right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.” "I'm pleased the Senate today passed my bipartisan bill to honor the service and sacrifice of the Women Airforce Service Pilots. I look forward to swiftly passing a final bill through Congress that can be sent to the President to be signed into law‎," Senator Mikulski said. "If they were good enough to fly for our country, risk their lives and earn the Congressional Gold Medal, they should be good enough to be laid to rest at Arlington. I introduced this bipartisan bill with Sen. Joni Ernst to once and for all right this wrong." “I am proud to help ensure that the Women’s Air Force Service Pilots and other active duty designees who put their lives on the line for our country receive the honor they deserve,” said Senator Johnny Isakson, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. “It was wrong for the Army to suddenly deny these brave women and men the honor of inurnment at Arlington National Cemetery after they were granted this privilege years ago. I thank Senators Ernst and Mikulski and Rep. McSally for their hard work to right this wrong, and I look forward to seeing this bill signed into law.” “The WASP were pioneering heroes and, today, we are one step closer to honoring them as they deserve,” said Congresswoman McSally. “I applaud Senator Ernst for her persistent leadership to get this bill passed in the Senate. With minor changes made to the bill, I will continue to work expediently to get this bill passed in the House, where it has seen unanimous support, and send it to the President’s desk.” "I’m thrilled to see the Senate pass the WASP Act,” said Congresswoman Davis. “These amazing women who helped win World War II deserve access to Arlington Cemetery and the full honors we give our war heroes.” “On behalf of my family, I would like to thank Senators Mikulski and Ernst for introducing Senate legislation and working to ensure we had support in the Senate as well as the House,” said Erin Miller, the granddaughter of the late Elaine Harmon, a WASP who has been denied inurnment rights at Arlington National Cemetery. “I would like to thank Senator Ernst and her staff for their attention to this legislation which is so personal to us. Senator Ernst has been a strong advocate for us since the beginning and now we are one step closer to ensuring that the WASP and my grandmother are rightfully eligible for the honor to be inurned at Arlington National Cemetery alongside others who have served our nation proudly." Following today’s Senate passage, the legislation now heads back to the U.S. House of Representatives for final consideration. Upon House passage, the legislation will head to the President’s desk. ###
05.09.2016	WASHINGTON – In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst requested more information from the United States Department of Agriculture regarding the methodology for determining county yields for the Agriculture Risk Coverage or ARC County program. The majority of Iowa corn and soybean farmers signed up for the ARC program that was enacted in the 2014 farm bill. The formula used to determine ARC payments is composed of two factors, including the average marketing year price and the average county yield. Grassley and Ernst are seeking to learn more about the process the USDA uses to determine county yields because there are several instances of significant discrepancies in payments between adjacent counties. In 2014, Calhoun County received a payment of $23.21 per acre while the county directly north, Pocahontas County, received $91.52 and the two counties to the south received about $75 an acre. Webster County, to the East of Calhoun, received $46.80 per acre, double the payment that farmers in Calhoun County received. “Farmers have raised concerns about the yield data being utilized by USDA and the resulting distribution of payments to counties," wrote Grassley and Ernst. "We recognize counties are different sizes which can affect how well the crops in a county correlate to the county average yield. However, legitimate questions have been raised about the significant payment disparity that has occurred between adjacent counties in certain areas throughout the country." The full text of the letter is included below: May 2, 2016 The Honorable Tom Vilsack Secretary U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave., SW Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack, We are writing you to inquire about the methodology USDA is using to determine average county yields for the Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) county program. ARC is designed to protect farmers against sudden drops in revenue by offering protection to farmers based on both the county yield for a crop and the average marketing year price. Section 1117 of the 2014 Farm Bill instructs you to determine the average yield of counties for the five most recent crop years. Farmers have raised concerns about the yield data being utilized by USDA and the resulting distribution of payments to counties. We recognize counties are different sizes which can affect how well the crops in a county correlate to the county average yield. However, legitimate questions have been raised about the significant payment disparity that has occurred between adjacent counties in certain areas throughout the country. To help us better understand how USDA determines ARC county payments, please provide answers to the following questions: 1) What methodology does USDA use to determine county yields for the ARC program? 2) If a significant inconsistency in county yields is determined between adjacent counties, does USDA do any further analysis to ensure the county yield numbers are correct? 3) Does anything prevent USDA from using county yield data from the Risk Management Agency (RMA) for the determination of ARC county yields? We look forward to working with you to ensure the farm safety net functions properly for farmers across the country. Sincerely, Chuck GrassleyUnited States Senator Joni ErnstUnited States Senator -30-

04.28.2016	WASHINGTON – A bipartisan pair of U.S. Senators today took the next step to continue curbing sexual assaults in the military, introducing legislation to build on the historic reforms of recent years, and better protect survivors who report such crimes from retaliation. Senators Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa)—both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee—introduced the bipartisan Military Retaliation Prevention Act, targeting stubbornly high rates of survivors who report that they have been retaliated against by their peers after coming forward. Those rates of experienced retaliation remain high, even as the number of assaults has dropped and reporting by victims has gone up, following a slate of historic reforms overhauling the military justice system. “Sexual predators thrive when victims are too scared to come forward—and while we’ve taken big steps to get more survivors out of the shadows and empowered, a fear of retaliation in the military remains one of our most stubborn obstacles,” said McCaskill, a former prosecutor of sex crimes. “This bipartisan bill represents our next step in our shared, sustained effort to stamp out these heinous crimes.” “I strongly believe there should be no tolerance for sexual assault and abuse of any kind in the military, which is why I’m proud the Military Retaliation Prevention Act takes concerted efforts to improve military response and empower these tenacious survivors to report the attack,” said Senator Ernst. “We must work to change the culture surrounding sexual assault in the military, and make clear that any retaliation against a sexual assault survivor is unacceptable. Combatting and preventing sexual assault in the military is a bipartisan issue, and we absolutely must provide the support and care these brave survivors deserve.” The Senators’ bipartisan bill (summary available online HERE, and full bill text available online HERE) would target retaliation in a number of ways: Strengthen the military response by making retaliation its own unique offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (where retaliation is currently punishable under Article 92 of the UCMJ, a broader article to punish failure to obey an order or regulation) Increase transparency by requiring victims be notified of how their complaint was decided—and requiring the Pentagon collect and publish data on retaliation complaints, including: whether a victim claims professional or social retaliation; the narrative and date of the allegation; the recipient of each complaint; the gender of the victim of retaliation and the retaliator; the relationship between the victim of retaliation, victim of the sexual assault, and the retaliator; the relationship, if any, between retaliator and the alleged perpetrator of the underlying crime; whether the alleged retaliation is actionable under the UCMJ; the organization investigating report of retaliation; the outcome of the retaliation report, or current status of a pending investigation; and whether the outcome of the retaliation report was shared with the victim of retaliation Require specific training for investigators, including all military criminal investigators, IG investigators, or any personnel assigned by commanders to investigate the complaints Ensure each of the services adopt best practices by establishing metrics for measuring the outcomes of their efforts to prevent and respond to instances of retaliation The Senators’ plan was informed by recommendations made by the Judicial Proceedings Panel (which is chaired by former Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman, author of the federal rape shield law and former member of the Response Systems Panel) and the Military Justice Review Group. The Military Justice Review Group specifically recommended that retaliation be made its own UCMJ offense—but proposed to apply this new article only in cases in which an individual has reported or intends to report a crime. The Senators’ legislation builds on that recommendation to also protect military whistleblowers who report any violation of law, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety. Initial data has demonstrated concrete progress in curbing sexual violence in the military as a result of reforms passed by Congress over the past few years. The Fiscal Year 2014 Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military shows that incidents of unwanted sexual contact dropped by 29 percent from 2012 to 2014. The total number of reports (restricted and unrestricted) are up 11 percent from the previous year (5,518 in FY13 compared to 6,131 in FY14) and up 70 percent from FY12. About 1 out of 4 survivors reported in FY14, up significantly from 1 out of 10 survivors reporting in FY12, and the highest reporting rate ever. Increased reporting occurred in all categories—unrestricted reports, restricted reports, and reports that survivors converted from restricted to unrestricted. And 82 percent of survivors surveyed agreed that their unit commander supported them, 73 percent were satisfied with their unit commander’s response, and 73 percent said they would recommend others report if they were a survivor of a sexual assault. However that same data found that 62 percent of the women who reported an incident of unwanted sexual contact reported experiencing some form of retaliation. The majority, 53 percent, categorized their experience as “social” retaliation. 32 percent indicated they experienced professional retaliation. Among the more than 30 reforms already passed into law over the past few years: Commanders have been stripped of the ability to overturn convictions, and are now held accountable under rigorous new standards. Every survivor who reports a sexual assault now gets their own independent lawyer to protect their rights and fight for their interests—a reform that has no parallel in the civilian justice system. Civilian review is now required if a commander decides against a prosecution in a case in which a prosecutor wants to go to trial. Dishonorable discharge is now a required minimum sentence for anyone convicted of a sexual assault. The pre-trial “Article 32” process, which came under scrutiny following a case at the Naval Academy, has been reformed to better protect survivors. The statute of limitations in these cases has now been eliminated, a particularly important development in a sustained battle against sexual assaults. The “good soldier” defense for servicemembers accused of sexual assault has been eliminated under most circumstances. Survivors are now allowed formal input on whether their case is tried in military or civilian court. Sexual assault survivors are now allowed to challenge their discharge or separation from service. The role of the prosecutor in advising commanders on going to court-martial has been strengthened. ###
04.27.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Prove It Act of 2016, legislation that increases transparency within the federal rulemaking process, especially when there is a disagreement between agencies over the economic impact of a rule on small businesses. In particular, this proposal designates a third party to review the facts and issue a publicly available objective assessment. If it is determined that the proposed rule would have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the bill requires the federal agency to go back and complete additional regulatory analyses. In the case of the expanded Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) rule, the Prove It Act could have worked to incentivize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy to resolve their differences on whether the rule would have a direct and significant economic impact on small businesses. In 2014, the Office of Advocacy submitted a regulatory comment letter that requested EPA to withdraw the WOTUS rule and conduct additional analysis in light of these concerns. “The Prove It Act is a step in the right direction to mitigate rules like the overreaching and burdensome expansion of WOTUS that threatens the livelihoods of many small businesses,” said Senator Ernst. “By requiring an objective, third party assessment of differing regulatory analyses, this proposal works to counter agencies like the EPA from having an unchecked ability to implement harmful rules and regulations without taking into account the concerns of our small businesses. This legislation incentivizes better rulemaking by encouraging federal agencies to have thoughtful conversations about differing impact studies a rule may have on small businesses, as well as bring the conversation into the public domain in a way that doesn’t currently exist. “It’s time to make our government work more efficiently and streamline our regulatory system so our small businesses can innovate and create jobs without the weight of unnecessary, costly regulations that stymie growth.” The Prove It Act is also supported by the National Federation of Independent Business, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Women Impacting Public Policy. About The Prove It Act: Gives small businesses a stronger voice and requires agencies to prove their regulatory analysis if the SBA Office of Advocacy Chief Counsel disagrees with the agency’s decision to certify that the rule would not have a significant economic impact. Calls for the request for review to be published in the Federal Register and on the SBA Office of Advocacy’s website to ensure transparency. Requires the federal agency that issued the proposed rule to also publish a response to the SBA Office of Advocacy’s request for an OIRA review and disclose it in the Federal Register and on its website. Mandates that OIRA submit the results of the review to the SBA Chief Counsel and publish those results in the Federal Register and on OIRA’s website. If OIRA determines that the proposed rule will in fact have a significant economic impact, the agency would be required to perform an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) and subsequently a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA). # # #
04.27.2016	WASHINGTON – The U.S. Senate delegations from Iowa and Nebraska are seeking details on the Obama Administration’s decision to place an unaccompanied minor immigrant in the care of his older brother, who was illegally residing in the United States. Edwin Mejia entered the country as a minor, was transferred out of federal custody, and is now a fugitive charged in an Omaha drunk driving incident that killed 21-year-old Iowan Sarah Root. “We are deeply concerned that an unaccompanied alien minor, Edwin (a.k.a. “Eswin”) Mejia, was released by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to a sponsor who was reportedly in the United States illegally. We would appreciate a better understanding of what happened in light of the fact that Mejia, now almost 20 years old, has since been charged with a crime resulting in the death of a U.S. citizen, absconded from authorities, and remains a fugitive at-large,” Iowa Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst and Nebraska Senators Deb Fischer and Ben Sasse wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. The Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for placing unaccompanied minor immigrants with adult sponsors who live in the United States. The Department is also responsible for conducting background checks on potential sponsors prior to placing minors under their supervision. However, a recent Government Accountability Office report reveals that the Department fails to routinely and thoroughly conduct background checks of potential sponsors to determine whether they are suited to supervise a minor. The Senators are seeking details on the steps the Department took to ensure that Mejia’s brother, Santos Jesus Romero-Mejia, was qualified to be responsible for the care of a minor, as well as whether the Department has maintained any communication with the brothers after Mejia was placed with Romero-Mejia. The Senators have also raised concern that the Department of Homeland Security didn’t consider Mejia to be an enforcement priority. They have not received full responses to those inquiries. Grassley, the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration policy, has raised concerns about inadequate background checks, including skipped child abuse and neglect checks, that leave unaccompanied minor immigrants in the care of criminals, according to whistleblower reports. Text of the Senators’ letter to Secretary Burwell follows: April 26, 2016 The Honorable Sylvia Mathews BurwellSecretaryDepartment of Health and Human ServicesWashington, DC 20201 Dear Secretary Burwell: We are deeply concerned that an unaccompanied alien minor, Edwin (a.k.a. “Eswin”) Mejia, was released by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to a sponsor who was reportedly in the United States illegally. We would appreciate a better understanding of what happened in light of the fact that Mejia, now almost 20 years old, has since been charged with a crime resulting in the death of a U.S. citizen, absconded from authorities, and remains a fugitive at-large. According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Mejia entered the country illegally on May 14, 2013, near Nogales, Arizona. At that time, Customs and Border Protection arrested Mejia and served him a Notice to Appear. On May 17, 2013, Mejia was placed by HHS, via the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), at the David and Margaret Youth and Family Services facility in Los Angeles, California. On June 28, 2013, Mejia was released into the custody of his brother, Santos Jesus Romero-Mejia, who resided in Madison, Tennessee. According to ICE, the ORR reunification packet includes information stating that “Edwin Mejia claims that his brother is ‘illegal.’” Edwin Mejia was arrested on January 31, 2016, in Omaha, Nebraska, and charged with drag racing, driving under the influence, and killing 21-year old Sarah Root in a car accident. Mejia’s blood alcohol limit at the time of the accident was more than three times the legal limit. Sarah Root had graduated that evening from Bellevue University with perfect grades and was on her way home. Mejia, who had twice failed to appear in court on state charges, was released on bond and absconded. His whereabouts are still unknown. Because Mejia was an unaccompanied minor at the time he crossed the border, HHS was in charge of his care and placement while in the United States. Given the findings by the Government Accountability Office that your Department does not adequately monitor its grantees and has failed to routinely conduct background checks, including fingerprinting all sponsors or completing child abuse and neglect checks on relative sponsors[1], we would like to know what information your Department had on Mejia’s sponsor before releasing Mejia into his custody. Moreover, we would like to know whether HHS had any further contact with Mejia once he was placed with his sponsor. Therefore, we ask that your Department respond to the following questions related to this case no later than May 11: Why was Edwin Mejia placed at the David and Margaret Youth and Family Services facility in Los Angeles? How many individuals applied to be a sponsor for Edwin Mejia? Please provide details and any document related to each applicant, including information such as name, relationship, address, and a copy of the application submitted. What specific background or biometric checks were done on the sponsor applicants before Edwin Mejia was transferred to the custody of his brother, Santos Jesus Romero-Mejia? Who performed the background check for Mejia’s sponsor – HHS or a contractor? If a contractor, please provide the name. Was Mejia released under any kind of an agreement, probation, or order of supervision? How was Edwin Mejia physically transferred from California to the custody of his brother who supposedly resided in Tennessee? What is the Department’s current policy on fingerprinting the sponsors of unaccompanied minors? If parents and other immediate relatives are not required to undergo biometric checks, please explain why. After Mejia’s placement, did HHS have any further contact with him or his sponsor? In addition to answering these questions, please provide any document related to Edwin Mejia, including all notes, documents, applications and correspondence included therein. We appreciate your cooperation and await your response.

04.26.2016	***WATCH Full Press Conference HERE**** Washington, D.C. – To mark Sexual Assault Awareness Month, Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate and survivors of sexual assault joined Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill today to urge the Senate to pass the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. This bipartisan legislation would protect students, professionalize the response to and reporting of sexual assault cases, and provide colleges and universities with incentives to solve the problem of sexual assault on their campuses. “We started from the premise that sexual assault is a serious crime and should be treated as a crime,” Senator Chuck Grassley said. “The bill helps survivors get the support they need so they know their options. It’s meant to make them comfortable reporting to police and campus authorities. This is a common-sense bipartisan measure, and I hope to see it pass the Senate soon.” “Sexual assault is an underreported crime, and the sad reality is that many survivors don’t believe that they will get the support and services they need and deserve if they come forward. Universities and colleges must be held accountable for the safety of their students, and we need a structured approach that brings together responsiveness, transparency, and a uniformity of standards – instead of the haphazard approach that exists today,” said Senator Kelly Ayotte. “I am grateful for the partnership of Senators Gillibrand, McCaskill, and others, and I will continue to work with the Senate HELP Committee and key stakeholders to get CASA passed.” “In order to truly affect change, we need to come together and pass the Campus Accountability and Safety Act. By educating campus personnel, strengthening the law enforcement response, creating transparency and establishing support services for survivors of sexual assault, this bill takes clear steps to help those in West Virginia and around the country affected by sexual assault,” said Senator Capito. “The Campus Accountability and Safety Act offers protections and supports for students, standardizes the response and streamlines the reporting of sexual assault cases by college campuses,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This proposal is a step in the right direction and it’s my hope that the Senate will act quickly to pass it.” “When our sons and daughters go to college, they shouldn't have to worry about their safety on campus. The time to address campus sexual assault is now. We have a strong, bipartisan bill that will help combat these crimes and provide survivors with the assistance they need. ‎I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass CASA,” said Senator Dean Heller. “The bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act would create historic transparency requirements and give colleges and universities an incentive to take campus sexual assault seriously,” said Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “Some schools, like the SUNY system in New York, have shown leadership by acknowledging that sexual assault is a problem on their campuses, and they’re beginning to fight it. But most colleges are stuck in defensive mode, and won’t even admit they have a problem because they’re afraid their application numbers will drop, or because they just don’t take these assaults seriously. We need to pass this bipartisan bill and finally start holding our schools accountable for how they deal with this crime.” “We’ve taken huge steps forward over the past two years in crafting this bipartisan, commonsense plan—but students on campuses across this country can’t wait any longer for us to act on it,” said Senator McCaskill, a former prosecutor of sex crimes. “This legislation reflects the input of countless survivors, universities, advocates, and law enforcement officials. We’ve got a smart policy solution that helps curb these crimes, increases responsiveness when crimes do occur, protects and empowers students, and creates an accountable system with real teeth. Even at a time when it’s hard to get much done around here, I’m confident these are solutions that my colleagues in the Senate can agree on, and I look forward to working with them to get this across the finish line. It’s time to get this bill passed.” “We must stop the staggering scourge of sexual assault on our college campuses,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal. “This critical legislation provides specific, enforceable rights to make clear to campus sexual assault survivors that we’re serious about preventing and punishing this horrific crime. Our bipartisan coalition today spoke louder than ever to say our commitment is stronger than ever to creating a culture of safety on our campuses. Passing this bipartisan legislation will signal that the days of victim blaming are over—and the days of empowerment are here.” “Ensuring the most basic protection – safety – for young people trying to get an education ought to be foremost in our minds,” Senator Wyden said. “The problem of campus sexual assault needs an all hands-on-deck approach. That’s why I am a proud cosponsor of the bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act.” “The epidemic of sexual violence on college campuses demands action. That means better resources and support for victims, more transparent and carefully constructed systems for reporting sexual violence, and an acknowledgement that it’s on us to end the quiet tolerance that’s allowed the violence to spread,” said Senator Whitehouse. “Thanks to Senators McCaskill and Gillibrand for their tremendous leadership, and for addressing the important role law enforcement can and should play in helping protect victims of sexual assault.” “EROC supports the Campus Safety and Accountability Act because it provides institutions of higher education with more comprehensive tools with which to empower their students and effectively prevent campus sexual assault,” said Andrea Pino, Director of Policy and Support at End Rape On Campus (EROC). “The bill also bolsters the Department of Education's effectiveness in enforcing Title IX and holding institutions accountable that do violate Title IX — an essential gender-equity and civil rights educational amendment that college students need.” “The Bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act will help improve the way that colleges deal with sexual violence, and will give more victims an opportunity for justice,” said RAINN Vice President for Public Policy Rebecca O’Connor. “It will also help us measure progress, through an annual survey, and will stop the practice of letting athletic departments investigate allegations against their own players. We’re grateful that so many Senate leaders are working hard to solve the problem of rape on campus, and we remain committed to working with them to pass a bill that will help victims and help reduce the number of violent assaults.” “CASAct is a critical step on the path towards ensuring every American student can pursue a college education free from fear of sexual assault,” said SAFER Policy and Research Coordinator and Board Chair-elect Jennifer Snow. “By standardizing campus climate surveys and requiring colleges and universities to maintain more accurate data, students now have a real opportunity to hold their institutions accountable for the epidemic of sexual and gender violence on campus. We also believe that amnesty policies and truly confidential resources are critical for creating a campus environment that is supportive of survivors.” “The State University of New York has a long and unwavering commitment to ensuring student safety and we strongly support Senator Kirsten Gillibrand’s efforts to make this issue a national priority, as New York State has done,” said State University of New York Chancellor Nancy Zimpher. “We are proud to be the first university system to support of the Campus Accountability and Safety Act, which takes a bold step towards improving the prevention of and response to sexual and interpersonal violence at all institutions of higher education.” According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, college campuses reported over 6,700 forcible sex offenses (rape and sexual battery) in 2014, but a recent Department of Justice study shows that the actual number of offenses is estimated to be at least four times that number. Colleges must create an environment where more students feel comfortable coming forward to report sexual assault, so that more perpetrators can be brought to justice. Quick Facts: 80 percent of rape and sexual assault victimizations against female students ages 18-24 go unreported to police. Law enforcement officials at 30 percent of institutions of higher education receive no training on how to respond to reports of sexual violence. 73 percent of institutions of higher education have no protocols on how the institution and law enforcement work together to respond to campus sexual violence. Most cases of campus sexual assault are not instances of “stranger rape.” 78 percent of campus sexual assaults are perpetrated by someone the victim knows. Confidential reporting options facilitate reporting of campus sexual assault to police and campus authorities. Current federal law has had the perverse effect of encouraging colleges to under-report sexual assaults. The bipartisan Campus Accountability and Safety Act (S. 590) would flip the incentives to protect students and professionalize the response to and reporting of sexual assault by doing the following: 1. Establishing new campus resources and support services for student survivors Colleges and universities would be required to designate Confidential Advisors to assist survivors of sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Confidential Advisors would coordinate support services and accommodations for survivors, and provide information and assistance regarding options for reporting the crime to local law enforcement and/or campus authorities at the direction of the survivor. A report to a Confidential Advisor would not automatically trigger a Title IX investigation, and survivors would have support in filing a police report, thus making prosecutions more likely. Schools would no longer be allowed to sanction students who report sexual violence but reveal a non-violent student conduct violation, like underage drinking, in good faith. 2. Ensuring minimum training standards for on-campus personnel The lack of training for campus personnel can interfere with sexual assault investigations and student disciplinary proceedings, resulting in negative outcomes for both survivors and accused students. This legislation would ensure that everyone from the Confidential Advisor to those responsible for investigating and participating in student disciplinary proceedings would receive specialized training, so that they would have a firm understanding of the nature of these crimes. 3. Creating historic new transparency requirements Students at every university in America would be surveyed about their experience with sexual violence. The new biennial survey would be standardized and anonymous. Colleges and universities would publish the results online, and the Department of Education would be required to publish the names of all schools with pending investigations, final resolutions, and voluntary resolution agreements related to Title IX with respect to sexual violence. 4. Requiring a uniform discipline process and coordination with law enforcement All schools would use one uniform process for campus student disciplinary proceedings and would no longer be allowed to have athletic departments or other subgroups handle complaints of sexual violence against members of that subgroup. Both survivors and accused students would receive notification if schools proceed with a disciplinary process regarding an allegation of sexual assault within 24 hours of such decision being made, and both survivors and the accused would be informed of their rights. Colleges and universities would be required to enter into memoranda of understanding with each local law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction to report to a campus as a first responder, to clearly delineate responsibilities and facilitate law enforcement investigations. 5. Establishing enforceable Title IX penalties and stiffer penalties for Clery Act violations Schools that do not comply with certain requirements under the bill may face a penalty of up to 1 percent of the institution’s operating budget. Currently, the only allowable penalty is the loss of all financial aid, which is not practical and has never been done. The bill would increase penalties for Clery Act violations to up to $150,000 per violation, from the current penalty of $35,000 per violation. ###
04.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate has unanimously approved a bipartisan resolution co-sponsored by U.S. Senator Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, in support of 4-H and its recently-launched “Grow True Leaders” campaign. The measure, which was authored by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., recognizes the immeasurable benefits of the national 4-H program for young people and its potential growth under the new initiative. “I’m always glad to see strong bipartisan support for youth involvement in programs like 4-H,” said Senator Ernst, a former member of 4-H. “4-H provides valuable educational and vocational skills that foster a lifetime of engagement in agriculture and in communities across Iowa for future generations.” As the Iowa Senator noted in a recent column for the Iowa Spokesman, “When visiting with organizations such as 4-H and FFA, I am encouraged by the work they are doing to highlight career fields related to agriculture for students. My daughter is in high school, and just like her mother at that age, she is involved with the local 4-H club. Whether it is service through these organizations, or in the classroom where students are learning about agronomy, soils, wood and metal working, and a myriad of other technical real-world skills, it is wonderful to see the interest in helping others that our young high school students exemplify.” The 4-H movement supports young people through programs designed to shape future leaders and innovators, particularly in rural communities. Last week, 4-H launched a campaign called “Grow True Leaders,” which seeks to replicate 4-H’s success in rural communities in urban areas. The program’s new initiative hopes to reach a broader, more diverse population, impacting more African American and Hispanic children.

04.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in support of the bipartisan Energy Policy Modernization Act (S.2012), a comprehensive energy reform bill: “This bipartisan legislation works to match America’s rapid energy growth and advancements with the much needed improvements to our outdated energy laws, regulations, and programs. “Without adding to the deficit or increasing taxes, the Energy Policy Modernization Act works to: streamline the natural gas export permitting process; advance certain energy efficiency programs; improve energy storage and transmission; modernize the management of federal buildings to eliminate potentially duplicative and wasteful programs; increase government accountability and oversight; and require greater stakeholder engagement on how energy rules and regulations are developed. “In the face of growing cybersecurity threats, this bipartisan legislation also makes critical improvements to our nation’s electric grid which are necessary to protect the system from cyber-related attacks in emergency situations. “Additionally, the Energy Policy Modernization Act helps outline and increase awareness about federal conservation and incentive programs available to interested landowners in order to conserve our land for future generations. “These bipartisan reforms will not only promote more American energy production, but empower our businesses to create jobs, maintain global competitiveness, and save money for consumers in Iowa and nationwide.” ###
04.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act. This legislation reauthorizes Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) programs through September 2017. “As our aviation industry adapts to growing and increasingly complex national security threats from all around the globe, the bipartisan Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act implements real reforms that put passengers first, by increasing airport security and improving the overall travel process. “This bill contains provisions to keep our airports and the traveling public safe. In particular, it increases oversight to ensure airport employees are properly vetted and identified with security badges. Additionally, this legislation improves agency coordination, and requires TSA to assess security vulnerabilities. The Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act also includes consumer protections like refunding baggage fees if items are lost or delayed, and forcing airlines to use a uniform standard for disclosing airline fees that is prominently displayed and easy to read. “Also included is my bipartisan measure to ensure airports – including in Iowa – aren’t disqualified from a particular grant solely because the airport provides a nominal lease to a military component. My proposal fosters a positive environment for negotiations to continue, in order to achieve a fair resolution that takes into consideration the perspectives of the airport boards, National Guard and U.S. Air Force.” About the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act: Provides for a $400 million increase to the Airport Improvement Program with available existing funds that Iowa airports rely on. Addresses growing cybersecurity threats facing aviation and air navigation systems. Enhances security for international flights bound for the U.S. Expands enrollment in the TSA PreCheck program to help passengers move through security lines quickly and formalizes TSA procedures to allow parents to accompany their children through the airport screening process. Improves airport security by improving airport worker vetting, agency coordination, and requiring TSA to assess security vulnerabilities. Strengthens the mental health evaluations of commercial pilots. Reauthorizes the Essential Air Service Program and the Small Community Air Service Development Program. Directs airlines to bolster flight attendant training on how to identify and report incidents of human trafficking. Requires airlines to allow a child under the age of 13 to be able to sit in a seat next to a family member over the age of 13 at no additional cost. Requires airlines to provide a refund to the customer for their baggage if items are lost or delayed. Creates a uniform standard for disclosing airline fees that is easier to read for consumers. ###
04.19.2016	Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, and Members of the Committee, We appreciate the opportunity to submit for the record a joint statement to honor our constituent, Ms. Sarah Root, who lost her life because of a drunk driver in the country illegally. The Senators from Nebraska, Senator Sasse and Senator Fischer, join us in honoring Ms. Root as well. Today, her mother, Michelle Root, will share her personal story about the loss of her daughter and how someone in the country illegally was able to walk free after fatally hitting her daughter’s vehicle on graduation night. Sarah was 21 years old, and had just graduated from Bellevue University with perfect grades and an interest in pursuing a career in criminal justice. In the words of her family, “she was full of life and ready to take on the world.” According to a close friend of hers, Sarah was smart, outgoing, and dedicated to her friends and family. She embodied the words tattooed on her skin: Live, Laugh, Love. The day Sarah graduated, she was struck by a drunk driver in the country illegally. The alleged drunk driver was Eswin Mejia, who had a blood-alcohol content of more than three times the legal limit. Mejia was charged with felony motor-vehicle homicide and operating a vehicle while intoxicated on February 3. After causing the death of an American citizen and being charged with felony motor-vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s so-called “Enforcement Priorities.” Unfortunately and shamefully, that was not the case. After the crash, local law enforcement apparently asked the federal government – specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – to take custody of Mejia, but the federal government declined. An ICE spokesman stated that the agency did not lodge a detainer on the man because his arrest for felony motor-vehicle homicide “did not meet ICE’s enforcement priorities.” In responding to questions about ICE’s failure to lodge a detainer during a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldaña actually suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured, not dead. How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who – while driving drunk and drag racing – hits and either seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally acknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This case has shed light on the breakdown between the federal government and state and local government. It has also showcased – in heartbreaking fashion – why the President’s policies don’t work, and how they are having a dire effect on American families like the Root family. Under the Obama Administration’s Enforcement Priorities, a person in the country illegally will only be detained or removed in a few limited circumstances. In this case, these so-called “priorities” resulted in a tragedy. A smart young lady who had a bright future was struck by a drunk driver who entered the country illegally, and ICE declined to take custody of him. While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should – without question – constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide otherwise is baffling. In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia on their “Most Wanted” list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. And for the countless other families who are suffering today because of their personal losses, they deserve our commitment that the U.S. Government will enforce the law. Things have to change. The President must rethink his policies and seriously reconsider his so-called “priorities” so that tragedies like this one are not replicated elsewhere. # # #
04.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today spoke on the Senate floor to honor the life of Sarah Root, a young Iowan allegedly killed by an illegal immigrant, Eswin Mejia. The Iowa Senator also called for answers as to why the Obama Administration neglected to detain Mejia. Ernst’s remarks followed a joint letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) seeking clarification about the administration’s failure to act, which ICE has yet to respond to. Click here or on the image below to watch the Senator’s remarks. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, I rise today to echo the sentiments shared by our senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley. Tomorrow morning, one of my constituents, Michelle Root, will be testifying before the House Judiciary Committee about the loss of her beautiful young daughter, Sarah Root. As a mother to three daughters myself, I cannot begin to fathom the pain and anguish Ms. Root is experiencing. Earlier this year, 21-year old Sarah Root was killed by a drunk driver. That driver, Eswin Mejia, was allegedly drag racing with a blood alcohol level more than three times the legal limit when he crashed into the back of Sarah’s vehicle. Eswin Mejia is also an illegal immigrant. After causing the death of an American citizen and being charged with motor-vehicle homicide, one would think he would clearly meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s so-called “Enforcement Priorities.” But no. No. Citing the Administration’s November 2014 memo on immigration enforcement priorities, ICE declined to lodge a detainer and take custody of Mejia. During a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, ICE Director Sarah Saldana actually suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured, not dead. How twisted and convoluted has our immigration system become that an illegal immigrant who – while driving drunk and drag racing – hits and either seriously injures or kills an American citizen is not considered a priority for deportation? In fact, only after a floor speech, multiple letters, and hearing questions from Senators from Nebraska and Iowa, as well as media attention and concerns raised by the Root family, did ICE finally acknowledge that they should have taken Mejia into custody. It should not take all of those actions for ICE to determine that an illegal immigrant who kills an American citizen should be removed from our country. Tragically, after ICE declined to file a detainer against Mejia, he posted a $5,000 bond, was released, and has since disappeared. This despite the fact that he had a history of skipping court dates relating to prior driving offenses. A few weeks ago, I spoke with Sarah’s dad, who told me that before they could even lay their daughter to rest, Mejia was released. This is truly an injustice, and we must do everything we can to ensure that we get answers in this case and prevent a similar tragedy from being replicated elsewhere. While America has been and always will be a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws. It is a privilege to live in this country, and anyone who comes here illegally and harms our citizens should – without question – constitute a priority for removal. For ICE to decide otherwise is baffling. In recognition of their clear mistake, they have since listed Mejia on their “Most Wanted” list and acknowledged they should have taken him into custody. The photograph of Sarah behind me was taken as she celebrated her graduation from Bellevue University – with a 4.0 GPA and a Bachelor’s degree in Criminal Investigations – and prepared to begin a bright future. The next day, she was killed. While nothing can bring Sarah back, her family and friends deserve clear answers as to why Mejia was allowed to flee. This tragedy further underscores the Administration’s failed immigration enforcement priorities and should serve to spur renewed discussion about their so-called “priorities.” Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor. # # #
04.13.2016	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Agriculture Subcommittee, and U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) this week introduced the Agriculture Students Encourage, Acknowledge, Reward, Nurture (EARN) Act (S. 2774). The legislation amends the tax code to exclude from gross income the first $5,000 earned by students who are 18 years old or younger on agricultural projects completed under the supervision of 4-H or FFA. “For agriculture and our rural way of life to thrive, it is essential for a new generation of young people to return to rural America to live, work and raise their families,” Sen. Moran said. “Our policies, including the tax code, should encourage this goal by fostering student interest in pursuing a career in agriculture, and I’m proud to have Senator Ernst join me in introducing the Agriculture Students Earn Act.” “It is so important that we encourage our students to stay engaged in vocational and agricultural education programs, particularly as the demand for young farmers continues to grow. I’m proud to support the Agriculture Students EARN Act, which would promote our youth’s involvement in programs that serve as an introduction to careers in agriculture,” said Sen. Ernst, a former member of the 4-H. “Alleviating some of the tax burden these hardworking students face on the income they earn from 4-H or FFA projects is a step in the right direction to help bridge the generational gap, and ensure our youth is ready to take the reins when their time comes.” Agricultural projects completed by students under the supervision of 4-H clubs and FFA chapters may include showing animals at local and state fairs, growing and harvesting crops, building agricultural mechanic projects, and many other possibilities. The projects encourage personal growth and responsibility, while also providing the opportunity for students to generate modest revenues. The money earned by a student is often used to finance future agricultural projects, deposited in savings, or used to fund a college education. S. 2774 would protect students involved in 4-H and FFA and the money they earn from the IRS by lowering or eliminating the tax burden on the students. According to the latest agricultural census, the average age of the U.S. farmer is over 58 years old and trending upward. By lowering the tax burden on projects, S. 2774 would encourage more students to complete agricultural projects under 4-H and FFA. The hands-on experience that supervised agricultural projects provide aims to inspire a new generation of farmers and ranchers. Supporters of the legislation include National FFA Organization, National 4-H Council, American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers Union, and National Young Farmers Coalition. ###
04.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Sens. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), along with 12 additional senators today introduced the Detainee Transfer Transparency Act, legislation that would require the Secretary of Defense to make available to the public the intended transfer or release of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba at least 21 days in advance. Cosponsors at the time of introduction include Sens. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), James Lankford (R-Okla.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), John Thune (R-S.D.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). “The Detainee Transfer Transparency Act works to prevent the Obama administration from transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees onto U.S. soil and provides more public oversight on any agreements made with foreign nations,” said Ernst. “In addition, this legislation takes the necessary steps to combat President Obama’s misguided and reckless efforts to close Guantanamo Bay, prevents Cuba from gaining control of the facility, and increases overall transparency by ensuring any intended transfers to foreign nations are made public.” “By law, the administration is required to give Congress 30-days advance notice of the transfer or release of terrorists held at Guantanamo, but this information is kept classified, leaving our hands tied in warning the public of irresponsible and dangerous releases,” said Inhofe. “A terrorist's previous leadership ranking or active network hasn’t stopped President Obama from sending these individuals back to the fight, as we saw with the Taliban Five. If he is unashamedly trying to seal his legacy item to close Gitmo, then he should fully communicate to the public who these terrorists are and the justification for their release or the restrictions on their transfers. Not only should Americans be warned in advance of the administration’s intentions with these terrorists, but so should citizens of the countries in which the administration is sending these individuals. With 89 terrorists remaining in Gitmo, most of which have been labeled ‘too dangerous to release,’ my bill will give Americans a greater voice in how an administration is handling enemy combats while our country remains in a global war against terrorism.” “One of the most important things we can do is make sure we don’t release known terrorists who will return to the battlefield and kill more Americans,” said Barrasso. “More than a hundred terrorists that have been released have already returned to the battlefield. The terrorists who remain at Gitmo are the most dangerous terrorists there are. This bill will make sure the Obama administration is honest and up front with Americans on how and where they plan to release these terrorists in the future.” “The prisoners at Guantanamo Bay are hardened terrorists who seek to do us harm and their release puts our national security in jeopardy,” said Cotton. “If President Obama insists upon putting our national security at risk and closing Guantanamo Bay, the American people and our foreign partners deserve to have the resources and information they need to keep themselves safe." “Radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill Americans should not be transferred and allowed to continue their efforts, particularly behind the backs of American citizens,” said Cruz. “When the Obama administration intends to transfer terrorists to foreign countries, despite the repeated demonstration of their willingness to reengage in hostilities against the United States, the American people have every right to know who and why. The security of our people, not political expediency, should guide decisions regarding prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay. Ensuring that our national security interests are being protected is only prudent, and I am proud to stand with my colleagues in the Senate to stop this dangerous ploy.” “This bill closes an important loophole in the law. Under current law, before Guantanamo Bay detainees are been released, the American people are not informed of where the detainees will be sent, under what conditions, or what threat they will pose,” said Hatch. “This dangerous situation has led to numerous examples of detainees being sent to countries with uncertain security infrastructures, such as Uruguay and Senegal. Our legislation ensures the American people know exactly what the Obama administration is planning to do and affording them an opportunity to petition their elected representatives to prevent it.” “If the Obama administration is going to keep working to close Guantanamo Bay despite the dangers of doing so, Americans and innocent civilians around the world deserve to know the truth about who the detainees at this facility are and where they are being sent,” said Isakson. “By requiring the U.S. Secretary of Defense to make available to the public the intended transfer or release of detainees held at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility at least 21 days in advance, the Detainee Transfer Transparency Act will do just what it says. It will shed light on the information this administration has tried to keep from Americans who are concerned about the dangers posed by the release of these hardened terrorists.” “Maintaining our facilities at Guantanamo Bay and the ability to detain international terrorists is extremely important for our national security,” said Lankford. “This bill takes the additional important step of prohibiting President Obama from closing the facility. The bill prohibits any terrorists from being transferred to the United States and requires the Obama Administration to be transparent and provide public notice of any release of a terrorist to another country. Almost one in three terrorists released from Guantanamo Bay are confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight. My trip, last year, to Guantanamo Bay deepened my understanding of the need for this detention facility and the role it plays in our national security. We must not weaken our resolve to confront terrorism and protect American citizens.” “Unfortunately, this administration is putting politics ahead of our national security through their efforts to deplete the number of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and eventually fulfill a campaign promise of closing the facility altogether,” said Moran. “The White House should be transparent with Congress and the American people about the detainees they transfer to foreign countries and the risk they pose to our national security. The administration continues to look for ways to work around Congress in a misguided effort to close GITMO, and this bill would prohibit their ability to relinquish control of the facility to Cuba. I will continue fighting to keep these dangerous detainees at GITMO.” “The American people deserve to not only know when dangerous terrorists are being released from Guantanamo Bay, they also need to know what deals are being made with foreign countries to accept these people,” said Rounds. “The risk that these terrorists will return to the battlefield and kill Americans must take priority over the administration’s determination to fulfill a campaign promise. Additionally, the bill prohibits giving our strategically important base at Guantanamo Bay back to Cuba and would bar any terrorist detainees there from being transferred to prisons in the United States.” “The American public should have as much information as possible about the terrorist detainees the Obama Administration is seeking to release around the world,” said Rubio. “We know from Obama Administration officials that released detainees have gone on to kill Americans and routinely reengage in terrorist activities. By mindlessly adhering to his campaign promise to close the detention center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, President Obama is endangering America’s national security and burdening the U.S. intelligence community with the difficult challenge of tracking released detainees that shouldn’t be free in the first place.” “Detainees at Guantanamo Bay aren’t common criminals, they’re hardened terrorists who are intent on doing us harm,” said Thune. “Unfortunately, President Obama has chosen to put campaign promises above national security and continues to sidestep existing restrictions – that he signed into law – on the release or transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The president should not be playing politics with the security of the American people. We must not relent in our effort to protect Americans from threats posed by known terrorists being released to conduct further atrocities, which is why it’s so important we pass this common-sense legislation without delay.” “The Obama administration has previously released terrorists from Guantanamo who then returned to the battlefield to fight against America and our allies,” said Tillis. “The President is now determined to release more enemies of the United States, regardless of Congressional intent or the potential impact on our national security. This bill requires the administration to disclose information about these dangerous prisoners prior to their release or transfer, information that the American people deserve to know.” The Detainee Transfer Transparency Act would require the public notice from the Secretary of Defense to include: the name of the individual, the location to which the individual will be transferred or released, and the current and past risk profile of the individual. If the detainee is being transferred to another location, then the notice must also include a summary of the agreement made with that location and list actions being taken to mitigate the risk of another transfer or the release of the detainee. The legislation would also prohibit closure of Guantanamo Bay and prohibit the transfer of detainees to the United States. # # #
04.12.2016	Last week, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) introduced the Credit for Caring Act, which would provide up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit to working family caregivers for qualified expenses.

04.07.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA), Michael Bennet (D-CO), Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) today introduced the Credit for Caring Act, which would provide up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit to working family caregivers for qualified expenses. According to AARP, there are an estimated 40 million family caregivers in the United States, and 317,000 in Iowa. Most of these caregivers spend approximately 18 hours per week providing critical support to a family member. The bipartisan Credit for Caring Act recognizes the essential role that family caregivers play in supporting aging parents or grandparents, and family members with a long-term illness or disability. Importantly, these caregivers help folks needing care stay in their homes, rather than entering a nursing or long-term care facility. This tax credit helps alleviate some of the out of pocket financial expenses that caregivers often take on, all while balancing full or part-time employment. The credit would be available to family caregivers to provide some relief for the added costs caregivers incur, such as travel costs for transporting a loved one, home modifications to accommodate a family member’s special needs, medication management services, and more. “Family caregivers play an invaluable role in ensuring their loved ones have access to the support they need, from the comfort of their own home,” said Senator Ernst. “This role is not without challenges however, which is why the Credit for Caring Act is essential. As Iowans take on the added financial responsibilities of long-term care for their family members, our bipartisan tax credit proposal eases the difficulties working caregivers face, while providing their loved ones with quality care.” “Family caregivers in Colorado and around the country provide billions of hours of unpaid care to ensure that loved ones can perform daily activities and continue to live independently,” said Senator Bennet. “And as the population continues to age, the need for family care will only increase, adding to the physical, emotional, and financial stress on caregivers. This bipartisan tax credit will help family caregivers afford the costs of caring for a loved one.” “Family caregivers in New Hampshire and across the country help their loved ones who require caregiving assistance to stay at home, where they often prefer to be,” said Senator Ayotte. “As a co-founder of the Assisting Caregivers Today Caucus, I’m pleased to support this important legislation that will help ease the financial burden on caregivers and better support those who give so selflessly to their loved ones.” “More than 40 million Americans provide unpaid care to a friend or relative with a long-term illness or medical condition, often juggling this work with other obligations and spending a great deal of money providing this care,” said Senator Warren. “This modest tax credit will make life a little easier for the hardworking Americans who do the often-unacknowledged but powerfully important work of taking care of their loved ones in need.” “AARP is pleased to endorse the Credit for Caring Act and appreciates Senator Ernst’s bipartisan leadership to support family caregivers,” said AARP Anthony Carroll, AARP Iowa Associate State Director of Advocacy. “There are an estimated 317,000 family caregivers in Iowa who provide an estimated more than $3.8 billion annually in unpaid care to their adult loved ones. Family caregivers help their loved ones live independently in their homes and communities, saving taxpayer dollars by helping to delay or prevent more costly institutional care and helping to prevent unnecessary hospital readmissions. According to a 2015 study of 45+ registered voters in Iowa, 59 percent of family caregivers use their own money to provide care. We look forward to working with Senator Ernst and others to pass this bipartisan family caregiver tax credit in Congress to help address the financial realities of family caregivers in Iowa and across the country.” To ensure appropriate taxpayer protections are in place, this credit would also phase out at higher income levels and contains important provisions to prevent double dipping.The Credit for Caring Act is the companion to H.R. 4708 introduced by Congressman Tom Reed (R-NY) in March. About the Credit for Caring Act: Creates up to a $3,000 nonrefundable tax credit adjusted to inflation for family caregivers Applies to incurred family caregiving expenses greater than $2,000 Qualified care recipients must have been certified by a health care practitioner to be in need of long-term care for at least 180 consecutive days Eligibility is limited to a caregiver of a qualified care recipient who must pay for caregiving expenses and has earned income in excess of $7,500 Credit is phased out when income exceeds $150,000 for joint filers or $75,000 for individual filers Family Caregivers in Iowa: According to AARP, there are 317,000 family caregivers in Iowa at any given time during the year AARP also found that the unpaid contributions of family caregivers in Iowa are valued at $3.86 billion ###
04.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – During a Senate Agriculture Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy hearing today, Chairman Joni Ernst stressed the need to examine rural development programs and regulations to ensure they are effective and efficient. As Chairman Ernst noted in her opening remarks, “In continuing with my commitment to bring effective oversight of programs within the federal government, and as we begin preliminary discussions about the next Farm Bill, it is imperative we look at programs under my subcommittee’s jurisdiction to ensure that Congress is being an effective steward of the taxpayer’s money and that USDA is implementing programs as we intended.” In particular, Ernst asked the Iowa panelists whether federal regulations are impeding the development of rural areas and hampering industries that rural communities rely on, stressing “I came to the Senate committed to cutting pork and working through unnecessary and burdensome regulations, finding where we can get rid of those imposed upon our farmers and in our rural economies… What are those regulations and why do you see them as being an impediment to developing the rural areas?” Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President, Craig Hill explained: “When EPA, an agency of government, creates the uncertainty that they have with Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS), it has been something that has just stymied and crippled our farmers.” Click here or the image below to watch Mr. Hill’s full answer Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director, Monte Shaw said: “The proper implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) would be one area that would have a big boost.” Click here or the image below to watch Mr. Shaw’s full answer Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) stated, “Rural communities are the backbone of America, which makes today’s hearing an important one as this subcommittee conducts oversight of rural development programs. I’m pleased Senator Ernst has taken such an active role in the Agriculture Committee, and I commend her leadership in tackling the tough issues facing rural America.” Witnesses on both panels included The Honorable Lisa Mensah, Undersecretary of Rural Development for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); Mr. Craig Hill, President of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation; Mr. Monte Shaw, Executive Director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association; and Mr. Chris Sommerville, President of Dakota Turbines. TRANSCRIPT: SEN ERNST: Beyond my role today examining programs that are in existence through USDA Rural Development, I came to the Senate committed to cutting pork and working through unnecessary and burdensome regulations, finding where we can get rid of those imposed upon our farmers and in our rural economies. And if you could talk about any of those types of regulations, rules that exist out there that are hampering industry in our rural areas. What are those regulations and why do you see them as being an impediment to developing the rural areas? CRAIG HILL: I think speaking for farmers in general, we have an understanding of the rules of the game: conservation compliance, a component of the Farm Bill, through crop insurance and other mechanisms to provide ourselves with, or avail ourselves with any of the programs from USDA. We want to be compliant. We understand those rules, but when EPA, an agency of government, creates the uncertainty that they have with Waters of the U.S., it has been something that has just stymied and crippled our farmers. They don’t understand the rules and they ask for help, “What is the definition of the Waters of the U.S?,” and what features on their land would be permissible or not, what is jurisdictional or not, are unanswered, and there’s not an office in Iowa that can answer those because it’s Army Corps of Engineers that would produce that answer and there’s no office in Iowa. SEN. ERNST: Right. CRAIG HILL: So to implement and execute upon those new rules, new definitions that have never been created before by EPA, that don’t stand up to court decisions, and defy, actually, what Congress has set out through the Clean Water Act is just a very, very difficult thing for agriculture to accept. SEN. ERNST: And the way I understand that is the expanded definition of Waters of the U.S. would include what percent of Iowa? CRAIG HILL: You know, most experts would declare 97% of Iowa to be jurisdictional under the new rule, tributaries being the definition that was created that expands that authority across to nearly all of Iowa. And I would make a statement that it’s very disingenuous when it’s said by agencies of government that, for example, ditches are exempt. There is no definition for a ditch. There’s only definition for tributaries, which is a bed bank high water mark, wet or dry, intermittent or perennial, man-made, man-altered or natural. Which that includes everything that conveys water, but yet it’s said that “Oh no, agriculture is exempt, ditches are exempt,” but there’s no definition for a ditch, only a tributary. SEN. ERNST: Right. CRAIG HILL: Those kind of things are troubling and I would ask the committee to consider what actually Congress has established in the Clean Water Act rather than this agency. SEN. ERNST: Very good. Mr. Shaw or Mr. Sommerville, any thoughts on regulations that might be hampering industry in the rural areas? MONTE SHAW: Well, and I won’t belabor this because you’re well aware of it, but the problem of proper implementation of the Renewable Fuel Standard would be one area that would have a big boost. And I think we’ve seen that with the data I submitted in my prepared remarks. But also, there’s S. 1239 which is a bill to equalize the summertime vapor pressures of E-10 and E-15. We need to move to use more advanced biofuels and even more traditional biofuels, we need to get to higher blends of ethanol and the largest impediment to that is, despite a lot of roadblocks thrown up by some of the oil companies, the largest impediment to that is what I think was truly an unintentional regulatory difference between how we handle E-10 and E-15, which just ties retailers hands and they can’t sell the fuel. And if we could simply make that commonsense correction, I think you would see the move to higher blends become pretty rapid if E-15 became the new normal like E-10 is now, that would be 7 billion gallons of additional biofuels. That would spur an awful lot of rural economic development. SEN. ERNST: Very good. So not just the rules and regulations but making sure they’re being implemented correctly. MONTE SHAW: Absolutely. ###
04.06.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Nutrition, and Forestry Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy, today delivered the following opening remarks at the hearing on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rural development programs and their economic impact across America. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s opening remarks Click here to watch the hearing live. Senator Ernst’s Opening Remarks as Prepared for Delivery: Good morning. Thank you, Ranking Member Heitkamp for being here today. We do expect that we’ll have other members of the subcommittee coming in and out this morning as well, so I apologize for that. But, I call this hearing of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry’s Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy to order. I feel fortunate to be chairing this committee, considering my upbringing in rural America, and the critical role that Iowa plays in producing energy for the nation. Today, over half of Iowa’s 3 million residents live in rural communities. Each year I do a tour to our state’s 99 counties, and 75 of those counties have a population 25,000 or less. As I committed to do when I came to the Senate last year, I really do want to focus on the things that make sense, while working to streamline or even eliminate federal programs that foster bad behavior by both the government and people. I believe it is imperative that we focus on the causes of rural poverty and work to provide opportunities for folks to overcome obstacles that have created many of the problems we see throughout rural America. Lack of jobs and poor rural housing are just two examples I hear about while traveling throughout Iowa. Since the early 1900s, the federal government has administered various programs aiding communities in rural America. Today, the major agency tasked with carrying out the bulk of these programs is USDA’s Office of Rural Development. Created under the 1990 Farm Bill, the Office of Rural Development Administration’s main function is administering grants, loans and loan guarantees to support a number of services in rural communities; including the construction and maintenance of electric and telecommunications infrastructure, rural business development and retention, water and waste water treatment facilities, and rural housing. In continuing with my commitment to bring effective oversight of programs within the federal government, and as we begin preliminary discussions about the next Farm Bill, it is imperative we look at programs under my subcommittee’s jurisdiction to ensure that Congress is being an effective steward of the taxpayer’s money and that USDA is implementing programs as we intended. In Iowa, production agriculture takes the center stage as our state’s fertile soil and ideal growing conditions have allowed us to lead the country in production of pork, corn and soybeans. In addition to that, Iowa is proud to lead the nation in ethanol and biodiesel production. Many of the energy programs administered by USDA’s Rural Development help support Iowa’s biofuels industry, employing over 45,000 Iowans and nationwide contributing over $52 billion to annual GDP. Ms. Undersecretary, I look forward to hearing your testimony today and asking you some questions in regards to the state of USDA Rural Development. But before we hear from you, I want to turn things over to Ranking Member Heitkamp for any opening remarks. ###
04.04.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a co-sponsor of the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, today released the following statement following strong, bipartisan passage of the legislation: “Protecting trade secrets is an extremely important component to helping our American companies – including our farmers and agribusiness – keep a competitive edge in an increasingly globalized marketplace. “American agriculture, especially in Iowa, is a growing target for espionage as we continue to build on advancements in seed and crop sciences that increase the quality, quantity, and availability of a sustainable food supply. The fact that our technology is sought by competitors all around the globe underscores the importance of guarding against theft within our agriculture biotech industry. “With these concerns in mind, I’m pleased to support the Defend Trade Secrets Act. This legislation aims to help victims quickly cut through a web of legal and governmental bureaucracy to recover their losses. By creating a federal private right of action for the theft of trade secrets, this bipartisan proposal empowers our companies to retain their competitive advantage both here at home and abroad. “Furthermore, this is an important step toward ensuring our agriculture biotech sector remains a strong and growing industry, as well as freeing up these job creators to focus on innovation instead of trying to keep their proprietary technology out of the hands of thieves.” ###
03.31.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) today sent a letter to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to request that the agency provide Congress with a report on the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) regulations that create potential barriers to the participation of local pharmacies in federal drug take back programs. The letter comes on the heels of Senate passage of the bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), legislation to help local organizations and municipalities engage in the fight against the nationwide opioid epidemic. The Senators wrote, “We have heard from constituents in Iowa that a convenient place to return unwanted and unused controlled substances is to the same place they received them – their local pharmacy. However, some stakeholders have suggested that the regulations currently in place make it difficult and costly for retail pharmacies to participate in the program. Indeed, some of these same concerns were also raised in public comments provided to the DEA during the rulemaking process.” “We appreciate the challenge of creating new avenues to return unwanted and unused controlled substances, while at the same time guarding against the diversion of these drugs. However, we also want to ensure that compliance and participation costs do not act as a deterrent to pharmacies that want to voluntarily provide this important service to their communities,” the Senators continued, “As such, we respectfully request that GAO review the DEA’s regulations, stakeholder concerns with them, and participation rates in the program, and submit a report to Congress with recommendations on how Congress and the DEA can address existing regulatory barriers in order to expand the voluntary participation of retail pharmacies in this important program as much as possible.” In a recent op-ed, Senator Ernst stressed her commitment to ensuring that local pharmacies that wish to participate in the federal drug take back program are able to do so. She wrote, in part, “Based on feedback from Iowa pharmacists, I am working on a request to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a thorough review of the program and report to Congress with recommendations to address the barriers to participation that local pharmacies face. These recommendations will help us to find appropriate ways to maximize participation in the program and ensure that this important service to the community is widely available.” As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Senator Grassley led the Senate to overwhelming passage of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. Prior to that, he led the bill through the Judiciary Committee. The Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America recognized that without his leadership, the bill would not have passed the Senate. In addition, Senator Grassley successfully urged the Obama Administration to re-instate the DEA’s highly effective prescription drugs take back days, which it had discontinued. Grassley was an original cosponsor of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act, which initiated take back days and encouraged communities to establish programs to collect unused medications year-round. The full text of the letter can be found here and below. March 31, 2016 The Honorable Gene DodaroComptroller General of the United StatesGovernment Accountability Office441 G Street N.W.Washington, D.C. 20548 Dear Mr. Dodaro: We are writing to request that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provide Congress with a report on the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) regulations related to the secure disposal of controlled substances by registrants and ultimate users, and potential barriers to participation by retail pharmacies. Prior to the enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (“Disposal Act”), the Controlled Substances Act only permitted the ultimate users of controlled substances themselves to destroy any unused substances, and they were unable to return unused substances to a pharmacy, hospital, or other health care provider. In 2010, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Disposal Act[1] to amend the Controlled Substances Act to authorize ultimate users to deliver their pharmaceutical controlled substances to another person for the purpose of disposal in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Attorney General. Pursuant to the Disposal Act, the DEA promulgated rules to implement the Act and outline how certain entities may voluntarily collect unused controlled substances at a DEA-registered location. We have heard from constituents in Iowa that a convenient place to return unwanted and unused controlled substances is to the same place they received them – their local pharmacy. However, some stakeholders have suggested that the regulations currently in place make it difficult and costly for retail pharmacies to participate in the program. Indeed, some of these same concerns were also raised in public comments provided to the DEA during the rulemaking process. We appreciate the challenge of creating new avenues to return unwanted and unused controlled substances, while at the same time guarding against the diversion of these drugs. However, we also want to ensure that compliance and participation costs do not act as a deterrent to pharmacies that want to voluntarily provide this important service to their communities. As such, we respectfully request that GAO review the DEA’s regulations, stakeholder concerns with them, and participation rates in the program, and submit a report to Congress with recommendations on how Congress and the DEA can address existing regulatory barriers in order to expand the voluntary participation of retail pharmacies in this important program as much as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have any questions, please reach out to Danielle Janowski or Taryn Frideres of Senator Ernst’s staff at (202) 224-3254 or David Bleich of Senator Grassley’s staff at (202) 228-0927. Sincerely, Charles E. Grassley Joni K. Ernst Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee United States Senator [1] Public Law No. 111-273 ###
03.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators from Iowa and Nebraska are demanding an explanation for why the Obama Administration didn’t detain an undocumented immigrant charged in an Omaha drunk driving incident that led to the death of a young Iowan. Senators Chuck Grassley, Deb Fischer, Joni Ernst and Ben Sasse are not satisfied with a top immigration official’s claims that the driver did not meet the agency’s enforcement priorities because the victim had not yet died from her injuries at the time it was contacted. Eswin Mejia, 19, was drag racing with a blood-alcohol level three times the legal limit when his vehicle collided with that of 21-year-old Sarah Root on January 31. Despite repeated requests by Omaha law enforcement, and the fact that Mejia had a history of skipping court dates, Immigration and Customs Enforcement refused to issue a detainer for Mejia, who was released on bond on February 5. Mejia failed to report to his subsequent court hearing and remains at large. “We are baffled by your testimony that when drunk driving results in serious injury it may not be an enforcement priority, but when it results in death it is,” the Senators wrote in a letter to ICE Assistant Secretary Sarah Saldaña. “We would appreciate a full explanation as to why [Mejia] would be an enforcement priority today, but was not an enforcement priority on February 5, 2016, when – as we understand it – ICE had all of the same information then that it does now.” The Senators’ letter follows a recent Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, in which Saldaña testified that Mejia was not detained by immigration officials because the agency didn’t have enough time to respond and that Root was injured – not dead – when she claims ICE was first notified. The Senators are now calling on ICE to provide a full timeline of its involvement in the case, any records related to Mejia, and clear explanations for how ICE arrived at its decision not to detain Mejia. Text of the Senators’ letter follows: March 24, 2016 The Honorable Sarah SaldañaAssistant SecretaryU.S. Immigration and Customs EnforcementDepartment of Homeland SecurityWashington, D.C. 20528 Dear Assistant Secretary Saldaña: We write to express concern and follow up on your March 15, 2016 testimony before the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. At that hearing, you responded to questions from Senators Sasse and Ernst about the death of Iowan Sarah Root, who was recently killed by a drunk driver in Omaha, Nebraska. While the facts of the case remain elusive following your testimony, we are frustrated by (1) your agency’s determination that Eswin Mejia – an illegal immigrant and the drunk driver who killed Sarah Root – did not meet ICE’s enforcement priorities, and (2) your attempt to explain that determination. In response to a question by Senator Sasse during the course of the hearing, you asserted a number of reasons for why ICE officials neglected to lodge a detainer on Mejia. First, you suggested that ICE officials simply did not have time, stating that ICE only had a matter of hours – specifically, four hours – between the time the agency was contacted and the time Mejia was to be released. Second, after acknowledging that ICE officials have discretion on a case-by-case basis to issue detainers for illegal immigrants believed to be a threat to public safety, you suggested that perhaps the ICE official making the decision made an unfortunate error in judgment. Finally – and most egregiously – you suggested that ICE neglected to issue a detainer because at the time they were contacted, Sarah Root was seriously injured but had not yet died. We’re especially troubled that you told the committee Mejia was not considered to be an enforcement priority because Sarah Root had not yet died. Not only was this not true – media reports at the time indicated that Sarah Root died before ICE was ever contacted – we cannot understand how Sarah Root’s condition should have had any impact on ICE’s evaluation of Eswin Mejia’s threat to public safety. Mejia crashed into Sarah Root’s car while drag racing drunk at 19-years-old with no valid driver’s license and two prior driving offenses – something you told the committee made him a clear threat to public safety. He was also a flight risk with a history of skipping court dates relating to his driving offenses. We are baffled by your testimony that when drunk driving results in serious injury it may not be an enforcement priority, but when it results in death it is. What is more, we remain concerned that drunk driving – regardless of whether it results in a serious injury or death – would not appear to be an enforcement priority at all if charged as a misdemeanor rather than a felony, especially given Mejia’s legal history. In response to questions from Senator Ernst, you then said Mejia would “absolutely” be an enforcement priority if apprehended today. As addressed in our questions below, we would appreciate a full explanation as to why he would be an enforcement priority today, but was not an enforcement priority on February 5, 2016, when – as we understand it – ICE had all of the same information then that it does now. Finally, we are concerned that, according to Sarah Root’s family, there had been no attempt by ICE to contact them until after Chairman Grassley delivered a speech on this case on March 14, 2016, and Senators Sasse and Ernst raised the issue to you directly during the March 15, 2016 hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. As you know, Sarah Root died on January 31, 2016, and Mejia posted bail and was released on February 5, 2016. The Omaha Police Department then contacted ICE on February 10, 2016, after Mejia failed to make himself available for a blood alcohol test. It is unclear why ICE took more than one month to reach out to the Root family about the circumstances and whereabouts of Eswin Mejia. Accordingly, we request that you respond to us no later than April 6, 2016, concerning the following: 1. Any document providing a timeline of your agency’s involvement with this case, including the dates and times of the agency’s communications with the Omaha Police or the Douglas County Jail, and the content of those communications. 2. Any document, including emails, voice mail messages, reports, memoranda, or alerts, related to Eswin Mejia or Edwin Mejia. 3. A clear explanation of the reason ICE officials determined that Mejia was not an enforcement priority. 4. A clear explanation of why Mejia, if apprehended today, would “absolutely” be an enforcement priority. 5. Whether you retract any statements you made during the March 15, 2016 hearing before the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 6. An explanation of ICE’s policy with respect to communicating with the victims or the families of the victims of crimes committed by illegal immigrants who ICE refuses to take into custody, and any information regarding the agency’s attempt to contact the Root family. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter and look forward to your response. Sincerely, Charles E. GrassleyUnited States Senator Joni K.

03.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), ranking member of the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, today led a bipartisan letter co-signed by U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Joni Ernst (R-IA) – members of the Senate Agriculture Committee – calling on the U.S. Department of the Treasury to review China National Chemical Corporation’s (ChemChina) proposed acquisition of Syngenta for any potential effects on U.S. national security and the American food system. “While this Committee has not reached any conclusions regarding the proposed purchase of Syngenta by ChemChina, we believe that any foreign acquisition of an important U.S. agricultural asset should be reviewed closely for potential risks to our food system,” the Senators said. “It is not unreasonable to suggest that shifts in company governance; operational strategy; or financial health—particularly in light of the magnitude of this leveraged transaction—could have consequences for food security, food safety, biosecurity, and the highly competitive U.S. farm sector as a whole.” Pointing to growing investment from abroad in U.S. agriculture, the Senators also urged Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to include both the United States Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) when reviewing foreign acquisitions of major U.S. agriculture assets. The full text of the letter to Treasury follows. Dear Secretary Lew: As members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, we write to you regarding China National Chemical Corporation’s (ChemChina) proposed acquisition of Syngenta, a Switzerland-based crop protection and seed company with significant operations in the United States. Despite the two companies reported intent to voluntarily file for review with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), chaired by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, we respectfully request that CFIUS exercise its authority to review this transaction to assess any potential ramifications the purchase may have for American national security, with a specific focus on the potential effects on food security and the safety of our food system. There is shared sentiment among lawmakers, military officials, and everyday Americans that protecting the safety and resiliency of our food system is core to American national security. Notwithstanding this widely held conviction, the composition of the CFIUS today does not include representation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as formal components of its process for reviewing foreign investments in critical American assets, including agricultural assets. Constituents have approached us with concerns over this transaction, citing the 2013 CFIUS review of the Shuanghui-Smithfield acquisition. The most common reflection on that experience is that growing foreign investment in U.S. agriculture—and the prognosis of more to come—should be met with a careful review process that captures the issues most relevant to safeguarding the American food system going forward. To that end, we believe that it is imperative that both the USDA and the FDA be included in the CFIUS for purposes of reviewing and making decisions on this proposed acquisition by ChemChina. While this Committee has not reached any conclusions regarding the proposed purchase of Syngenta by ChemChina, we believe that any foreign acquisition of an important U.S. agricultural asset should be reviewed closely for potential risks to our food system. It is not unreasonable to suggest that shifts in company governance; operational strategy; or financial health—particularly in light of the magnitude of this leveraged transaction—could have consequences for food security, food safety, biosecurity, and the highly competitive U.S. farm sector as a whole. The risk of negative outcomes is heightened to the extent that an acquired U.S. agricultural asset becomes in some part governed by a foreign government with clear strategic interests. In fact, the potential for unpredictable behavior from global farm sector participants is a great challenge for the United States as the importance of trade to American agriculture continues to grow and food systems become more integrated. For instance, nonmarket behavior due to state-ownership could lead to inconsistent or seemingly arbitrary treatment of U.S. farm products in key export markets, particularly when company governance includes governments of countries with which the United States exchanges a high volume of trade. We support the mission of CFIUS to safeguard our national security. At the same time, it is important that the tools and processes used to review foreign investments in critical U.S. assets accurately reflect the full range of national security challenges our country faces today and in the future. Thank you for your consideration of our request and views on this important matter. ###

03.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee released the following statement regarding the terrorist attacks in Brussels: “Once again, we are confronted with devastating news of yet another terrorist attack on one of our allies. This terrorist attack targeting the Belgian people and the de facto capital of the European Union is a tragic event. We must do all we can to leverage our intelligence capabilities and counterterrorism tools to assist our European partners to prevent further attacks on the West. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families, the Belgian people, and all of Europe as they continue to live under the threat of terrorist attacks. “We must stand united in the fight against terrorism and strengthen our efforts to preserve and protect our liberties and our way of life. We must take up an AUMF to give President Obama every authority to destroy ISIS. Now is the time for all Americans to stand up and show our support for our Belgian allies, the cause of freedom, and for those men and women who confront terrorism on a daily basis to help prevent horrifying attacks from happening again.” Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces. The following information was released by the U.S. Embassy Brussels, Belgium: Security Message for U.S. Citizens: Preliminary reports indicate one or more explosive devices have gone off at Zaventem Airport and Maelbeek metro.

03.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today applauded passage of U.S. Representative Martha McSally’s (R-AZ) legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives to reinstate the Women Airforce Service Pilots’ (WASPs) right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors. “The Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II were trailblazers and forged the way for women serving in today’s military forces. These women served our nation with great honor – and put their lives on the line. If the Pentagon won’t act to restore the WASP’s right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with military honors, we will. I’m thrilled that the House passed this legislation, and moved us one step closer toward achieving that goal. It is my hope that the Senate will act quickly, followed by the president, so we can restore this right,” said Senator Ernst. Click here to read the statement from Representative McSally. In January, Senator Ernst helped introduce bipartisan legislation with Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) to restore the inurnment rights. A recent policy change made by the Army now prevents WASPs, who flew domestic military missions during World War II, from being inurned at Arlington. Last week, Senator Ernst led a bipartisan, bicameral press conference with Representative McSally to call on the Army to reinstate the WASPs at Arlington. As the Iowa Senator noted, “Iowa was at one time or another, home to at least 25 courageous WASPs.” Following the press conference, Senator Ernst pressed Defense Secretary Ash Carter on this issue, noting “…it is a travesty that these women, who are pioneers in military aviation, had the honor of having their ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery revoked last year, during the same year that historically you opened up positions that had been previously closed in combat to women.” ###
03.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed Defense Secretary Ash Carter on the need to restore the rights of Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) to be inurned at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). “Yesterday, I joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers to advocate for some incredible women, who really do deserve to be honored: they are the Women Airforce Service Pilots, otherwise known as WASPs. “And Secretary—you know where I’m going with this—it is a travesty that these women, who are pioneers in military aviation, had the honor of having their ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery revoked last year, during the same year that historically you opened up positions that had been previously closed in combat to women. “So I would like to see that addressed, and the Pentagon should do the right thing and honor these women by restoring their rights to have their ashes inurned at the National Cemetery. And it’s my understanding that a waiver could be done for these women to do so. So I would encourage you to do so and I’d like to see that action taken. They are a part of America’s greatest generation as well.” Click here or the image below to watch the video.

In January, Senator Ernst helped introduce bipartisan legislation to reinstate these inurnment rights. A recent policy change made by the Army now prevents WASPs, who flew domestic military missions during World War II, from being inurned at ANC. ICYMI: Coverage from the WASP Press Conference: KCCI-TV (VIDEO): “Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is fighting to allow women who served in the Women Airforce Service Pilots also known as WASPs into Arlington National Cemetery.” Yahoo News with Katie Couric (VIDEO): “They were known as WASPs, Women Airforce Service Pilots. During World War II, between 1942 and 1944, about 1,100 women volunteered to fly military planes here in the United States. Today, a new battle is being waged for these veterans of war. Despite the important role they played, the women pilots have never been awarded full Army status and therefore cannot be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. They were granted retroactive veteran status in 1977 but never received the full military benefits needed for the right to be interred at Arlington. A bipartisan group of lawmakers is looking to change that for good. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., are holding a press conference today to draw attention to legislation that would allow for WASPs to be interred at Arlington.” KCRG (VIDEO): “’I do think that it is ironic that the military is opening all avenues, combat roles for women, yet they're turning their backs on these women pioneers,’ said Ernst.” KMTV-TV (VIDEO): “Senator Ernst said at least 25 Iowans served as WASPs including one, Madelyn Taylor Eggleston from her hometown of Red Oak.” The Hill: “’I was fortunate to have extraordinary trailblazers in these women,’ said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), a retired Army National Guard lieutenant colonel and the first female combat veteran in the Senate. ‘We must move forward, and not backwards. And the Pentagon should do the right thing and join us in honoring these women and restore their right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with full honors,’ said Ernst, an original bill co-sponsor.” Military Times: “Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa — who with McSally is one of four Iraq War veterans in Congress — has offered similar legislation in the Senate. ‘There is no doubt these women are heroes,’ she said. ‘The Pentagon should do the right thing and honor these women.’” Roll Call: “McSally was joined by Sens.

03.18.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In response to recent ballistic missile tests by Iran, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) co-sponsored legislation introduced by Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) to impose tough primary and secondary sanctions on every sector of the Iranian economy that directly or indirectly supports Iran’s ballistic missile program. Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mark Kirk (R-IL), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) helped lead the introduction of the Iran Ballistic Missile Sanctions Act of 2016, which is also being cosponsored by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), James Risch (R-ID), and Ted Cruz (R-TX). The bill introduction coincides with the release today of a new report by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies that demonstrates the need for Ayotte’s legislation. “I have repeatedly called on the administration to impose tough sanctions against Iran for its illicit and dangerous ballistic missile activities. That administration has failed to do so, and the potential danger to our homeland, as well as the urgent threat to our forward deployed troops and our allies like Israel, is only growing. That is why today I have led an effort in the senate to introduce legislation that would require the administration to impose tough, hard-hitting primary and secondary sanctions on every sector of the Iranian economy that supports Tehran’s ballistic missile programs,” said Senator Ayotte. “Tough words alone will not deter the world’s worst state sponsor of terrorism from continuing to develop its ballistic missile program, and I call on my colleagues in Congress, as well as the administration, to pass this legislation and impose without delay the strongest possible sanctions in order to hold Tehran accountable.” “Iran is the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism and continues to align themselves with groups around the world who threaten our security and national interests,” said Senator Ernst, “The administration has cut deals with Iran despite their participation in these dangerous programs. I am glad to join my Senate colleagues in demanding that we implement strict sanctions on every sector of the Iranian economy that relates to their ballistic missile program.” In January 2016, the administration imposed limited sanctions on Iran for firing ballistic missiles in October and November of 2015. Ayotte called those administration sanctions “tepid” and “weak”. Iran continues to develop its ballistic missile program and at the beginning of March 2016, again test-fired several ballistic missiles. Yesterday, during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter agreed that more sanctions should be imposed on Iran for its ballistic missile activities. In his prepared testimony for yesterday’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Joseph F. Dunford, Jr. stated that Iran is the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East and North Africa, expressed concern about Iran’s ballistic missile programs, and said Tehran’s “ballistic missile force can hold key regional U.S infrastructure at risk.” He also noted that Tehran has “made significant strides in its missile development programs since 2009,” and warned that Tehran’s space launch vehicle–if configured as a ballistic missile–would be capable of reaching the United States. On February 9, 2016, James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, testified that, “We judge that Tehran would choose ballistic missiles as its preferred method of delivering nuclear weapons, if it builds them. Iran’s ballistic missiles are inherently capable of delivering WMD, and Tehran already has the largest inventory of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. Iran’s progress on space launch vehicles—along with its desire to deter the United States and its allies—provides Tehran with the means and motivation to develop longer-range missiles, including ICBMs.” Since 2011, Ayotte has led efforts in the Senate to counter Iran's ballistic missile program, which represents a major threat to our forward deployed troops, regional allies like Israel, and potentially our homeland. In brief, the Iran Ballistic Missile Sanctions Act of 2016: (1) imposes new sanctions against persons that knowingly aid Iran’s ballistic missile program; (2) requires new sanctions against entities owned 25 percent or greater or controlled by Iran’s key ballistic missile organizations (the Aerospace Industries Organization, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group, or the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group); (3) requires a Presidential certification that persons listed in UN Security Council Resolutions are not engaged in activities related to ballistic missiles and requires the imposition of sanctions if that certification cannot be made; and (4) imposes sanctions on persons involved in sectors of Iran’s economy that support, directly or indirectly, Iran’s ballistic program. ###
03.17.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued a statement after voting in support of S.Res.377, the Backpage.com Civil Contempt Resolution. This legislation directs the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce the subpoena issued by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (“PSI”) to the CEO of Backpage.com, a website that has been under investigation for nearly a year due to its reported links to human trafficking. “As a mother, grandmother, and someone who has volunteered at a women's crisis shelter, I firmly believe we must do everything within our power to end human trafficking. “Today’s legislation gives us the chance to do something about Backpage.com’s reported connection to human trafficking and their refusal to cooperate with Senate investigations. “We have seen the harmful impact Backpage.com has had in Iowa, specifically through the facilitation of sex trafficking. We simply cannot stand by and allow more people to fall victim to these heinous crimes. We must act, which is why today the Senate is moving forward to direct the Senate Legal Counsel to take legal action against Backpage.com to enforce PSI’s subpoena.” About the Backpage.com Subpoena: In the course of its investigation of sex trafficking on the internet, the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs’ (HSGAC) Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) issued a subpoena for documents to Carl Ferrer, CEO of Backpage.com – the website has been linked to hundreds of human trafficking cases. Mr. Ferrer’s attorney cited legal objections in response to the subpoena, and therefore, has yet to comply. In February, HSGAC reported out S.Res.377 to the full Senate by a unanimous vote. S.Res.377 directs the Senate Legal Counsel to bring a civil action to enforce the subpoena of the PSI to Carl Ferrer, CEO of Backpage.com. This will be the first action to enforce a Senate subpoena in over twenty years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has reported an over 800 percent increase in reports of suspected child sex trafficking in the last five years. The Center has also reported that a majority of the tips it receives about child sex trafficking cases involve ads posted on Backpage.com. ###
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today held a bipartisan, bicameral press conference, along with U.S. Representatives Martha McSally (R-AZ), Susan Davis (D-CA) and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), along with other members of Congress, to call on the Army to reinstate the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). A recent policy change made by the Army now prevents WASPs, who flew domestic military missions during World War II, from being inurned at ANC. The lawmakers were also joined by family members of Elaine Harmon, a former WASP who has been denied inurnment at ANC, as well as a representative from Change.org. The press conference follows the Iowa Senator’s introduction of bipartisan legislation to reinstate these inurnment rights. Click here or the image below to watch the video. Senator Ernst’s remarks begin at the 2:45 mark. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you so much and thanks to all of you for joining us today. This is an important issue and I’d like to start by thanking Congresswoman Martha McSally. Thank you so much for leading this effort. She is a combat pilot so this has a very significant meaning for her, but also to the rest of us that are veterans. I’d also like to thank the members from Elaine Harmon’s family. Thank you for being here today and thanks for being such great advocates. And from Change.org as well because they’ve really led the charge and allowed our voices to be heard on this issue. You know, more than two decades have gone by since I was able to join the military, and I was fortunate to have some extraordinary trailblazers from these women that allowed me to forge ahead as a woman serving in today’s military forces. But we’re here to advocate for some of these incredible women, who deserve to be honored. There is no doubt in my mind that they are heroes: the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or those that we know as WASPs. These women flew military aircrafts under the orders of the United States Army Air Forces. They served in non-combat capacities and this allowed their male pilots to go to combat during WWII. Now, these courageous WASPs are being denied what was once their right to have their ashes inurned at Arlington National Cemetery, with full military honors. Iowa was at one time or another, home to at least 25 WASPs, including one special lady, Madelyn Taylor Eggleston, who is from my hometown of Red Oak, Iowa. And some women died while they were in training and in service to our nation. Beverly Jean Moses was born in Des Moines, Iowa and died during a training mission. Gleanna Roberts grew up near Iowa City and she also died in a training crash. These women served our nation with great honor – and put their lives on the line. We must move forward, not backwards. The Pentagon should do the right thing and join us in honoring these women, and restore their right to have their ashes placed at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. If they won’t do the right thing, then those of us here today will ensure that we do the right thing. ###
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement regarding President Obama’s hand-picked nomination to the United States Supreme Court: “In the midst of a critical election, the American people deserve to have a say in this important decision that will impact the course of our country for years to come. “This is not about any particular nominee; rather this is about giving the American people a voice. Folks are frustrated with Washington, and are fed up with President Obama’s failed policies and endless power grabs. We saw this frustration embodied in 2014 when voters made their voices heard and elected a Republican majority in the Senate. “My Democratic colleagues have noted in previous years that nowhere in the Constitution does it state that the Senate must vote on the president’s nominee to the Supreme Court. I support Senator Grassley’s decision to exercise the Senate’s constitutional authority to withhold consent to a Supreme Court nomination until the next president is sworn in. “We must wait to see what the people say this November, and then our next president will put forward a nominee.” ###
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in support of the bipartisan Biotechnology Labeling Solutions bill: “Americans today spend less of our disposable income on food than every other country around the globe, and we must not take this for granted. In fact, a recent study showed that the potential impact of mandatory state labeling laws could raise the cost of food for the average family by over $1,000 per year. Those demanding this mandatory state level labeling must be mindful of the middle and low income folks just trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck. Additionally, our companies that are forced to comply with inconsistent food labeling would add unnecessary costs to their operations and ultimately raise the price for consumers. “It’s imperative we stop the state-by-state patchwork approach to food labeling laws to prevent consumer confusion and avoid additional costs at the grocery store. While this is not a perfect bill, it’s an important step forward to mitigate the impact on hardworking families in Iowa and nationwide. “The bipartisan Biotechnology Labeling Solutions bill would have taken the initial steps to create a national solution and preempt state level efforts to mandate the labeling of food products that contain ingredients derived from biotechnology. While I am disappointed this legislation did not move forward today, I will not stand by and allow this state level forced labeling to continue which would disparage food production practices that are proven to be safe, and increase food costs for families that can least afford it.” Senator Ernst previously supported Committee Chairman Pat Roberts’ (R-KS) Biotechnology Labeling Solutions bill at a Senate Agriculture Committee markup. The legislation passed out of committee with bipartisan support. ###
03.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) are introducing legislation to name a Cedar Rapids post office in honor of Sergeant First Class (SFC) Terryl L. Pasker, an Iowa National Guardsman who was killed in action in Afghanistan on July 9, 2011. Specifically, the bill would designate the facility of the United States Postal Services located at 615 6th Avenue SE in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, as the “Sergeant First Class Terryl L. Pasker Post Office Building”. “When our country called on him to serve, Sergeant First Class Terryl Pasker made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedoms,” said Senator Ernst. “While we will never be able to say ‘thank you’ enough to SFC Pasker and his family, this post office would honor his legacy and serve as a symbol throughout the community of his unwavering heroism.” “Sergeant First Class Terryl Pasker served our country and lost his life on our behalf,” said Senator Grassley. “In turn, we should honor his service in every possible way, including the recognition of a community fixture named for him.” This is the Senate companion to Representative Rod Blum’s (R-IA) bill, cosponsored alongside Iowa Representatives Dave Loebsack (D-IA), David Young (R-IA) and Steve King (R-IA). SFC Terryl L. Pasker was born in Anamosa, Iowa, enlisted in the US Army in 1990, and joined the Iowa National Guard in 1995. While serving in the Guard, he deployed to Afghanistan from 2004, and again in 2011 with the 334th Brigade Support Battalion, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. SFC Pasker gave the ultimate sacrifice to his county when he was killed in a green-on-blue attack in Panjshir Province, Afghanistan on July 9, 2011, near the end of his tour. SFC Pasker was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart. He is survived by his wife, Erica; parents, Mary and David; brother, Andrew, and two sisters, Christine and Rebecca.

03.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), which passed the Senate today with strong bipartisan support: “Opioid abuse is a tragic epidemic across the country that tears apart families, devastates our communities, and causes unnecessary loss of precious life. Like many Iowans, I am gravely concerned about the increase in the abuse of both prescription and illicit drugs like heroin. “Equipping local law enforcement, health care stakeholders, and other key groups in the community with the tools they need to improve communication and coordination in the fight against opioid abuse is critical. “The bipartisan Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, guided through the Senate by Senator Chuck Grassley, aims to do just that. This legislation promotes programs to help increase education and prevention efforts, as well as offers opportunities to train first responders in using drugs to reverse an opioid overdose. It also provides critical treatment and recovery options for individuals suffering from addiction. “I’m pleased with today’s important step in combating this terrible problem, and I urge the president to sign CARA into law as soon as possible.” Iowa Drug Abuse Statistics: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 264 people in Iowa died of drug overdoses in 2014. In 2014, 1 out of every 11,000 deaths could be traced to drug overdoses in Iowa. According to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), a total of 94,000 Iowans used prescription pain medications for non-medical purposes in 2014, including 10,000 youth (ages 12-17). In 2014, 52,000 Iowa residents needed treatment for illegal drug use but failed to receive it, including 7,000 youth (ages 12-17). In 2014, the Iowa Department of Public Health reported 1,555 opioid-related emergency department visits compared to 519 in 2006. ###
03.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following the recent announcement that U.S. special operations forces conducted a raid which resulted in the capture of an Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) leader, Senator Joni Ernst today joined Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) and 13 fellow Senators in introducing a resolution to detain ISIS fighters at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Additional cosponsors of the resolution include Senators Jerry Moran (R-KS), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), John Boozman (R-AR), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Tim Scott (R-SC) and David Vitter (R-LA). As the United States continues to conduct combat operations against ISIS, U.S. forces are likely to continue capturing terrorists. Guantanamo Bay was established to house individuals who engaged in, aided, abetted or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism and should be utilized as such as our nation faces a continued threat of terrorism. “Last week when I was at Guantanamo Bay I saw plenty of vacant cells,” Senator Daines stated. “Terrorists captured by U.S. forces belong in Guantanamo, a location that has played a pivotal role for collecting intelligence from detainees and keeping terrorists off the battlefield in the global war on terror. These dangerous individuals do not belong on U.S. soil, or in the custody of a nation that may allow them to return to the battlefield as we have seen before. We must ensure they don’t continue to spread radical Islam throughout the world, and Guantanamo Bay serves an integral purpose for just that.” “My recent visit to Guantanamo Bay reaffirmed my belief that it is the best place to detain individuals who wish to do our nation harm,” Senator Moran stated. “The detention facility is a place to counter the serious national security threats we face across the globe. Captured militants affiliated with ISIL and other terrorist groups are dangerous and should be held at Guantanamo Bay, not in Kansas or anywhere else in the United States.” “My recent trip to Guantanamo Bay not only confirmed that the detainees should remain there, but also that this facility is tailor-made for enemy combatants,” Senator Gardner stated. “At a time when the Obama Administration lacks a coherent strategy to defeat ISIL, it’s more important now than ever that we use all the tools at our disposal to fight terrorism. Instead of closing Guantanamo Bay, the Administration should transfer detained ISIL fighters to the facility. This resolution paves the way to do just that, while preventing grants of new rights to terrorists.” “Guantanamo Bay is a first-rate detention facility that’s kept terrorists off the battlefield, provided valuable intelligence, and made America safer,” Senator Cotton stated. “President Obama needs to recognize this and begin sending dangerous Islamic State terrorists to Gitmo. Just yesterday, the New York Times reported that an Islamic State terrorist with expertise in chemical weapons was in the custody of U.S. Special Forces. That terrorist should be sent immediately to Guantanamo Bay for detention and interrogation, and not read his Miranda rights or turned over to another nation. Our priority should be stopping terrorists, not providing them with constitutional rights that rightfully belong to the American people they are trying to kill.” “There should be no confusion in the minds of our enemies that, if captured, they will be sent to the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay to be interrogated,” Senator Rubio stated. “More than seven years in, the Obama administration still does not have a coherent detention policy that will give our military and intelligence community the best opportunity to extract valuable intelligence to help defeat ISIS, Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. This White House would rather release terrorists from Guantanamo Bay and hope for the best. We know recidivism rates are rising as released terrorists return to the fight. This resolution makes it clear what our policy should be.” “With tens of thousands of fighters and the capability to make false passports for infiltrating refugee flows into Europe and the United States, ISIS poses a clear danger to American citizens,” Senator Kirk stated. “No other facility can house terrorists as securely as Guantanamo, which is where we should be sending ISIS terrorists when they are captured by our brave servicemen and servicewomen in the field." “Jihadists who seek to kill Americans should not be brought to American soil. The security of our people, not political expediency, should guide decisions regarding prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay,” Senator Cruz stated. “Ensuring that our national security interests are being protected is only prudent, and Congress should step up and exercise its constitutional authority and detain ISIS fighters at Guantanamo Bay.” “For years, the Obama administration’s single-minded focus on fulfilling a campaign promise to close Guantanamo has hindered the fight against our terrorist enemies,” Senator Hatch stated. “Our facilities at Guantanamo offer a secure, lawful, and humane option for detaining terrorists, and the administration’s misguided ideological agenda should not foreclose its continued use. As we continue combat operations against the Islamic State, the Senate should again make it clear that Guantanamo and other facilities abroad offer the best alternatives for holding terrorists and collecting vital intelligence from them.” “Guantanamo Bay, and the servicemembers at the detention facility, serve an important mission to protect our nation from some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists,” Senator Ernst stated. “We should detain ISIS terrorists at Guantanamo as we cannot afford to release them into Iraqi custody and risk that these terrorists will end up right back on the battlefield. At this time of growing threats, we must work to preserve our operations at this detention facility which is central to our national security interests.” “Our number one priority should be keeping our homeland safe and secure from the threat of radical terrorists, including those from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant,” Senator Isakson stated. “Unfortunately, the president appears more focused on releasing terrorists to fulfill his political promise to close Guantanamo Bay prison than on going after the very terrorists he should be sending there. We must continue to utilize this critical detention facility in the fight against global terrorism. We must keep those who wish to do us harm off the battlefield and, especially off of American soil.” “Closing Gitmo and transferring detainees to American soil creates needless national security risks and poses unnecessary threats to American citizens,” Senator Boozman stated. “The state-of-the-art facility is more than serving its purpose for detaining the worst of the worst, obtaining valuable intelligence from them and keeping these terrorists who are bent on destroying America from returning to the battlefield. As the threat posed by ISIL grows, Gitmo remains the only option to house these terrorists. Any facility on U.S. soil is not an option. It never was with al-Qaeda terrorists, nor can it be with ISIL terrorists. We are committed to ensuring that President Obama understands this and is prevented from closing the detention center at Guantanamo Bay.” “America faces unknown threats as we confront the spread of ISIS or ISIL, the growing number of terrorist attacks and as we deal with the president’s failed foreign policy decisions,” Senator Roberts stated. “Guantanamo Bay is the safest and most suitable facility to house future detainees. The security and consequences of moving these and future terrorists and combatants to the mainland is unknown and is simply not worth the risk to American communities.” "President Obama’s default foreign policy strategy has been to kill off high-ranking ISIL fighters with drones instead of attempting to detain them to glean valuable intelligence information,” Senator Inhofe stated. “This has weakened our nation’s ability to more quickly make advancements in the Middle East. Guantanamo Bay has served a purpose in the fight against extreme terrorism, and we should be sending ISIL fighters there so that we can garner better knowledge on their tactics and plans that would impact our national security as well as our allies.” “Instead of trying to empty out Guantanamo and transfer dangerous terrorists to domestic soil in order to fulfill a campaign promise, the President should instead be focused on detaining captured ISIS fighters and other terrorists there,” Senator Scott stated. “I visited Guantanamo late last year and met the dedicated Marines who are guarding the terrorists currently held there, and can say unequivocally this is the best place on the planet for us to hold those captured overseas who wish to do us harm. The President’s refusal to do so puts our national security at risk, plain and simple.” “Under no circumstance should the United States allow dangerous terrorists on our homeland, leaving the military prison at Guantanamo Bay as our very best – and frankly, our only – option to detain terrorists,” Senator Vitter stated. “During the course of its existence, Guantanamo has played a major role in securing the safety of American families,” Senator Vitter said. “Closing Guantanamo Bay endangers our security, and President Obama is kidding himself if he thinks otherwise.” Read the full text of the resolution below or download it here. RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Senate that individuals capturedby the United States for supporting the Islamic Stateof Iraq and the Levant should be detained at United States Naval Station,Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that— (1) the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has declared war on the United States; (2) the United States Armed Forces are currently engaged in combat operations against ISIL; (3) in conducting combat operations against ISIL, the United States has captured and detained individuals associated with ISIL and will likely capture and hold additional ISIL detainees; (4) following the horrific terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the United States determined that it would detain at United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, individuals who had engaged in, aided, or abetted, or conspired to commit, acts of international terrorism, or acts in preparation therefor, that have caused, threaten to cause, or have as their aim to cause, injury to or adverse effects on the United States, its citizens, national security, foreign policy, or economy; (5) members of ISIL captured by the United States during combat operations against ISIL meet such criteria for continued detention at United State Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay; and (6) all individuals captured by the United States during combat operations against ISIL that meet the criteria by their affiliation with ISIL must be detained outside the United States and its territories and should be transferred to United States Naval Station, Guantanamo Bay. ###
03.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Representative Martha McSally (R-AZ) and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) will hold a press conference on March 16 at 1:30 PM ET at the U.S. Capitol to call on the Army to reinstate the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) at Arlington National Cemetery. The lawmakers have led the fight in Congress to restore the rights of WASPs, who were pioneering female World War II pilots, to have their ashes laid to rest at Arlington, a right that was revoked by the Army last year. Both lawmakers have introduced companion legislation with strong bipartisan support. They will be joined at the press conference by lawmakers from both parties, WASP family members, and a representative from Change.org. What: WASP Press Conference Who: U.S. Representative Martha McSally (R-AZ)Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA)U.S. Representative Susan Davis (D-CA)Family members of Elaine Harmon, former WASPRepresentative from Change.org Where: U.S. CapitolHouse triangle location (outside on southeast side of Capitol) When: Wednesday, March 161:30 PM ET*The press conference also will be live-streamed Background In 1942, General Henry “Hap” Arnold created the WASP unit with the intention of granting them full military status. Nearly 1,100 signed up for the WASP program, which ran from 1942 to 1944. Their missions included ferrying airplanes, training combat pilots, and towing airborne targets, and 38 WASPs died during their service. In 1977, Congress passed legislation retroactively granting active duty status to WASP pilots for the purposes of all laws administered by the VA, and in 2009, Congress awarded the WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal. Arlington National Cemetery approved in 2002 active duty designees, including WASP pilots, for military honors and inurnments. However, in March 2015, then-Secretary of the Army John McHugh reversed this decision. ###
03.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to President Obama expressing her deep concern over continued Obama Administration leaks regarding the activities of U.S. military special operations units. “Not too long ago, General Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter on the risks assumed by our special operations servicemembers through continued leaks of information to the public regarding special operations activities. However, despite this effort by GEN Votel to end leaks on special operations activities from the Administration, it appears information which outline the activities of our special operations servicemembers continue,” Senator Ernst wrote, “On February 29, 2016, CNN reported that it obtained information from an unnamed Administration official regarding special operations forces in Iraq. This unnamed Administration official, which CNN describes as someone with direct knowledge of the information, provided CNN with specific information regarding a special mission unit.” The Iowa Senator added, “As a retired Army National Guard officer and the spouse of a retired special operations Soldier, I fully understand the risks to our servicemembers when information about their mission, location, tactics, techniques, and procedures is released to the press or other unauthorized individuals. This release of potentially classified information from Administration officials must end now.” Senator Ernst called for accountability, writing “To better honor the daily sacrifices of our servicemembers and their families, I urge you to increase your efforts to end leaks regarding special operations missions and to hold those Administration officials accountable who leak information which puts our servicemembers at greater risk in the conduct of their vital mission.” The full text of the letter is below, and a signed copy can be found here. President Barack Obama1600 Pennsylvania Ave, NWWashington, DC 20500 President Obama: I write to you today regarding my concern about continued leaks by your Administration regarding U.S. military special mission units and their efforts in support of our nation. Not too long ago, General Joseph Votel, the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command, wrote a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter on the risks assumed by our special operations servicemembers through continued leaks of information to the public regarding special operations activities. However, despite this effort by GEN Votel to end leaks on special operations activities from the Administration, it appears information which outline the activities of our special operations servicemembers continue. On February 29, 2016, CNN reported that it obtained information from an unnamed Administration official regarding special operations forces in Iraq. This unnamed Administration official, which CNN describes as someone with direct knowledge of the information, provided CNN with specific information regarding a special mission unit. This specific information included the name of the unit, the unit’s time in-country, and specific mission related activities this special mission unit is performing as a part of its operations in Iraq which reveal special operations tactics, techniques and procedures. As a retired Army National Guard officer and the spouse of a retired special operations Soldier, I fully understand the risks to our servicemembers when information about their mission, location, tactics, techniques, and procedures is released to the press or other unauthorized individuals. This release of potentially classified information from Administration officials must end now. Our special operations servicemembers often operate with limited support and in the most dangerous locations around the world, and depend on secrecy and surprise to defeat our nation’s enemies and come home to their families. While they stand ready to give the ultimate sacrifice in support of their fellow operators and our country, the Administration must not add greater risk to special operations forces’ already high-risk mission set through continued leaks. To better honor the daily sacrifices of our servicemembers and their families, I urge you to increase your efforts to end leaks regarding special operations missions and to hold those Administration officials accountable who leak information which puts our servicemembers at greater risk in the conduct of their vital mission. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst United States Senator # # #
03.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Chuck Grassley’s (R-IA) Iowa Community Colleges Resolution passed the Senate. The resolution offers congratulations to the community colleges of Iowa for 50 years of outstanding service to the state of Iowa, the United States, and the world. “Over the past year I have had the opportunity to visit with educators and students at many of our Iowa community colleges throughout the state,” Senator Ernst said, “I have been consistently impressed by their work in their communities to prepare students for a competitive job market. This resolution recognizes the important and critical role Iowa community colleges play in educating our citizens. I’m grateful for their service over the last half of a century and I look forward to many more years of success to come.” ###
03.01.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Agriculture Biotechnology Labeling Solutions Markup, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today voted in support of Committee Chairman Pat Roberts’ (R-KS) Biotechnology Labeling Solutions bill. It passed out of committee with bipartisan support and now heads to the full Senate for consideration. The bipartisan proposal creates a national solution and preempts state level efforts to mandate the labeling of food products that contain ingredients derived from biotechnology, often referred to as Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs). Stopping the state-by-state, patchwork approach to food labeling laws prevents consumer confusion and avoids additional costs at the grocery store. “Allowing these proposed mandates to go forward would raise food prices for those who can least afford it – those middle and low income families just trying to get by from paycheck to paycheck. In fact, one recent study showed the impact of biotech labeling mandates could raise food prices for the average household by over $1,000 per year. The legislation that passed the committee today pre-empts these state level efforts, and provides for a national voluntary standard that will not raise prices unnecessarily, disparage safe and affordable foods, or create further confusion among consumers,” said Senator Ernst. About the Biotechnology Labeling Solutions bill: Considerations/Iowa Impact: Many food manufacturing companies have a presence in Iowa, and complying with Vermont’s law would add unnecessary costs to their operations in the form of more product SKUs, additional warehouse space, and reformulation. State level labeling would increase food costs for families that can least afford it, and are not asking for this information. Scientifically proven safe biotech products are grown and processed across Iowa, providing the base to over a quarter of our state’s economy. Major highlights of the legislation: Immediately: Pre-empt the Vermont law. Within 2 Years: Create a voluntary national standard for foods that contain biotech. Within 4 Years: Require the USDA to submit a report on the availability of information to consumers regarding the biotech content of foods. Ongoing: Require the USDA and other agencies to engage consumers in education and outreach efforts on the safety and benefits of biotech. ###
02.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate Whistleblower Protection Caucus, now approaching its second year, is adding two new members: Senators Joni Ernst of Iowa and Gary Peters of Michigan. The bipartisan caucus focuses on raising awareness of the important role whistleblowers play in bringing about accountability in government and the workplace, and the need to protect them from retaliation when they disclose fraud or misconduct. The caucus was launched last year by Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice-Chairman Ron Wyden of Oregon. “Whistleblowers are essential to bringing about transparency and accountability in government and the private sector, but all too often they are punished for simply telling the truth. We need all the help we can get to spread the word that they do important work and need to be shielded from retribution. I’m grateful that senators Joni Ernst and Gary Peters will be joining us in this effort,” Grassley said. “Ensuring whistleblowers can report government waste and wrongdoing without being fired or retaliated against is absolutely fundamental to good government. The Whistleblower Protection Caucus is proof that it isn’t a partisan issue either. I’m pleased to welcome Sens. Ernst and Peters as our newest members,” Wyden said. “Whistleblowers who have the fortitude to expose waste, fraud, abuse, and misconduct in our government deserve appropriate protection from retaliation. I am proud to join the bipartisan Whistleblower Protection Caucus led by my colleague from Iowa, Senator Chuck Grassley as well as Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon, to work to raise awareness and enact needed reforms and improvements to shield whistleblowers,” Ernst said. “Whistleblowers play a critical role in bringing critical issues to light and holding government and private entities accountable. As a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I’m focused on finding ways to make sure government is working efficiently and effectively for taxpayers. I’m proud to join this bipartisan caucus to help enhance protections for whistleblowers who can help improve transparency, ensure agencies are operating effectively and make government work better for the American people,” Peters said. Ernst and Peters join caucus Chairman Chuck Grassley and Vice-Chairman Ron Wyden and senators Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mark Kirk of Illinois, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Barbara Boxer of California, Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Ed Markey of Massachusetts John Boozman of Arkansas and Tom Carper of Delaware. ###
02.26.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed Brad R. Carson, the nominee for Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, on the need for a recommendation from the Obama administration on requiring women to register for selective service. Senator Ernst stressed that while she supports opening up all military occupational specialties to women, “the determination to open up combat roles to women was made by the administration, and I think it was done in a manner that was very fast. It is not being implemented maybe as methodically, as deliberative, as many of us that have served in the military and of course our service chiefs would like to see. So, that decision was made by the administration. I think when we look at selective service, the administration needs to own up to their decision, and then because we do have an existing policy with selective service, they need to make their recommendation to Congress on whether we have women sign up for selective service or not.” The Iowa Senator supports opening all military occupational specialties, including combat roles, to women as long as standards are not lowered and combat effectiveness is maintained. Furthermore, Senator Ernst has consistently called for an implementation strategy that is thoroughly and fully developed. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: ERNST: Considering the fact that all military occupational specialties are now open to women, to provide greater opportunities to women in the military, which I do support as well. Would you consider that it would be also progressive to require women to register for the selective service like their male counterparts? CARSON: I think the issue from a policy perspective is this, we should divorce the question of registration from that of the draft. We’ve had service chiefs talk about the need for a draft, the secretary no doubt testifying right now before the House appropriations committee on defense, is speaking to his strong conviction that we don’t need a draft. The Center for Naval Analysis just this week came out and said that only 13% of youth are even eligible to serve in the military. What everyone might think about contingency, which a draft might be needed, the more interesting public policy question is whether the registration requirement is necessary for it. The GAO has said differently to that… ERNST: The stance of the administration, your stance, is that there should be no selective service. CARSON: No, that is my personal view about it. If you ask me the policy questions that this committee and the rest of the nation must address, is whether the registration requirement is still a viable, is still a necessary one for us. It is one we have to debate among ourselves. The Selective Service Act does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense. It would be inappropriate for me to opine about their continued existence. ERNST: I think that you are correct, that it is established by Congress, however the determination to open up combat roles to women was made by the administration, and I think it was done in a manner that was very fast. It is not being implemented maybe as methodically, as deliberative, as many of us that have served in the military and of course our service chiefs would like to see. So, that decision was made by the administration. I think when we look at selective service, the administration needs to own up to their decision, and then because we do have an existing policy with selective service, they need to make their recommendation to Congress on whether we have women sign up for selective service or not. Thank you for your answer. ###
02.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Congressman Tim Walberg (R-MI), U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), and U.S. Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) introduced bicameral legislation to prevent a surge in costly federal regulations as a United States President’s term comes to a close. The Midnight Rule Relief Act would protect hard working families and small businesses from significant regulations that are often politically motivated and imposed between Election Day and Inauguration Day. Regardless of political party, midnight regulations have noticeably increased during the transition time between new administrations. According to data from the American Action Forum (AAF) and the Mercatus Center , midnight regulations nearly doubled in 2000 and 2008 from the non-midnight average. This heavy-handed approach to rulemaking puts a strain on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), the entity directly responsible for overseeing the quality of regulatory analysis, which has a staff of around 45 people. According to research done by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), government regulations and red tape rank as one of the most important issue facing small businesses. The $600 billion (as cited by AAF) in new major regulations this Administration has issued since 2009 only adds to the uncertainty and uneasiness our job creators are feeling. “Given the Obama administration’s tendency to overregulate and overreach, the American people can expect to see a surge of last minute regulations in the President’s waning days in office,” said Congressman Walberg. “This bill will hold outgoing administrations in check and ensure small businesses in Michigan and across the country aren’t faced with a new onslaught of excessive regulations that stifle wages, job creation, and economic growth. It’s time to say goodnight to midnight regulations—from both parties.” “Effective oversight and quality analysis of Washington’s burdensome regulations is essential at all times; and careful review during the final days of a president’s term should not be any different,” said Senator Ernst. “Our legislation would prevent hasty – and at times, politically motivated – analyses, which could ultimately lead to poor oversight and increased public costs for job creators and taxpayers. Ultimately, this bill improves transparency and accountability in our federal government to ensure the American people have a voice in how regulations with a $100 million or more price tag impact our economy and livelihood.” "Presidents of both parties have ‎consistently attempted to push through regulations during the last few weeks and months of their administrations,” said Senator Johnson. “This bill provides some basic accountability and ensures a president cannot impose a surge of new rules on the American economy as he exits office." This concept has been raised by both Republicans and Democrats. Senator Harry Reid and Congressman Jerry Nadler, for example, introduced bills in 2009 that opposed midnight rules from going into effect in the closing days of the Bush Administration. House cosponsors of the bill include: Reps. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), Blake Farenthold (R-TX), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Jody Hice (R-GA), Lynn Jenkins (R-KS), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), Mick Mulvaney (R-SC), Reid Ribble (R-WI), and Lamar Smith (R-TX). About the Midnight Rule Relief Act: • Establishes a moratorium period beginning on the day after the election through the inauguration on new regulations that cost the economy $100 million or more annually, or result in major cost or price increases for consumers, industries, or government agencies. • Includes exceptions for rules that are necessary for imminent health or safety threats, enforcement of criminal laws, and national security. • Exempts rules that are limited to repealing existing regulations. ###
02.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced she is an original co-sponsor of Senator Gary Peter’s (D-MI) Remotely Piloted Aircraft Mission Protection Act. This bipartisan legislation prevents the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from disqualifying an airport for an Airport Improvement Project grant solely because the airport provides a nominal lease to a military component. “By ensuring no party is put at a disadvantage, this bipartisan legislation fosters an environment for negotiations to continue in good faith while also taking into consideration the perspective of the airport boards, National Guard and U.S. Air Force,” said Senator Ernst. “I’m proud to support this bipartisan measure that takes important steps to ensure that grant opportunities are not missed while the stakeholders work to come to an agreement that works best for them. It’s important that a fair resolution is achieved to ensure those involved can continue their various missions.” Click here to read the text of the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Mission Protection Act . ###
02.25.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a bipartisan letter urging the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to begin screening veterans for food insecurity as part of routine health care screenings. Veterans are at an increased risk for food insecurity, or a lack of reliable access to affordable and nutritious food. Food insecurity is more prevalent among veterans than the general population due in part to higher rates of disability, medical problems, and mental health conditions that may make it more difficult for veterans to maintain an adequate income. “We owe it to our veterans to do everything we can to ensure that they do not go hungry,” the Senators said. “We believe that veterans would benefit from the VA including a brief screener on food insecurity when veterans seek health care from the VA. Any veteran who claims food insecurity can be referred to a social worker, who can then assist the veteran in completing paper work for SNAP or other resources. The addition of this screener is simple, requires little of the VA, and has the potential to help prevent millions of veterans and their families from going hungry.” Food insecurity is particularly high among veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 27 percent of veterans from these wars reported difficulty with food insecurity, while 14.5 percent of the general U.S. population struggle with food insecurity. Despite the higher rates of food insecurity among veterans, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) use among veterans is considerably lower than the general population. Potential reasons for underuse among veterans may include stigma associated with SNAP, lack of information about the program, and difficulty navigating the application process. Screening for food insecurity at the VA can help address each of these barriers. The full text of the letter is below: The Honorable Robert McDonaldSecretary of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue NorthwestWashington, DC 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald, We write to encourage the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to incorporate screening for food insecurity among all veterans seeking healthcare. Veterans are at a particular risk for food insecurity, or the lack of reliable access to a sufficient amount of affordable and nutritious food. Higher rates of disability, medical problems, and mental health conditions among veterans may render it difficult if not impossible for them to maintain employment and adequate income. We owe it to our veterans to do everything we can to ensure that they do not go hungry and believe that asking a few simple questions can help in this effort. Perhaps surprisingly, it appears that younger veterans are more likely to be food insecure than older veterans. Researchers at the University of Minnesota in conjunction with the Minneapolis VA Healthcare System found that, in that system, 27% of veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan reported difficulties with food security, which is markedly higher than the U.S. population at 14.5%. Food insecure veterans were also found to have more children than those who were food secure, suggesting that screening for food insecurity will help not only veterans, but their families as well. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly food stamps) is the cornerstone of our nation’s efforts to reduce food insecurity. A November 2014 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 1.7 million veterans lived in households that participated in SNAP at some point within the prior twelve months. Although studies suggest prevalence of food insecurity among veterans is higher than the general population, SNAP use among veterans is considerably lower. Potential reasons for underuse among veterans include stigma associated with SNAP, lack of information about the program, and difficulty navigating the application process. Screening for food insecurity at VHA can help address each of these barriers. The Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) contains “Clinical Reminders” that providers can administer to patients when prompted. Providers can screen veterans for homelessness, depressive symptoms, and alcohol and tobacco use, among other issues, and many of these screeners are administered at least annually. Positive screens prompt providers to place an appropriate referral, for example, a positive tobacco screen initiates a referral for tobacco cessation programs, including medications and behavior therapy. We believe that veterans would benefit from VHA including a brief screener on food insecurity as a CPRS Clinical Reminder. Any veteran who claims food insecurity can be referred to a social worker, who can then assist the veteran in completing paper work for SNAP or establishing other services as appropriate. Although we certainly understand that administering these screeners may add burden to providers, we believe the desired outcome—helping veterans secure adequate food—can be achieved with only a few questions. VHA may want to adopt the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which recently put out a policy statement encouraging pediatricians to screen for food insecurity with a two-item questionnaire comprised of only the following questions: 1. Within the past 12 months, we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more. (Yes or No) 2. Within the past 12 months, the food we bought just didn’t last and we didn’t have money to get more. (Yes or No) The addition of this screener is simple, requires little of the provider, and has the potential to help millions of veterans and their families. We therefore request that VHA implement this screener into its Clinical Reminders as soon as possible. Thank you in advance for your attention and cooperation with our request. We look forward to hearing more from you on this matter. Sincerely, Kirsten GillibrandUnited States Senator Joni ErnstUnited States Senator ###
02.24.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Robert McDonald, expressing her outrage over a recent Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) report that found at least 23 veterans who contacted the VA’s Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) were transferred to a voicemail system and never received a returned phone call. As Senator Ernst wrote, “There is simply no excuse for VA to allow calls from veterans reaching out to the Department for lifesaving assistance to go unanswered. I remain deeply disturbed that the Department continues to allow itself to fail our veterans when they are most at need—particularly those veterans who are facing imminent crises such as a potential suicide. Often, when our veterans reach out to VA for help—whether it be through VCL or in attempting to schedule an appointment to see a mental health professional—it can be at a time when they have reached the breaking point.” The Iowa Senator called for “swift action to hold those VA employees accountable who were directly responsible for this inexcusable lapse in care, as well as the VA’s Director of the Office of Mental Health Operations who oversees VCL.” Senator Ernst also emphasized the need to "immediately implement the recommendations provided by VA OIG to ensure veterans who reach out for help through VCL are receiving the care they deserve,” and once again called on the VA to implement the “previous VA OIG recommendations to improve overall mental health care for our veterans.” The full text of the letter is below, and a signed copy can be found here. The Honorable Robert McDonaldSecretaryDepartment of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald: I am appalled by the poor management at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and a recent Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (OIG) report which found that at least 23 veterans who contacted VA’s Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) were transferred to a voicemail system and their calls never returned. This is a crisis for far too many of our bravest men and women and cannot be ignored. There is simply no excuse for VA to allow calls from veterans reaching out to the Department for lifesaving assistance to go unanswered. I remain deeply disturbed that the Department continues to allow itself to fail our veterans when they are most at need—particularly those veterans who are facing imminent crises such as a potential suicide. Often, when our veterans reach out to VA for help—whether it be through VCL or in attempting to schedule an appointment to see a mental health professional—it can be at a time when they have reached the breaking point. As you know, it is widely reported that every day our country loses to suicide 22 men and women who once wore our nation’s uniform. The VA must be part of the solution to reduce that number of veteran suicides, and not part of the problem where it contributes to unnecessary delays for veterans to receive the potentially lifesaving care they need and deserve. As a Member of the U.S. Senate, and as a veteran, it is my duty to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it has made to our veterans. I urge you to take swift action to hold those VA employees accountable who were directly responsible for this inexcusable lapse in care, as well as the VA’s Director of the Office of Mental Health Operations who oversees VCL. I also urge you to immediately implement the recommendations provided by VA OIG to ensure veterans who reach out for help through VCL are receiving the care they deserve as well as previous VA OIG recommendations to improve overall mental health care for our veterans. Sincerely, Joni K. ErnstUnited States Senator ###
02.23.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement regarding the Obama Administration’s plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. “The detention facility for terrorists at Guantanamo Bay is an important component of our counterterrorism strategy. These detainees are some of the world’s most dangerous terrorists and the facility houses many responsible for planning the attacks upon our nation on September 11, 2001. “Regardless, the Obama Administration wants to bring these terrorists to a facility close to Americans' homes in the United States. Like many other parents and grandparents across the country, I am deeply concerned that the release or transfer of these terrorists poses a direct threat to our safety and security – especially considering that about 30 percent of Guantanamo Bay detainees return to the fight after their release. “I have observed detention procedure and met with military commanders and servicemembers at the Guantanamo Bay facility, where I saw firsthand just how vital our operations there are in ensuring our national security. Congress has passed a number of bipartisan measures restricting the Obama Administration from building and outfitting facilities for relocation of Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States. “I urge President Obama to reconsider this reckless plan. I remain committed to working on behalf of the security of the American people, our allies and our global community.” PHOTO: Last year, Senator Ernst toured the Guantanamo Bay base, observed detention operations, and met with military commanders. ###
02.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement following news that the agricultural company that will emerge from the Dow-DuPont merger will not be headquartered in Iowa: “Today's news is certainly disappointing for our state and also difficult, particularly for the hard working Iowans who were laid off and their families. My thoughts are with them during this time. “Iowa is a leader in agriculture and plays a critical part in ensuring folks in the U.S. and around the world have access to a safe and affordable food supply. Although the agricultural company will not be headquartered in Iowa, it is my hope that Dow-DuPont will expand and produce more good-paying jobs in our state in the very near future.” Last month, Senator Ernst joined Senator Chuck Grassley, and Congressmen Rod Blum, Steve King, Dave Loebsack and David Young to send a letter to Mr. Edward Breen and Mr. Andrew Liveris highlighting the many benefits to making Iowa the home of the agricultural company that could soon emerge from the Dow-DuPont merger. The members of the Iowa delegation wrote in part, “We believe that Iowa’s rich agricultural heritage combined with our state’s dynamic leadership in agricultural and bioscience innovation would serve as an exceptional center for your agriculture business.” Click here to read the full letter. ###
02.16.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following their participation in the Munich Security Conference this past weekend, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Ben Sasse (R-NE) penned the following op-ed in the Omaha World-Herald: World needs United States to leadBy Senators Joni Ernst and Ben SasseFebruary 16, 2016 We just finished the Munich Security Conference, one of the most important gatherings on global threats. Now home, we offer Nebraskans and Iowans six observations: 1) Global stability is at its lowest point since the Cold War’s conclusion in 1989. Our challenges are real and big. Yes, the Middle East has been a mess for ages, but this is different. This is more than common war. We are witnessing the decline of states and the international system the West has built. Many Democrats want to blame President George W. Bush for the faulty intelligence that preceded the decision to go to war in Iraq in 2003. Many Republicans are rightly aghast by President Barack Obama’s premature withdrawal of troops from that same conflict nine years later, giving rise to ISIS. We need a broader, shared American understanding of how we got into our current foreign policy situation. But even more important than shared history, we need a reality-based picture of the future. To protect our national security, we will be engaged in a decades-long battle against jihadis, both at home and abroad. Some pine for isolationism, but make no mistake: More San Bernardinos are inevitable. There will be more jihadis bringing this war to us. The next president’s first years will be consumed with fixing the present wreckage. 2) The Syrian war is a tragedy that rips your heart out. And it has now spread to dozens of nations. We were in Serbia in southeastern Europe last week and met with some of the refugees trying to flee their homeland — moms, babies, kids the age of our kids and, tragically, probably some infiltrating terrorists masquerading as the vulnerable. There were 23 million Syrians when the civil war began. Today, nearly half are displaced from their homes — over 4 million of them beyond the former nation’s borders. King Abdullah of Jordan (an ally we should be supporting more forcefully) told us of the unrest in his country, where many schools now have more Syrian than Jordanian children. None of this is sustainable. 3) While it is complicated, the Syrian spillover is not a random evil like a tornado or hurricane. Russia is in effect “weaponizing” emigration to advance its geopolitical goals. This is no accident. The Russians — and Syrian President Bashar Assad, who is increasingly a Russian and Iranian puppet dictator — deliberately bomb civilians, causing them to flee, thus killing would-be internal fighters and taxing would-be external opposition. They essentially have the ability to dial up and dial down refugee exodus pacing. This produces havoc in the receiving nations of Europe. That is not accidental. 4) We need a shared theory of what Vladimir Putin is doing in Europe. Many U.S. generals believe that Putin regards the terms on which the Cold War ended (we won) as the worst event in Russian history. And he wants to use current U.S. self-doubt as an occasion to renegotiate. He wants access to the Middle East and the Mediterranean Sea via a vassal state in western Syria. He wants Russia to be perceived as big, and actually to be big. He wants to dominate the internal politics of his neighbors. And, critically, he wants to break NATO. We are foolish to see his aims as benign. A Ukrainian invasion is probably only part of what he’s plotting during our presidential transition. 5) Soon, all wars will have a cyber component. There will be traditional wars with cyber aspects. And there will be stand-alone cyber conflicts. But the future is less about massed armies and more about the combination of information technology, unmanned systems and surgical special forces. In all of these areas, we are unprepared and under-investing. 6) The world cries out for U.S. leadership. We met privately with seven heads of state, and their message was unmistakable: “We don’t know who the U.S. is anymore. Your enemies don’t fear you, and your friends don’t trust you.” Let us be clear: There is extraordinary gratitude the world over for U.S. troops; our men and women in uniform are the finest in the world. But there is also deep anxiety. We say this delicately, as we work hard to respect the office of the presidency, but our allies everywhere are baffled. We asked one head of state, What single lesson would you like us to report back to our bosses, our constituents? The reply: “Get us a U.S. president who will know that the U.S. needs to lead. We need you. All the freedom-loving nations of the world need you.” Reasonable citizens and candidates for office should wrestle with what — and where and when and how — U.S. leadership looks like in the world. But the necessity of U.S. leadership is inarguable — for our allies and for us. ###
02.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia‎: "Justice Antonin Scalia was a ‎passionate defender of our Constitution and one of the most influential legal minds of our time. His nearly thirty years of service on the Supreme Court were marked by a commitment to upholding the principles on which our country was founded. I am deeply saddened by the passing of Justice Scalia and ‎my thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Maureen, and their family." ###
02.12.2016	WASHINGTON — A bipartisan bill introduced by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) aimed at combating the use of social media by terrorists was approved by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Wednesday. “We must have a comprehensive strategy in place to counter online radicalization,” said Sen. Johnson, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “ISIS is growing, and the threat of homegrown terrorism is real. I’d like to thank Sens. Booker and Ernst for their hard work on this legislation. This bill is a necessary step in developing an effective counter narrative to ISIS recruitment and appeal.” “I appreciated the opportunity to work with both Chairman Johnson and Senator Booker on this important bipartisan bill, which would require the Obama Administration to fulfill a promise they made in 2011 to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ use of social media,” said Senator Ernst. “The digital battlefield is an important front in the fight against violent extremism. To keep America safe, we need to effectively counter the spread of violent extremist propaganda online,” Senator Booker said. “This legislation seeks to promote accountability and encourage greater cooperation to counter dangerous extremist narratives, while balancing this with the need to respect civil rights and civil liberties. Its committee passage is an important step forward and part of a broader strategy to combat extremism.” The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of 2016 complements H.R. 3654, introduced by Rep. Ted Poe (R-Texas) in the House last year. In December 2011, the Obama Administration released a “Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States,” which made the following commitment: “[b]ecause of the importance of the digital environment, we will develop a separate, more comprehensive strategy for countering and preventing violent extremist online radicalization and leveraging technology to empower community resilience that considers: (1) the latest assessment of the role of the Internet; (2) the absence of clear national boundaries in online space and the relationship between international and domestic radicalization to violence; (3) relevant legal issues; and (4) the differing authorities and capabilities of departments and agencies.” The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act requires the president to prepare: A report on terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media and an evaluation of current government efforts to combat such use. A comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media. ###
02.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), David Perdue (R-GA), and Mike Rounds (R-SD), today sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry raising serious concerns about the need for support of the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) continued care and shelter for hundreds of thousands of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) as they fight to combat ISIS on the ground. The senators called on the State Department to enhance its efforts to engage American allies in Baghdad and the broader Middle East to secure appropriate resources for the KRG. “According to the KRG, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq currently hosts over 1.6 million refugees and IDPs, including Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities. Moreover, it has been estimated that the vast majority (approximately 97%) of the Syrian refugees in Iraq reside in the Kurdistan Region,” the group of bipartisan senators wrote in the letter to Secretary Kerry. The senators continued, “Confronted with the loss of expected fiscal transfers from Baghdad, a funding shortfall, the refugee and IDP crisis, and the war on ISIS - the KRG cannot maintain its current level of contribution and open-door policy without putting the safety and welfare of the population of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the stability of the region at risk.” “Despite these fiscal challenges, the character of the Iraqi Kurdish people is an example for others in the region to follow. The U.S. Government must enhance its efforts to work with the KRG, the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, and our international allies to ensure that the KRG receives the financial resources it needs to continue to support those fleeing ISIS terror and to defend its territory against ISIS,” the senators concluded. Full text of the letter is below and a signed copy can be found here. Dear Secretary Kerry: We are writing to encourage the State Department to enhance its efforts to engage with American allies in Baghdad and the broader Middle East to secure appropriate financial resources for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in Iraq as it continues to host and care for hundreds of thousands of refugees and Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) and take the fight directly to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) on the ground. As you know, more than four million Syrians have fled their homeland since 2011. According to the KRG, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq currently hosts over 1.6 million refugees and IDPs, including Christians and other religious and ethnic minorities. Moreover, it has been estimated that the vast majority (approximately 97%) of the Syrian refugees in Iraq reside in the Kurdistan Region. As a result, in August 2014, the UN designated the humanitarian crisis in Iraq a “Level 3 Emergency”– the highest level of emergency. Meanwhile, the KRG’s fighting force—the Peshmerga—continue to serve as one of our most capable, steadfast, and loyal allies in the war against ISIS. Currently, the Peshmerga is defending a 600-mile border with the terrorist group, and in mid-November the Peshmerga, along with Yazidi militias, re-took the ISIS-held city of Sinjar after its residents faced unspeakable crimes at the hands of ISIS for over a year. As reported by the Wall Street Journal in December, “the World Bank has warned that the KRG is desperately in need of a $2.4 billion bridge loan to remain afloat” and “is facing economic collapse.” The KRG relies on the Iraqi central government in Baghdad to provide its share from the federal budget, but only about $2 billion of the $12 billion per year owed by Baghdad was released to the KRG in 2015. Meanwhile, although the KRG and the refugees and IDPs that it hosts have received support from allied governments and international organizations, both the refugee crisis and the battle against ISIS have exacted a heavy financial burden on the KRG. Confronted with the loss of expected fiscal transfers from Baghdad, a funding shortfall, the refugee and IDP crisis, and the war on ISIS—the KRG cannot maintain its current level of contribution and open-door policy without putting the safety and welfare of the population of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the stability of the region at risk. In fact, according to the KRG, their government is already unable to pay the salaries of all of its Peshmerga forces due to the increased economic strain brought by support to refugees and displaced persons. Despite these fiscal challenges, the character of the Iraqi Kurdish people is an example for others in the region to follow. The U.S. Government must enhance its efforts to work with the KRG, the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, and our international allies to ensure that the KRG receives the financial resources it needs to continue to support those fleeing ISIS terror and to defend its territory against ISIS. We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to working with you on this important issue. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst Joe Manchin United States Senator United States Senator M. Michael Rounds David Perdue United States Senator United States Senator ###
02.11.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the follow statement after voting to confirm Leonard Terry Strand, as a judge for the United States District Court for the Northern District of Iowa: “I’m pleased to see Judge Strand confirmed as a federal judge for the Northern District of Iowa. He is dedicated to serving the people of Iowa and I look forward to continuing to follow his outstanding career as he continues to serve our great state and nation. “I would also like to thank Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and the members of the Judicial Selection Commission for their due diligence and hard work throughout the nomination process.” Senator Ernst introduced Judge Strand at his nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in which she noted that the Judicial Selection Commission formed by Chairman Grassley “was comprised of experienced and respected members of Iowa’s legal community who spent countless hours reviewing applications and carefully studying the applicants’ professional history and qualifications. The Commission then made the recommendation of Judges Ebinger and Strand to Chairman Grassley, who in turn reviewed them, consulted with me, and then recommended them to the White House.” The American Bar Association rated Judge Strand as “Unanimously Well Qualified” for the position. Judge Strand earned his B.A., with high distinction, from the University of Iowa in 1987 and his J.D., with highest distinction, from the University of Iowa College of Law in 1990. In 1990, Judge Strand joined the law firm of Simmons, Perrine, Moyer, and Bergman in Cedar Rapids as an associate, and was made partner in 1996, serving with the firm until 2012. Since June 7, 2012, Judge Strand has served as a United States Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Iowa. ###
02.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2015 passed out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. The legislation awaits full Senate consideration. “We’re doing something today with the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act that many think Washington can’t do, and that’s cutting spending, but we can,” said Senator Ernst at today’s business meeting. “And even though this is just a start, we have over $19 trillion in debt; we have to do it. This bipartisan effort reforms and updates the benefits provided to former presidents to try and better reflect today’s post-presidential life. By limiting how much taxpayers pick up the tab for presidential perks - things like communications, office space, staff, and travel expenses - we are making sure taxpayer money is being spent wisely.” The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act examines how former presidents are spending taxpayer dollars and would set the annual allowances for former presidents at $200,000—far below levels spent today. These taxpayer funded perks include, but are not limited to communications, office space, staff, and travel expenses. In addition, the legislation would further reduce the amount of perks available dollar-for-dollar for annual income over $400,000 generated by former presidents the previous year. At no point will security protection for former president’s and their families be impacted. The Iowa Senator introduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act last spring. Original co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL). This is the companion bill to the House of Representatives bill, H.R. 1777, introduced by Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD). Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. In addition, the committee passed a number of bipartisan bills targeted at improving government inefficiencies that if enacted, will ultimately save taxpayers millions of dollars. One such proposal would require the federal government to act on hundreds of U.S. Government Accountability Office recommendations to get rid of duplication and fragmentation in government programs. Another bill would demand accurate inventory of government property to hold federal agencies accountable that hold onto excess property at the cost of taxpayers. And finally, the MEGABYTE Act would streamline the management of federal software licensing programs. About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president. In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. ###
02.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in favor of the bipartisan North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016: “North Korea is a rogue government whose continued provocations threaten our national security and the security of our allies in the region. Due to North Korea’s recent actions of testing a nuclear weapon and a ballistic missile, restarting a plutonium reactor to support its nuclear weapons program, as well as its continuing efforts to undermine U.S. cybersecurity, and committing human rights abuses against its own people—we must not underestimate the threat posed by this dangerous adversary. “President Obama’s failed ‘wait and see’ approach has enabled North Korea’s destructive behavior. The bipartisan North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act forces the Obama administration to put forward a strategy to investigate and combat North Korea’s aggression by expanding and tightening enforcement of sanctions and demands a comprehensive strategy to stop cyberattacks. This legislation would also require the administration to expose and address human rights abuses. “The U.S. must stand up against this rogue regime to put an end to their reckless and hostile actions, and work with countries in the region to apply as much pressure on North Korea as possible.” ###
02.10.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today the Senate Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee passed the Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act of 2016 (S. 2517). U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), an original co-sponsor along with Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), highlighted the critical importance of the legislation introduced by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI). “I want to thank both Chairman Johnson and Senator Booker for working with me on this bill. This will require the Obama Administration to fulfill a promise that they made back in 2011 to develop a comprehensive strategy to counter and prevent violent extremism and online radicalization,” Senator Ernst stated. “So while President Obama continues to lack a comprehensive overall strategy to defeat ISIS, this legislation will ensure he must at least present a strategy to address its use of social media to spread terror.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. In December 2011, the Obama Administration released a “Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States” which made the following commitment: “[b]ecause of the importance of the digital environment, we will develop a separate, more comprehensive strategy for countering and preventing violent extremist online radicalization and leveraging technology to empower community resilience that considers: (1) the latest assessment of the role of the Internet; (2) the absence of clear national boundaries in online space and the relationship between international and domestic radicalization to violence; (3) relevant legal issues; and (4) the differing authorities and capabilities of departments and agencies.” The Combat Terrorist Use of Social Media Act requires the president to prepare: A report on terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media and an evaluation of current government efforts to combat such use. A comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists’ and terrorist organizations’ use of social media. The bipartisan legislation is the companion to H.R. 3654, introduced by Rep.

02.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) today introduced legislation to expand manufacturing opportunities for Army arsenals. The Army Arsenal Revitalization Act, S. 2516, would provide Army arsenals, such as Rock Island Arsenal, the tools they needed to be more competitive, including the ability to adjust their own labor rates and to better seek new opportunities to compete for manufacturing contracts within the Department of Defense (DoD). “The skilled workers at Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois play a vital role in maintaining military readiness and strengthening our national security,” Senator Kirk said. “Removing these unnecessary barriers will give arsenals the opportunity to compete on a level playing field and stay at the cutting edge of manufacturing.” “Our delegation got the Government Accountability Office to identify ways the Army could better utilize the arsenals,” Senator Grassley said. “Unfortunately, the Army has not done enough to get the Rock Island Arsenal to the level of workload it needs to maintain its critical capabilities. Our bill would help make that happen.” “When it comes to the Rock Island Arsenal, the Illinois and Iowa Congressional Delegations come together from both sides of the river, both sides of the aisle, and both sides of the Capitol,” Durbin said. “This bill would build on our ongoing efforts to help the Arsenal adapt to a changing workload and remain competitive.” “Our nation’s arsenals are an important manufacturing component for our national defense that our military relies on,” said Senator Ernst. “Under the Army Arsenal Revitalization Act, our arsenals would be better able to seize new manufacturing opportunities, obtain and develop a skilled workforce, as well as more readily adapt to the changing demands of our workforce and Defense Department.” Army arsenals play a vital role in our national security by adapting to the needs of the military and quickly manufacturing critical items for the warfighter. But because of outdated DoD rules that require Arsenals to set and maintain their labor rates at least a year in advance regardless of market conditions, Army arsenals face barriers to manufacturing opportunities and are often unable to maintain the skilled workforce needed to meet national security needs. S. 2516 gives Arsenals flexibility to adjust their labor rates throughout the year and requires DoD to identify work opportunities the arsenals are uniquely qualified to meet. The Army Arsenal Revitalization Act would: • Give Army arsenals flexibility to stay viable and competitive. o The bill creates a three-year pilot program to allow arsenals to adjust their labor rates based on market conditions and workload changes. o Currently, arsenals must maintain fixed labor rates through the entire year, making it difficult for them to compete for contracts or form public-private partnerships. • Increase competition for DoD contracts. o The bill requires DoD to consider Army arsenals to produce certain legacy items no longer manufactured by the private sector and sole source contracts produced non-competitively by only one vendor. o Increasing competition opens new opportunities for arsenals to keep their workforces employed and diversely skilled. • Identify arsenals’ critical capabilities to meet national security needs. o The bill requires the DoD to identify the critical capabilities of each arsenal to meet national security needs and determine the minimum workloads necessary to maintain those skills. ###
02.09.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a combat veteran and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, today introduced the Military Sexual Assault Victims Empowerment (SAVE) Act, along with the support of Senators Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Mark Kirk (R-IL), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) and Lindsey Graham (R-SC). The bipartisan Military SAVE Act puts military sexual trauma (MST) survivors in control of their health care by giving them the opportunity, flexibility and discretion to choose treatment options that best suit their needs. Under this legislation, if the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) does not match the needs of MST survivors, the Military SAVE Act gives all MST survivors the option to seek prompt care at a non-VA facility of their choice. This enables MST survivors to find a trusted provider who has the specialized training and expertise to care for these complex and sensitive cases. “The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2016 included efforts to strengthen policy for sexual assault prevention as well as increased victim support. However, the Military SAVE Act works to continue to improve care for military sexual trauma survivors,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This bipartisan legislation addresses the individualized needs of military sexual trauma survivors to ensure they have the ability to choose their own quality and timely care from a provider they trust.” “Victims of sexual assault have benefited from the historic reforms we’ve made to the military justice system, but we shouldn’t stop there,” said Senator Claire McCaskill, a former sex crimes prosecutor. “We should continue to look for ways to improve the quality and access to care for victims, which is exactly what this bill aims to do.” "Military members who have been sexually assaulted should be able to seek immediate care with a doctor or nurse they trust,” said Senator Kirk. “The culture of corruption at the VA is systemic and real, and no serviceman or woman should ever feel limited in their ability to seek quality care after experiencing sexual assault.” “Victims of sexual assault in our military need a government on their side. This bipartisan legislation meets compelling human need for victims of military sexual assault by ensuring that they have access to timely care from a doctor in their own community that best suits their needs,” said Senator Barbara Mikulski, a member of the Senate Military Family Caucus. “Victims may suffer lasting trauma, prejudice and overwhelming obstacles, and it is our duty to provide them with a reliable healthcare system that can assist their needs. Promises made must be promises kept.” “I strongly support this much-needed change,” said Senator Lindsey Graham. “Senator Ernst has been a leader in bringing this important issue forward and her work will help improve the care available to our veterans who are military sexual trauma survivors. I hope we are able to push this important change into law at the soonest possible opportunity.” About the Military SAVE Act: • The Military SAVE Act amends the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act to allow veterans who are MST survivors to choose health care providers outside the VA, regardless of certain eligibility requirements. The option to access non-VA care applies to injuries directly related to military sexual trauma while serving in the military on active duty or in training. • Survivors of MST would contact the Veterans Choice Card benefits hotline in order to report a documented or previously unreported sexual assault during their military service – these veterans would receive automatic authorization to private care without having to satisfy any other conditions. • This legislation is the companion to the House of Representatives bill, H.R. 1603, introduced by Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY). ###

02.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the follow statement after voting to confirm Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger of Des Moines, as a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa: “I want to congratulate Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger on her confirmation to serve as a federal judge for the Southern District of Iowa. I have tremendous respect for Judge Ebinger’s impressive career and her commitment to public service. Judge Ebinger’s nomination is the result of an extensive search conducted by a Judicial Selection Commission formed by Senator Grassley. I greatly appreciate the hard work and thoroughness of Senator Grassley and his staff throughout the nomination process.” Senator Ernst introduced Judge Ebinger at her nomination hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she explained that the Judicial Selection Commission formed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley “was comprised of experienced and respected members of Iowa’s legal community who spent countless hours reviewing applications and carefully studying the applicants’ professional history and qualifications. The Commission then made the recommendation of Judges Ebinger and Strand to Chairman Grassley, who in turn reviewed them, consulted with me, and then recommended them to the White House.” The American Bar Association has rated Judge Ebinger as “Unanimously Qualified” for the nomination. She began her career with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa, serving as a Special Assistant United States Attorney, from 2004 to 2006. From 2006 to 2008, she served as a law clerk to Judge Michael Joseph Melloy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. From 2009 to 2011, she served as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Division of the United States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Iowa. Since 2012, she has served as a State District Judge in Iowa's Judicial Election District 5C. She was appointed to this position by Governor Branstad in November 2012, and she was retained in 2014 for a term that expires on December 31, 2020. ###
02.03.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) hearing entitled “Implementation of the Decision to Open All Ground Combat Units to Women”, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) raised important questions to defense officials on the military’s implementation strategy and timetable of their recently announced gender integration strategy to open all military occupations and positions, including combat roles, to women without any exception. Witnesses included Honorable Raymond E. Mabus, Jr. (Secretary of the Navy), Honorable Patrick J. Murphy (Under Secretary of the Army), General Mark A. Milley, USA (Chief of Staff of The United States Army), and General Robert B. Neller, USMC (Commandant of The United States Marine Corps). Senator Ernst, a combat veteran, made clear that she “fully support[s] providing women the opportunity to serve in any military capacity. As long as standards are not lowered, [and] our combat effectiveness is maintained. But in order to ensure women are fully integrated into these previously closed positions, the implementation strategy must be fully developed and methodically and deliberately carried out.” Ernst added, “These are the men, and will be, the women who meet our enemies in close combat. Their lives depend on it. That is why over the past few weeks I have visited Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Marine Core Base Quantico, Virginia to speak directly with Army and Marine infantrymen about this topic.” Senator Ernst shared some of the concerns from Marines and asked whether the panelist share these concerns. She said, in part: “As you know, some of our female Marines have voiced concerns that they anticipate there will be pressure to lower standards if not enough of them are able to qualify to serve in combat positions. While I’m glad that lowering the standards for greater female participation is against your best military advice, I agree with these women that pressure may come, likely from civilian leadership who may have motives other than supporting gender integration to enhance our nation’s ability to destroy our enemies on the battlefield. Also, in order to boost participation, some female Marines have voiced that leadership and training will not solve physiological differences between men and women, and some are worried that they will be involuntary assigned to combat MOS’s or even assigned to an infantry unit in a support position which would require them to meet the higher physical standards for infantry units. Do you share these concerns, sir, and what concerns do you have regarding the retention of our best female marines who may now be assigned to combat arms, MOS, or units?” Ernst encouraged “all of the members of this panel - and our witnesses - to go talk to our servicemembers, hear for yourselves what their concerns are, and help ensure we ultimately get this right.” Click here to read Senator Ernst’s statement for the record. In addition, Senator Ernst also asked Secretary Mabus, about recent reports that the Director of Naval Intelligence has not had an active clearance for over two years.

As long as standards are not lowered, our combat effectiveness is maintained. But in order to ensure women are fully integrated into these previously closed positions, the implementation strategy must be fully developed and methodically and deliberately carried out. It must include an understanding of second and third order effects to ensure that we do not set women or men up for failure. These are the men, and will be the women, who meet our enemies in close combat. Their lives depend on it. That is why over the past few weeks I have visited Fort Bragg, North Carolina and Marine Core Base Quantico, Virginia to speak directly with Army and Marine infantrymen about this topic. I spoke with groups comprised mostly of mid to senior level NCOs and Junior Officers, the servicemembers who over the past 14 years of war, have met the enemy in close combat, and who will do so again in the future with their female counterparts. After those conversations, it is clear that we need to ensure that we are taking into account the impacts on women’s health, lodging, physiological differences between men and women which could lead to female physical fitness test scores on average being lower than their male counterparts, and how that could affect their ability to compete for promotions, schools, and senior command positions. I would encourage all of the members of this panel, and our witnesses, to go talk to our servicemembers, hear for yourselves what their concerns are, and help ensure we ultimately get this right. Our combat arm soldiers and Marines are the best we have. They have taken the majority of causalities since the founding of our nation, and on battlefields from Yorktown, Gettysburg, Iwo Jima, and Normandy. They have made the difference between Americans enjoying life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or being subjugated by foreign powers. Their lives mostly involve suffering and hardship, and they honorably carry that physical and mental burden not only in service, but afterwards as well. We must honor them by ensuring this process moves forward in a thoughtful and methodical way. General Neller, I‘d like to start with you, sir. As you know, some of our female Marines have voiced concerns that they anticipate there will be pressure to lower standards if not enough of them are able to qualify to serve in combat positions. While I’m glad that lowering the standards for greater female participation is against your best military advice, I agree with these women that pressure may come, likely from civilian leadership who may have motives other than supporting gender integration to enhance our nation’s ability to destroy our enemies on the battlefield. Also, in order to boost participation, some female Marines have voiced that leadership and training will not solve physiological differences between men and women, and some are worried that they will be involuntary assigned to combat MOS’s or even assigned to an infantry unit in a support position which would require them to meet the higher physical standards for infantry units. Do you share these concerns, sir, and what concerns do you have regarding the retention of our best female marines who may now be assigned to combat arms, MOS, or units? GEN. NELLER: Well, Senator, as the committee members in unanimity have talked about today, we have to do everything possible to not lower standards. In fact, we should be looking at how we can raise the standards to improve our capability. Right now, there is no intent to involuntarily assign anybody who wants to compete in these MOS’s. A little more problematic is the assignment of a Marine in a non-combat MOS, but assigned to one of these units, because in the past, because it was restricted to men, we didn’t ask a communicator or a supply Marine if they wanted to go to an infantry battalion. So we have established an assignment policy, which has a minimum physical standard, before we would do that. So we’re working our way through that, and that’s part of the implementation process, but we’re aware of that, that that’s kind of an outlier that wasn’t considered as part of this decision. As far as career progression, there are a lot of things we don’t know, and we’re going to find out and we will have to continue to monitor. We’re looking at this as a decade minimum long study to see how this all turns out, what effect is there on propensity to enlist? Propensity to reenlist? What is the competiveness for promotion? What’s the injury rate? Not just for all marines, because we really haven’t looked at this in the past, because there were enough people, and there are still enough people. So, those are concerns, but they’re concerns about something we don’t know the answer to. So there are a lot of different views as you found when you talked to people. So we’re taking all this into consideration. We’re going to try to mitigate as much of this as we can, and then we’ll come back and report and we’ll keep the data and we’ll be able to have a better analytical view on how this is all working as we go through this in a very methodical, objective way. But, the three lenses we’re looking at through this whole process is the mission, you know the effectiveness and readiness of the unit, the health and welfare of all the Marines, and the ability to manage the talent. I think one of the things that I’m confident is going to be, in fact I know it’s already happened, is the assignment of female marines to previously restricted units and the MOS’s that they have. In the past, if you were an infantry Armor Battalion Commander in the best pick an MOS, Intelligence Officer, Communications Officer, Motor Transport Officer, in the division was a women, she couldn’t work in your unit. So now you actually have the opportunity to have her serve with you. The talent pool has expanded and that should make the unit better. SEN. ERNST: Very good. Thank you, General. General Milley, many of the command positions with those positions, most of our army senior leaders have served in various elite units, yourself included, you have served in Special Forces capacity, many of those advancing to very high levels within the Army have served in Ranger Regiment and other high-performing infantry-type units. While there have been three female graduates of Ranger School in the Army, which I applaud, I think that’s tremendous, the unfortunate truth is an infantry officer without a ranger tab is often looked down upon by their fellow infantry men, and tab-less infantry officers are often not as competitive for senior leadership positions, just like many of those that will serve in these elite type units with very, very high standards. So as you branch female officers to infantry, and potentially accept branch transfers for captains and field grade officers, how will this affect their ability to integrate into the infantry community and be competitive for those higher levels of command? GEN. MILLEY: Couple of points, Senator. One, is you’re correct, there’s an institutional bias, especially in the infantry if you don’t have a ranger tab on career progression. So we encourage all infantry officers to attend Ranger school, very demanding school, as you well know. For women, it’d be the same thing, if they go in the infantry, we’d encourage them to go to Ranger School, because it does enhance your performance and skills, but it also enhances your credibility with peers, superiors, and your subordinates as well. So Ranger School is a very important school, especially for the infantry. As far as long-term career progression goes, the core business, the C-O-R-E business of the United States Army, is to close with and destroy the enemies of our country in close combat, and that means infantry and armor supported by attack aviation and aviation incumbent engineers. But infantry and armor is the very essence of the United States Army, and those, as we know and we’re here discussing, those have been previously closed. So as the senior officers of the Army over many, many years have been infantry and armor officers, because that’s the essence of the business so to speak. So I would expect over time, 25 -35 years sort of time, we’ll see women in infantry and armor units eventually rise to command. We opened up Apache helicopters 25 years ago, and recently we now have Apache battalion commanders that are female. So I think the same phenomena will occur over an extended period of time. SEN.ERNST: Very good, gentleman. I appreciate that. I do have one question, and I would just like a response for the record follow up. But, Secretary Mabus, I was disturbed to read that the Director of Naval Intelligence has not had an active clearance for over two years. Your decision to keep him in a position with such great responsibility without access to critical information sets a terrible example for our sailors and makes a travesty out of naval intelligence and our national security. And, for the record, I’d like to know what is preventing you from having a sailor with an active security clearance in this position today, and I would like a follow up on that, sir. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. SEN. MCCAIN: You want to respond now? SEC. MABUS: Senator, I’m as frustrated as you are about this particular individual. There have been, there is an investigation ongoing, we have no information one way or the other as to whether anything improper happened, but because of the sensitive place that he occupied, I felt that I had to withdraw his access to classified information until the investigation was finished. The investigation has drug on and on and on, and we are in the process of putting up another officer to take that person’s place. SEN. ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Two years is a very long time not to have access, and I do believe there should have been another officer assigned to that billet. SEC. MABUS: Senator, I agree with you, this has been a very long, very drawn out process and it has been frustrating for everybody involved. ###
02.03.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today introduced the Female Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, in response to the alarming increases in suicide among female veterans detailed in a recent Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) study. The bill requires the VA to include specific metrics on female veterans in its annual evaluation of mental health and suicide prevention programs and requires them to identify which programs are the most effective and have the highest satisfaction rates among female veterans. Researchers tracked over 174,000 veteran and nonveteran suicides from 2000 to 2010 and found that the rate of suicide among female veterans increased 40 percent during that time period. The data also revealed that women veterans-who now account for ten percent of the veteran population-commit suicide at nearly six times the rate of civilian women. The risk doubles for young female veterans between 18-29 years old. "It is shocking to learn that women veterans are committing suicide at nearly six times the rate of civilian women," Senator Boxer said. "Our bill will focus attention on which VA mental health and suicide prevention programs are working and which are not, so we can better serve the women who courageously served our country." "One veteran's life lost to suicide is too many," said Senator Ernst. "By narrowing in on the mental health and suicide prevention programs available to our female veterans, we can ensure our returning veterans have access to quality care that meets their unique needs to transition back into civilian life." "The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which became law last year, was a critical down payment ‎toward making sure VA has the resources it needs to prevent veteran suicide." Senator Blumenthal said. "This new, bipartisan measure is an important next step in ensuring VA provides the mental health and suicide prevention programs that meet the gender-specific needs of women veterans. With suicide among women veterans happening at an alarming rate, this bill will help save lives by ensuring VA is providing the care, counseling and outreach these veterans need." "Improving access to quality mental health care programs and professionals is a critical part of supporting our veterans when they return home," Senator Brown said. "This bill will ensure that the VA tailors mental health programs to more effectively serve female veterans." There are more than two million women veterans in the United States, making them the fastest growing subpopulation of veterans treated by the VA. While the VA has made strides to improve and expand mental health and suicide prevention programs aimed at women, there is no gender-specific data available on the efficacy of these programs. Similar legislation authored by Congresswoman Julia Brownley (CA-26) passed out of the House Veterans Affairs Committee in September 2015. ###
02.02.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. -- U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) submitted the following statement for the record to the Senate Armed Services Committee ahead of today's hearing, "Implementation of the Decision to Open All Ground Combat Units to Women": Joni K. Ernst United States Senator Statement for the Record Committee on Armed Services Hearing February 2, 2016 As I have said on numerous occasions, I fully support providing women the opportunity to serve in any military capacity, as long as standards are not lowered and it enhances our combat effectiveness. However, I remain concerned that some within the Administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, are rushing toward this historical change in policy without much concern for the second and third order effects to our men and women in uniform and our combat capabilities. In order to ensure women are fully integrated into these previously closed positions, the implementation strategy must be fully developed, and methodically and deliberately implemented, to include having an understanding of second and third order effects to ensure we do not set women, or men, up for failure. These are the men, and will be the women, who meet our enemies in close combat—their lives depend on it. Over the past few weeks, I have visited Fort Bragg, NC and Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia to speak with Soldiers and Marines about this topic. During my trip to Fort Bragg, I sat down with special operations soldiers and paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division to discuss gender integration. At Quantico, I had the same open discussion with Marine infantrymen and scout snipers. Both of these groups comprised mostly of mid to senior level NCOs and junior officers—the servicemembers who over the past 14 years of war have met the enemy in close combat—and who will do so again in the future with their female counterparts. Our discussions began with the understanding that gender integration is the new policy, and now it is time to move forward. Primarily, these young Soldiers and Marines were concerned that gender integration was not being done for the right reasons—to enhance their combat capabilities—and instead as a social experiment. To this point, even as a supporter of gender integration, I share their concern due to the haphazard way this process has been led by some in DoD’s civilian leadership. This was especially troubling as we witnessed a distinguished military leader muzzled, inappropriate comments from civilian leadership about our female Marines, and disturbing, unmerited, and unprofessional assertions that our Marine leaders do not value the service of our female Marines. The other primary concern expressed by these Soldiers and Marines was the implementation strategy, for which I also share their concern. This Congress is being asked to support a policy for which the implementation strategy—which is key to ensuring our military will maintain its combat effectiveness—has not yet been fully developed or revealed. Nor has it taken into account the impacts on women’s health, lodging, physiological differences between men and women which could lead to female physical fitness test scores, on average, being lower than their male counterparts, and how that could affect their ability to compete for promotions, schools, and senior command positions. For example with command positions, most of our Army senior leaders have served in elite units during their time as junior and field grade officers—which is often key to being slotted into command positions from battalion commander and above. GEN Milley is a Special Forces veteran, and others have served in the elite 75th Ranger Regiment like the Army Vice Chief of Staff, LTG John Nicholson—who may be confirmed as the next commander of our troops in Afghanistan, our next potential CENTCOM commander, the 18th Airborne Corps Commander, and division commanders of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions, the 10th Mountain Division, and 3rd Infantry Division. Also, while there have been three female graduates of Ranger School in the Army, the unfortunate truth is an Infantry officer without a Ranger tab is often looked down upon by their fellow infantrymen, and tab-less Infantry officers are often not as competitive for senior leadership positions. In the Marine Corps, some of our female Marines have voiced concerns that they anticipate there will be pressure to lower standards if not enough of them are able to qualify to serve in combat positions. Lowering standards for more female participation is against the best military advice of our military leaders, but I agree with these women that the pressure will come—likely from civilian leadership—who have motives other than supporting gender integration to enhance our nation’s ability to destroy our enemies on the battlefield. Female Marines have also voiced that leadership and training will not solve physiological differences between men and women, and some are worried that they will be involuntary assigned to combat MOSs or even assigned to an infantry unit in a support position which would require them to meet the higher physical standards for infantry units. Furthermore, retention of female Marines and their ability to continue to serve if they are injured while serving in a combat position is an area of concern for some of them. The data is clear—women do get injured at a higher rate than their male counterparts when performing combat arms tasks. Will we allow women to continue to serve in another role or will we medically discharge them if they are injured while serving in a combat position or combat unit? If it becomes commonplace that female combat arms Marines are injured while training, how will that impact unit cohesion, especially for those who will be platoon and company commanders? After nearly 15 years of war, our country, and many within this Administration, are disconnected from our combat soldiers who have borne the brunt of the battle. These Soldiers and Marines are the best we have. They have taken the majority of the casualties since the founding of our nation and on battlefields from Yorktown, Gettysburg, Iwo Jima, and Normandy—they have made the difference between Americans enjoying life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or being subjugated by foreign powers. Their life is one of mostly suffering and hardship, and they honorably carry that mental and physical burden not only in service, but afterwards as well. We must honor them by ensuring this process moves forward in a thoughtful and methodical way. ###
01.28.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed witnesses on U.S. dependency on Russian-made rocket engines, RD-180s, used for national security space launches. These launch systems provide space capabilities for military operations, including navigation, threat assessments, strategic and tactical communications within our intelligence communities, as well as diplomatic engagements. The Iowa Senator sought answers as to why the Department of Defense has not addressed, until now, the national security risk posed by Russia’s ability to withhold the RD-180 engines. Ernst concluded, “We can’t let this happen again. You’ve spoken many times over about the American taxpayer, they expect much better from us. We have to do better… I think we need to develop our own technology as quickly as possible.” Witnesses on the panel included Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, Honorable Frank Kendall III, and Secretary of the Air Force, Honorable Deborah Lee James. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair, Thank you to Secretary James and Secretary Kendall for being here as well. I think you’ve heard today, we’re all just very disappointed in the way the process has gone so far. We have an opportunity now to move forward in a different direction, so I’m not going to hammer so much that but the fact that I’m assuming for decades the air force has known that the RD-180 could be withheld by the Russians at some point, so why is the solution just now being addressed? I would have thought this is something that should have been a part of our discussion years and years and years ago. Can somebody explain that to me? HON. KENDALL: It actually has been part of our discussion. I think this predates Secretary James’ return to the department. We have looked at budget issues to remove the dependency of the RD-180 but in the funding climate we’ve been in, for the last several years, it’s been unaffordable to the department. Now, when the Crimean events occurred that all changed and it became obvious that we could no longer accept the risk of the continued alliance of the RD-180. So I think we’re all in agreement now that we need to get off it as quickly as possible. Prior to that point in time we had consciously considered investing money to remove the RD-180 and develop a U.S. alternative but it had not made the budget cuts, frankly given the funding situation we had. SEN. ERNST: Okay. Was that an issue of Congress, or was that a departmental decision? HON. KENDALL: That was within the department. SEN. ERNST: Okay. Should the air force have started a replacement engine program then long ago before it became so critical? Wasn’t that a discussion that should have come to congress? HON. KENDALL: With hindsight we obviously should have. The expectation was that relationships with Russia were, after the end of the cold war, were going to be relatively benign. That has not turned out to be the case. SEN. ERNST: Okay. And just so we don’t repeat this error in judgment and I think we need to look at many of our acquisition programs and the way we do business across the board, not just this particular propulsion system, but we need to take some lessons learned here and move forward. But who in DOD, if anyone, should have been responsible for conducting the long-term planning and architectural development for the national security space enterprise including launch? Is there one person? Who is that? How is that structured? SEC. JAMES: Well I would say today, if there is a single person, it would be me. And I’m, in addition to being Secretary of the Air Force, is the Principle Defense Space Advisor, so that means my job is to, in a joint fashion, look not only at the Air Force, but look at the entirety of our budgets because of course there is Army space, there is some Navy space as well, to be able to work across the requirements community, and I don’t do all of this by myself, I don’t mean to suggest that, but to be a single point of contact who can then make independent advice to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary. But again, that’s a new development. If you’re going back in time, there probably were too many voices, and no single independent voice that could reach across and provide that advice. SEN. ERNST: And are there communications now, then, between yourself and the other service branches? SEC. JAMES: Yes, there are. I chair what’s called the Defense Space Council. I am Principle Advisor now to the Deputy and Secretary in terms of what we call the DMAG, which is where all of the important money discussions occur as we are building our POM and finalizing our budget and so on, so, there is additional authorities of late. SEN ERNST: Okay, and can you describe that process then to me because I am not familiar with that, how you do interact with the other services, and is this something we need to be aware of, any types of these situations that might happen with funding any other branches as well? SEC. JAMES: There certainly always crop up issues of policy and issues of funding across the Department of Defense. But my role now, as the Principle Defense Space Advisor, is to stay well-coordinated with the others, and even though at times I might be asked to go against my own Air Force budget, that is my job. That is my role to be able to rise above that and act in a joint way, and be that independent voice. SEN. ERNST: Okay, well my time is running short, but I think communication is very key here, and when these things do crop up, it is important that we engage Congress as well. We can’t let this happen again. You’ve spoken many times over about the American taxpayer—they expect much better from us. We have to do better. So, lessons learned. We need to move forward at this point, and I think we need to develop our own technology as quickly as possible. But, I thank you both for your time. Thank you, Mr. Chair. ###
01.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned the Secretary of the Army nominee, Honorable Eric K. Fanning, on the military’s implementation timetable of their gender integration policy. The hearing comes on the heels of Senator Ernst’s recent visits to Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, and Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where she visited the installations to hear firsthand from those who ultimately engage our nation’s enemies in close combat—our Army and Marine infantrymen and special operations soldiers—about the path forward to ensure gender integration ultimately is effective for our national defense. During the hearing, Senator Ernst questioned Fanning, as to whether he had talked through gender integration with soldiers yet. The Iowa Senator also stressed, “In order to ensure that women are fully integrated into these previously closed positions, I believe the implementation strategy must be thoroughly and fully developed, to include having an understanding of those secondary and tertiary effects so that we’re not setting our women or our men up for failure.” This follows the U.S. Department of Defense’s announcement to open all military occupations and positions, including combat roles, to women without any exception. Senator Ernst responded with a cautionary sentiment that this “must be a military decision, and not a political one.” Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair, thank you Mr. Fanning for being here today and for your service in so many different capacities throughout our various departments. I want to thank your mother for joining us today as well, thank you Kathy for being here. As you know, Mr. Fanning, last month Secretary Carter announced that all military occupational specialties will be open to women. I do support providing women with various opportunities to serve in any capacity, as long as we are not lowering standards to allow participation and that we are not decreasing our combat effectiveness. So, in order to ensure that women are fully integrated into these previously closed positions, I believe the implementation strategy must be thoroughly and fully developed to include having an understanding of those secondary and tertiary effects so that we are not setting our women or our men up for failure. Over the past few weeks, I’ve had the opportunity to visit with a number of soldiers and Marines. I’ve visited Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, as well as Marine Base Quantico in Virginia, and during my trip to Ft. Bragg, I was able to sit down with a number of special operators and airborne paratroopers from the 82nd to discuss the gender integration, and I did the same at Quantico. Both of these groups were mostly senior level NCO’s, some more junior and non-commission officers, and, of course, some junior officers, both men and women, and really talked about gender integration. Have you had the opportunity to go out and talk through gender integration with soldiers, and are you committed to doing that if you have not? HON. FANNING: I have, and I have been to Ft. Benning, Ft. Bragg, Ft. Hood, and I spent a lot of time at Benning in particular, discussing this issue, down at a ranger school. And if confirmed, it would be a dialogue I would continue to have because I share your view that we need to get this right. It is critical that we get this right. SEN. ERNST: Absolutely, and I think we have to again make sure that we are planning wisely, and that we are understanding what any follow-on effects will be, whether it is positive or whether it is negative as well. One of the top concerns I’ve heard about the implementation is that it shouldn’t be done haphazardly, and we have seen this recently with short terms of getting plans turned in and short turn around for implementation and I’m directing those comments at the Marines. But we want to make sure that the Army does it right. We want to make sure everybody does it right. Do you think that having such a quick turnaround of 15 days for a plan to work that out, do you think that’s enough time to get it right? HON. FANNING: I haven’t seen the Marine Corps plan or any guidance they have been given. I will say that I think getting this right means doing it methodically, deliberately, and however much time it takes to get it right. And the Army plan as I saw it before I left is just that—it is a long term plan that I think is carefully thought through, starting with validated requirements for an entry man, for example. What requirements do you need to meet to do the job at entry man, and if you can meet the requirements, then we can start from there. But I don’t believe in the Army plan, and all of the plans are with the Secretary of Defense for review, you are going to see anything that looks like a rush to judgment. SEN. ERNST: I am very hopeful of that. HON. FANNING: That would set us back, set back the opportunities for women and take us more time in the end. SEN. Ernst: Yes and I agree with that, we do have to be very methodical and talk about the implications of the standards and what that might do to orders of merit lists and promotion opportunities. Are we setting our women back or moving them forward? We don’t know what those implications are yet. So, I appreciate your thoughtful approach to that. Also, do you believe that women now that we’ve opened up those areas—combat—do you believe that women should be required to register for the selective service? HON. FANNING: Senator, I think that’s something that the administration has taken up and is looking for a recommendation for Secretary Carter, so I can’t get out front of him. I will say if we are focused on equal opportunity, I think a part of that is equal responsibility. SEN. ERNST: Okay thank you. I do appreciate your thoughtful manner as we work with our soldiers in the Army. I also want to echo—I know Senator Sullivan—had spoken earlier about the 425 and we want to make sure that we are protecting our assets in the Pacific Northwest, that is of great concern, many of us have talked that through, and so I would appreciate your consideration with that as well. Thank you Ranking Member Reid, and thank you Mr. Fanning. # # #
01.22.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today addressed tens of thousands of people from across the country at this year’s March for Life rally. At the rally, Senator Ernst discussed this year’s theme: “Pro-Life And Pro-Woman Go Hand-In-Hand.” Senator Ernst speaks to the crowd at March for Life Following is the full text of Senator Ernst’s remarks as prepared for delivery: “Good afternoon! “First, let me say that there is no place I would rather be on this cold January day! “I am honored to be here today not only to stand, but to march, to protect the most vulnerable of our society. “Thank you all – including those I met this morning from the great State of Iowa and all of the young future leaders in the crowd – for getting in your cars, boarding trains and planes, putting on your coats and gloves, and fighting for life. “Over the last year, thank you for helping me fight to remind those in Washington that we are a nation that protects life. “Thank you for helping me to fight in Washington to shine a light on the lack of compassion shown by Planned Parenthood for women and their babies. “And thank you for helping me fight to remind those in Washington that we are a nation that will stand up and together say ‘we can and must do better!’ “The theme of this year’s march is ‘Pro-Life and Pro-Woman Go Hand-in-Hand.’ “It is such an important message. “Many of those fighting against us have claimed that our efforts to defend and protect life at all stages of development constitute a ‘War on Women.’ “I reject that. “I am a woman and I have been to war, and let me be clear, pro-life policies are no ‘War on Women.’ “Rather, to me, being pro-life means that you have a deep respect for the miracle of life and a woman’s unique ability to bring life into this world. “Being pro-life means you recognize the joint responsibility of a mother, father, and society at large to protect and nurture each and every life from the moment that it is created, and you see abortion as a reflection of our collective failure to meet that responsibility – and not as a litmus test for the advancement of women’s rights. “Being pro-life means you reject the notion that the loss of millions of babies through abortion honors the civil liberties, independence, or strength of a woman. “Being pro-life means you mourn the thousands of baby girls – and boys – that are lost each year to abortion in the United States, and you believe we should cherish women and girls equally at every stage of their development. “Look around you. As you can see by the crowd assembled here today – many of us are mothers, grandmothers, sisters – pro-life and pro-woman does indeed go hand-in-hand. “In my first year in office, I have tried to embody that important message. “As you may know, I have been leading the fight to safeguard taxpayer dollars for women’s health care by redirecting them from Planned Parenthood, which is the nation’s single largest provider of abortion, and instead providing them to other eligible entities like community health centers, which provide greater health care services but do not provide abortions. “Thanks to your support, earlier this month, Congress was able to put legislation on the President’s desk to defund Planned Parenthood. “I have also joined my colleagues in support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in an effort to ban abortions after five months of pregnancy – a stage of development at which evidence shows unborn babies can feel pain. “The day I took to the Senate floor to speak in favor of the bill, I had the opportunity to meet an adorable little three-year old boy from Newton, Iowa named Micah Pickering. Micah was born prematurely at just five months of development. As Micah joyfully ran around my office, his mother and father explained to me that they know Micah was just as full of life when he was born as he is now. “As Micah proved, an unborn baby in its 5th month of development is not just a clump of cells – they have ten fingers and ten toes, they can feel pain, and they can survive outside the womb. “It’s what we all know. Life is precious, and we are a country that stands for life. In order to rise and meet that commitment, we must protect the most vulnerable in our society – particularly those who cannot protect themselves. “As a mother and a grandmother, thank you for joining me here today and every day to stand, speak, and march for life.” ###
01.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – As a founding member of the Senate’s bipartisan Post 9/11 Veterans Caucus, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today took part in the caucus’ “Veterans and Agriculture Briefing” along with Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY). The Iowa Senator also invited former Navy SEAL and Iowa bison farmer, Jathan Chicoine, to speak on the panel. Chicoine now serves as the Veterans Services Coordinator at Iowa State University and also raises bison on his family farm outside of Ames. In her opening remarks Senator Ernst stressed the importance of initiatives that connect veterans to jobs in agriculture, “I have had a lot of veterans that have come to me and express interest in agricultural areas because of the connection between what they are doing in the service and the applicability of those skills when it comes to agriculture.” The Senator added that her goal for the event was to “highlight some of the wonderful initiatives that are out there connecting veterans to careers in agriculture.” Mr. Chicoine noted that jobs in agriculture are particularly beneficial to veterans, "Many veterans find purpose in being a part of something larger than themselves. Agriculture seems to be a natural fit, as it allows many of us to continue serving society in meaningful ways." Senator Joni Ernst meets with former Navy SEAL and Iowa bison farmer Jathan Chicoine from Iowa. Other panelists included Major General James Hoyer (Adjutant General, West Virginia National Guard), James McCormick (Director, West Virginia Veterans & Warriors Agriculture Project), and Lanon Baccam (Deputy Under Secretary, Farm and Foreign Agriculture Services and Military Veterans Agriculture Liaison). In addition, panelists stressed that 40 percent of veterans come from rural America and often have trouble gaining access to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Administration hospitals, an issue of great concern to Senator Ernst. Last October, Senator Ernst introduced the Veterans E-Health Telemedicine Support Act (VETS Act) to improve health care access for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telemedicine services offered by the VA across state lines.

01.21.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting to override President Obama’s veto of her bipartisan resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to eliminate the expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule: “Today, I led a bipartisan majority in the Senate and voted to override President Obama’s reckless veto of my resolution to scrap the expanded WOTUS rule. This was an important opportunity to stand up for our farmers, ranchers, small businesses and manufacturers across our state who say this misguided rule threatens their very livelihoods. “I’m disappointed that President Obama and Senate Democrats have repeatedly ignored the legitimate concerns raised by folks across the country who are directly impacted by the WOTUS rule and chose instead to stand with an unchecked federal agency in Washington, D.C. “I will not stand idly by and allow mounting overregulation to overwhelm the commonsense voice of hardworking Americans. While I am deeply disappointed by today’s outcome, I remain committed to fighting for those across our state who are negatively impacted by this reckless rule.” Click here or the image below to watch Senator Ernst speak on the Senate floor on the need to override the President’s veto of S.J. Res. 22. Senator Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Vowed to remain committed to identifying new ways to push back against the WOTUS rule. Praised the bipartisan passage in both chambers of her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule. Applauded Senate passage of her resolution of disapproval to scrap the WOTUS rule which passed with bipartisan majority support. Spoke on the floor of the Senate to urge support for her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. Cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and direction for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders. Denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. Introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. Invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa. See map below: ###
01.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following consideration by the Senate Agriculture Committee, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today expressed her support for the Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016: “The bipartisan Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act provides meaningful reforms that scale back some of the burdensome federal requirements for school lunches, return broad program oversight to local and state authorities, and safeguard taxpayer dollars. “I’ve heard firsthand from Iowans that the meals being served and consumed by our students under current standards unnecessarily tie the hands of local schools. This bill would give our states and local schools greater flexibility to implement meal standards that work best for the countless number of children who depend on school lunch nutrition. “I am proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure our students have the needed quality child nutrition programs now and for future generations.” The Improving Child Nutrition Integrity and Access Act of 2016 passed out of committee today by a voice vote and now heads to the Senate floor. ###
01.20.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in support of the American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act (H.R. 4038): “For months, top national security officials in the Obama administration have raised concerns about the capacity of ISIS to exploit the refugee crisis and the limitations of our security vetting process. While the United States has a proud tradition of accepting refugees into our country, we must make every effort to confidently ensure that any refugee seeking to enter the United States does not pose a security threat to American citizens. “This bill takes the necessary steps by first requiring the FBI to certify the background investigation of each refugee, and then requiring the FBI Director, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Director of National Intelligence to certify to Congress before we admit a refugee into the United States that the refugee does not pose a security threat to the United States. “In addition to this important legislation, we must also focus on addressing the underlying, root cause of this international humanitarian crisis – President Obama’s failed policies against ISIS. Until President Obama presents a comprehensive plan to destroy ISIS, the refugee crisis will continue and our country’s security will remain at risk. Congress should also debate a new AUMF, which would be an important step toward achieving a serious bipartisan solution to destroy ISIS and those radicalized by the terrorist organization. The AUMF would give President Obama the authorization to fully engage, defeat, and destroy ISIS, wherever they are.” Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces. ###
01.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined the entire Iowa congressional delegation, led by Iowa Congressman David Young, in calling on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to propose 2017 ethanol and 2018 biodiesel Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) consistent with enacted law. The letter, signed by Iowa Congressmen David Young, Rod Blum, Steve King, and Dave Loebsack, and Iowa Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, was sent to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. It urged the EPA to use this year as an opportunity to commit to getting the RFS back on track, and pointed to Iowa's role as the premier renewable fuels producer in the nation. The letter also highlighted the critical need for the RFS, which works to provide consumers with fuel choices, increase energy independence, boost rural economies, and protect the environment. “Our agricultural base in Iowa, serving as feedstock for ethanol and biodiesel production, has near record supplies of excess corn,” the members of Congress wrote. “In addition, low oil prices spurred surging fuel demand and large retailers of gasoline are embracing higher ethanol blends. Furthermore, the United States is importing record amounts of foreign biodiesel from countries like Argentina and Canada, despite growing domestic capacity.” “Because of these reasons, the EPA should announce a 2017 level for conventional biofuels at 15 billion gallons and set an aggressive biomass-based diesel level for 2018, the letter continued. “We believe the statutory levels are more than achievable in the coming year.” The full letter is available here. ###
01.19.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after President Obama vetoed her bipartisan resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to eliminate the expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule: “During his State of the Union address, President Obama pledged a willingness to work with Congress on regulations and this legislation presented a great opportunity to do exactly that. Unfortunately, less than a week later, we see a President who is reneging on that commitment. “Instead, the President chose to side with an unchecked federal agency and empower unelected Washington bureaucrats to expand their authority to control what’s done on private land. It is clear President Obama did not take into account the comments, perspectives and legitimate concerns raised by those whom this expanded WOTUS rule directly impacts. “We all want clean water – that is not disputable. I have continuously emphasized that the water we drink needs to be clean and safe. However, this rule is not about clean water. Rather, it is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land. “This ill-conceived rule breeds uncertainty and confusion, while adding more red tape that threatens the livelihoods of many in Iowa and across the country. In fact, this rule would give the EPA extensive power to regulate water on 97 percent of the land in the state of Iowa. In addition, this invasive EPA power grab could cost our job creators up to $465 million per year. We cannot allow mounting unnecessary environmental regulations to overwhelm the commonsense voice of hardworking Americans. “We must stand up for those in our rural communities and hold our government accountable. I remain committed to identifying new ways to push back against this complex, burdensome and overreaching rule.” Senator Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Praised the bipartisan passage in both chambers of her resolution of disapproval to eliminate the expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule.

01.14.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed the nominee for the Inspector General (IG) of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Mr. Michael J. Missal, along with the nominee for Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, the Honorable Carolyn N. Lerner, emphasizing the critical importance of timely oversight, accountability, and protection of whistleblowers within the VA. Senator Ernst stressed “as we have seen all too many times in the past that there has not been the follow-up necessary, and those months delay could mean another veteran that has been left untreated or another veteran that takes their own life because of the lack of care provided by the VA. So we do have to be vigilant in this oversight and it quite literally is a matter of life and death.” Last June during a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, the Iowa Senator called attention to the prolonged vacancy of the VA Inspector General position and its impact, "I do have the responsibility to ensure that those veterans are receiving adequate care… but the only way we can do this is to have efficient and motivated IGs and especially one in the VA that can be held accountable.” In addition, Senator Ernst joined a bipartisan group of Senators in sending multiple letters to President Obama calling on him to immediately nominate a permanent VA IG, amid ongoing reports of mismanagement at the department. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you very much, it is so nice to have you both in front of us today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling for this nomination process. I want to thank your families as well for joining you today. It takes a lot to put that on their shoulders as well. And for those that came from the OSC, we want to thank you for your very important work. You can tell this is not the Veterans Committee, but you can tell that the members of this committee are very, very passionate about the care that not only our veterans are provided through the VA healthcare system, but also those that see issues within that VA healthcare system, and protecting those whistleblowers and making sure that they are afforded the opportunity to speak out without reprisal. So, thank you again for the work that you are doing. Mr. Missal, it is good to see you again. I appreciate you taking the time before the holidays to sit down with me and my staff and talk through a number of these issues. Again, very passionate about the care that we provide to our veterans. It was actually last March when all of the members of this committee joined together in a letter to the President asking for a nominee to this position of Inspector General for the VA. So, we do need to act swiftly on this. I am very excited about this opportunity, and I, like a number of our other members--Chairman Johnson, you have had frustrations with the VA, Senator Baldwin—all of us have had specific frustrations with our own VA healthcare centers. Last February, I requested a review of the mental health care provided to an Iraq War veteran from the Des Moines area, a young man that committed suicide, and the VA IG’s office did not report back to me for many, many months. And again, this was a very serious situation. Again, a young man had taken his own life out of the frustration that he felt, and now the frustration that we all bear. So, again, it was months before they got back to my office, and my state staff has also reported to me that the VA OIG has failed to respond to their repeated, repeated request for an update on three cases. Now, three additional cases in Iowa that were opened last spring. So, this is not a one-time occurrence for any of us--repeated requests for information on cases that are going unanswered. And, can you please just repeat to me your commitment to all of us on this committee that you will assist us in our oversight responsibilities in a timely manner and keep us effectively informed on all OIG matters? MR. MISSAL: Senator, I recognize the important role an IG can play in assisting the committee and Congress in its oversight responsibility. I think you’ll find me highly communicative, that I would respond very quickly to requests. I may not always have the answer right away, it sometimes takes time to develop it, but I just believe it’s important to keep people informed of the progress so you know exactly what is going on. SEN. ERNST: That is wonderful, I appreciate that very much because, unfortunately, as we have seen all too many times in the past that there has not been the follow-up necessary, and those months delay could mean another veteran that has been left untreated or another veteran that takes their own life because of the lack of care provided by the VA, so we do have to be vigilant in this oversight and it quite literally is a matter of life and death. So, I just want to make sure that we all understand how important it is for timely response. I was a little appalled to learn during this committee’s hearing last September that the VA OIG investigates only a fraction of the approximately forty thousand complaints—forty thousand—that it gets annually, and I understand that both the VA OIG and the OSC are resource-constrained, but a top priority of both organizations should be ensuring that not one of these VA whistleblower complaints goes unresolved. And, so I would like to hear maybe your just very brief, your general thoughts on that. MR. MISSAL: Sure, I understand there are forty thousand contacts to the hotline a year, give or take there. I don’t know what they’re doing to triage those, how they decide which ones should rest, which ones are not. But that’s, again, one thing that I find very important. If there’s an issue out there that needs to be addressed, it needs to be addressed quickly, and figure out a way to find resources to at least initially address them and see what can be done. SEN. ERNST: Thank you. Ms. Lerner, just very briefly. HON. LERNER: Sure, let me tell you just briefly some of the steps that OSC has taken to prioritize VA cases. We have set up a triage system that prioritizes VA health and safety cases. So, any case involving health and safety, whether it’s a disclosure, or someone who claims retaliation for having reported a health and safety violation, those get a very quick look. We have a senior counsel who is assigned full-time to coordinate our VA cases. I have assigned one of my deputies to coordinate VA cases. They meet weekly with the VA team of employees at OSC that we created after we got this total influx of new cases. That team meets weekly. We have worked with the VA Office of General Counsel and Office of Accountability and Review to expedite the resolution of VA retaliation cases so that we can get quicker, better results without having to do a full investigation. So those are just some of the things that we are doing to prioritize VA cases at the OSC. SEN. ERNST: I appreciate it very much. ###
01.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. –U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to end the expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule today passed the House with bipartisan support. This momentum follows bipartisan passage in the Senate last November. The legislation now heads to President Obama’s desk. “Today’s House passage of my legislation to scrap the expanded WOTUS rule is a major step forward toward stopping this blatant EPA power grab. Our farmers and ranchers know how to care for and conserve their own land without the harmful interference of Washington bureaucrats from the EPA telling them what’s best. “President Obama must now decide between an unchecked federal agency or the livelihoods of those in our rural communities who say this rule must be stopped. “I will continue to fight for hardworking Americans who are harmed by the EPA’s overreach and today, Congress is calling on President Obama to do the same.” Senator Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Called out the EPA’s illegal use of taxpayer dollars to rally support for the harmful WOTUS rule.

01.13.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today joined Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” to discuss her disappointment in the President’s failure to present a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS in last night’s State of the Union address. She also noted that we need to not just contain ISIS, but destroy them. See the full video and excerpts below. Click here or on the image below to watch. KEY EXCERPTS: ERNST: “He really missed an opportunity last night to spell out a clear and concise strategy for defeating ISIS, but he seemed to just push it away and dismiss it in a manner that I didn’t appreciate as a veteran. I know a number of other folks didn’t. But again, we have to have a strategy coming from the White House, I’m willing to assist with that.” …. ERNST: “What the President has proposed is very different from what we would like to see in Congress. We really want to make sure that we are getting to the heart of the problem and allowing our troops to do what they do best, and that is to go after these terrorists and absolutely destroy them. You know, I’ve said before, I don’t want to see them contained, I don’t want to see them degraded, I want to see them destroyed, and I want to see them destroyed no matter where they exist.” …. ERNST: “…to first allow us to combat ISIS, there has to be an acknowledgment coming from the White House that we truly do have a problem and again last night he seemed to dismiss ISIS as not truly a threat to the United States, but I would argue that there is a valid threat out there and we need to do something about it. We do. I agree with the President that we do have the greatest military on the face of this planet but again, we have to be allowed to do our jobs as Congress, and that is work with the President on a solution. But he has to admit that it is a large problem.” ###
01.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s final State of the Union Address: “First and foremost, my thoughts and prayers are with the U.S. Navy sailors in Iranian custody. While I am disappointed the President did not provide an update tonight, I am hopeful they will be safely released immediately. “Furthermore, unfortunately President Obama’s speech tonight failed to address the troubling reality our country finds itself in near the end of his presidency. While an overwhelming majority of Americans believe the country is on the wrong track, the President doubled-down on his failed policies of the past from ObamaCare to more burdensome regulations, to restricting law-abiding Iowans’ Second Amendment rights. “Although national security is a top concern for many folks across the country, our Commander in Chief yet again ignored an opportunity to outline a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIS and fight terror at home and abroad. “As someone who served our nation at war, I believe President Obama owes it to the American people to be honest about the efforts necessary to defeat ISIS, and to match that honest assessment with a real strategy to accomplish the goal. “We must preserve the safety and security of the American people, which is why I will continue to urge President Obama to fully engage, defeat, and destroy ISIS wherever they are. “It is completely unacceptable that the President failed to present serious solutions to grow our economy and ensure that America remains a strong force around the globe. Americans deserve better.” ###
01.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today spoke on the floor of the United States Senate urging support of her legislation, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act – or SCRUB Act – which establishes a commission-based procedure to reduce the federal regulatory burden on the economy. The SCRUB Act recently passed the House with bipartisan support and awaits a vote in the Senate. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the “Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act” – more affectionately known as the SCRUB Act. This past summer, my colleague Senator Hatch and I introduced this legislation to help free American families and small businesses from the unnecessary burdens of our regulatory system. And I am pleased to mention that this bill passed the House last week on a bi-partisan basis. For too long, our nation’s innovators and employers have been trying to comply with a swath of outdated, duplicative, or obsolete regulations that hamper their growth and creativity. Many of these regulations also come with stacks of paperwork requirements that force our small businesses to spend time on filling in the blanks rather than filling in jobs. The SCRUB Act – would peel back these types of regulations so our businesses can focus on doing what they know best; innovating and creating jobs. The purpose of this bill is to take an objective and in-depth look at major regulations that are at least 15 years old and could be repealed because they have: (1) achieved their goal and there is no threat to the problem recurring; (2) technology or market changes have made the regulation unnecessary or; (3) they are ineffective or overlap with other federal or state regulations. For decades, lawmakers and presidents on both sides of the aisle have recognized the need to unleash our small businesses and job creators from rules and regulations that don’t make sense. You see, when new rules are proposed there is very little - if any - attention paid to how the new rule will work with the hundreds of other rules that came before it. This buildup of rules are a cumulative burden on our businesses which ultimately slows job growth and hits families that are already struggling to make ends meet even harder. In fact, according to one study - if the cost of all these regulations were considered an independent country – all of the costs of these rules and regulations - it would be about the 10th largest economy in the world. And let’s face it. The more expensive it becomes to make a product or deliver a service, the more money the consumer will have to dig out of their own pockets to pay for it. And it’s those families that are working multiple jobs to provide for their kids that are going to be hit the hardest. Mr. President, this bill is how we start to solve that problem. The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission to give a fair and thoughtful review of our nation’s existing regulations. Once the Commission is finished with their review, it would provide its recommendations to Congress and we would have an opportunity to vote on them. If an agency wants to impose a new regulation – they can do that under the SCRUB Act - but they would have to offset the cost of that new regulation by repealing an existing one that is of equal cost and has been deemed unnecessary or outdated by the Commission. I know Iowa families do this. They can prioritize. So why can’t our federal agencies? We simply cannot allow the buildup of unnecessary and costly regulations over time. I will end with just one last comment. Rules and regulations often have unintended consequences. It is our responsibility as lawmakers to not only recognize when this happens, but to then proactively fix it. The SCRUB Act is a common sense solution that forces lawmakers and our agencies to be honest about the regulatory system by fixing the rules that need fixing and dropping those that have outlived their useful purpose. I want to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this and urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation. # # #
01.12.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2015 (S.2232), legislation to audit the Federal Reserve: “The Federal Reserve has an enormous impact on the lives of Iowans and all Americans, and we must ensure that Congress and the public have enough information on its activities. “Current efforts do not provide adequate disclosure of the Federal Reserve’s most important functions, including managing interest rates and the money supply. Given the Federal Reserve’s increased role in the last financial crisis and their actions since, having congressional oversight and open access to this information is critical. “Iowans deserve transparency and accountability, so I’m disappointed some in the Senate would block this bipartisan measure that would pull back the curtain on the Federal Reserve’s activities.” ###
01.11.2016	WASHINGTON – U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) together with U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) today introduced bipartisan legislation to reinstate inurnment rights for Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) at Arlington National Cemetery (ANC). A recent policy change made by the Army now prevents WASPs, who flew domestic missions during World War II, from being inurned at ANC. Bipartisan companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives last week by U.S. Representatives Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) and Susan Davis (D-Calif.). “I’m deeply disappointed the Army continues to prevent the Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II from being laid to rest among our nation’s patriots in Arlington National Cemetery,” said Senator Mikulski, a member of the Senate Military Families Caucus. “If they were good enough to fly for our country, risk their lives and earn the Congressional Gold Medal, they should be good enough to be laid to rest at Arlington Cemetery. This legislation will right this wrong.” “This decision just doesn’t make sense. At a time when we are opening all positions to women, the Army is closing Arlington to the pioneers who paved the way,” said Congresswoman Martha McSally. “Army leadership has the authority to reverse this appalling decision immediately. But if they do not act, Congress will, and I look forward to continue working with our co-sponsors in the House and Senate to see this get done.” “On behalf of my grandmother Elaine Harmon, my family, and all the women of the WASP, I thank Senator Mikulski for championing this legislation in the Senate to recognize the important service of the WASP during World War II so that my family may finally be able to fulfill my grandmother's last request to be inurned at Arlington national cemetery and bring closure to our family,” said Erin Miller, granddaughter of Elaine Harmon. Between 1942 and 1944, the 1,102 women of WASP, including 14 Marylanders, were trained in Texas and went on to fly non-combat military missions so that all their male counterparts could be deployed to combat. These women piloted every kind of military aircraft, and logged 60 million miles flying missions across the United States. They were never awarded full military status and were ineligible for officer status. Following the war, the women pilots paid their own way home. And for the 38 women who died in the line of duty, their families were saddled with the costs to transport their bodies and arrange burials. It was not until 1977 that the WASP participants were granted veterans’ status “for the purposes of all laws administered by the Veterans’ Administration.” The Superintendent of ANC allowed active duty designees, including WASPs, to be inurned in ANC. However, in March of last year, the Secretary of the Army changed inurnment policies, stating that the Superintendent of ANC did not have the authority to change criteria for inurnment and that these individuals were not active duty. Among WASPs denied inurnment at ANC are Marylander Elaine Harmon, who passed away in April. Elaine’s daughter requested she be buried at ANC, and was denied, citing the change in inurnment policy. The Senate legislation would allow WASPs to be inurned at ANC. In 2009, Senator Mikulski introduced legislation to award the WASPs the Congressional Gold Medal, which is awarded by Congress and is bestowed for exceptional acts of service to the United States or for lifetime achievement. The WASPs were awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in March 2010.
01.08.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after President Obama vetoed legislation passed by both the Senate and the House to repeal major provisions of ObamaCare and redirect funding from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities: “I’m disappointed that the President continues to ignore families and small businesses who have been hurt by the painful effects of ObamaCare, from rising costs, to losing access to doctors, to hampering businesses’ abilities to hire new employees. The President has once again chosen to put his failed agenda ahead of Iowans and replaced choice with one-size-fits-all mandates and taxes. I will continue to fight for Iowans to have affordable, patient-centered options that constrain costs, maximize flexibility, and allow them to have a voice over their own health care decisions. “Additionally, this bill would have redirected funds from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities like community health centers, building on the bipartisan effort I led to protect women’s health care. The footage depicting Planned Parenthood employees discussing in gruesome detail the organization’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies is morally reprehensible and raises a number of questions that taxpayers deserve answers to. Taxpayers simply should not be forced to continue to fund the nation’s largest abortion provider. Despite the President’s veto today, I will continue working on behalf of taxpayers to redirect these funds to other eligible entities like community health centers, which provide greater preventative and primary health care services regardless of a person’s ability to pay.” # # #
01.07.2016	FORT BRAGG – Today, Senators Thom Tillis (R-NC) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) concluded a Congressional Delegation visit to Fort Bragg in North Carolina, the largest military installation in the United States that is home to 52,000 active duty men and women and 100,000 of their family members. Senators Tillis and Ernst, both members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with many key military commanders at Ft. Bragg, including General Robert B. Abrams, the Commander of the United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM), and General Stephen J. Townsend, the Commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. On Tuesday, the Senators started their day by sharing breakfast with Army soldiers from their home states, with Senator Tillis dining with soldiers from North Carolina, and Senator Ernst dining with soldiers from Iowa. The Senators then toured the United States Army Special Operations Command (USASOC), which is often among the first commands to deploy soldiers to combat zones, particularly since the beginning of the Global War on Terror. The Senators also went on an extensive tour of the Joint Special Operations Medical Training Center (JSOMTC), which plays a vital role in ensuring that Special Operations Forces are self-reliant with well-trained combat medics, often making the difference between life and death in combat. In the afternoon, Senator Ernst met with Fort Bragg Soldiers for a candid discussion on how to end sexual assault in our Army. On Wednesday, the Senators toured the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), where they received classified battle update briefings, and enjoyed lunch with JSOC soldiers. Senator Tillis also toured the Engagement Skills Trainer (EST) Facility, which provides state of the art computer-generated arms training for soldiers. Senator Ernst also met with infantrymen and cavalry scouts from the 82nd Airborne Division, recently returned from Iraq, to discuss their thoughts on the way forward with gender integration of combat arms positions. In addition to the busy itinerary of the CODEL at Fort Bragg, Senator Tillis joined Senators Richard Burr and Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Johnny Isakson (R-GA) for the official opening of the new Fayetteville VA Health Care Center on Monday. “Fort Bragg is the home to the Global Response Force, and is paramount to maintaining America’s position as the strongest and most capable military the world has ever seen,” said Senator Tillis. “I was honored to welcome Senator Ernst to Fort Bragg to visit with the commanders and brave active duty members serving at our nation’s largest military base, they truly represent the very best of the best.” “It was an honor to visit with our men and women in uniform at Fort Bragg, to learn more about their mission, capabilities, and how we can help improve their ability to protect our nation and defeat our adversaries,” said Senator Ernst. “The Fayetteville community is vital to our national defense, and I remain committed to ensuring our servicemembers and their families are well taken care of as they face the unique challenges of military life.” Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) discusses military quality of life issues and state legislation with soldiers from various units during a breakfast at the 20th Engineer Brigade dining facility on Fort Bragg Jan. 5.

01.05.2016	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement in response to President Obama’s executive actions that would restrict law-abiding Iowans' Second Amendment rights: “I am opposed to President Obama’s overreaching and unilateral actions; the American people should have a voice in this process instead of the President's top-down approach that sidesteps Congress and the people we were elected to represent. “There are laws currently in place to prevent firearms from getting into the wrong hands and we must ensure that they are being enforced. In addition, we must continue to focus on improving access to mental health services. “However, executive actions to restrict law-abiding citizens' rights are simply not the answer. President Obama's attempt to mandate these Second Amendment restrictions have fallen flat in Congress previously. Any further discussion about how best to respond to recent tragedies involving firearms should happen in Congress, where the American people have a voice through their representatives. “I remain committed to working to counter the President’s overreaching actions, and protecting the constitutional rights of law-abiding Iowans.” # # #

12.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced she has nominated 42 Iowa students to be considered for appointments to United States service academies. “It is truly an honor to nominate so many outstanding young leaders throughout our state who excel in the classroom and also in their communities,” said Senator Ernst. "During my time in the military, I often talked with my young soldiers about the four pillars I strive for, and encouraged them to strive for as well: assuming risk; leadership; service to your community and country; and, an attitude of gratefulness. "These are important qualities for our students as they take the next step in their admissions process. Attending a service academy is incredibly hard work, but is an exceptional opportunity for our students to lead and serve our great country." Every year Senator Ernst, a retired Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, has the honor and responsibility of nominating Iowa students to the U.S. Air Force Academy, U.S. Naval Academy, U.S. Military Academy at West Point, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. The admissions process at the service academies is incredibly competitive and the Iowa Senator encourages students to apply for more than one academy.

12.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting against the more than 2,000 page bill which includes $1.8 trillion dollars in spending and tax policy: “Once again, Washington finds itself governing from one crisis to the next, cutting back room deals and now, jamming through this $1.8 trillion package in spending and tax policy. Iowans deserve better; they deserve to have a voice in this process, instead of a being told what’s been negotiated behind closed doors. “While there are some positive aspects of the deal, I could not in good faith support it in its entirety because it not only fails to address the drivers of our fiscal mess, but it exacerbates the problem by leaving taxpayers on the hook. Simply put, I was sent to Washington to cut the pork and this deal adds too much money to an already growing government and unsustainable national debt. “Additionally, this back room deal fails to include a critical measure to stop the EPA’s harmful expansion of the WOTUS rule. The reality is the WOTUS rule is ill-conceived and breeds uncertainty, confusion, and more red tape that threatens the livelihoods of many in Iowa and across the country. Failure to act hurts hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses who are continuously ignored by the EPA. "This bill also sidesteps the need to pause the refugee program for Syrians, in order to ensure that Americans are safe. "Like Iowans across our state, I'm fed up with politicians' talk of change, only for it to result in more Washington dysfunction. Congress should debate this deal in an open and transparent process. "We must work together to cut spending and make the tough decisions that the American people elected Congress to make." # # #
12.14.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released a tribute honoring Iowa’s own Governor Terry Branstad as he makes history as the longest serving governor in the United States. Due to the Senate schedule, the Iowa Senator was unable to deliver remarks in person at the "Governor Branstad Longest Serving Event." Click here or on the image below to watch the tribute which was played at tonight's event. VIDEO TRANSCRIPT “Hello everyone! I’m so sorry I could not be there to celebrate the remarkable achievement of my friend and our very own Governor, Terry Branstad. I wish I could join all of you, but unfortunately, votes have kept me in Washington, D.C. “Today marks his historic milestone as the nation’s longest serving governor, with 7,642 days in office working for our great state of Iowa. And what a great job he’s done. “I’ve known Governor Branstad for more years than I want to admit, but I distinctly remember one of our first interactions at a Red Oak Chamber of Commerce Annual Banquet where he was the guest speaker. “Governor Branstad and I spoke about the military. He is a fellow veteran himself and it was then that I saw just how much love he has not only for the military, but also for government service. “The governor shared with me that while he was stationed at Fort Bragg as a young soldier, he would leave base during his time off to watch the North Carolina General Assembly from their viewing gallery. “Even as a young soldier, Terry Branstad was interested in public service at the state level. Now look at all that he has accomplished for Iowa. “I also appreciate that he continues to wear his uniform for different veterans’ events in Iowa, showing his support, his leadership, and his commitment to our men and women in uniform. “Our governor is someone who truly cares about serving others and we are incredibly fortunate to have a leader like him. “Today, we honor his steadfast commitment to the people of Iowa. “Congratulations, Governor Branstad and thank you for making Iowa a great place to grow.” Last week, Senator Ernst also spoke on the Senate floor to honor Governor Branstad and highlighted his work on behalf of Iowa veterans. # # #
12.14.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the “congressional watchdog”, issued a report that found the EPA’s social media campaign to promote its flawed expansion of the Waters of the U.S. Rule (WOTUS) broke the law: “Today’s report issued by the GAO has confirmed what many in Iowa have already suspected, that the EPA was on shaky legal ground when it decided to use taxpayer dollars to lobby the American public to support its harmful rule. The agency used election-style tactics to gin up support for this misguided rule, and today, GAO – the one responsible for investigating how the federal government spends taxpayer dollars – has called the EPA out for its egregious actions. “The EPA repeatedly touted the ‘over one million’ supportive comments they received on this rule, but this report clearly shows that many of those comments were solicited by the EPA in an illegal manner. It is now more apparent than ever that this WOTUS rule is ill-conceived and nothing more than a blatant power grab by an agency that is committed to expanding its reach over Iowa. I remain committed to scrapping this rule entirely.” According to GAO’s report, “EPA’s use of Thunderclap constituted covert propaganda, in violation of the publicity or propaganda prohibition.” GAO also concluded that “…EPA hyperlinks to the NRDC and Surfrider Foundation webpages provided in the EPA blog post constitute grassroots lobbying in violation of the grassroots lobbying prohibition.” In May, the New York Times wrote an article regarding the concerns with EPA’s actions on social media. Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Senator Ernst’s resolution of disapproval to scrap the WOTUS rule passed the Senate with bipartisan support. Last month, Senator Ernst released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. The Iowa Senator cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and directions for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders. In May, Senator Ernst denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. In May, Senator Ernst also introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. In February, Senator Ernst invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa.

12.14.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after President Obama spoke from the Pentagon on his strategy in the Middle East: “Today was another missed opportunity by our President to lead in the war on terrorism and communicate to the American people what is necessary to defeat a growing terrorist organization with global reach. Rather than outlining a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIS, the American people heard more of President Obama's same tired message. “I urge the Senate to take up an AUMF which will give President Obama every authority to fully engage, defeat and destroy ISIS wherever they are." Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces. # # #
12.10.2015	Legislation includes Ernst language underscoring importance of telemedicine options available to veterans WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) recently cosponsored the Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2015, which was introduced by Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Senator Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and passed unanimously out of committee yesterday during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee business meeting. This legislation would put into place needed reforms and improvements to shield whistleblowers, hold retaliators responsible, and ensure that medical records of veterans who serve as U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) employees are protected. The Dr. Chris Kirkpatrick Whistleblower Protection Act of 2015 follows a September Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing entitled, “Improving VA Accountability: Examining First-Hand Accounts of Department of Veterans Affairs Whistleblowers”, during which Dr. Kirkpatrick’s brother testified. He explained that Dr. Kirkpatrick was fired by the VA after raising questions about the medication amounts given to veterans. Dr. Kirkpatrick tragically committed suicide shortly thereafter. During the September hearing, Ernst emphasized: “today’s hearing is just re-emphasizing to me that we have a corrupt and broken VA system. And when I hear that supervisors, other workers, are more concerned about their own jobs than they are about the veterans – we have an issue.” In addition, during yesterday’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee business meeting, Senator Ernst highlighted language she added to the legislation, to inform veterans who serve as VA employees of the telemedicine options available to them. Click here or on the image below to watch. Senator Ernst previously introduced the bipartisan Veterans E-Health and Telemedicine Act (VETS Act) to improve health care access for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telemedicine services offered by the VA across state lines. The legislation awaits further consideration by the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. TRANSCRIPT “Senator, thank you. I do want to thank you for – for this piece of legislation and those that are sponsoring the piece of legislation as well. Particularly you, Mr. Chairman for also allowing me to add language highlighting the importance of the telemedicine options that we have available for our veterans. And this is an issue that I have been working on with Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Senator Ayotte, and Senator Tester, those on this committee, and a number of our other colleagues. It is an important step for us and I appreciate your willingness to work with me on telemedicine. So thank you Mr. Chairman, very much.” # # #
12.09.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for final passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA): “As a mother and grandmother, I believe education should be handled at the state and local level, by Iowans, not Washington bureaucrats. “The bipartisan Every Student Succeeds Act rolls back many of the failed policies established under No Child Left Behind. This legislation ends the Common Core mandate and other federally prescribed academic standards imposed on our states. In addition, ESSA moves our education system away from a Washington top down, one size fits all system based on test results. These long overdue reforms give our individual states greater flexibility to design and implement their education and accountability standards as they see fit. “I believe this is a positive step forward to ensure our students have access to quality education, and empower our parents, teachers, local school boards, and states to make the best decision for their own students.” # # #
12.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced she has cosponsored Senator Tom Cotton’s (R-AR) Liberty Through Strength Act II, requiring the Obama Administration to keep all records of terrorist communications and grant congressional authorization of counterterrorism tools that are critical to the safety and security of our homeland. This legislation comes in response to the expiration of the NSA’s terrorist data collection program on December 1, 2015, as mandated by the USA Freedom Act that was signed into law earlier this year. Senator Ernst opposed the USA Freedom Act in June and emphasized her “serious concerns over delegating responsibility solely to telephone companies. The USA Freedom Act fails to detail how long telephone companies are required to keep metadata records, and there are uncertainties about process delays in the transfer of information from telecom to the federal government.” As Fox News recently reported, “The National Security Agency’s sweeping authority to collect phone-record data expired Sunday, despite evidence that such programs helped European officials track down the perpetrators of the recent Paris suicide bombing attacks and prevented other attacks.” Senator Ernst released the following statement: “Recent events are a stark reminder that America faces some of the most complex security challenges in more than a generation. At this critical time, we cannot afford the potential for systematic and long-term gaps in our intelligence gathering. The USA FREEDOM Act alters our counterterrorism approach and opens the door to a false sense of security, undercutting protections previously put in place to preserve the security of the American people. In light of the continuous ISIS threats, the Liberty Through Strength Act II would provide additional security for Iowans from potential terrorist attacks on our homeland. “Now is not the time to impose unnecessary roadblocks within our counterterrorism approach. It is vital that our intelligence community has tools at their disposal to find terrorists and stave off potential attacks on our homeland. “The risks are simply too high to move ahead with this untested approach without first certifying there is no impact on our current operations. My top priority is the safety and security of each and every American. We can and must do better for families in Iowa and nationwide.” Last month, Senator Ernst cosponsored the original Liberty Through Strength Act, which was introduced by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) to postpone the USA FREEDOM Act’s end of the NSA’s terrorist metadata collection program.

12.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement following President Obama’s Oval Office address to the nation on terrorism: “Last night, President Obama spoke to reassure himself of his efforts, rather than reassure Americans by putting forward a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIS and those radicalized by them. His address was a gravely missed opportunity to lead in the war against terror and connect with the American people on the necessary hard choices needed to destroy ISIS. “Despite growing terrorist attacks and threats, President Obama’s address revealed absolutely no new efforts to defeat and destroy ISIS abroad, nor efforts to protect the homeland. “President Obama owes it to the American people to be straightforward on what is necessary to defeat a terrorist organization with global reach. The time is now to enact a comprehensive strategy to completely eradicate ISIS, including an honest assessment of what it takes to accomplish that goal. The United States cannot defeat ISIS alone, which is why we need all members of the U.S.-led coalition contributing to a full-spectrum military, diplomatic, and development operation, both in the air and on the ground. We must also enhance our intelligence capabilities at home and abroad to protect each and every American. “Furthermore, I have called for a new AUMF as an important step toward achieving a serious bipartisan solution to destroy ISIS, giving President Obama every authority to fully engage, defeat and destroy ISIS wherever they are. Congress should take up, debate and vote on an AUMF to fight against ISIS and its associated forces without further delay.” Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of Senator Lindsey Graham’s (R-SC) joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces. # # #
12.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after the World Trade Organization (WTO) issued its official ruling on the level of retaliation tariffs Canada and Mexico are allowed to seek against the United States for the mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL): “Today’s ruling by the WTO sends a clear message that it is time to repeal this policy, which will negatively impact our own producers if continued. “The WTO has repeatedly found that this mandatory COOL law fails to comply with our free trade agreements, and now Mexico and Canada have been given the go-ahead to take over $1 billion in retaliatory action against the United States. “We’ve been putting this off for far too long and the time to act is now. The Senate must pick-up the reigns and pass a full repeal of COOL to avoid unnecessary harm to our agricultural and manufacturing sectors. “I remain committed to ensuring that our products reach other countries without retaliation to our American producers who are the backbone of Iowa and an integral part of our economic vitality.” # # #
12.04.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after cosponsoring a joint resolution for the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against the Islamic State (ISIS) and its associated forces, which was introduced by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC). This AUMF would enable the President to use all necessary and appropriate force in order to defend the national security of the United States against terrorist organizations. “For well over a year, ISIS has declared war on our nation and continues to threaten attacks against the American people, while committing devastating acts of terrorism across the globe. “This AUMF is an important step toward achieving a serious bipartisan solution to destroy ISIS and those radicalized by them. Simply put, the AUMF gives President Obama the authorization to fully engage, defeat, and destroy ISIS, wherever they are. “It is completely unacceptable that our Commander in Chief has failed to outline a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIS. We must preserve the safety and security of the American people, and that starts with our President making a commitment todestroy ISIS.” Senator Ernst recently called for a renewed AUMF on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, “We need to be more aggressive and that would include a comprehensive strategy coming from our President and coming from our Joint Chiefs. They can develop that strategy and we need to implement it. We need to grow our coalition. And we need to rely on those military experts. We as Congress, though, need to make sure that we have an AUMF, an Authorization of Use of Military Forces, which will direct our military on what they can or can’t do as they go after ISIS the Middle East, and we need to get rid of sequestration in the military.” Click here to read the AUMF. About the AUMF: Authorizes the President to use all necessary and appropriate force in order to defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and its associated forces, organizations, and persons. Requires the President, at least once every 60 days, to submit to Congress a report on matters relevant to this joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the exercise of authority granted. Senator Joni Ernst is the first female combat veteran elected to serve in the United States Senate and served in the military for more than 23 years. She received her undergraduate degree from Iowa State University where she joined the university’s ROTC program. After graduating, Ernst was commissioned as an officer in U.S. Army Reserves, and after a few years in the Reserves, transferred to the Iowa National Guard. In 2003, she served as a company commander in Kuwait and Iraq, leading 150 Iowa Army National Guardsmen during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Senator Ernst retired from the military on November 30, 2015, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. # # #
12.03.2015	“After passing repeated short-term bills and stopgaps, Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to pass this important five-year highway bill.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) a five-year transportation authorization measure: “This long-term, bipartisan transportation bill works to ensure that Iowans and all Americans finally have the certainty of safe and secure roads, bridges and other basic infrastructure to help our economy thrive. “The FAST Act affords much-needed clarity on our nation’s infrastructure needs and places focus on the specific concerns of our state and local communities, enabling them to move forward with planning and implementing long overdue transportation projects. “Furthermore, the legislation contains a number of critical provisions for Iowa. This includes reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank with necessary reforms to increase oversight of Bank practices and promote good governance measures. The Ex-Im Bank is an important tool to grow our Iowa exports, expand new market opportunities and ensure our competitiveness in the global marketplace. In addition, this bill repeals the ill-advised cuts to the crop insurance program that would have placed a significant burden on our rural Iowa communities and agricultural industry. “After passing repeated short-term bills and stopgaps, Congress has worked in a bipartisan manner to pass this important five-year highway bill. I am hopeful President Obama will side with the American people and sign the FAST Act into law.” # # #
12.03.2015	“ Today we put patients and doctors back in the driver’s seat when it comes to their health care decision-making. This legislation provides critical relief from ObamaCare’s individual and employer mandates and $1 trillion tax hike on Americans.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting for final passage of the Restoring Americans’ Health Care Freedom Reconciliation Act: “Years ago, President Obama promised health insurance premiums would go down under ObamaCare. They haven’t. In fact, Iowans looking for health care plans in the exchange are potentially facing more than a 12 percent increase in premiums. “This poorly conceived and reckless law is rooted in a faulty, Washington knows best mentality. The result is numerous broken promises and too many families and businesses hurt by the painful effects of ObamaCare from rising costs, to losing access to doctors, to hampering businesses’ abilities to hire new employees. “Instead of empowering families and individuals to determine what they want and need in their health care plans, Washington has replaced choice with one-size-fits-all mandates and taxes. It’s hurting jobs and stifling our economy. “Today we put patients and doctors back in the driver’s seat when it comes to their health care decision-making. This legislation provides critical relief from ObamaCare’s individual and employer mandates and $1 trillion tax hike on Americans.” “I look forward to continuing to work to help Iowans achieve the patient-centered, affordable alternatives they deserve that enhance competition, increase flexibility, constrain rising costs and ensure folks have a voice over their own health care decisions.” “Finally, this legislation builds on the critical, bipartisan work my colleagues and I started by sending a bill to President Obama’s desk that protects funding for women’s health care by redirecting money from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities like community health centers and hospitals. The footage depicting Planned Parenthood employees discussing in gruesome detail the organization’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies is morally reprehensible and raises a number of questions that taxpayers deserve answers to. Taxpayers simply should not be forced to continue to fund the nation’s largest abortion provider.” Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst speak on the Restoring Americans’ Health Care Freedom Reconciliation Act. Senator Ernst is also a co-sponsor of legislation introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), which authorizes the full repeal of ObamaCare 180 days after enactment of the bill in order to allow a six-month window to replace it with quality solutions. ObamaCare Aspects Repealed: Individual mandate, which currently requires most individuals to purchase health insurance or face a penalty. Employer mandate, which subjects employers to a tax penalty for failing to offer employees health insurance. 2.3 percent medical device tax that increases costs for consumers and hampers medical innovation and global competitiveness. Existing health insurance tax and the impending Cadillac tax on certain high value health insurance plans that get passed onto consumers, driving up their out of pocket costs. Restrictions on contributions to Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Savings Accounts and the limitations on their use to purchase over the counter drugs, empowering patients to take charge of their health care needs. # # #
12.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement following the Pentagon’s announcement to open all combat roles to women: “Over the past 14 years, women have honorably served our nation – in combat – in the longest war in American history. Today’s announcement opens the door for women to hold specific combat related military occupational specialties. I support providing women the opportunity to serve in any capacity, as long as standards are not lowered and it enhances our combat effectiveness. The decision to open up all military occupational specialties to women is one that must be a military decision, and not a political one. “I am proud of all women who serve in our armed forces, especially the ones that have recently led the way as the first females to enter previously all male training schools, like the U.S. Army Ranger School and the Marine Corps School of Infantry. “I look forward to hearing more from the military service chiefs about their recommendations to the Secretary of Defense after the years-long studies they’ve done regarding gender integration.” Senator Joni Ernst is the first female combat veteran elected to serve in the United States Senate and served in the military for more than 23 years. She received her undergraduate degree from Iowa State University where she joined the university’s ROTC program. After graduating, Ernst was commissioned as an officer in U.S. Army Reserves, and after a few years in the Reserves, transferred to the Iowa National Guard. In 2003, she served as a company commander in Kuwait and Iraq, leading 150 Iowa Army National Guardsmen during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Senator Ernst retired from the military on November 30, 2015 as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. # # #
12.02.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – This evening, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the Senate floor to discuss the harmful impact that ObamaCare has had on Iowans, and to stress the need for affordable, patient-centered solutions for families and individuals. Earlier this year, Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) to authorize the full repeal of ObamaCare 180 days after enactment, providing a six-month window to replace it with quality solutions. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT “Promises, promises, promises... “Day in and day out, I hear stories of the broken promises of the President’s failed health care law in Iowa, and across the country. “President Obama promised health insurance premiums would go down by $2,500. They haven’t. In fact, the President’s own administration admits that nationwide, premiums in the exchange for next year have increased by more than 7 percent. The outlook for my state is even worse, with Iowans facing more than a 12 percent increase in premiums. “President Obama’s promises don’t pay these bills. Real people in Iowa and across the country they do. “Mark from Urbandale shared with me that the double digit premium increases his family faces for 2016 are unsustainable and that it may be more cost effective to pay the individual mandate penalty instead. “Similarly, Angela from Centerville said that the plan she had hoped to purchase for 2016 increased by nearly $200, and that was the cheapest option for her. If she keeps her current coverage, her family will be strapped with a nearly $1,000 per month bill for health insurance. She asks, ‘How is it possible that the Affordable Care Act has made health care so unaffordable?’ “Let me say that again. How is it possible that the Affordable Care Act has made health care so unaffordable? “It’s a question I get when traveling all across the state of Iowa. “The answer is pretty simple. Obamacare is wrongly rooted in a Washington knows best mentality. “Instead of empowering families and individuals to determine what they want and need in their health care plans, Washington has replaced choice with new one-size-fits-all mandates and taxes. “It’s another costly example of the Washington way failing every day Americans. “Mr. President, the sad reality is that the consequences of this failed law go far beyond just these unaffordable premium increases. “Americans were promised job creation and economic growth, but instead, we have seen employers reduce employee hours in an effort to avoid Obamacare’s employer mandate. “Small businesses—employers—like a marina in Okoboji, have halted their plans to expand and create new jobs because of the mandate. They have even quit hiring folks to fill open jobs and had to cut back on hours for their existing employees to bring them to part time. “And as employers brace themselves for the impending ‘Cadillac tax,’ employees are already feeling the effects – rapidly increasing out of pocket costs. In fact, Ryan from Newton recently learned that his deductible will be doubling next year in anticipation of the tax going into effect. “Obamacare is not helping these folks, it’s hurting them. “At a time when we want to see job growth and rising wages, this is simply the wrong approach. Broken promises don’t cut it. “Today we have the opportunity to roll back some of Obamacare’s most harmful provisions. “Today we can provide much needed relief from the individual and employer mandates, and stop the law’s trillion dollars in tax hikes, like the health insurance tax, medical device tax and Cadillac tax, from being passed on to the American people. “Today we can put patients and doctors back in the driver’s seat when it comes to their health care decision-making. “Today I will stand up for the Iowans and people all across America to fulfill our promise to them—that I am committed to stopping this failed law and paving the way to implement patient-centered options that ensure that folks have affordable coverage and access to needed health care services. “Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.” # # #
12.01.2015	“… veterans who bravely served our nation deserve a Department that reviews every claim of wrongdoing by those who are dedicated to restoring Americans’ trust in the VA” Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today sent a letter to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Robert McDonald challenging the department’s failure to review all whistleblower claims. This request follows recent testimony by the VA Deputy Inspector General Linda Halliday on the low number of whistleblower complaints actually reviewed by the VA Office of Inspector General. “Unfortunately, it is apparent the Department is failing to seriously take into account reports submitted by those who report wrongdoing at VA. Regardless of the volume, veterans who bravely served our nation deserve a Department that reviews every claim of wrongdoing by those who are dedicated to restoring Americans’ trust in the VA,” Senator Ernst wrote. “In a September 2015 hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Deputy Inspector General Linda Halliday said that her office shelved 36,000 complaints it received this year. This means that approximately only 10% of the total number claims reported by whistleblowers are being reviewed by the Department,” the Iowa Senator added. “This is simply unacceptable considering the extensive challenges at VA and the risks whistleblowers take to come forward with complaints at VA.” “As a Member of the Senate, it is my duty to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it has made to our veterans. I urge you to ensure the Department examines all whistleblower claims, or if the Department is unable to examine all whistleblower claims, seek further assistance to ensure due diligence to all whistleblower claims,” the Senator concluded. A copy of the letter available here and below. November 30, 2015 The Honorable Robert McDonaldSecretaryDepartment of Veterans Affairs810 Vermont Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20420 Dear Secretary McDonald: I write to you today regarding the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) failure to review all whistleblower complaints and a lack of accountability of VA employees who commit wrongdoings. I am deeply disturbed regarding testimony provided by the VA Deputy Inspector General on the low number of whistleblower complaints actually reviewed by the VA Office of Inspector General, and a report to Congress by the U.S. Office of Special Council on a failure of accountability at the Department. Unfortunately, it is apparent the Department is failing to seriously take into account reports submitted by those who report wrongdoing at VA. Regardless of the volume, veterans who bravely served our nation deserve a Department that reviews every claim of wrongdoing by those who are dedicated to restoring Americans’ trust in the VA. In a September 2015 hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Deputy Inspector General Linda Halliday said that her office shelved 36,000 complaints it received this year[i]. This means that approximately only 10% of the total number of claims reported by whistleblowers are being reviewed by the Department. This is simply unacceptable considering the extensive challenges at VA and the risks whistleblowers take to come forward with complaints at VA. While the VA must review all claims submitted by whistleblowers, the Department must also hold accountable every VA employee who has committed a violation which negatively impacts our veterans. This year, the Office of the Special Counsel took in over 2,000 whistleblower claims from the VA. In a September 17, 2015, letter to the White House and Congress, the Office of the Special Counsel disclosed that VA failed to adequately discipline employees for endangering the health and safety of veterans. In addition, Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner stated in the letter, “The failure to take appropriate disciplinary action, when presented with clear evidence of misconduct, can undermine accountability, impede progress, and discourage whistleblowers from coming forward.”[ii] As a Member of the Senate, it is my duty to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it has made to our veterans. I urge you to ensure the Department examine all whistleblower claims, or if the Department is unable to examine all whistleblower claims, seek further assistance to ensure due diligence of these whistleblower claims. Thank you for your attention to this matter, I look forward to your response. Sincerely, # # # [i] “VA Watchdog Shelves 36,000 Complaints: USA Today, September 23, 2015 http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/09/22/va-watchdog-shelves-36000-complaints-draws-ire-whistleblowers/72643182/ [ii] “VA Needs to Improve Internal Accountability in Whistleblower Cases” US Office of Special Counsel, September 17, 2015. https://osc.gov/News/pr15-19.pdf
11.30.2015	“The Obama Administration is once again using the EPA to impose their agenda on hardworking Iowans by instituting biofuel volume requirements that are lower than originally mandated and in direct contradiction of the law.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) unveiled the final volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2014 through 2016: “I am extremely disappointed by the EPA’s choice to reduce volume requirements for corn ethanol which flies in the face of original congressional intent, and fails to provide any incentives for expanding alternative fuel availability for consumers. The Obama Administration is once again using the EPA to impose their agenda on hardworking Iowans by instituting biofuel volume requirements that are lower than originally mandated and in direct contradiction of the law. “The RFS creates consumer choice for clean fuel, spurs investment in research, production and infrastructure. Furthermore, it is critical to growing our green energy sector, reducing our dependence on foreign oil, and supporting the rural economy in Iowa and across the Midwest. “Iowa is a national leader and is home to retailers across the state who offer affordable ethanol and biodiesel blends to consumers which is in direct alignment with the original intent of RFS when Congress passed it. “Having a strong and long-term RFS is of critical importance to Iowa, as well as our nation. I remain committed to protecting our domestic energy security and promoting innovation in the next generation of biofuels which are paramount to the health and vitality of our state as we chart a path forward.” # # #
11.19.2015	“these commonsense reforms ensure that taxpayer dollars are safeguarded by increasing accountability throughout the federal government” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Bolstering efforts to prevent billions in wasted taxpayer dollars due to mismanagement throughout our federal government, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) bipartisan Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act of 2015 today passed the Senate unanimously. A recent GAO report revealed that many federal government projects are grossly over budget, significantly delayed, or fail to meet their original purpose. Many of these projects are terminated years after the program was implemented, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. Some of these failures have been attributed to the fact that professionals tasked with managing these federal programs fail to use common best practices and standards that are widely acknowledged and used in the private sector. Furthermore, there is not one distinct government job series that spells out program management qualifications. This is dividing the workforce responsible for delivering effective programs. This ongoing problem can be corrected by recognizing program management as a discipline essential to government success. A recent study found the “United States alone could save as much as $995 billion by 2025 by increasing public sector efficiency by just 1 percent a year.” “This bipartisan legislation puts our federal government back on track by streamlining efforts and outlining strategies to correct widespread deficiencies, lax oversight and unnecessary cost overruns incurred by preventable delays in meeting stated program goals and deadlines,” said Senator Ernst. “By adopting widely accepted management standards that are often used in the private sector, these commonsense reforms ensure that taxpayer dollars are safeguarded by increasing accountability throughout the federal government. I’m delighted that my colleagues in the Senate recognize the epidemic of mismanagement that’s eating away at the effectiveness of our federal government.” The Iowa Senator introduced this bipartisan legislation alongside Senator Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) earlier this year. Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) is also a cosponsor. The legislation passed unanimously out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in June. After Senate passage today, now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives for full consideration. About Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act: Establishes a leader within each agency that is focused on program management. Creates an inter-agency Program Management Council to drive improvements through portfolio reviews of agency programs and encourages communications between agencies and program management professionals. Requires the development of a specific job category with distinct qualification for project managers. Requires the federal government to adopt widely-accepted program management best practices and standards. Includes two amendments that: Requires the Government Accountability Office to issue a report three years after the bill’s enactment on its overall effectiveness and impact on program management in the federal government. Works directly with the Department of Defense to improve their current procedures while making sure to not duplicate existing efforts. Examples Of Preventable Taxpayer Waste: The Healthcare.gov Preparation and Launch: “The administration spent $840 million on the creation of healthcare.gov and its supporting systems. According to GAO: CMS incurred significant cost increases, schedule slips, and delayed system functionality for the FFM [federally facilitated marketplace] and data hub systems due primarily to changing requirements that were exacerbated by oversight gaps. From September 2011 to February 2014, FFM obligations increased from $56 million to more than $209 million. . . . Because of unclear guidance and inconsistent oversight, there was confusion about who had the authority to approve contractor requests to expend funds for additional work. . . . As a result, CMS launched Healthcare.gov without verification that it met performance requirements.” The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Scheduling Replacement Project: “Terminated in September 2009 after spending an estimated $127 million over nine years. Despite spending nearly a decade attempting to modernize the department’s 25 year old outpatient scheduling system, the VA had not implemented any of the planned system’s capabilities and it was scrapped. VA began a new project for the scheduling system, which GAO warns is at risk due to ‘weaknesses in several key project management disciplines and a lack of effective oversight.’” The Office of Personnel Management’s Retirement Systems Modernization Program: “Canceled in February 2011 after spending approximately $231 million on the agency’s third attempt to automate the processing of Federal employee retirement claims.” The Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers: “Four medical centers at the VA (Las Vegas, Orlando, Denver and New Orleans) have realized cost increases that ‘range from 66 percent to 427 percent and delays range from 14 to 86 months.’ In the aggregate, these four projects will see cost increases of more than $2.4 billion.” # # #
11.19.2015	“…we have to have a leader here in the United States that says we are going to destroy ISIS, not contain it, not degrade it, but destroy it.” WASHINGTON, D.C . – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined MSNBC’s Morning Joe to discuss the critical need for a comprehensive strategy to destroy ISIS.

11.18.2015	Committee Chairman: “…in large geographic territories, legislation like this is a godsend.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) discussed her Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support Act of 2015 (VETS Act) as the committee considers the legislation. The Iowa Senator introduced this bipartisan legislation with Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) in October. Following Senator Ernst’s remarks, chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Johnny Isakson, noted the legislation “does address a critical need.” He also added “…we want to move forward as soon as we can. It’s a great suggestion that really helps to solve a problem in the most economical way, but also benefit mostly our veterans which is why we’re here to begin with.” Chairman Isakson later added “…in large geographic territories, legislation like this is a godsend.” Click here or on the image below to watch. CHAIRMAN ISAKSON: We’re delighted to have you here. You’re our first witness and we’ll be glad to hear from you. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate it very much. And thank you for your service, and of course your service to our veterans as well. Thank you as well, Senator Sullivan. And I do wish to thank all of the members of the Committee who have worked so hard for our veterans. This is one of the most important committees I feel to making sure that we honor our commitments to the men and women that have served in our nation’s military. So again thank you for allowing me to testify today. I want to specifically thank my lead Democratic sponsor, Senator Hirono, for her help with this legislation which is designed to improve the access and quality of care we provide our veterans. The bill is called the VETS Act for a reason, and that’s because we all want to honor and help those that served and sacrificed for our country. The VA has been practicing telemedicine since 2001, and they are largely cited as leaders and innovators in the field. Their efforts in telemedicine have saved money and veterans’ time by eliminating often an hour or more long drives to the VA, and reducing bed days at the VA. For example: According to the VA, in Fiscal Year 2014, telehealth reduced bed days of care by 54%, reduced hospital admissions by 32%, and saved $34 in travel savings per consultation. Our legislation is straightforward, commonsense, and builds upon this work that the VA is already doing in telemedicine. It allows VA doctors to conduct telemedicine across state lines for patients in their homes—something they’re already able to do within state lines. Unfortunately, current law allows doctors to call patients at their homes if they are in the same state, but prevents them from doing so if their veteran patient lives across state lines. VA doctors wishing to treat patients via telehealth across state lines must have the patient drive to a federal facility. This is the case even though there’s no special licensing requirement for VA doctors to practice in different states. For example: A veteran in my small town of Red Oak, Iowa who wishes to have a telemedicine appointment with a doctor at the VA hospital in Omaha, Nebraska - that’s closest to my hometown - an hour away, must drive to the VA center in Des Moines. A two-hour drive. By contrast, if the doctor was based in Des Moines, the patient could remain in their home in Red Oak and have a telemedicine appointment. Back in Iowa, and in many other states, rural veterans are often faced with the struggle of making it to a VA facility in the city. Increasing opportunities for telemedicine is a great way to tackle this challenge for services ranging from mental health treatment to post-surgery follow up. In addition, this bill includes language we worked with the VA on to ensure policymakers have up to date information on the VA’s telehealth program. This report language is designed not to have a cost or create any extra work, as this is data that the Department already collects on its telehealth program. As you may know, this legislation has broad bipartisan support with 12 co-sponsors, 3 from this committee, and is supported by the VFW, the American Legion, Concerned Veteran’s for America, the Paralyzed Veterans Association, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America – and the American Telemedicine Association, and Health IT Now. I hope you all are able to see the commonsense behind this legislation and I greatly appreciate all of you taking the time to consider this legislation and listen to my remarks today. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. CHAIRMAN ISAKSON: Senator Ernst, we appreciate your leadership and Senator Hirono, your cosponsorship of the legislation. Proud cosponsorship. SEN. ERNST: Thank you, Mazie, very much. CHAIRMAN ISAKSON: I think we have five other Committee members who are also cosponsors of the bill. SEN. ERNST: Wonderful. CHAIRMAN ISAKSON: It does address a critical need. We’ve had some input which I’ll go over with you, but we want to move forward as soon as we can. It’s a great suggestion that really helps to solve a problem in the most economical way, but also benefit mostly our veterans which is why we’re here to begin with. Thank you very much for sending me the legislation, we’ll be with you shortly when we do a markup. SEN. ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair. CHAIRMAN ISAKSON: Thank you. # # #

11.17.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in favor of two measures that would block the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) costly rules on new and existing power plants from going into effect. “Once again, the EPA has bypassed Congress and ignored the voices of hardworking Americans to unilaterally enforce its agenda. This latest overreach is a backdoor cap-and-trade policy that is likely to threaten jobs, burden hardworking Americans and increase electricity prices for low-income families. “Energy policies like this one are central to the economic health of our country and should not be forced through a rulemaking process that is specifically designed to ignore the will of Congress and the American people. These issues should be debated openly in Congress as well as in every congressional district and community across America. I remain committed to ensuring that hardworking folks across the country are protected from this harmful rule.” EPA’s rule would require Iowa to reduce its emissions by 42 percent by 2030. Iowa must decide between a single state plan or a regional approach that could include emissions trading. The rule also prohibits any renewable investments made prior to 2013 from being used directly for compliance. As an early adopter of wind energy, this is disappointing for Iowa. National & Iowa Impact: The EPA’s new rule will impact 37 electric generating units in Iowa. In Iowa, 59 percent of the state’s electricity comes from coal. Even the EPA estimates that this new rule will cost $8.4 billion per year. The American Action Forum predicts that the rule will eliminate 125,800 jobs across the country. # # #
11.17.2015	ISIS Terror Attacks in Paris Claimed 129 Lives At Least One Attacker Reportedly Infiltrated Syrian Refugee Flow to Enter Europe WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the aftermath of the November 13th terrorist attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people and injured hundreds more, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a letter led by Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) to President Barack Obama urging the Administration to ensure that no members, supporters or sympathizers of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are infiltrating Syrian refugee movements to enter the United States. ISIS claimed responsibility for the synchronized terror attacks in Paris, and French and other European officials said at least one of the attackers used the flow of Syrian refugees to enter the European Union. In September 2015, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned of the U.S. intelligence community’s “huge concern” that ISIS may attempt to infiltrate Syrian refugees to enter Europe and possibly the United States. In October 2015, FBI Director James Comey cautioned about the U.S. government’s limitations in thoroughly vetting all Syrian refugees for national security risk. Since 2012, the United States has reportedly admitted 1854 Syrian refugees into the country. “While our country has a long history of welcoming refugees and has an important role to play in the heartbreaking Syrian refugee crisis, our first and most important priority must be to ensure that any refugee who comes to the United States does not present a threat to the American people,” the Senators wrote. “We believe that an essential component of that effort is ensuring that no refugee related to the Syrian crisis is admitted to the United States unless the U.S. government can guarantee, with 100 percent assurance, that they are not members, supporters, or sympathizers of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Daesh or ISIL.” Senators Daniel Coats (R-IN), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Joe Manchin (D-WV) also signed on to the letter. A copy of the letter is below. November 16, 2015 President Barack ObamaThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NWWashington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: We stand in solidarity with the people of France and against the terrorists who carried out the horrific attacks of November 13th that clearly were designed deliberately to kill as many innocent people as possible. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. As we mourn the loss of life and provide France all the support and assistance it needs, the U.S. government must redouble its efforts to keep the American people safe. We believe that an essential component of that effort is ensuring that no refugee related to the Syrian crisis is admitted to the United States unless the U.S. government can guarantee, with 100 percent assurance, that they are not members, supporters, or sympathizers of the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), also known as Daesh or ISIL. It is already clear that ISIS is responsible for the barbaric attacks. Reports indicate that at least one of the attackers apparently utilized the flow of refugees to infiltrate into Europe. These facts require a serious and objective reexamination of the Administration’s policy toward Syrian refugees to avoid unnecessary risks. While our country has a long history of welcoming refugees and has an important role to play in the heartbreaking Syrian refugee crisis, our first and most important priority must be to ensure that any refugee who comes to the United States does not present a threat to the American people. Compassion for Syrian refugees is important, but a fierce determination to protect the American people is also important. The fact that ISIS may have utilized the flow of refugees to infiltrate Europe and potentially the United States is not a surprise. In September, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), James Clapper, publicly warned the U.S. intelligence community has a “huge concern” that ISIS may seek to infiltrate Syrian refugees who are flowing into Europe and potentially the United States. “As they [refugees] descend on Europe, one of the obvious issues that we worry about, and in turn as we bring refugees into this country, is exactly what’s their background?” DNI Clapper added: “We don’t obviously put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees. On October 21, 2015, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director James Comey told the House Committee on Homeland Security that the U.S. government may not have the ability to vet thoroughly all Syrian refugees coming into the United States. He explained that if a Syrian person is not already in the FBI’s database, that person is unknown to the agency, leaving an inadequate basis for the person’s background to be screened for terrorism risk. “We can only query against that which we have collected,” Director Comey cautioned. He also said, “So if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to—there will be nothing … because we have no record on that person.” Given DNI Clapper’s stated concern that ISIS may try to infiltrate Syrian refugee movements as well as FBI Director Comey’s public acknowledgment of the U.S. government’s limitations in thoroughly vetting all Syrian refugees, we respectfully request your Administration: List comprehensively the challenges, prior to the November 13th terrorist attacks, in the process for checking the background of Syrian refugees and checking potential risks to national security, including potential terrorism risks; Detail what special or enhanced measures will be added to the screening process for Syrian refugees in the aftermath of the November 13th terrorist attacks; and Describe how it plans to address the vetting challenges that Director Comey describes. We ask that your Administration immediately share this information with the American people. We look forward to a timely response. We cannot imagine a more urgent or higher priority. Sincerely, # # #

11.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, legislation to fund veterans’ services, military housing and family support, as well as hospital and health facilities construction. “I’m pleased that Congress could come together and support this critical bipartisan legislation, which outlines funding for our servicemembers, veterans and military families, and works to ensure our military has the resources for facility improvements and construction which are integral to our national security. “Tomorrow as we honor our nation’s veterans and recognize their unparalleled sacrifice, we are reminded of our responsibilities to live up to the promises we made to our men and women in uniform when they return home. This legislation works to address problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs and works to improve veterans’ health care services, including homeless assistance, caregiver services, and expanding the current treatments offered. “In addition, as our nation faces the threats of an unpredictable world, this legislation includes measures to keep some of the world’s most dangerous criminals detained at Guantanamo Bay by restricting the Obama Administration’s ability to build or outfit facilities in the United States intended for future relocation. “As we honor Veterans Day, and every day, we must ensure support is in place to provide for our men and women in uniform, our military, and our national security.” # # #
11.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of the revised National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016. “In the face of increasingly complex security challenges, it is critical that we move this bipartisan legislation forward to provide a comprehensive blueprint for our military and Department of Defense which includes long overdue reforms and resources to strengthen our national security; ensures our men and women in uniform have the tools needed to be successful; and eliminates unnecessary spending. This legislation also continues to build on efforts to strengthen policy for sexual assault prevention as well as increased victim support. “Furthermore, the Senate is once again acting to help keep our most dangerous adversaries detained at Guantanamo Bay by requiring the Obama Administration to consult and gain congressional approval before relocating these terrorists to the United States. This would require a comprehensive plan, case-by-case determinations, and assurance of continued detention and intelligence collection. “I also am pleased that the NDAA includes several of my provisions including improvements to the VA’s outreach for its peer-to-peer support program to help veterans suffering from mental health issues; an extension to the National Guard State Partnership Program; a measure to give the President the authority to directly arm the Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment needed to fight against ISIS; and a provision to ensure that federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule, among many other critical measures. “We can never forget the sacrifices our servicemembers make on our nation’s behalf every single day. Congress must remain united in this effort to ensure our troops have the necessary resources and support they deserve. Ernst Provisions Included in the NDAA: A provision which provides the President with the legal authority, if the President finds the Government of Iraq is not increasing its political inclusiveness, to directly arm the Kurdish Regional Government, in coordination with the Iraqi government to the extent necessary, to fight ISIS. This provision also provides the sense of Congress on the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq, including Iraqi Kurdistan, and the security and stability of the region and the world. It also shares the sense that the U.S., in coordination with our coalition partners, provide without undue delay – the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment, and training necessary to more effectively partner with the U.S. and other international partners to defeat ISIS. A provision to improve the Clay Hunt SAV Act pilot program by requiring outreach of the VA’s community-based veteran peer support network to our wounded, ill, and injured service members, as well as all service members within 180 days of leaving service. This provision will ensure the VA will be proactive, instead of reactive, with its outreach to those who have sacrificed for our nation on this important mental health pilot program. A provision requiring a joint report to the Senate Armed Services Committee from the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy, a plan to jointly modernize Army and Marine Corps small arms during a 15-year period. This provision seeks to reduce duplication of efforts between the services, potentially realize cost savings in developing common small arms weapons and technology, and improve the committee’s oversight of the modernization strategies of both of the branches of service whose primary mission it is to fight and win our nation’s land conflicts. A provision, for the next five years, which provides new or current leases on Army Ammunition Plants, under the Army’s ARMS initiative, the option of extending a 25-year lease for an additional 25-year period. This provision will attract and retain greater investment, reduce facility sustainment cost, and provide a boost to some local communities - including the Des Moines County Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. A provision which extends the National Guard State Partnership Program for five years. # # #
11.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after President Obama once again rejected the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would authorize construction of a cross-border pipeline to transport oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast: "Once again President Obama is illustrating just how out-of-touch he is with workers and families across the country in his rejection of the Keystone XL Pipeline. However, this reckless decision comes as no surprise following his veto of the critical legislation that Congress and the American people overwhelmingly support. “It is unfortunate that the President has once again turned his back on a historically vetted energy project that would have created good jobs for the middle class and moved us one step closer to energy independence. “I remain committed to advocating for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline despite the President’s eagerness to make it a political symbol.” About the Keystone XL Pipeline: U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), is an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Keystone XL Pipeline Act. On January 29, the Senate passed the Keystone XL Pipeline Act with bipartisan support by a vote of 62 to 36. On February 11, the House of Representatives passed the Keystone XL Pipeline Act with bipartisan support by a vote of 270 to 152. The cross-border pipeline would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast. According to the U.S. State Department, oil would be transported safely with minimal impact to the environment, and cause no disruption to the development of Canadian oil sands. This project contains strong protections and will comply with federal, state and local authorities. The Keystone XL Pipeline sets up basic energy infrastructure for future needs and is necessary to the progress of our country. Construction of the pipeline will stimulate the American economy through the creation of 42,000 new construction jobs and add an estimated $3.4 billion to GDP. This project has been under review for over six years and encountered numerous unnecessary delays by the Obama administration. There is broad-based support behind construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO.
11.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting in support of advancing the Fiscal Year 2016 defense spending bill to provide critical funding for our troops: “I am incredibly disappointed that my Democratic colleagues are once again blocking this important defense appropriations bill, which is critical to upholding our commitment to the military and our servicemembers. “As our nation faces some of the most complex security challenges in more than a generation, it is imperative that our military has the necessary means and capabilities to stave of terrorist threats, as well as confront growing violence and unrest in the Middle East. “If we send our men and women into harm’s way to protect and defend our national security, we absolutely must provide the proper tools and support they need and deserve. We must remain united in our efforts to support our armed forces and their servicemembers; this is an integral step towards that goal.” # # #

11.04.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a major victory for communities across Iowa and the middle class, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to put an end to this expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule today passed the U.S. Senate with bipartisan support. The legislation now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives. Following passage in the Senate, Ernst issued the following statement: “Today’s passage to scrap the expanded WOTUS rule is a major win for our hardworking farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses who are continuously ignored by the EPA. It is abundantly clear that the WOTUS rule is ill-conceived and breeds uncertainty, confusion, and more red tape that threatens the livelihoods of many in Iowa and across the country. “Our resolution stops the EPA from continuing to act as an unchecked federal agency of the Obama Administration, expanding its power over Iowa farmers, small businesses, ranchers, and other landowners in our rural communities. Iowans have an incentive to conserve their own land, they don’t need Washington bureaucrats from the EPA telling them what’s best. Passing this resolution is a major step forward to stop the EPA’s blatant power grab and scrap the expanded WOTUS rule. “The time to act is now and I will not ignore the commonsense voices of hardworking Americans. President Obama will ultimately be forced to decide between an unchecked federal agency, or the livelihoods of our rural communities who say this overreaching WOTUS rule must be stopped.” Click here and here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks on the floor of the Senate. Senator Ernst’s Additional Efforts to Scrap WOTUS Rule: Last month, Senator Ernst released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. The Iowa Senator cosponsored Senator Barrasso’s proposal, which provided clear principles and directions for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders. In May, Senator Ernst denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. In May, Senator Ernst also introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. In February, Senator Ernst invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa.

11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the floor of the United States Senate to urge support of her joint resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to eliminate the expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT “Mr. President, I rise today to talk about this ill-conceived and harmful Waters of the U.S. Rule, better known as ‘WOTUS’, and how its implementation threatens the livelihoods of many of my fellow Iowans. “As you know, Mr. President, recent court decisions have forced this rule – EPA’s latest power grab - to come to a screeching halt across the country because of the likelihood that EPA has overstepped its authority. “And to be clear, it’s not just me saying that – it’s the courts. “As my colleague and friend, the senior Senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley often says, ‘Washington is an island surrounded by reality.’ “There is not a more perfect phrase to describe how the events and process has unfolded surrounding this confusing rule. Only in Washington do unelected bureaucrats take 300 pages to simplify and provide clarity. “This rule is so complex and so ambiguous that folks in my state are concerned that any low spot on a farmer’s field - or a ditch - or a puddle after a rainstorm, may now fall under the EPA’s watch. “We all want clean water and clean air – that is not disputable. Time and again, I have emphasized that air we breathe and the water we drink needs to be clean and safe. “Statements suggesting otherwise can’t be farther from the truth; and it’s unfortunate that the EPA continues to fuel that line of false attack through their election style tactics and controversial lobbying efforts on social media. “This rule and this debate isn’t about clean water. No Mr. President, the heart of this debate is about how much authority the federal government and unelected bureaucrats should have to regulate what is done on private land. “Look at my state of Iowa. And you can see the map behind me. Look at my state of Iowa. This rule would give the EPA extensive power to regulate water on 97% of the land in the state of Iowa. 97%! “If you compare that to Iowa’s federal land acreage percentage of 0.3% – it is quite a shift in the current makeup of federal authority over the land in Iowa. “I spent the weekend going back through letters my fellow Iowans have sent me on this issue. And so many of them are frustrated with the lack of common sense coming out of Washington. They are taking this issue personally because their livelihood depends on it. “Many of the letters I get are from farmers who spend their days working land that has been in their families for generations, some going back over a hundred years. They have an incentive to take care of their land and conserve it for future generations. Caring for the land and conserving is a way of life in the heartland – and it’s as if the EPA just turns a blind eye to that fact. “One Iowan wrote, ‘This proposed rule is so vague, long and very unclear that I feel they are wanting farmers . . . to fail . . . so a large fine can be assessed. Why am I taking this personal?’ – She writes, ‘because, for me and my family, we live off this land. If we don’t take care of it – it will not take care of us. So I will do whatever I can to protect this land and water for my children. My family lives on well water, my cattle drink from the same well and I don’t want either to get sick.’ “That’s what one Iowan wrote. And I believe the same. “Exactly, Mr. President. “This rule would give EPA the authority to expand its power over family farms, small businesses, ranchers and other landowners in our rural communities. “Iowans are so concerned about this rule because they know it will actually create a negative impact on conservation and it is contradictory to the common sense and voluntary work that is taking place in communities across Iowa, today. “In Iowa, we have had a state-level clean water initiative in place for several years now. It’s a partnership between the state legislature, the Department of Natural Resources, the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa State University and a myriad of stakeholders across the state. “The Voluntary Nutrient Reduction Strategy is based on extensive research, and provides a path forward for conservation efforts that individual farmers can pursue with matching funds from the state. This science-based approach provides incentives for farmers and other landowners to make sustainable decisions on their own land, rather than be forced to adhere to a one-size-fits-all regulation that would do far more harm than good. “A farm in Iowa is not the same as one in Montana, and the rolling plains of Texas are very different from the hills and valleys of Pennsylvania. This is simply one more reason that this WOTUS rule is the wrong approach. A one-size-fits-all ‘solution’ from inside the beltway could have disastrous effects nationwide. “As I’ve mentioned, I’ve heard from constituents across the state of Iowa who have grave concerns with the ambiguity of this rule. They are holding off on making conservation improvements to their land, for fear of being later found out of compliance with this WOTUS rule, and facing significant fines. “Maybe it’s because we are so ‘Iowa Nice’ that we are inclined to work together collaboratively, rather than simply issuing more onerous regulations. Take the Middle Cedar Partnership for example – this project in Eastern Iowa uses local dollars and state funding, coupled with federal grants from the USDA to organize and advocate for land practices that improve water quality downstream. “The coalition is made up of city, county and state officials, business people, farmers, environmentalists and other concerned citizens. Together, they are making meaningful progress on multiple watershed projects within the Cedar River basin, and sharing what they have learned. This approach is now being adopted by other municipalities within the state. “Contrary to what some claim - Iowa has done all of this on its own, not at the behest of the EPA. In fact, the EPA has asked the leaders of Iowa’s efforts to come to D.C. and explain how they’re able to get such grassroots buy-in to voluntary conservation project and programs. The other states in the Mississippi River basin look to Iowa as a leader on water quality, and are modeling their own state-level efforts after ours in the state of Iowa. “Mr. President, while there are clear indications that this WOTUS rule is illegal and likely to be scrapped by the courts – that process could take years to play out and all at the expense of the average American. “Let’s not wait around for the inevitable and force our farmers and small businesses to operate in the dark while they wait. “Let’s fix this now and give American families the certainty they deserve. “And Mr. President, we can do that by passing the legislation before us. “I have led the charge here in the Senate on this joint resolution of disapproval which would scrap the rule entirely. “My legislation is the necessary next step in pushing back against this blatant power grab by the EPA. We will send this to the President where he will be forced to decide between the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and his unchecked federal agency. “I also voted for S. 1140, which provides the EPA with clear principles and directions on how best to craft a Waters of the U.S. rule. “It spells out the steps that they should have taken prior to finalizing this rule – to guarantee that they are taking into consideration the thoughtful comments from folks like farmers, ranchers, small businesses and manufacturers. “Congress is acting because it is evident that the EPA did not seriously consider the comments and perspective from those whom this rule will directly impact. “And it’s clear they are far outside the bounds of the congressional intent of the Clean Water Act. “Mr. President, Iowa is bounded by rivers – the very shape of our state is dictated by the mighty Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Take one look at the commerce and recreation happening on them, and it’s easy to see why these are considered ‘navigable water.’ When Congress passed the Clean Water Act, this was the type of water it intended to protect, not a grass waterway running across a farmer’s field, or a ditch bordering it. This rule ignores congressional intent, and is nothing more than a power grab by the EPA. “The EPA continues to run roughshod over Iowans, acting as if they are a legislative body – something they have no business doing. “It’s no wonder they have lost the trust of the American people and many here in Congress. “Every community wants clean water and to protect our nation’s waterways, but we simply cannot allow mounting unnecessary regulations to overwhelm the common sense voice of hardworking Americans. “Especially when they are not based on sound science – and again it’s not just me saying that. “The courts and the Army Corps have both called the EPA on their shaky data or lack thereof. “Yet unelected bureaucrats remained committed to making a political decision instead of the right decision. “As Iowa’s United States Senator, it’s my responsibility to speak up for the folks I represent and hold the federal government accountable when it’s clear they have gone too far. And make no mistake, they have here. “And with that Mr. President, I yield the floor.” # # #
11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In light of recent reports that Russian naval vessels have been operating along known routes of U.S. global communication undersea fiber optic cables, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Senators Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Roger Wicker (R-MS), sent a joint letter to Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, Secretary of State John Kerry and Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson requesting information on steps taken to enhance the security of our vital undersea network. As The New York Times reports: “Russian submarines and spy ships are aggressively operating near the vital undersea cables that carry almost all global Internet communications, raising concerns among some American military and intelligence officials that the Russians might be planning to attack those lines in times of tension or conflict.” “As widely cited in reports, undersea communication cables are responsible for moving trillions of dollars in global business, more than 95 percent of daily communications, and matters extremely significant to our national security,” the Senators wrote. “While we respect that the location, security protocols and conditions of many cables are classified for national security, we are increasingly concerned about cables whose locations are well known, yet still carry data important to our economic and military functions. While fiber optic cables have revolutionized global communications, they make the U.S. incredibly vulnerable to attack in U.S. and in international waters.” The Senators added, “With all due consideration to the classified nature of the cables and deep water drilling infrastructure, because of their significance to national security and energy supplies, we request information on what steps are being taken, and what steps need to be taken, in order to enhance the security of the undersea network on which the U.S. depends. Given the significant impact an attack could have on our economic stability, and cyber, energy, and national security, we write to ensure there is an effective effort between the Department of Defense and other U.S. government agencies to secure our nation.” “Developing a national security strategy that incorporates the vulnerability of our undersea network is of the utmost importance and we wish to discuss this matter further with you in a classified setting, while doing everything possible to allow the public to know we are taking every step to maintain their security,” the Senators stressed. In today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “Future of Warfare,” Senator Ernst highlighted the letter, emphasizing their concern for Russia’s activities near some of the underwater cables. The Iowa Senator asked Mr. Bryan Clark, Senior Fellow for the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, whether he is concerned about the security of the undersea cables and whether it exists. Watch the questioning here. Read the full letter here. # # #
11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The Senate today voted to proceed with debate on U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) joint resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to eliminate the expanded “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule. This resolution was taken up as the Senate continues to address legislation to tackle the overreaching and expanded definition of the WOTUS rule. Earlier, the Senate considered Senator Barrasso’s (R-WY) Federal Water Quality Protection Act (S.1140), which Senator Ernst cosponsored. Senator Barrasso’s legislation provided clear principles and directions for the EPA to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses. However, Senate Democrats blocked this legislation. The Senate in turn proceeded with consideration of Senator Ernst’s resolution, which, if enacted into law, would scrap the expanded WOTUS rule. S.J. Res. 22 requires only a simple majority in order to pass. “The expanded definition of WOTUS breeds confusion, uncertainty and more red tape. I am pleased that our proposal ensures every option is on the table to push back against the EPA’s blatant power grab,” said Senator Ernst. “Senate Democrats and President Obama will have an opportunity to stand on the side of our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses who say this ill-conceived and overreaching rule must be stopped or they can continue to stand with an unchecked federal agency.” In September, Senator Ernst led a group of 49 fellow Senators in introducing a joint resolution of disapproval that would scrap this rule entirely. According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa. See map below: # # #
11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst took to the Senate floor to congratulate her friend and colleague Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) on casting his 12,000th vote as a United States Senator. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT I rise today to congratulate my friend, colleague, and Iowa’s outstanding senior Senator on casting his 12,000th vote today in the wee early hours of this last Friday morning. In fact, there are only 17 other Senators in history who have cast more votes than Senator Chuck Grassley. On top of that, he has the longest existing voting streak in Congress. This farmer from Iowa serves as the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and is one of the highest-ranking members in the United States Senate. But that has not gone to his head – not for Chuck Grassley. Back home in Iowa, he travels all 99 counties every single year and he has done this for 35 years – 35 wonderful years. And today, his travels across the state to all 99 counties have a name. It is called the “the Full Grassley,” so that is something that our elected officials and even the presidential candidates that visit Iowa – it’s something they try to complete as well. Senator Grassley has set a high bar and I’m very glad that he did. Over the years, I’ve learned quite a bit about my friend, Senator Chuck Grassley. His extremely thrifty ways and because he is extremely thrifty – of course he is always looking out for our taxpayer dollars. He fights tirelessly for accountability and transparency in Washington. And I can always count on Senator Grassley to stop by my office for donuts and coffee and to meet all of our wonderful Iowa constituents who happen to be visiting Washington, D.C. He says it’s to visit the constituents, I really think it’s for the free donuts – but, we are glad that he stops by. Senator Grassley is the epitome of the Iowa Way and he has faithfully upheld these values in the United States Senate. He is a workhorse and has dedicated his entire career to serving Iowans. Iowa has no greater friend than Senator Chuck Grassley. Congratulations Senator on your 12,000th vote. Congratulations to Barbara also. Get your Twitter ready, because at noon we’re going to celebrate. # # #
11.03.2015	WASHINGTON – Today, Senators Tom Carper (D-Del.), a retired Navy captain, and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, sent a letter to Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Deputy Under Secretary Curtis Coy requesting that the department provide more information about the status of flight training programs that have been suspended by VA on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. “Ten schools were found to have flight programs in violation of the 85/15 Rule, and VA suspended these programs from enrolling new veteran students until they become compliant with the law,” the Senators wrote. “We believe that this information should be available to all prospective students who intend to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill to help finance their higher education.” The GI Bill Comparison Tool offers important resources to veterans with Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits who are seeking to pursue higher education programs. It’s critical that veterans know when a program listed on the tool has violated federal regulations regarding veteran enrollment, and whether or not that program has been suspended from enrolling new students. Adding more information about these programs to the GI Bill Comparison tool will help ensure veterans can make smart choices about enrolling in educational programs. Last month, Senators Carper and Ernst sent a letter to VA Secretary Robert McDonald requesting more information about flight schools that contract with public colleges and universities after news reports claimed that some schools were charging taxpayers over $500,000 to train veterans using Post-9/11 GI Bill education benefits. The Senators recently received a preliminary response from the department, identifying among other troubling findings that the Post-9/11 GI Bill expenditure on aviation-related degree programs at public institutes of higher learning (IHLs) has nearly doubled to $80 million per year for fewer than 2,000 students. A comprehensive summary can be found here. The text of the letter is below and a pdf can be found here. Dear Mr. Coy, We recently received an interim response from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to our September 30, 2015 letter to Secretary McDonald regarding the costs of certain flight training programs and whether VA has the tools to protect veterans and taxpayers from bad actors. One of the most important ways that VA can protect veterans and taxpayers from spending excessive and unnecessary sums on flight training programs is by enforcing the 85/15 Rule. This important rule was created to protect the GI Bill from academic programs that rely too heavily on veterans’ education benefits to stay in business. The 85/15 Rule requires VA to halt veteran enrollment at programs when more than 85 percent of their students are receiving educational assistance from the VA. We were pleased that VA’s interim response included an overview of a recent audit that assessed each flight program’s 85/15 compliance. As you know, VA conducted compliance surveys from April 6, 2015 through May 8, 2015 at all public institutions of higher learning (IHLs) with contracted flight programs. The findings of these surveys were troubling. Three schools were operating non-VA approved programs, and VA banned each school from participating in the Post-9/11 GI Bill program. Another 10 schools were found to have flight programs in violation of the 85/15 Rule, and VA suspended these programs from enrolling new veteran students until they become compliant with the law. We believe that this information should be available to all prospective students who intend to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill to help finance their higher education. Currently, VA lists “caution flags” for particular schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool when VA determines that prospective veteran students would benefit from having certain additional information, including when schools have been designated to be in Heightened Cash Monitoring (HCM) status. We believe that this information is important for veterans. We also believe that the GI Bill Comparison Tool should include caution flags that indicate 85/15 violations and whether flight programs are prohibited from enrolling new students using the Post-9/11 GI Bill. While we remain concerned with unnecessary and excessive spending on flight training programs, we also believe veterans would benefit from more accurate information on the GI Bill Comparison Tool’s website. Given that none of the 10 suspended programs have become compliant with the law since VA completed its review over five months ago, we are urging you to add visible caution flags as soon as possible. Our veterans would greatly benefit from having this information. Thank you for your work on behalf of our nations’ veterans and for consistently improving upon the GI Bill Comparison Tool. We look forward to your response, and to the swift completion of another critical improvement that will help veterans make more informed educational choices. Sincerely yours, # # #
11.03.2015	This week the Senate will turn its attention to the overreaching and expanded definition of the “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule. Senator Ernst has secured strong support from her colleagues through a discharge petition to ensure the Senate can consider her joint resolution of disapproval (S.J. Res. 22) to scrap WOTUS without a filibuster. The Iowa Senator’s efforts to stop this ill-conceived rule has enabled the Senate to consider S.J. Res. 22 without any further delay. Last month, there were a total of 50 Senators who supported Senator Ernst’s resolution. S.J. Res. 22 requires only a simple majority in order to pass. About Senator Ernst’s Joint Resolution of Disapproval… S.J. Res. 22 allows Congress to review major rules issued by federal agencies and utilize expedited procedures to overturn regulations before the rule takes effect. The Senate will first consider Senator Barrasso’s (R-WY) proposal, which Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of, and provides clear principles and directions for the EPA to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by folks like farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses. Senator Ernst’s resolution ensures that all available options are on the table if needed. Senator Barrasso is also a cosponsor of Senator Ernst’s proposal. As Senator Ernst stated, “These efforts are the next necessary steps in pushing back against this blatant power grab, and I’m optimistic it will head to the President’s desk where he will be forced to decide between the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and his unchecked federal agency.” WOTUS Impact On Iowa… According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa.

11.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced that Cameron Sutton, State Director for Senator Ernst, is retiring from his government responsibilities and Clarke Scanlon, Deputy State Director, will succeed Sutton as the new State Director. “We are incredibly fortunate as an office and a state to have a great team of dedicated public servants working on behalf of the people of Iowa. Cam is a passionate advocate for Iowa and I am grateful for his help to establish offices across the state to better serve our constituents,” said Senator Ernst. “Clarke has a wealth of knowledge serving the people of our state for more than two decades. He has been an asset to our team and I am proud to welcome him in this new role.” “It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as Senator Ernst’s first State Director,” said Cameron Sutton. “In working to open the Senator’s five offices in Iowa and hiring the outstanding personnel to staff them, I’ve accomplished what she asked me to do back in December. Our Deputy State Director and good friend, Clarke Scanlon, is well-qualified to serve Iowans as State Director and brings with him over 20 years in experience of serving Congressman Latham and Senator Grassley.” “I am honored to have spent this year helping Senator Ernst and Cam build an incredible statewide Iowa team dedicated to serving all Iowans,” said Clarke Scanlon. “I am truly humbled at the opportunity Senator Ernst has given me to help lead her Iowa staff.” Clarke Scanlon served Senator Ernst as her Deputy State Director since January. Previously he worked as District Director for Congressmen Tom Latham and Greg Ganske for fifteen years. He also spent eight years on Senator Chuck Grassley’s Iowa staff. Scanlon is an Iowa City native and a graduate of Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa. He lives in Johnston with his wife Stacy and two teenaged sons. # # #
11.02.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following a recent Congressional delegation trip to the Middle East, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mike Rounds (R-SD) sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter raising serious concerns voiced by American servicemembers and foreign leaders in the region. The Senators echoed concerns that the Department of Defense’s Train and Equip Program and the coalition effort to defeat ISIL are not achieving the desired outcome – including U.S. support for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and their Peshmerga Forces. Senators Ernst and Rounds called on Secretary Carter in their letter to strengthen support to the KRG. “Unfortunately, the picture provided to us in theater is starkly different from that which is provided to the American people, and to us as elected officials in the Senate and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee,” the Senators wrote. “Specifically, it does not appear that coalition efforts are having the Administration’s desired ‘degrade and destroy’ effects against ISIL.” The Senators continued, “While visiting Iraq, our meeting with foreign officials painted a grim picture of the U.S. and coalition effort against ISIL. In particular, our time on the ground did not alleviate our long-standing concerns about inadequate U.S. support to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and their Peshmerga forces.” “In conclusion, we ask the Department to strengthen its support to the KRG based on the troubling operational situation in large portions of Iraq, the dedication of the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against ISIL, and KRG support provided to the over 1.6 million displaced persons within their territory,” the Senators requested. Full text of the letter is below, and a signed copy of the letter can be found here. November 2, 2015 The Honorable Ashton CarterSecretary of Defense1000 Defense PentagonWashington, DC 20301 Dear Secretary Carter: We write to you today to raise concern regarding our coalition effort to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and support to our Iraqi Kurdish partners. We recently returned from meeting with U.S. servicemembers and foreign leaders throughout Iraq and Afghanistan. Unfortunately, the picture provided to us in theater is starkly different from that which is provided to the American people, and to us as elected officials in the Senate and members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Specifically, it does not appear that coalition efforts are having the Administration’s desired “degrade and destroy” effects against ISIL. While visiting Iraq, our meeting with foreign officials painted a grim picture of the U.S. and coalition effort against ISIL. In particular, our time on the ground did not alleviate our long-standing concerns about inadequate U.S. support to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and their Peshmerga forces. While meeting with our KRG allies in Erbil, we were again informed the military support promised to them from Baghdad is far from being provided, and the level of support, such as adequate stocks of small arms ammunition, is not enough to effectively defend their territory against ISIL. Furthermore, the coalition’s piecemeal supply of various Russian and NATO weapons and ammunition makes resupply extremely difficult for Peshmerga forces—as it would for U.S. forces if faced with a similar logistical situation. The KRG also informed us that they require heavier weapons, more equipment in general, and protective gear—as already provided to ISF units for a number of years—to more effectively defend their territory. As this is something we specifically worked to achieve via the NDAA, we have heightened concerns for the needs of our allies on the front lines against ISIL. In conclusion, we ask the Department to strengthen its support to the KRG based on the troubling operational situation in large portions of Iraq, the dedication of the Kurdish Peshmerga in their fight against ISIL, and KRG support provided to the over 1.6 million displaced persons within their territory. Specifically we ask your views on what additional measures the United States can take to support our Kurdish allies. Sincerely, # # #
10.30.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement in opposition to legislation that would increase our national debt limit, encourage more spending, and make major cuts to the crop insurance program: Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: “Hi, I’m Joni Ernst, your U.S. Senator from Iowa. “Like many Iowans, I’m tired of Washington’s reckless habit of governing from one crisis to the next. We have known for months that this day was coming, and yet this backroom deal was crafted to rack up more spending and debt without regard for the future. “Earlier this year, we passed a balanced budget for the first time in over a decade and we should abide by these guidelines. Instead, this deal was negotiated behind closed doors without the full input of Congress or the American people. “Iowans sent me to Congress with a clear mandate: to cut the reckless, irresponsible, and out of control spending problem in Washington. Our nation is more than $18.4 trillion in debt already, and we simply can’t continue spending money that we don’t have. I have heard from a great number of Iowans who have said enough is enough when it comes to increasing our debt. Therefore, I cannot support this shortsighted deal that hands Washington a credit card without a limit and sidesteps the tough decisions that the American people elected Congress to make. “It is also unacceptable that this deal places an additional burden on our hardworking farmers by making major cuts to the crop insurance program that will hit our rural communities the hardest. While we can find savings at all levels of our bloated government, crop insurance has already been trimmed down and these cuts would be incredibly harmful to our agricultural industry. “This trajectory of continuously writing blank checks for limitless government spending is completely unacceptable. As a mother, I will not stand silently by and allow more than $57,000 to be passed on to each of my daughters and grandchildren. We need to work towards real solutions that hardworking Iowans and folks across this country deserve, to solve this problem for our children and grandchildren. “Please continue to send your thoughts, questions and ideas to us by calling our office or visiting our website: Ernst.Senate.Gov. “I look forward to hearing from you soon.” # # #
10.29.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – On the heels of U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) recent work to introduce a joint resolution of disapproval, S.J. Res. 22, that would scrap the expanded “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule, Senator Ernst has secured enough support to ensure the Senate can consider the bill without a filibuster. Senator Ernst’s efforts to stop the expanded definition of WOTUS will be taken up in the next week or two. Last month, Senator Ernst led a group of 49 fellow Senators in introducing an effort to eliminate the WOTUS rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE), which expands the scope of federal authority over land and waterways. After securing strong support from her colleagues through a discharge petition, the Senate will now have to consider Senator Ernst’s S.J. Res. 22 in opposition of this harmful WOTUS rule. “I am pleased the Senate will now move forward with our efforts to confront this ill-conceived and harmful WOTUS rule; we must eliminate unnecessary confusion and red tape for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and small businesses,” said Senator Ernst. “These efforts are the next necessary steps in pushing back against this blatant power grab, and I’m optimistic it will head to the President’s desk where he will be forced to decide between the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and his unchecked federal agency.” Sen. Ernst’s Additional Efforts to Scrap WOTUS: Earlier this month, Senator Ernst released a statement following a federal court ruling to issue a nationwide stay, suspending implementation of WOTUS. The Iowa Senator is also a cosponsor of Senator Barrasso’s proposal which provides clear principles and directions for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders, without causing additional harmful and unnecessary government regulations. In May, Senator Ernst denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. In May, Senator Ernst also introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. In February, Senator Ernst invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA and ACE jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa.

10.27.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA), bipartisan legislation to improve America’s cybersecurity through voluntary information sharing. “The cyber threat against our nation is one of the most severe threats we face in the 21st century. “CISA is an important first step to improve our cybersecurity capabilities in both the private and public sectors. This bipartisan legislation achieves an important balance – including both rigorous oversight to ensure Americans’ privacy is protected, as well as procedures to bolster the government’s ability to deter, detect, and defend against cyberattacks. “Cyberspace has provided hackers, terrorists, and our adversaries around the world with the capability to cause massive damage and greatly impact our way of life with a few keystrokes on a computer. If we do nothing, cyberattacks are sure to continue, leaving our information and national security at greater risk. “Our cybersecurity experts must be able to gain a technological advantage and have the means necessary to prevent future attacks. CISA confronts these challenges by creating a voluntary framework to promote real time information sharing across the government and private sector in order to keep our systems secure and help to prevent cyberattacks before they happen.” # # #
10.24.2015	MARSHALLTOWN, IOWA - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today completed her first 99 county tour across Iowa as a United States Senator with a visit to Central Iowa Healthcare in Marshall County. The Iowa Senator launched the tour with a town meeting in her hometown of Red Oak, Iowa in January. “Iowans know what is best for Iowa, which is why I launched a 99 county tour to visit with as many fellow Iowans as possible, every year. This tour has been invaluable to hear directly from folks about the issues impacting their everyday life. “Over the past year, I have held town meetings across Iowa, and visited manufacturers, agricultural operations, small business, hospitals, schools, and more. Here in Iowa, we work with our neighbors to find solutions to the many problems we face. For the last ten months, I’ve been working to bring this commonsense approach to Washington, rather than resorting to the political theatre that consumes Congress. “I am dedicated to working for all Iowans; I look forward to continuing to bring their ideas and feedback to Washington to craft and implement real solutions as we chart a new path forward.” To check out Senator Ernst’s 99 county tour on social media, follow the hashtag #99CountyTour on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. # # #
10.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At a press conference ahead of President Obama’s veto of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 (NDAA), U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today highlighted the challenging landscape of the Middle East and the need to provide for our military and servicemembers engaged in the fight against terrorism. Following the President’s veto of NDAA, Senator Ernst added: “I am extremely disappointed that President Obama vetoed a bipartisan bill which authorizes the funding level he requested and helps put our country on solid footing to stave off terrorist threats. At a time when our nation faces increasingly complex security challenges, I urge my colleagues in Congress to remain united in our efforts to ensure our men and women in uniform have the resources and support they need and deserve.” Audio of the press conference is available here and a transcript of the Iowa Senator’s remarks is below. TRANSCRIPT: “Thank you everyone for being here today, and to the Chairmen also for their very hard work on this important piece of legislation. Good afternoon everyone. “Over the weekend I returned from a Congressional Delegation trip to Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Afghanistan with a few of my Senate colleagues. “The trip for me was very eye opening. Even though I served in the Middle East with the Iowa National Guard, I was still taken back by the current situation on the ground. It was quite evident—even on my short trip to the region—that the situation on the ground poses a greater threat to our homeland, US interests, and our allies, than the Obama Administration has led the American people to believe. “My time in the region taught me this—the men and women in Afghanistan – those that are deployed there – are on the front lines of a very serious war, and they are extremely concerned about the level of troops and military capabilities in the region to stay safe. “When we said ‘Never Again’ after 9/11, the American people meant it. If we send Americans into harm’s way in Afghanistan, we owe them the military capabilities necessary to defeat terrorist safe havens and to ensure the Afghan government can develop a credible security force to defend themselves. “ISIS has made it into Afghanistan, and they continue to spread and grow. We are very much losing our voice and leadership in the region. “The Middle East is a disaster. I’ve been here almost 10 months and having been sent to war by many of the people still serving in Congress today, it’s extremely disappointing that with all this unrest in the Middle East, the President would even entertain the thought of vetoing the NDAA. “Ultimately, we must never forget the folks overseas engaging in this fight every single day. We have brave Iowans and servicemembers from across the country putting themselves in harm’s way. We must always ensure that we are united in supporting their efforts. “Thank you very much I am pleased to join our members here today.” To read more about the NDAA, which President Obama vetoed today, click here. Summary of Senator Ernst’s Provisions in NDAA: A provision which provides the President with the legal authority, if the President finds the Government of Iraq is not increasing its political inclusiveness, to directly arm the Kurdish Regional Government, in coordination with the Iraqi government to the extent necessary, to fight ISIS. This provision also provides the sense of Congress on the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq, including Iraqi Kurdistan, and the security and stability of the region and the world. It also shares the sense that the U.S., in coordination with our coalition partners, provide without undue delay – the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment, and training necessary to more effectively partner with the U.S. and other international partners to defeat ISIS. A provision to improve the Clay Hunt SAV Act pilot program by requiring outreach of the VA’s community-based veteran peer support network to our wounded, ill, and injured service members, as well as all service members within 180 days of leaving service. This provision will ensure the VA will be proactive, instead of reactive, with its outreach to those who have sacrificed for our nation on this important mental health pilot program. A provision requiring a joint report to the Senate Armed Services Committee from the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy, a plan to jointly modernize Army and Marine Corps small arms during a 15-year period. This provision seeks to reduce duplication of efforts between the services, potentially realize cost savings in developing common small arms weapons and technology, and improve the committee’s oversight of the modernization strategies of both of the branches of service whose primary mission it is to fight and win our nation’s land conflicts. A provision, for the next five years, which provides new or current leases on Army Ammunition Plants, under the Army’s ARMS initiative, the option of extending a 25-year lease for an additional 25-year period. This provision will attract and retain greater investment, reduce facility sustainment cost, and provide a boost to some local communities - including the Des Moines County Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. A provision which extends the National Guard State Partnership Program for five years. # # #
10.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today at a Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing entitled “Agriculture Biotechnology: A Look at Federal Regulation and Stakeholder Perspectives”, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) cited a recent report released by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) that pointed out the national security threats posed by global food insecurity. Senator Ernst emphasized that failure to embrace biotechnology could ultimately put our military and our country at risk. The Iowa Senator questioned the panel which included: Mr. Mike Gregoire, Associate Administrator of the Animal and Plant Inspection Service (APHIS) at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); Mr. William Jordan, Deputy Director of the Office of Pesticide Programs at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); and Dr. Susan Mayne, Director of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). During her questioning, Senator Ernst detailed, “If we fail to embrace biotechnology as a safe, affordable and timely way to bring food production methods to developing and unstable nations, we are ultimately putting our military and our country at greater risk. How can this Administration and your agencies specifically work to help the public better understand biotechnology, so we can better address the national security challenges laid out by DNI?” The hearing comes on the heels of the World Food Prize in Des Moines, an award presentation in honor of Iowan Dr. Norman Borlaug. He is a 1970 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and a trailblazer in the development of global food sustainability. Recently, Senator Ernst penned a column for Waverly Newspapers, highlighting Dr. Borlaug’s vast contributions and the need for GMOs to help feed a growing and hungry world. She wrote in part: Dr. Borlaug dedicated his life to the tireless pursuit of an important goal to feed a growing and hungry world. He made breakthroughs in plant breeding, especially in developing disease resistant varieties of wheat, which were well suited to broad swaths of the globe, and produced dramatically higher yields than their predecessors. The spread of these ever improving seeds, as well as the knowledge of improved cultivation practices, across Mexico and later in Asia and Latin America became known as the Green Revolution, which has subsequently reduced hunger, famine, and poverty around the world. For this, Dr. Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Congressional Gold Medal, and has been credited with saving over one billion lives. While we celebrate his vast contributions, we are faced with the harsh reality that his fight is not yet won. Much of the world remains impoverished, and malnutrition in children is the primary force holding back emergent nations. Additionally, the global population is projected to swell to nine billion by the year 2050. However, the good news is we are currently enjoying a second Green Revolution due in large part to the remarkable advances being made in biotechnology. Our Iowa farmers and the agricultural industry nationwide have been growing safe, nutritious, and affordable Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) for decades; and much like the first Green Revolution, many have taken for granted the remarkable benefits that have accompanied this transition. Every year we are producing more food on fewer acres, while using less pesticides to produce healthy and bountiful crops in all climates and conditions. Click here to read the full column.

Well, thank you folks for joining us here today in this committee hearing, I just came from the Armed Services Committee, and of course we focused very much on national security. And Senator, I believe you mentioned national security and food security in your opening statement, so thank you for doing that. The Director of National Intelligence, DNI, released a report last week pointing out the national security threats posed by global food insecurity. If we fail to embrace biotechnology as a safe, affordable and timely way to bring food production methods to developing and unstable nations, we are ultimately putting our military and our country at greater risk. How can this Administration and your agencies specifically work to help the public better understand the science supporting biotechnology, so we can better address the national security challenges laid out by DNI? And I would open that up to our entire first panel. MR. GREGOIRE: Well I mentioned some things that we are already doing in terms of being transparent in terms of our decision making and the coordinated framework review that we have undertaken is at least in part designed to get at this issue. Beyond that I just think we just really need to redouble our efforts to communicate better about our processes and the science behind them. SEN. ERNST: Thank you. MR. JORDAN: Government needs to speak clearly, to answer questions responsibly, to lay out fully all of the information that we have, and I hope and expect that anyone who gives that fair consideration will conclude as we have that our decisions are protecting public health and the environment, and the food is safe. SEN. ERNST: Ok, thank you Mr. Jordan. Dr. Mayne? DR. MAYNE: I’d say just continue to educate as best we can using plain language techniques as best we can to communicate what the science really indicates and with regards to the processes and how we review these commodities for safety. SEN. ERNST: Well I appreciate that. I do think that many of use this phrase in our home communities, since many of us are from agricultural areas, but, we do “feed and fuel the world,” and I do believe that that is very important to maintain stability around the globe in making sure that populations are fed. So, I appreciate your answers today, but it’s something we need to continue working on. I believe that GMOs are safe, I believe we should have them available to the globe. So, thank you very much, we appreciate it. # # #
10.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at a Senate Judiciary Committee nomination hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger, nominee for the Southern District of Iowa, and Judge Leonard Terry Strand, nominee for the Northern District of Iowa. Their respective nominations to federal district courts in Iowa will be voted on in a future Judiciary Committee hearing. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: “Mr. Chair. Thank you Senator Schumer. I appreciate the hydrology report from Iowa as well as your other factoids. And I do want to congratulate all of our nominees here today as well, but specifically, why I am here in front the of the Judiciary Committee: It is my privilege today to introduce two superb nominees for the federal bench in Iowa – Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger and Judge Leonard Terry Strand. “These two nominees have come to us as a result of an extensive search conducted by a Judicial Selection Commission formed by Chairman Grassley. This commission was comprised of experienced and respected members of Iowa’s legal community who spent countless hours reviewing applications and carefully studying the applicants’ professional history and qualifications. The Commission then made the recommendation of Judges Ebinger and Strand to Chairman Grassley, who in turn reviewed them, consulted with me, and then recommended them to the White House. “After receiving her law degree in 2004 from Yale Law School, Judge Rebecca Ebinger commenced a well-regarded career in public service – notably serving as a law clerk to Judge Michael Joseph Melloy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and as an Assistant United States Attorney in the Criminal Divisions of both the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Iowa and the Southern District of Iowa. “Since 2012, Judge Ebinger has served as a State District Judge in Iowa and remains active in a number of professional associations and community organizations. Along with Chairman Grassley, I am delighted to welcome her and her family here. Thank you very much. “After graduating at the top of his class from the University of Iowa College of Law, Judge Leonard Strand joined the Cedar Rapids law firm Simmons, Perrine, Moyer, and Bergman, focusing his practice on employment law and commercial litigation. In addition to receiving a number of professional honors during the course of his career, he is active in a number of professional organizations and has served as both Director and President of the Northern District of Iowa Branch of the Historical Society of the United States Courts. “In 2012, Judge Strand became a Magistrate Judge for the Northern District of Iowa, a position he continues to serve in today. His family is also here with him today, and I am delighted to welcome them as well. Thank you for attending today. “I have a tremendous amount of respect for these two nominees and their impressive careers, as well as their willingness to commit to public service. Both nominees are experienced and greatly respected in the Iowa legal community. I am honored to support them for these positions, and I look forward to what I hope will be a speedy approval of their nominations. Thank you, Mr. Chairman I appreciate it.” # # #
10.20.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting to proceed with Senate consideration of the Stop Sanctuary Policies and Protect Americans Act, legislation that would withhold certain federal funding from jurisdictions known as “sanctuary cities” that defy Department of Homeland Security (DHS) detainer requests or withhold information in violation of federal law. “Law enforcement at the federal, state and local levels should have the opportunity and ability to work together to ensure that potentially dangerous criminals who have entered our country illegally are not set free. This commonsense legislation is an opportunity to discourage shortsighted and dangerous policies that often unfortunately end up protecting such criminals instead of our law-abiding U.S. citizens. Today’s vote was simply about keeping our communities safe by ensuring that DHS can coordinate with state and local law enforcement officials to assume custody of illegal immigrants who commit crimes before they are released back into the community. “Ultimately, the safety and well-being of our citizens must be the chief priority of law enforcement officials at every level of government. While protecting individuals’ civil liberties, this bill removes the legal liability concerns that may have previously dissuaded state and local cooperation with DHS, thereby clearing the way for a collaborative effort to keep our communities safe. “I’m disappointed by today’s outcome. Congress must continue to discuss the impact of sanctuary cities on our ability to effectively enforce immigration laws and prevent needless crime.” # # #
10.17.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced Saturday that she and four other Members of Congress just wrapped up a visit to Israel, Jordan, Iraq and Afghanistan. Led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Iowa Senator was also joined by Senators Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Representative Andy Barr (R-KY). During their trip, the lawmakers met with U.S. troops, military leaders and political leaders to review regional issues and the counter-ISIL campaign. In addition to visiting with soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines from their respective states, the Members met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, KRG President Masoud Barzani, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, and Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah. “The trip has been invaluable to gather the Ground Truth,” said Senator Ernst. "I have been able to visit with national leaders, as well as servicemen and women - including three of Iowa's own - in countries facing extremist groups. Following this trip, I have great hope we will continue to be strong partners with these nations." (Senator Joni Ernst meets with Iowa servicemembers) The delegation returns to Washington, D.C. on Saturday. # # #
10.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement upon learning of the passing of Iowa Representative Jack Drake. "Jack was a phenomenal voice for our agricultural community and our great state. I was honored to serve with Jack in the state legislature and always valued his hard work and in-depth knowledge on the issues most important to Iowans. Jack was a good friend and he will be greatly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Shirley and their family during this difficult time." # # #
10.09.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, ruled to suspend implementation of the final “Waters of the U.S.” (WOTUS) rule nationwide, stating among other things, that defendants of the rule have not “…identified specific scientific support substantiating the reasonableness” of certain parts of this rule. By issuing a “stay” (a suspended implementation of the rule for a period of time), Iowa - and the rest of the nation - are granted a reprieve from this ill-conceived and harmful rule. Upon this ruling, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement: “Today’s ruling sends a strong message to the EPA that it has for too long ignored the voice and legitimate concerns raised by those directly impacted by the expanded definition of WOTUS and mounting overregulation on hardworking Americans. “The EPA continues to act as an unchecked federal agency of the Obama Administration, expanding its power over Iowa farms, small businesses, ranchers, and other landowners in our rural communities. “It is abundantly clear that this ill-conceived rule breeds uncertainty and confusion, while adding more red tape that threatens the livelihoods of many in Iowa and across the country. “That is why I recently introduced a resolution, along with 49 of my Senate colleagues, to scrap this rule and send a message to the EPA that they failed to address the concerns raised by farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses in Iowa and across the country. “I remain steadfast in my commitment to see this rule scrapped for good and not just on pause. It’s time President Obama’s EPA take into account the commonsense voice of hardworking Iowans who know what this rule means for them and their families." From the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit Ruling: "A stay allows for a more deliberate determination whether this exercise of Executive power, enabled by Congress and explicated by the Supreme Court, is proper under the dictates of federal law. A stay temporarily silences the whirlwind of confusion that springs from uncertainty about the requirements of the new Rule and whether they will survive legal testing. A stay honors the policy of cooperative federalism that informs the Clean Water Act and must attend the shared responsibility for safeguarding the nation’s waters. See 33 U.S.C. § 1251(b) ("It is the policy of Congress to recognize, preserve, and protect the primary responsibilities and rights of the States to prevent, reduce, and eliminate pollution."). In light of the disparate rulings on this very question issued by district courts around the country—enforcement of the Rule having been preliminarily enjoined in thirteen states —a stay will, consistent with Congress’s stated purpose of establishing a national policy, 33 U.S.C. § 1251(a), restore uniformity of regulation under the familiar, if imperfect, pre-Rule regime, pending judicial review. "Accordingly, on due review of the relevant considerations in light of the briefs filed by petitioners, respondents and intervenors, and in the exercise of our discretion, we GRANT petitioners’ motion for stay. The Clean Water Rule is hereby STAYED, nationwide, pending further order of the court." Sen. Ernst’s Efforts to Scrap WOTUS: In September, Senator Ernst led a group of 49 Senators in a joint resolution of disapproval to scrap the expanded WOTUS definition, sending a strong message to EPA and ACE that they failed to address concerns raised by Iowans. In May, Senator Ernst denounced the EPA’s finalized WOTUS rule as harmful to Iowa. In May, Senator Ernst also introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. In February, Senator Ernst invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. Administrator McCarthy has yet to take Senator Ernst up on this offer. # # #
10.08.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Mazie Hirono (D-HI), led eight co-sponsors, in introducing the bipartisan Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support Act of 2015 (VETS Act), legislation to improve health care access for disabled or rural veterans by expanding telehealth services provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As defined by the Department of Health and Human Services telehealth is, “the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration. Technologies include videoconferencing, the internet, store-and-forward imaging, streaming media, and terrestrial and wireless communications.” Under current law, the VA may only waive the state license requirement for telehealth services if both the patient and physician are located in a federally owned facility. In addition, the VA may only perform at-home telehealth care when the patient and physician are located in the same state. These barriers are a deterrent for disabled or rural veterans who are seeking treatment from a physician in another state, in some cases forcing veterans to travel great lengths to a federal facility before receiving telehealth services by camera or phone. The VETS Act would address these deficiencies by allowing qualified VA health professionals to operate across state lines and conduct telehealth services, including mental health care treatment, for veterans from the comfort and privacy of their own homes. Telehealth is one of the VA’s major transformational initiatives, and the number of veterans utilizing telehealth services continues to climb. In fact, VA telehealth care grew by 18 percent among veterans in Fiscal Year 2014 and in turn more than 12 percent of veterans received elements of their care through telehealth services. According to the VA, 88 percent of veterans who utilized the VA’s telehealth services were satisfied with the care they received. Telehealth services are effective and affordable as veterans save on average $2,000 per year in health care related costs, including travel to a VA medical facility. “The bipartisan Veterans E-Health & Telemedicine Support Act moves us one step closer to achieving more affordable, patient-centered health care that our veterans deserve by embracing telehealth services to offer physician care and health treatment beyond the walls of a VA facility,” said Senator Ernst. “Telehealth care is an innovative and important means to meet the wide-ranging needs of veterans in Iowa and nationwide, including the invisible struggles of mental health care.” “Our nation has a moral obligation to provide the best care for all veterans,” said Senator Hirono. “This legislation would eliminate the added burden of traveling long distances, or even to different states, in order to see a doctor. The VETS Act will build on a VA telemedicine program that is proven to work and removes barriers to accessing care particularly for veterans in rural areas like Hawaii’s Neighbor Islands.” Additional cosponsors to the bipartisan VETS Act include: Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), John Boozman (R-AR), John Cornyn (R-TX), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and Tom Udall (D-NM). The VETS Act is widely endorsed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the American Legion, Concerned Veterans for America, and the American Telemedicine Association. The companion bill in the U.S. House of Representatives was introduced by Congressmen Charles Rangel (D-NY) and Glen Thompson (R-PA). Click here to read the full text of the VETS Act. VETS Act: Allows VA health professionals to practice telemedicine across state lines if they are qualified and practice within the scope of their authorized federal duties. Ensures the VA and Congress provide oversight of the VA’s telehealth program by requiring the VA to measure program effectiveness. Benefits of VA Telehealth Services in Fiscal Year 2014: Provided veterans telehealth care from more than 150 VA Medical Centers and over 750 Community Based Outpatient Clinics. More than 12 percent of veterans received elements of their care through telehealth services. More than 717,000 veterans participated in over 2.1 million telehealth care interactions. 45 percent of veterans who used telehealth services lived in rural areas. Reduced hospital bed days of care by 54 percent. Reduced hospital admissions by 32 percent. VA telehealth care grew by 18 percent among veterans in Fiscal Year 2014. Patient satisfaction for clinical video telehealth averaged 94 percent. Patient satisfaction for overall home telehealth services averaged 88 percent. Home telehealth services save veterans on average $2,000 per year. # # #
10.07.2015	“As our nation faces some of the most complex security challenges in more than a generation, I urge the President to sign this fiscal year’s NDAA without delay.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today voted in support of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) conference report for Fiscal Year 2016, which includes five major provisions offered by the Iowa Senator. Among the provisions is a measure building on Senator Ernst’s previous bipartisan efforts in support of arming the Kurdish Peshmerga, critical partners to the United States in the fight against ISIS. The provision instills a sense of the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territory of Iraq, providing the President with the option to directly provide arms and training to the Kurdish Peshmerga in coordination with coalition partners at the President’s discretion. Sen. Ernst released the following statement after the Senate passed the NDAA conference report, which will head to the President’s desk: “This comprehensive blueprint puts our Department of Defense on solid footing to stave off terrorist threats; permits lethal assistance to Ukraine; includes breakthrough technologies and modernizations to meet the unique challenges we face in cyberspace and all around the world; and prohibits the transfer of detainees out of Guantanamo Bay. In addition, this legislation builds on our continued efforts to strengthen policy for prevention, victim support and to stop retaliation in sexual assault cases. “Furthermore, this NDAA adopted several of my provisions including improvements to the VA’s outreach for its peer-to-peer support program to help veterans suffering from mental health issues; extends the National Guard State Partnership Program; gives the President the authority to directly arm the Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment needed to fight against ISIS; and ensures that federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule, among many other critical measures. “As our nation faces some of the most complex security challenges in more than a generation, I urge the President to sign this fiscal year’s NDAA without delay.” Ernst Provisions Included in NDAA Conference Report: A provision which provides the President with the legal authority, if the President finds the Government of Iraq is not increasing its political inclusiveness, to directly arm the Kurdish Regional Government, in coordination with the Iraqi government to the extent necessary, to fight ISIS. This provision also provides the sense of Congress on the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq, including Iraqi Kurdistan, and the security and stability of the region and the world. It also shares the sense that the U.S., in coordination with our coalition partners, provide without undue delay – the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment, and training necessary to more effectively partner with the U.S. and other international partners to defeat ISIS. A provision to improve the Clay Hunt SAV Act pilot program by requiring outreach of the VA’s community-based veteran peer support network to our wounded, ill, and injured service members, as well as all service members within 180 days of leaving service. This provision will ensure the VA will be proactive, instead of reactive, with its outreach to those who have sacrificed for our nation on this important mental health pilot program. A provision requiring a joint report to the Senate Armed Services Committee from the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy, a plan to jointly modernize Army and Marine Corps small arms during a 15-year period. This provision seeks to reduce duplication of efforts between the services, potentially realize cost savings in developing common small arms weapons and technology, and improve the committee’s oversight of the modernization strategies of both of the branches of service whose primary mission it is to fight and win our nation’s land conflicts. A provision, for the next five years, which provides new or current leases on Army Ammunition Plants, under the Army’s ARMS initiative, the option of extending a 25-year lease for an additional 25-year period. This provision will attract and retain greater investment, reduce facility sustainment cost, and provide a boost to some local communities - including the Des Moines County Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. A provision which extends the National Guard State Partnership Program for five years. # # #
10.02.2015	“I’m baffled why we are not focusing on program management and cost overruns. This is an epidemic and we’ve got to do something about it.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) highlighted the importance of program management to counter cost overruns and delays in construction of the Department of Navy’s Gerald R. Ford-class Aircraft Carrier, in a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “Procurement, Acquisition, Testing, and Oversight of the Navy’s Gerald R. Ford-class Aircraft Carrier Program.” Senator Ernst pressed the witnesses on whether there were consequences within the Department of the Navy to counteract the continued delays in the delivery of the Gerald R. Ford Aircraft Carrier, pointing to poor program management and a lack of accountability as major problems derailing project completion. The Iowa Senator also highlighted frustrations that the aircraft carrier is currently sitting idle in a shipyard, explaining “it doesn’t do us any good unless it’s actually out there providing us protections for the United States. And if we keep sitting on it, not moving forward in a timely manner, it doesn’t do us any good.” The Iowa Senator stressed that the $4.7 billion in cost overruns from the first two carriers underscore the importance of her previous work to overhaul federal program management through her bipartisan legislation, the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act. This legislation passed unanimously out of the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee and would streamline federal government processes by adopting the program management standards, practices and procedures of high-performing, private sector organizations. During the hearing, Ernst declared, “I’m baffled why we are not focusing on program management and cost overruns. This is an epidemic and we’ve got to do something about it.” Click here or on the image below to watch. Witnesses on the panel included Honorable Katrina G. McFarland, Assistant Secretary Of Defense (Acquisition) Department Of Defense; Honorable Sean J. Stackley, Assistant Secretary, Research, Development & Acquisition Department Of The Navy; Rear Admiral Donald E. Gaddis, USN, Program Executive Officer, Tactical Aircraft Department Of The Navy; Rear Admiral Thomas J. Moore, USN, Program Executive Officer, Aircraft Carriers Department Of The Navy; Rear Admiral Michael C. Manazir, USN, Director, Air Warfare (OPNAV); Honorable J. Michael Gilmore, Director Of Operational Test And Evaluation Department Of Defense; Mr. Paul L. Francis, Managing Director Of Acquisition And Sourcing Management U.S. Government Accountability Office. TRANSCRIPT SEN. ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair. Secretary McFarland, gentlemen, thanks for being with us today. Secretary Stackley, test, fix, test, fix – how long are we going to continue to do that? SEC. STACKLEY: Ma’am, when it comes to every developmental system, we are still doing test and fix on the DDG-51 Aegis Weapon System that has been in the fleet for 30 years. So there’s going to be a continual test and fix as you’re bringing in upgrades and added performance improvements on the specific systems that we’re delivering to the CVN78 we’ll be in a test and fix mode, right through operational testing, we’ll identify some further issues in operational testing and just like we do with every major weapons system that we bring to the fleet, and we’ll continue to fix those. Today, test and fix primarily, primarily is software related, software not hardware. SEN. ERNST: And where is this carrier right now? SEC STACKLEY: CVN78 is about 95 percent complete at the piers at Newport News Ship Building in Hampton Rhodes. SEN. ERNST: It’s sitting in a shipyard, correct? SEC. STACKLEY: Yes, yes ma’am. SEN. ERNST: Well, Iowa, we don’t have shipyards. The only time it matters to the folks back home for me – is when they are actually out there operating. Now, across military services – I have been told that 90 percent solution on time is better than the 100 percent solution too late. And at some point this is going to be too late. And we are rapidly approaching that. Now, you have been the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research Development and Acquisition since 2008. And that was the same year the CVN78 procurement was authorized. Have you ever received adverse action by the Navy or DOD due to the delays and the $2.4 billion in program cost growth? SEC. STACKLEY: No ma’am. SEN. ERNST: Has anybody within your chain, your structure, have they ever received adverse action for this? SEC. STACKLEY: In the chain? Yes ma’am. SEN. ERNST: And can you describe those actions to me please? SEC. STACKLEY: There was a program manager associated with the aircraft launch and recovery equipment who was relieved of his responsibilities. SEN. ERNST: And at what level was he? SEC. STACKLEY: Program manager, Captain, United States Navy. SEN. ERNST: And Secretary McFarland, also, have you received adverse action? SEC. MCFARLAND: No, ma’am. SEN. ERNST: Has anybody within your structure been reprimanded? SEC. MCFARLAND: Not to my knowledge. SEN. ERNST: Not to your knowledge. Folks, this has been – I can tell you – a lot of folks have been let go for a lot less. And you can tell, I am extremely frustrated with the cost overruns, not being on time, there’s no excuse. You can talk about all the gee-whiz gadgets that you want. That’s fantastic. But I will tell you that this is affecting all of the other services as well. I still serve in the National Guard, you know, I’m a ground pounder. Great. Good for me. We’re losing in the National Guard with this new NDAA. 8,200 National Guard soldiers, we’re being cut 1,100 dual status technicians. We’re losing 800 active Guard and Reserve members. We’re being cut forces. And at some point this is going to hit the Navy too, if we keep spending money on gee-whiz gadgets that are sitting in a shipyard, someday you may not have the sailors to get that thing out of port. It’s affecting everyone and our taxpayers are going to hold everyone accountable for this – everyone. I am really upset because I have been working very hard early hours, early months of my work here in the Senate, in this Committee, and on Homeland Security, trying to restore the program management process. And I had a bill passed unanimously out of HSGAC on the program management and I tried to get something into the NDAA specifically for the Department of Defense, but unfortunately it didn’t survive the Conference. And I’m baffled. I’m baffled why we are not focusing on program management and cost overruns. This is an epidemic and we’ve got to do something about it. I’m sorry I’m on a soapbox, but you can tell that I’m upset, the folks back home are upset, and it doesn’t do us any good unless it’s actually out there providing protections for the United States. And if we keep sitting on it, not moving forward, in a timely manner, it doesn’t do us any good. So, I’d like to hear a response. Just, when are we going to get this done? Anybody, anybody please. SEC. STACKLEY: Let me just specifically address CVN78 in terms of when she will deliver to the Navy. Now CVN78 at one point in time was going to be a 2006 procurement, it was delayed to 2007, delayed to 2008 for budget purposes. As was described earlier, she tied to being, to maintain 11 carrier Navy. Today we’re at 10 carriers. Requirement is for 11. Since the ship was put under construction, there was a 4-month delay to launching the ship and that was associated with getting completion levels to a higher level to ensure that we could control the cost going forward on the program. Since that time, there’s a 6 to 8 week delay that we announced a couple of weeks ago which is tagged to ensuring we maintain the discipline and cost in executing the balance of the test program. We have not moved the delivery date, we have changed the trials date so today we are still targeting an April – could go into May – delivery date for CVN78, all of that lines up to get the ship on its scheduled deployment in 2019. SEN. ERNST: I appreciate the response. I hope everybody understands my frustration as well as the other members on the Committee. This has got to be corrected. And somebody needs to be held accountable. MR. FRANCIS: Senator Ernst, may I make a comment? SEN. ERNST: Absolutely. MR. FRANCIS: I think your concerns about the budget are well founded and how those bills are going to be paid, I think if you look at the CBO’s analysis of the Navy shipbuilding plan, if it’s executed as it’s currently planned, the Navy will need a 30 percent bigger budget than it has historically got. So that’s on the Navy’s side. On the Air Force side, we have the tanker, we have the JSF, and the Long Range Strike Bomberis coming. And at the same time the Army is shrinking. So those bills are going to have to be paid somewhere. And then if they’re higher than even we think now, we’re going to be in real trouble. And on the program managers, I remember we were at a hearing a few months ago and you had asked me a question about that. One thing I wanted to bring up that I didn’t then was that we put program managers in terrible positions. So when we create business cases where a program is underestimated, and there isn’t enough schedule to get enough things done, and technology is immature, we put a program manager in that position, and they have to do two things they have to manage the program and impart discipline, at the same time, they have to defend the program. So, what we do with our program managers is not what industry does and we grind really good people up. It’s a wonder they take the jobs. SEN. ERNST: Exactly. Thank you so much. ADMIRAL MANAZIR: Sen. Ernst may I make an operational comment? SEN. ERNST: Yes, absolutely Admiral. ADMIRAL MANAZIR: Captain John Meyer and his crew have moved aboard Ford. They are in the galley aboard Ford, they are operating almost 50 percent of systems and the crew is extraordinarily happy with the ship at this point. Secretary Stackley has already outlined the retirement of risk and the timeline we have to do that, but the warfighter does need this ship – we’re pleased with the fact that the crew likes the capability that we’re delivering there and the statement referred to that capability. Yes Ma’am, absolutely – it costs more and it’s taking longer, but we will have that ship delivered at that higher capability by the time it deploys. And I’d just like to note for the record that the crew is very happy with the technology that we’re delivering to the warfighter. SEN. ERNST: And thank you Admiral, and I will make a closing comment. I have gone way over my time. I will tell you $2.4 billion is a lot of up-armor that could help the guys on the ground as well. We could have saved a lot of arms, a lot of legs, a lot of lives – if we had that money allocated in the budget as well. Thank you. # # #
10.01.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in support of starting debate on the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act: “This vital legislation for our men and women who have served and continue to serve outlines key policy objectives and funding goals of great importance to our national security; fulfills the commitments to our servicemembers and their families; and ensures our military has the facilities necessary to defend our nation. “Working to address some of the rampant problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs, this bill improves veterans’ access to health care services, including homeless assistance, caregiver services, and expanding the current treatments offered. “In addition, this bill provides much needed funding to advance our missile defense systems; supports National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve construction needs; improves military family housing, medical, and Department of Defense educational facilities; as well as funds the NATO Security Investment Program infrastructure to respond to international threats and challenges. “At a time when our nation faces ever increasing and complex global challenges, this bill helps keep our most dangerous adversaries detained at Guantanamo Bay by restricting the Obama Administration from building or outfitting facilities for relocation to the United States. “I am therefore deeply disappointed to see my Democratic colleagues play partisan games with our national defense, rather than supporting our active duty troops, veterans and their families. Once again, Senate Democrats are backtracking from their previous support for this bill that passed out of committee with strong bipartisan support. “I remain committed to securing funding for what is one of the most important appropriations bills we consider, especially in the face of such great global threats and challenges.” # # #
09.30.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today issued the following statement over the Russian airstrikes in Syria: “Considering the Obama Administration believed expanded Russian involvement in Syria was an asset—even with their longstanding support for Assad—it’s not surprising that under this Administration we only have four or five Syrian opposition members who are actually working with us. The Administration has lost much of its credibility in the eyes of the very people the U.S. wants to protect following naive comments in support of Russian involvement in Syria; whistleblower reports from the intelligence community of politicization of the effectiveness of U.S. efforts in Iraq and Syria; and many of our most effective coalition partners not receiving the weapons and equipment they need to fight. “Furthermore, the damage done from the Administration’s apparent support of the growing Russian-Assad-Iran effort against the Syrian people will soon be realized as Russia increases its combat operations. Not only will Russia’s involvement have disastrous consequences for the Syrian people, but to our efforts to defeat ISIS, hold Assad accountable for the war crimes he has committed, and to end one of the greatest refugee crises in history.” # # #
09.30.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting in favor of a short-term continuing resolution (CR) through December 11, 2015: “Like many Iowans, I’m tired of Washington’s dangerous and shortsighted habit of governing from one emergency to the next. The American people deserve better which is why Congress passed a budget that balances, for the first time in over a decade. Congress must work together in an open and collaborative dialogue to find the best path forward in order to ensure the government runs efficiently and effectively. “Prior to this vote, I supported a CR that would have placed a moratorium on Planned Parenthood funding for one year as congressional investigations seek answers over whether the organization is profiting from the selling of baby body parts. It would have protected women’s health funding by redirecting those funds from Planned Parenthood to community health centers and other eligible entities. Although that measure did not pass, I remain committed to exposing Planned Parenthood’s blatant disregard for human life and seeking answers to the many questions raised by the recent videos. “In the meantime, we must pass this short-term spending bill and then turn our focus to a sustainable plan forward that builds a path toward fiscal solvency for our nation and preserves our national security to keep all Americans safe and protected.” # # #

09.30.2015	http://1.usa.gov/1QL6Im0 WASHINGTON, D.C. — Recent news reports from the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Guardian, and the Daily Beast suggest that military intelligence reporting was manipulated to reflect the President’s narrative that the U.S. is winning the war against terrorists in Iraq and Syria, specifically the Islamic State (ISIS) and al Nusra. According to these reports, the Director of National Intelligence maintained frequent contact outside an official chain of command with the Intelligence Directorate leadership of the U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM). This influenced CENTCOM’s Intelligence Directorate leadership to regularly ignore or inappropriately alter intelligence assessments that were not positive enough about U.S. military success in the region. This created a culture of suppressing dissent within the CENTCOM Intelligence Directorate that kept analysts from giving candid assessments. Such was the culture of suppression that some who complained purportedly were urged to retire, and did. In July, finding no reprieve from complaints made to CENTCOM leadership, two senior intelligence analysts at the organization filed a formal complaint with the Inspector General of the Department of Defense, with 50 other analysts supporting the complaint. As a result, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee opened a review of the administration’s alleged actions in this matter. On Friday, Senators Ron Johnson and Joni Ernst, chairman and member of the committee respectively, sent letters to those purportedly involved in altering the intelligence assessments, including James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, and Jon Rymer, the Department of Defense Inspector General. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is the primary investigative committee of the Senate, including on national security matters, and routinely works with whistleblowers to investigate misconduct in the federal government. Anyone with knowledge of waste, fraud, abuse or mismanagement in the federal government is encouraged to contact Chairman Johnson’s staff directly at whistleblower@ronjohnson.senate.gov. Statement from Ron Johnson, Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee: “The allegations of the politicization of intelligence at the Department of Defense’s Central Command are highly concerning. The job of intelligence analysts is to produce objective, fact-based assessments, which then serve as an essential basis for informed national security and foreign policy decisions. The possibility that the administration is pressuring intelligence analysts to conform those assessments to the president’s narrative — that we are winning the war against ISIS, when we are not — is unacceptable. Doctoring and denying reality has no place in national and military intelligence, which require objectivity and candor. Strong leaders appreciate and cultivate dissenting views. Therefore, I have opened a review of these allegations to ensure that our nation’s intelligence analysts are able to continue to produce unbiased, fact-based assessments free from political pressure.” Statement from Joni Ernst, member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee: “It is clear that there are discrepancies between the Obama Administration’s assessment of the war against ISIS, and the realities on the ground. Now is the time for a thorough review of whistleblower reports from our intelligence community. This government owes it to the American people, especially our servicemembers who are putting their lives on the line for our nation, to get an accurate picture of the threats to our national security and to our allies around the world.” Related content here. # # #
09.29.2015	http://1.usa.gov/1WvnPMw WASHINGTON, D.C. – Chairman Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) of the Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee wrote Monday to the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary, Sylvia Burwell, insisting on answers to the department’s enforcement and oversight policies and procedures governing the research, transfer and sale of human fetal tissue. This letter is in response to a previous request made by the committees to HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim Esquea, to which they received inadequate responses. The senators wrote, On August 14, 2015, HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim Esquea sent nearly identical letters in response to separate inquiries from Chairmen Johnson and Grassley[1] and Senators Ernst and Blunt[2] regarding the fetal tissue harvesting practices of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (Planned Parenthood), an HHS grant recipient. Mr. Esquea’s response letter not only inadequately responds to the questions raised in our inquiries, but it also raises additional concerns about the adequacy of the Department’s oversight of HHS grant recipients that engage in activities involving fetal tissue. Chairman Johnson said, "It is our duty to protect life, including our most vulnerable. Shocking videos have revealed that Planned Parenthood, as an organization, is vested in the barbaric practice of harvesting human organs for revenue. All Americans, regardless of their views on abortion, should be repulsed by the callous and cavalier attitude of Planned Parenthood representatives as they discuss their harvesting "techniques,” as well as the revenue they require for the organs of unborn babies. Our committees will continue to demand answers about what Planned Parenthood has done with taxpayer funds.” Chairman Grassley said, “The department’s insufficient response does not help Congress with its constitutional duty of oversight. The committees need information to adequately assess if the department has ever undertaken any independent efforts to ensure that the laws are being followed, rather than just relying on the word of the entities involved.” Senator Ernst said, “Over the last several months, numerous videos have showcased Planned Parenthood’s blatant disregard for human life and raised a number of moral, legal, and policy questions. My colleagues and I are demanding answers, and our questions to HHS simply cannot be ignored. Form letters that side-step our questions are not acceptable. I will continue to urge HHS to comply with all current and future investigations into this matter, and remain steadfast in my commitment to protect the most vulnerable.” Full text of the letter available here and below. September 28, 2015 The Honorable Sylvia Matthews Burwell Secretary U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 200 Independence Avenue SW Washington, DC 20201 Dear Secretary Burwell: We write to reiterate our request for information and documents from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) relating to HHS enforcement and oversight policies and procedures governing the research, transfer, and sale of human fetal tissue. On August 14, 2015, HHS Assistant Secretary for Legislation Jim Esquea sent nearly identical letters in response to separate inquiries from Chairmen Johnson and Grassley[1] and Senators Ernst and Blunt[2] regarding the fetal tissue harvesting practices of Planned Parenthood Federation of America (Planned Parenthood), an HHS grant recipient. Mr. Esquea’s response letter not only inadequately responds to the questions raised in our inquiries, but it also raises additional concerns about the adequacy of the Department’s oversight of HHS grant recipients that engage in activities involving fetal tissue. According to Mr. Esquea, when HHS funding recipients submit applications or accept grant awards, a representative from the organization receiving federal funds “certifies that researchers using these samples are in compliance with applicable legal requirements….”[3] By accepting the award of federal funds, the recipients “agree that they will follow all applicable legal requirements and the applicable agency’s grants policy statement, and must be able to demonstrate their compliance with applicable legal requirements.” [4] Mr. Esquea’s letter further notes that HHS requires grant recipients to certify “no less than annually that they are in compliance with applicable legal requirements.”[5] The response we received from Mr. Esquea leads us to question whether, and to what extent, HHS actually verifies the accuracy of certifications submitted by private organizations entrusted with federal taxpayers’ dollars. According to Mr. Esquea, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) “confirmed that third-party institutions receiving NIH funding for research involving fetal tissue samples have confirmed that their activities are in accordance with applicable legal requirements.” He adds: [HHS] know[s] of no violation of [laws governing human fetal tissue] in connection with the research done at our agencies. Furthermore, as noted above, we have confirmed that HHS researchers working with fetal tissue obtained the tissue from non-profit organizations that provided assurances to us that they are in compliance with all applicable legal requirements.[6] If HHS makes no effort to independently audit or otherwise verify such assertions by federal grantees, then we can certainly understand why the Department might lack actual knowledge of violations of applicable laws and regulations. In this event, however, we would seriously question the grounds for concluding that no violations have occurred, absent any effort by the Department to check the accuracy of certification documents submitted to HHS by third parties. In light of outstanding questions concerning the enforcement of federal laws governing fetal tissue, we ask that you please provide itemized responses to the letter dated August 7, 2015 from Chairmen Johnson and Grassley as well as responses to the following: When an HHS grant recipient certifies to its compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to fetal tissue, does HHS conduct any additional oversight or investigation to ensure that such certification is accurate? Please explain (and discuss whether the Department’s oversight practices and policies relating to other forms of research differ from its practices and policies relating to fetal tissue research). Under 42 U.S.C. § 289g-1(b)(2), in connection with any research HHS funds or conducts on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes, the physician who performs the abortion from which the fetal tissue was acquired is required to make a signed, written statement declaring, among other things, that consent for the abortion was acquired prior to requesting or obtaining consent for the donation of the fetal tissue, that no alteration of the timing, method, or procedures used to terminate the pregnancy was made solely for obtaining the tissue, and that the abortion was performed in accordance with applicable State law. Under subsection (c), the individual with primary responsibility for conducting such research also must make a signed, written statement to declare a number of things. Moreover, under subsection (d), agency heads or other entities conducting fetal tissue research must make these required certification documents available for audit by the HHS Secretary. Has an HHS Secretary ever exercised his or her authority under this 1993 statute to conduct audits? If not, please explain. If yes How many audits of agency heads or entities conducting fetal tissue research have been conducted to date? (In responding please list number of audits conducted in each year from 1993 to the present, and detail the target as well as scope of each such audit.) Did any such audit(s) disclose that a violation of applicable laws and regulations had occurred, contrary to the recipient’s certification? Please explain. Did any such audit(s) disclose material omissions or deficiencies in certification statements, repeat violations of 42 U.S.C. § 289g–1 (or regulations promulgated under that statute), or violations of other statutes or regulations? If so, please describe all such omissions, deficiencies, and violations, as well as any punitive or remedial measures taken by the Secretary in response. Please provide all analyses, reports, and reviews of Planned Parenthood’s annual certification to HHS that it is in compliance with applicable legal and grant requirements for each year since 2010. Your August 14, 2015 letter states that HHS has not funded or conducted research on the transplantation of human fetal tissue for therapeutic purposes “in recent years.” When did HHS last fund or conduct such research, which is subject to the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 289g-1? Please list and describe all such research projects from the last year in which HHS did fund or conduct this type of research. Please provide this material as soon as possible but no later than one week from today. The Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs is authorized by Rule XXV of the Standing Rules of the Senate to investigate “the efficiency, economy, and effectiveness of all agencies and departments of the Government.”[7] Additionally, S. Res. 73 (114th Congress) authorizes the Committee to examine “the efficiency and economy of all branches and functions of Government with particular references to the operations and management of Federal regulatory policies and programs.”[8] The Judiciary Committee’s jurisdiction includes “judicial proceedings, civil and criminal, generally,” as well as “[r]evision and codification of the statutes of the United States.[9] For purposes of this request, please refer to the instructions and definitions contained in the enclosure.

09.29.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “United States Cybersecurity Policy and Threats,” pressed witnesses on the effectiveness of the U.S. government’s counter-ISIS efforts in cyberspace, highlighting the need for improvements in counteracting ISIS propaganda and recruitment through the Internet and social media platforms. Senator Ernst also voiced concerns over Russia’s emergence as a leader in the Middle East. The Iowa Senator raised particular questions about the implications of Iraq’s information sharing with Russia, Iran and Syria, as well as the potential consequences related to U.S. operations in Iraq. Witnesses on the panel included Mr. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence; Mr. Robert O. Work, Deputy Secretary of Defense; and Admiral Michael S. Rogers, Commander of the U.S. Cyber Command, Director of the National Security Agency and Chief of Central Security Services. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SEN. ERNST: Thank you gentlemen for joining us today. Admiral Rogers, I’ll start with you, sir. Two of the President’s nine lines of effort in defeating ISIL are first exposing ISIS’s true nature and second, disrupting the foreign fighter flow. And over the weekend the New York Times reported that 30,000 recruits joined ISIS over the past year and that’s double the previous recruitment year. Earlier this month in reference to ISIS recruiting, the State Department’s Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Counterterrorism said that ISIS’s recruiting trend is still upward and this information came as no surprise to her. The Ambassador also said the upward trend was primarily due to Internet and social media. So, sir, do you believe the Administration’s efforts have so far succeeded on these two lines of effort in cyberspace or social media? Just please: simple yes or no. ADMIRAL ROGERS: No. SEN. ERNST: Okay, in light of that, with the record recruiting numbers for ISIS, how would you then assess the effectiveness of the US government’s counter ISIS effort in cyberspace? So what specifically is your assessment of the State Department’s “Think Again, Turn Away” program in support of efforts to disrupt ISIS online recruiting effort? ADMIRAL ROGERS: Senator I’m not in a position to comment on State Department, the specifics of their program, I, honestly, am just not knowledgeable about it. I will say this broadly to get to, I think, your broader point. I have always believed that we must contest ISIL in the information domain every bit as aggressively as we are contesting them on the battlefield. That the information dynamic is an essential component of their vision, their strategy, and ultimately their success. And we have got to be willing to attempt to fight them in that domain just like we are on the battlefield. And we clearly are not there yet. SEN. ERNST: I agree. I think we are failing in this effort and some of the programs that we have seen obviously are not working. So, are there areas in which you could recommend how the US government better partner with various NGOs or private entities to more effectively counter the ISIS propaganda? ADMIRAL ROGERS: Again, the contesting the propaganda piece, much broader than Cyber Command’s mission. I will say from a technical and operational perspective, we, broadly within the DOD, the Cyber Command, Strategic Command, and Centcom are looking at within our authorities within our capabilities, what’s in the realm of the possible in terms of what can we do to help contest them in this domain. SEN. ERNST: Okay, we have a larger problem coming forward too, in regards to ISIS and ISIL in the Middle East. We seem to see the emergence of a trifecta between Syria, Iran, and Russia. And now it seems that Iraq has begun information sharing with Russia, with Iran, with Syria. Director Clapper, can you speak to that and the broader implications of Russia emerging as a leader in the Middle East while we seem to be frittering away our opportunity with ISIL? MR. CLAPPER: Well that’s certainly their objective. I think they have several objectives here. One of which that I think protect their base, their presence in Syria, ergo their build up in the Northwest part of Syria. Clearly, they want to prop up Assad and, I think, a belated motivation for them is fighting ISIL. As far as the joint intelligence arrangement is concerned, I can’t go into detail here in this forum, but I will say they are, each of the parties entering in to this are a little bit suspicious of just what is entailed here. So we’ll just have to see how robust a capability that actually provides. SEN. ERNST: Okay, I appreciate that. And Secretary Work, do you have any thoughts on the emergence of Russia with the intelligence sharing, how that might impact the operations we have ongoing in Iraq against ISIS? MR. WORK: I think we were caught by surprise that Iraq entered in to this agreement with Syria and Iran and Russia. Obviously we are not going to share intelligence with either Syria or Russia or Iran. So we are in the process of working to try to find out exactly what Iraq has said. Certainly we are not going to provide any classified information or information that would help those actors on the battlefield. Really what we’re trying to do is de-conflict and that is the primary purpose of the discussion between President Obama and President Putin yesterday is if you are going to act on this battlefield, we have to de-conflict. The other thing we have made clear is they would like to do a military first followed by a political transition, we believe those two things have to go in parallel and that has been our consistent message. This is early days, we are still in the midst of discussing what exactly this means so I do not have any definitive answers for you at this point, Senator. SEN. ERNST: Well, I am very concerned that we have abdicated our role in the Middle East as, and in so many other areas as has been pointed out earlier. Grave concern to all of us and I think we need to be working much more diligently on this. Thank you, Mr. Chair. # # #
09.29.2015	Senators’ Letter Questions OSHA Use of Guidance Document Instead of Public Rule-Making Process WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Lamar Alexander (R-TN), Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Steve Daines (R-MT) today sent a letter to Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez to challenge the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) recent use of an expedited regulatory guidance process rather than a more transparent and deliberative regulatory rule-making process that allows input from the American people. The letter comes less than a week after the Senators participated in a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management hearing on Wednesday, September 23 on whether federal agencies have used regulatory guidance appropriately. The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) allows agencies to produce guidance documents to clarify issues in an existing regulation without publication in the Federal Register and without the public notice and comment process. However, the hearing revealed that some agencies improperly issue guidance documents instead of regulations, in order to avoid public input and take advantage of the APA’s exceptions and relaxed procedures. A GAO report from earlier this year confirmed that legal scholars and federal courts grapple with these guidance determinations on a regular basis. During the hearing, the Senators were particularly concerned that the use of guidance lacked public input and resulted in a more expansive, effectively binding, and burdensome requirement for the private sector. OSHA is an agency of the Department of Labor. Lankford is Chairman of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management and Alexander is Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. A PDF of the letter is available here, and the full text is below: September 29, 2015 The Honorable Thomas E. Perez Secretary, Department of Labor 200 Constitution Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20210 Dear Secretary Perez: We write today to express concern about the process used to develop three guidance documents recently issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA): “Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and Covered Concentrations of Listed Appendix A Chemicals” (chemical concentration guidance) issued June 5, 2015; “Process Safety Management of Highly Hazardous Chemicals and Application of the Retail Exemption (29 CFR 1910.119(a)(2)(1))” (retail exemption guidance) issued July 22, 2015; and “RAGAGEP in Safety Process Management Enforcement” (RAGAGEP guidance) issued June 5, 2015. These three guidance documents are expected to dramatically expand the universe of regulated parties, create extreme logistical and financial burdens on regulated parties, and convert flexible recommended practices into mandatory requirements—all without the opportunity for public comment. We therefore ask that OSHA immediately withdraw these memoranda. In the case that OSHA decides to pursue these policies further, we ask that it only does so through the rulemaking process. These guidance documents took effect immediately when they were issued; therefore, parties not previously subject to certain requirements were deprived of notice that they were about to fall subject to OSHA enforcement. For example, OSHA’s chemical concentration guidance substantially expanded the universe of chemical manufacturers and distributions subject to the process safety management standard. Likewise, under the retail exemption, an estimated 4,800 previously exempted facilities will be subject to the revised process safety standard. The guidance pertaining to recognized and generally accepted good engineering practices (RAGAGEP) is especially troublesome because it converts recommended “generally accepted” practices that engender flexibility among individual refiners to mandatory practices. This closely resembles a legislative rule that requires notice and comment by law. Whether or not the RAGAGEP guidance is properly designated as such, we ask OSHA to err on the side of good governance and withdraw the memorandum. The manner in which OSHA issued the guidance documents also deprived regulated parties of the ability to comment on compliance costs and the overall regulatory burden the guidance documents would impose. For example, the Agricultural Retailers Association believes that OSHA’s compliance cost estimates stemming from the revised retail exemption are grossly underestimated. In particular, their members estimate the actual cost for compliance with the revised standard would approach $27,500 per facility—ten times OSHA’s estimate of $2,160 per facility. Similarly, one company overseeing facilities now required to follow the revised RAGAGEP guidance estimates that compliance with just one standard would cost $10 million per refinery; another company estimates that the initial cost of compliance would total $172 million, with additional annual compliance costs exceeding $18.5 million. Regulated parties subject to the revised chemical concentration guidance also expect their compliance costs to skyrocket. These estimates suggest that, because each of these guidance documents could have an estimated economic effect of over $100 million, OSHA should, at a minimum, have deemed them significant. If it had done so, at least the guidance documents would have been subject to the regulatory review policies and procedures articulated in the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices. However, it appears these guidance documents escaped OMB review as well. We can agree that a commitment to workplace safety is a high priority, but we are troubled by the process in which OSHA has altered its longstanding interpretations in favor of more expansive, binding, and burdensome guidance documents without inviting public comment. We therefore ask that OSHA withdraw these memoranda, and pursue these policies only through the rulemaking process. Sincerely, Senator James Lankford Chairman, Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management, U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Senator Lamar Alexander Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Senator Joni Ernst Senator Steve Daines # # #
09.24.2015	Letter Comes in Advance of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Visit to Washington, D.C. WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of 41 additional Senators led by Senators John Thune (R-SD) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), both members of the Senate Finance Committee and Senate Agriculture Committee, of which Stabenow serves as ranking member, in sending a letter to President Obama urging him to raise directly with Chinese President Xi Jinping the concerns of U.S. stakeholders regarding agricultural biotech approval delays by China. This week, President Xi will travel to Washington, D.C., for his first official state visit with President Obama. Today, the U.S. will host China in the inaugural U.S.-China Strategic Agricultural Innovation Dialogue (SAID), during which it’s expected agricultural biotech issues will be discussed. “To reinvigorate last year’s progress, we ask that you seek a commitment from President Xi to move forward with the queue of biotechnology products, including those awaiting final import approvals,” the Senators wrote. “In addition, we ask that you reengage President Xi on the value of elevating the agricultural innovation dialogue via the SAID so that our countries can continue to address mutual food security, environmental and rural economic policy challenges.” Stakeholder groups from across the country, including Farm Bureaus, Corn Growers Associations, and Soybean Associations, among others, wrote President Obama separately earlier this month about the need for “continued engagement … on agricultural innovation and trade.” Their letter can be found here. Joining Thune and Stabenow on the letter were U.S. Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Thomas Carper (D-Del.), Robert Casey (D-Pa.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), Christopher Coons (R-Del.), John Cornyn (R-Texas), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Michael Enzi (R-Wyo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Pat Roberts (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), David Vitter (R-La.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.). Full text of the letter can be found below: The Honorable Barack Obama President of the United States The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We appreciate your administration’s recent initiative to focus on the U.S.-China dialogue regarding agriculture, and we request that you prioritize biotech approvals with President Xi Jinping during his official visit this month. Developing good public policy that promotes innovation and trade will better position our nations to meet critical food security, environmental and rural economic policy objectives. Last year in Beijing, the U.S. and China established a foundation on which to build a robust, long-term exchange of ideas related to agricultural innovation, including the use of biotechnology in food crops. We were pleased with the creation of the Strategic Agricultural Innovation Dialogue (SAID), which we believe can be an excellent forum for the U.S. and China to advance common agricultural objectives by ensuring an ongoing commitment to transparency, open communication, and science-based regulatory decision-making. While we applaud the creation of the SAID and appreciate China’s efforts in 2014 to approve three delayed biotechnology-derived crops, we are concerned that forward momentum has not continued. It is our understanding that there is a growing queue of biotechnology-derived crops under review within China’s Ministry of Agriculture, creating additional regulatory uncertainty, and undermining commitments made last year to bolster science-based agricultural innovation and trade. To reinvigorate last year’s progress, we ask that you seek a commitment from President Xi to move forward with the queue of biotechnology products, including those awaiting final import approvals. In addition, we ask that you reengage President Xi on the value of elevating the agricultural innovation dialogue via the SAID so that our countries can continue to address mutual food security, environmental and rural economic policy challenges. Sincerely, # # #
09.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after Pope Francis made history as the first Pope to ever address a Joint Meeting of Congress: “Pope Francis’s visit reminds all of us that we each play a role in showing compassion for and improving the lives of those in need. As a person of faith, I appreciate the goal of identifying those struggling, and working to find ways to lift them up. “While we may not always agree on the right approach, I truly believe that we can all work together—across party lines and across faiths—to ensure the challenges we face are met head on. “Our great nation serves as a shining beacon of hope and a symbol of opportunity. We must continue working together to seek peace and stability here and around the globe.” # # #
09.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – More than three months after a report was released from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) following Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) request for an investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health care programs and treatment provided to veteran Richard Miles, it remains unclear as to whether any of the recommended changes have been implemented. After the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) neglected to reply to an initial closed letter from Senator Ernst, she has now sent a follow up letter demanding answers about the needed changes for veterans across Iowa. In the follow up letter, Senator Ernst wrote, “On June 24, 2015, I wrote a letter to you requesting that VHA expedite implementation of a number of VA OIG recommendations to improve the delivery of mental health care and case management services for our veterans. Specifically, as recommended by VA OIG in Report Number 15-02627-386, I requested VHA expedite a determination of the feasibility of expanding recovery coordination activities to patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to improve case management services at VA and to hold Veterans Integrated Service Network Directors accountable for providing all levels of case management in accordance with VHA policy.” Senator Ernst continued, “According to the October 1, 2014 – March 31, 2015 VA OIG Semiannual Report to Congress (SAR), there are a total of 1,162 unimplemented Office of Inspector General (OIG) recommendations which have been provided to the VA. Disturbingly, more than 1,000 of these unimplemented OIG recommendations are with VHA. This is unacceptable.” “…I remain concerned about the efforts VA has put forth to address the mental health of the men and women who so honorably served our country,” the Senator added. “…I once again urge you to act without delay on the VA OIG’s recommendations to improve services at VHA for our veterans.” Read the full letter here. Senator Ernst’s request comes in response to the untimely death of veteran Richard Miles from Des Moines, which prompted the Iowa Senator to call for an investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health care programs and the treatment sought and received by Mr. Miles. The VA OIG identified areas that need to be improved and those recommend changes must be implemented without further delay. Timeline of Efforts to Improve Mental Health Care for Iowa Veterans On February 23, 2015, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the VA OIG requesting an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. The inquiry follows recent news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. On March 4, 2015, the VA OIG provided an update regarding Senator Ernst’s request for an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. Senator Ernst’s inquiry followed news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. The Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles. On March 23, 2015, Senator Ernst introduced her first piece of legislation, the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. This legislation provides an option for veterans to receive immediate mental health treatment, until they can receive comprehensive treatment at the VA. It also prioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the VA. On June 3, 2015, Senator Ernst highlighted the critical need for a permanent VA Inspector General. At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Ernst expressed her disappointment that she has yet to receive an update from the Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office which said months ago that they initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles, an Army and Iraq War veteran who committed suicide in Des Moines, Iowa. On June 10, 2015, Senator Ernst released a statement after receiving the report from the office of the VA OIG. On June 24, 2015, Senator Ernst sent a letter urging the VA to “act without delay on the VA OIG’s recommendations to improve services at VHA for our veterans.” And requested a written response by no later than July 13, 2015. On July 13, 2015, Senator Ernst had still not received a response from the VA. She still has not received a response. On September 22, 2015, Following Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing where Senator Ernst stressed the urgent need for timely, quality mental health care for veterans, Ernst sent a follow up letter pressing the VA to immediately implement the “VA OIG’s recommendations to improve services at VHA for our veterans.” # # #
09.23.2015	Bipartisan Resolution Calls for Release of Women Political Prisoners Around the World WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined all 19 other women Senators led by Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) to introduce the bipartisan #FreeThe20 resolution to support the empowerment of women and urge countries to release women held unjustly. Earlier this month, US Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power launched a U.S. government-wide #FreeThe20 campaign, urging governments around the world to release female political prisoners. The Senators’ bipartisan resolution, which was introduced today, supports this effort to highlight the cases of women prisoners held unjustly around the world. “As 20 women serving in the United States Senate we stand unified in calling on governments to recognize the universal human rights of women and to release women who have been imprisoned unjustly for exercising those rights. Our message is simple – world leaders and foreign governments, including those attending the U.N.-hosted meeting this month, should empower women, not imprison them,” said the Senators. In 1995, representatives from 189 governments and thousands of organizations met in Beijing at the Fourth World Conference on Women and produced the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action in order to advance gender equality and women’s rights. Twenty years later, on September 27, the United Nations will host the “Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment: A Commitment to Action” in New York City. Yet, many of the governments attending this meeting are holding women unjustly. Last weekend, Ta Phong Tan, who was among the first Vietnamese bloggers to write and comment on political news events and whose release was called for as part of this campaign, was released. The full text of the resolution can be found here. Additional information about the #FreeThe20 campaign can be found here: http://www.humanrights.gov/freethe20/ # # #
09.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – More than three months after a report was released from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA OIG) following Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) request for an investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health care programs and treatment provided to veteran Richard Miles, it remains unclear as to whether any of the recommended changes have been implemented.

09.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – During today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “Testimony on United States Middle East Policy”, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned General David H. Petraeus, former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and former Commander of the International Security Assistance Force, U.S. Forces in Afghanistan, U.S. Central Command, and Multi-National Forces in Iraq on his opinion of current strategy in the Middle East. The Iowa Senator asked General Petraeus about strengthening the Kurdish Peshmerga forces, while noting that she would like to see more assistance going to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in consultation with the Iraqi government. Senator Ernst also voiced concerns over Turkey’s recent mobilization, requesting General Petraeus’ opinion of its impact on anti-ISIS coalition forces. Earlier this year, Senator Ernst introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to grant temporary, emergency authority for the President to provide weapons and training directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in consultation with the Iraqi government. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you Admiral McCain. General Petraeus, thank you for appearing in front of the committee today and I think you can see from the attendance at this committee today, that your opinions and your thoughts are very highly valued. So, thank you for sharing with us today, your thoughts. I would like to go back to the Kurds a little bit, I think we’ve talked a lot about it and everybody has asked questions, but maybe not in all manners. So, the Kurds have been a great ally to us and I’ve heard that from many of the men and women that have served in that region. They have been a great partner for 25 years or so, and they have a healthy respect for the rule of law. They have been very helpful with a number of minorities, ethnic minorities, religious minorities, and what can we do to better provide support for the Kurdish Regional Government, the Kurdish Peshmerga, I believe we need to double down on this effort. Regardless of whether they may push beyond their regional boundaries, but they do provide an area, whether we can engage them in shaping operations, whether it is to provide an area for us to base. Can you give us some thoughts, and the advantages of this? GENERAL PETRAEUS: I can. The fact is, as you know we have headquarters, we have operational headquarters, we have very close relationships, in both my military and Intel lives, we are very, very closely linked. I think the single biggest issues are the provision of weapons and other supplies, to streamline that. You know, I’ve said we have to support Prime Minister Abadi, we need to strengthen him that means we can’t bypass him on these issues, but we need to figure out how to get this so that, ideally, it doesn’t have to touch down in Baghdad, it can go directly to them. Some coalition members are doing that, I think actually with our tacit approval, if not applause. I think that’s the single biggest step we could take, and to look very careful at what it is were providing them, here is some additional items again, I happened to be there for a conference in Sulaymaniyah in the earlier part of this year and I had a lot of people come and plead that particular case. The other is to determine, you know, the KRG, the Kurdish Regional Government, is in very, very difficult financial times right now because of the price of oil going down by 55%, it’s not only reduced what they get, but its reduced the amount for which the 17% that they get from the central government is. So, they’re having a very difficult time, they’re supporting hundreds of thousands of refugees on their soil, anybody who goes up there and flies over this will see a camp every few kilometers, and, indeed, they’re fighting a war. Again, if we could provide additional assistance to them that would be of support, I think that would be very valuable also. We have very much enabled them. We help them hold off, had it not been for decisive action actually at a critical moment last year, it’s very possible that the Islamic State might have gotten closer to the capital of Irbil, that held that of, and I think really retaken most of the area around the Kurdish Regional Government. Candidly, there are no more disputed internal boundary areas in Iraq. They are generally controlled by the Kurdish Regional Government, as a result of operations that have taken place with our support. SEN. ERNST: Very good, and I appreciate those thoughts very much. I would tend to agree, I would love to see more assistance going to the KRG. Of course, in consultation with the Iraqi government, I applaud you on that as well. If we could turn to Turkey, just very briefly. We’ve talked a little bit about the fact that they have mobilized and unfortunately, what we have seen is that through their mobilization of resources, whether it’s political, military, instead of really pushing back against ISIS, we see there’s been a turn to mobilize against PKK, and what do you see the impact is to those coalition forces, the anti-ISIS coalition forces, and what are the greater implications of that and thoughts maybe from some of those coalition members? GENERAL PETRAEUS: I don’t know that this has a huge effect on U.S. or coalition forces, they’re not being diverted to assist. There’s a certain slight degree of support that we provided in the past in the intelligence realm that I don’t imagine has changed a great deal. What I think is very significant is what is happening within Turkey as a result of this, the sheer escalation of the violence, a situation that was relatively calm seemed to be heading toward one in which there was greater reconciliation between in the government in Ankara and the sizable part of their population in Turkey that is Kurdish with the allowance of meeting certain desires of that Kurdish population and all of a sudden the wheels have come off the bus and whether this is connected with the future election in Turkey or something else, it is very distressing to see because again the violence on both sides now has escalated very, very rapidly and quite considerably. SEN. ERNST: Great, thank you, my time has expired. Thank you General, thank you Admiral. # # #
09.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) stressed the urgent need to address rampant problems at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) during a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing entitled, “Improving VA Accountability: Examining First-Hand Accounts of Department of Veterans Affairs Whistleblowers.” The Iowa Senator asked about viable alternatives for veterans who do not feel they are receiving timely or adequate mental health care at their local VA, and questioned witnesses on whether they believed the VA takes seriously ideas for reform, implementation of Inspector General (IG) recommendations, or recommendations from staff to improve services for veterans. During the hearing, Ernst emphasized: “This is an issue I am extremely passionate about and I think today’s hearing is just reemphasizing to me that we have a corrupt and broken VA system. And when I hear that supervisors, other workers, are more concerned about their own jobs than they are about the veterans – we have an issue. We have an issue, folks, that needs to be fixed and I don’t know how many hearings we’re gonna have until we get to actually addressing the situation. I hear a lot of talk but we need to figure this out.” While talking with the whistleblowers, Ernst also stressed the need to hold the VA’s feet to the fire. Earlier this year, Senator Ernst introduced the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. This legislation provides an option for veterans to receive immediate mental health treatment, until they can receive comprehensive treatment at the VA. It also prioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the VA. Click here or on the image below to watch. Witnesses on the first panel included Mr. Sean Kirkpatrick of Chicago, IL; Dr. Brandon Coleman, an addiction therapist from the Phoenix VA Health Care System; Mr. Joseph Colon; a credentialing program support from the VA Caribbean Health Care System; and Mr. Shea Wilkes, a licensed clinical social worker from the Overton Brooks VA Medical Center. The second panel’s witnesses included Ms. Carolyn Lerner, Special Counsel from the Office of Special Counsel; Ms. Linda Halliday, Deputy Inspector General from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; and Dr. Carolyn Clancy, Chief Medical Officer of the Veterans Health Administration within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. TRANSCRIPT: SEN. ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair. Thank you gentlemen so much for being here today. I will state again and I’ve said this many times in the short eight, nine months that I have been here that this is one of my priorities, is working with veterans and mental health issues, and the first bill I proposed was working with veterans that have mental health and allowing them greater access. And so, I do want to thank you, my condolences on the loss of your, on your brother, Shawn. Very, very sad. MR. KIRKPATRICK: Thank you. SEN. ERNST: This is an issue I am extremely passionate about and I think today’s hearing just is reemphasizing to me that we have a corrupt and broken VA system. And when I hear that supervisors, other workers, are more concerned about their own jobs than they are about the veterans – we have an issue. We have an issue, folks, that needs to be fixed and I don’t know how many hearings we’re gonna have until we get to actually addressing the situation. I hear a lot of talk but we need to figure this out. So again, I’m very passionate about this issue and thank you for coming forward, for being brave and doing the right thing. When it comes to accessing your health records, I just want to state, just for everybody, it doesn’t matter what the reason is. They shouldn’t be accessing your health records. That would be like saying it’s okay for us to access anyone here in the audience, their health records. That’s wrong. It should never ever occur. Never without your authorization. So I just want to emphasize that, it doesn’t matter why. Mr. Coleman, do you believe there are many alternatives for veterans who feel they are not receiving timely or adequate mental health care at their local VA? MR. COLEMAN: Thank you for asking me the question, Senator. I don’t know if you read the article by Dave Phillips, front page New York Times on Sunday. It was about the plight of second Battalion 7th Marines who have lost, I believe, it’s 13 members to suicide right after their deployments from Iraq and Afghanistan. The picture I have in front of me is me and my two Marine Corps sons. Not only am I a former Marine, but I make Marines. But the one on the right is with Two Seven currently. In that article they talk about how many of these veterans came to the VA for health care and were turned away. In one instance, they had a 22 year old female, social worker or whatever that told him that the loss of his buddies was like breaking up with a girlfriend and he just had to get over it. Well we don’t just get over it and that’s not right. And that’s why I think that these guys and girls, when they come home from years of war, should have the right to go wherever they feel comfortable. We owe it to them to send them anywhere they feel comfortable; if it’s a counselor in another town that they want to go to and they’re gonna open up and talk, then we should allow them to do that because once they’ve committed suicide it’s too late. There are no second chances. SEN. ERNST: That’s right. And you do believe that opening up for greater access, whether it’s at the VA or whether it’s through a community clinic, peer to peer supports, those are ways to address it. MR. COLEMAN: Any of those ma’am. And the reason I believe that is I don’t agree with the number of 22 per day; I think that’s the number of suicides. I believe that’s the number fed to us in the hopes that we’ll all shut up and make it go away. That study was sponsored by the VA. It didn’t include the states of California, Texas, and Illinois. And I don’t know about you folks, but when I was in the Marine Corps, over half of us were from California and Texas. Some of the guys written about in that article that have committed suicide are from California. They also don’t count the phenomenon of suicide by cop. I’ve had two veterans that were killed by police officers, not saying it’s the police officer’s fault, but they pretend to have a weapon or they pull a weapon. The VA does nothing to report those as suicides. The number of 22 per day is inaccurate and we need an independent third party to come in and do a complete study to show us what the real number is so we know, once the number, we get a real number, then we’ll know what a big deal it is and we can fight it together. SEN. ERNST: And I use that 22 a day number all the time. I think that is appalling enough, but I think you are probably correct, Mr. Coleman, in your assessment. And for all of you, in your experience, do you believe the VA management takes seriously ideas for reform, the implementation of the IG recommendations, or recommendations from staff members when they are seeking to improve these services at the VA. Do you think they take them seriously? MR. WILKIES: VA leaders, it’s a system of cronyism that has gone on for so long, and they protect each other. Rules and regulations, often times, they don’t care. They’ll do, they, they use them when it benefits them. And I’ll tell you, and one of the reasons why, is because nothing ever happens to them. Even if you catch them. I’ve put policies in front of folks and I’ve said you can’t do this. This is against the policy. They still do it. But nothing ever happens to them. And you know the IG makes recommendations but they don’t have to hold, I mean- SEN. ERNST: Who’s holding their feet to the fire? MR. WILKIES: Right. SEN. ERNST: Right. We should be doing that. Thank you, Mr. Wilkes. Mr. Colon? MR. COLON: Excuse me, I already stated that it is great to have all these hearings, all new policies, all new recommendations, and solutions, but since this scandal has broken, since Phoenix, we have not held one person accountable for any wrong doing at the VA as far as whistleblower retaliation. The VA, what they do is they report a couple things to the IG, the IG sends it back to the agency to investigate itself, and then they give it to the supervisor. The supervisor already knows who the whistleblower is. So I always truly believe is that you cannot police yourself. Its not the way, the solution you should do it. Like I said the key component that everything is failing to make the VA better is new service for our veterans is start holding people accountable. SEN. ERNST: Very good. Well now my time is up, do you have any other comments? Please. MR. KIRKPATRICK: If I may, with regards to that, I know, you know the people who seem to have been responsible for retaliating against my brother as far as I’m aware are still employed at the VA. I don’t know if that’s pending investigation, but that’s unacceptable. SEN. ERNST: It is unacceptable. MR. KIRKPATRICK: And that is Dr. David Houlihan. And the human resources person, David Decant. SEN. ERNST: Thank you, again, my condolences. Mr. Coleman, do you have any closing thoughts very quickly? MR. COLEMAN: Ma’am really quickly I was just gonna say, the retaliation investigations, I was removed on hearsay. I’ve been, I was on paid administrative leave for 206 days until I was ordered back into the same retaliatory environment on August 17th, which I refused to go until it was safe. So, if they’re able to remove me on hearsay, whereas we have a sworn affidavit from the HR chief, showing that the Director held this meeting to propose to fire me on January 13th, and he’s still showing up to work every day. I love my job helping vets get clean and sober. I would do it for free, and they removed me from that, or took me out of that position, to investigate hearsay which was proven untrue in February. SEN. ERNST: Thank you again, gentleman. Thank you, Mr. Chair. # # #
09.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Senate failed to garner enough votes to proceed on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act which would ban abortions after about 5 months of pregnancy – a stage of development at which evidence shows unborn babies can feel pain and may survive outside the womb with appropriate medical care: “I am deeply disappointed by today’s outcome as this legislation would protect as many as 10,000 vulnerable lives every year. There should be no disagreement when it comes to protecting the life of an unborn child that reaches the point of development at which he or she can feel pain. “As a mother and grandmother, I remain steadfast in my commitment to defend life and will continue working tirelessly to ensure that our nation does not deny these innocent babies a future they rightly deserve. It is our responsibility as a society to protect the most vulnerable – particularly those who cannot protect themselves.” Last night, Senator Ernst spoke on the Senate floor to urge support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, and shared the story of the Pickering family from Newton, Iowa. Micah Pickering was born prematurely at just 5 months and has grown to be an energetic three-year old boy. # # #
09.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting to protect funding the Defense Department: “I remain disheartened by the misplaced opposition of my Democratic colleagues to taking up this important defense appropriations bill, which is paramount to upholding our commitment to the military and our servicemembers. In the midst of ever-increasing and complex global threats, there is simply no time for partisan politics on a bill that has broad bipartisan support. “Congress has the responsibility to ensure we uphold the promises made to our men and women in uniform and make certain that our military has the tools to defend our national security – passing this defense appropriations bill is necessary in working towards that goal.” In June, Senator Ernst voted for the Senate’s fiscal year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that included seven amendments the Iowa Senator authored.

09.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald on Friday seeking clarification and further information on the end of the VA’s funding of the Iowa Consortium of Veteran Excellence (ICOVE), a two-year pilot program partnership with the University of Iowa to assist veterans in their transition from servicemember to student. In the letter, Senators Grassley and Ernst requested the following data and information: Steps taken by the Department to ensure veterans who participated in the program maintain continuity of care and services through University of Iowa’s partnership with Iowa City VA. Metrics collected by the Department regarding ICOVE program performance. Specific requirements and components developed where two and four year postsecondary educational institutions could implement a similar program. Details on the combined efforts by the Department, the University, and other associated partners, to develop a program which could be implemented at other institutions. The efforts by the Department to make sure that the services funded by the intitial two year grant could potentially be sustained in the long-term. Any other potential sources of funds that might be available to sustain the services provided by ICOVE. Read the full letter here. # # #
09.21.2015	“And, as Micah proves, they can survive outside the womb. As a mother and a grandmother, I urge my colleagues not to deny these babies the right to life. Micah’s mom has said it best: “I bet that if Micah could have gone up to everyone who opposes the bill and give them a big hug, he could change all of their minds.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – This evening, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the floor of the United States Senate to call for support of the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – which would ban abortions after five months of pregnancy – and share the story of the Pickering family from Newton, Iowa. Micah Pickering was born prematurely at approximately five months and has grown to be an energetic three-year old boy. This legislation stands to save up to 10,000 lives like Micah’s per year by banning abortions after about five months of pregnancy – a stage of development at which evidence shows unborn babies can feel pain and may survive outside the womb with appropriate medical care. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, just a short while ago, I had the opportunity to meet with a very special family from Newton, Iowa. Micah Pickering, an adorable, energetic three-year old boy, was born prematurely, at just 22 weeks gestational age – the equivalent of 20-weeks after fertilization, the method of measurement in the bill before us. You will notice my picture. This is Micah, that energetic three-year old boy. He was just in the office and the picture was there. And Micah ran up, and he said, “That’s me!” And he said, “That’s a baby!” This is Micah when he was born. We are talking about 5 months, Mr. President. Think about that for a minute. Micah’s parents and the doctors and nurses at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics were dedicated to his survival. Micah’s mother, Danielle, has recounted the first time she got to meet her son in the hospital: And I quote, “The second I was able to meet Micah changed my life. He was so small. I didn’t know what to expect. Would he look ‘normal’? Could I bond with this baby? Those questions were a mess in my head as I was wheeled into his room two hours after his birth. The sight I saw was a perfectly formed baby.” “We didn’t understand at the time that Micah was right on time, but now we do. . . . You can be knowledgeable on every part of prematurity, but that does not change the fact that Micah was just as much full of life at 22.4 weeks as he is now at almost 3 years old.” I can attest that this little boy, pictured behind me, is indeed full of life. The bill before us today – the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – would protect up to 10,000 lives like Micah’s every year by preventing abortions after 20 weeks, or about 5 months, of development. As Micah proves, at 5 months, babies can live. The United States is currently only one of 7 countries in the world that allows abortions after 5 months. We are currently in the same company of China and North Korea. Mr. President, we must do better. Substantial medical evidence indicates that at about 5 months of development, unborn babies can feel pain. This means that thousands of unborn lives end painfully through abortion in our country every year. Is this really who we want to be as a nation? We are a country that stands for life. Just earlier I heard a colleague across the aisle talking about how God intends that we should protect bumblebees and tetrapods. But what about human life? In order to rise and meet that commitment, we must protect the most vulnerable in our society – particularly those who cannot protect themselves. The majority of men and women across this great nation agree. According to a Quinnipiac poll from last November, 60 percent of those surveyed support a law prohibiting abortion after 5 months of pregnancy. Although passionate advocates on both sides of this issue of life often disagree, there should be no disagreement when it comes to protecting the life of an unborn child that has reached the point of development at which he or she can feel pain. As you can see from the photo behind me, an unborn baby in its 5th month of development is not just a clump of cells—he or she can suck his or her thumb, yawn, stretch, and make faces. They have ten fingers and ten toes. They can also feel pain. And, as Micah proves, they can survive outside the womb. As a mother and a grandmother, I urge my colleagues not to deny these babies the right to life. Micah’s mom has said it best: “I bet that if Micah could have gone up to everyone who opposes the bill and give them a big hug, he could change all of their minds.” Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. # # #
09.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the release of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) plan to address potential future outbreaks of the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI): “I look forward to thoroughly reviewing the USDA’s proposed plan to ensure our farmers and producers – in Iowa and across the country – have the necessary safeguards in place to prepare for and respond to potential future outbreaks as migratory waterfowl are soon returning. It is crucial that the USDA implement the necessary fixes in order to help prevent the same devastating losses and delays our ag industry suffered from as a result of this massive outbreak. “We have seen first-hand the crippling effects of the avian flu in our state. I continue to hear from Iowa poultry and egg producers frustrated by the government’s response to this outbreak, which has taken a significant financial and emotional toll. In working alongside our federal and state governments, I remain committed to working to ensure we are as prepared as possible for any potential outbreaks in the future.” Senator Ernst Seeks Answers on the Avian Flu In April, Senator Ernst joined the bipartisan, bicameral Iowa delegation in a letter calling on the USDA to provide assistance to combat the outbreak. Senator Ernst held a series of town meetings to discuss the impact of HPAI in Iowa. In a letter sent in May, Senators Grassley and Ernst urged the USDA to ensure that resources had been properly deployed to Iowa to fight the ongoing HPAI outbreak. At the request of Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Senator Ernst (R-IA), the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry held a hearing in July entitled “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: The Impact of the U.S. Poultry Sector and Protecting U.S. Poultry Flocks” to address the response of the federal government to the ongoing outbreak. In June, Senator Ernst joined members of the Iowa delegation in a letter supporting Governor Terry Branstad’s request for a federal disaster declaration for the state due to the catastrophic losses caused by the outbreak. In July, Senator Ernst authored a column in the Sioux City Journal, highlighting the integral role Iowans play in federal bird flu strategy. # # #
09.17.2015	“It is time to put an end to this harmful rule that threatens the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and to work to establish the needed certainty for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small businesses and other landowners.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with 46 Senate co-sponsors, introduced a joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (ACE) that expands the scope of federal authority over land and waterways in the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, commonly known as WOTUS. Senator Ernst’s resolution would nullify this ill-conceived rule sending a message to the EPA and ACE that they failed to address the concerns raised by farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses in Iowa and across the country. “Hardworking Iowans don’t need more Washington bureaucrats from the EPA telling our job creators how best to use their land,” said Senator Ernst. “This ill-conceived rule ignores the thoughtful comments and serious concerns raised by farmers, ranchers, manufacturers and small businesses across the county. Furthermore, its expanded definition causes confusion, uncertainty and unnecessary red tape. Simply put, this one size fits all method is the wrong approach that puts our agriculture community at a disadvantage. “It is time to put an end to this harmful rule that threatens the livelihood of our rural communities nationwide and to work to establish the needed certainty for our farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, small businesses and other landowners.” You can read the full resolution here. Original cosponsors to the resolution include Senators Lamar Alexander, (R-TN), John Barrasso (R-WY), Roy Blunt (R-MO), John Boozman (R-AR), Richard Burr (R-NC), Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV), Dan Coats (R-IN), Thad Cochran (R-MS), John Cornyn (R-TX), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Steve Daines (R-MT), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Jeff Flake (R-AZ), Cory Gardner (R-CO), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Dean Heller (R-NV), John Hoeven (R-ND), Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), James Lankford (R-OK), Mike Lee (R-UT), John McCain (R-AZ), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Rand Paul (R-KY), David Perdue (R-GA), Jim Risch (R-ID), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Tim Scott (R-SC), Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Thune (R-SD), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Pat Toomey (R-PA), David Vitter (R-LA), and Roger Wicker (R-MS). Sen. Ernst is also a cosponsor of Sen. Barrasso’s proposal which provides clear principles and directions for the EPA and ACE to craft a WOTUS rule that takes into consideration positions held by key stakeholders, without causing additional harmful and unnecessary government regulations. In May, Sen. Ernst introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby who testified on the impact of WOTUS before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and shared her personal experiences with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. Watch part of the hearing here. Earlier this year, the Iowa Senator invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see firsthand how the agency’s efforts to redefine WOTUS directly impacts Iowans. McCarthy has yet to respond to the Senator’s invite. A full copy of the letter is available here. Impact on Iowa: According to an analysis by the Iowa Farm Bureau, an expanded definition of the WOTUS rule would expand EPA and ACE jurisdiction to over approximately 97 percent of Iowa.

09.16.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a letter sent today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) continued to push for answers on the Office of Personnel Management’s (OPM) data breach earlier this year. The Iowa Senator urged OPM Acting Director Beth Cobert to notify and provide protections to Iowans impacted by a recent cybersecurity breach affecting background investigation records. “Although OPM has notified those individuals impacted by a separate but related cybersecurity incident – discovered in April 2015 – affecting the personnel data of 4.2 million current and former Federal government employees and offered them free identity theft monitoring and restoration services, OPM has yet to notify those individuals impacted by the incident affecting background investigation records. This issue has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents in Iowa who are concerned they may have been affected by this breach and shared their concerns about the lack of communication and support offered by OPM,” Senator Ernst wrote. Senator Ernst also noted, “It is vital that the victims of this data breach in Iowa be notified as quickly as possible that their personal information has been compromised, and that there are protections available to them. It is concerning that so much time passed – almost three months – between the discovery of the breach and the awarding of a contract to assist in the notification and identity protection process. It is equally concerning that those affected by this breach have yet to be notified – particularly in light of the fact that some non-applicants may have no reason to assume that their information was listed on a background investigation application.” The Iowa Senator added, “I will continue to follow this issue closely in the coming months and would appreciate timely and appropriate updates on progress made in communicating with the millions impacted by this data breach, which includes a number of my constituents.” A copy of the letter can be found here. Earlier this year at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Ernst sought answers regarding the OPM data breach. Read more here. Text of the letter is as follows: The Honorable Beth Cobert Acting Director, U.S. Office of Personnel Management 1900 E Street, NW Washington, DC 20415-1000 Dear Director Cobert: I am writing to express concern about the Office of Personnel Management’s (“OPM”) response to the recent cyber incident affecting the background investigation records of millions of current, former, and prospective Federal employees and contractors, as well as state officials and employees in Iowa. On July 9, 2015, OPM announced that an interagency forensic investigation into the incident – which OPM discovered in early June 2015 – concluded that the breach resulted in the compromise of the records of approximately 21.5 million individuals, including 19.7 million individuals that applied for a background investigation and 1.8 million non-applicant spouses or co-habitants whose information was also listed on applications. By OPM’s own account, the sensitive information compromised included Social Security Numbers, findings from interviews conducted by background investigators, usernames and passwords, and approximately 1.1 million sets of fingerprints. Although OPM has notified those individuals impacted by a separate but related cybersecurity incident – discovered in April 2015 – affecting the personnel data of 4.2 million current and former Federal government employees and offered them free identity theft monitoring and restoration services, OPM has yet to notify those individuals impacted by the incident affecting background investigation records. This issue has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents in Iowa who are concerned they may have been affected by this breach and shared their concerns about the lack of communication and support offered by OPM. On September 1, 2015, OPM and the Department of Defense (“DoD”) announced the award of a $133 million contract to Identity Theft Guard Solutions LLC, doing business as ID Experts, for identity theft protection services for the 21.5 million individuals whose personal information was stolen in the cyber incident involving background investigations. The agencies further announced that the U.S. Government, through DoD, will begin notifying those impacted “later this month and continue over the next several weeks.” It is vital that the victims of this data breach in Iowa be notified as quickly as possible that their personal information has been compromised, and that there are protections available to them. It is concerning that so much time passed – almost three months – between the discovery of the breach and the awarding of a contract to assist in the notification and identity protection process. It is equally concerning that those affected by this breach have yet to be notified – particularly in light of the fact that some non-applicants may have no reason to assume that their information was listed on a background investigation application. I will continue to follow this issue closely in the coming months and would appreciate timely and appropriate updates on progress made in communicating with the millions impacted by this data breach, which includes a number of my constituents. Sincerely, Joni K. Ernst, United States Senator # # #
09.16.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – In a letter to President Obama today, U.S. Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), John McCain (R-AZ), Joni Ernst (R-IA), and Claire McCaskill (D-MO), renewed their call for him to immediately nominate an Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Today’s letter follows a July 25 letter from the senators that also called for the president to act on a nomination. There has been no permanent IG at VA for more than 600 days, despite ongoing reports of mismanagement at the department following last year’s waitlist scandal. “This position is necessary to establish proper oversight and accountability at VA, as well as to start rebuilding the lack of confidence too many Americans have in the Department. This is especially important given the recently released VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report showing systemic mismanagement, including the 307,000 veterans who died while waiting to be enrolled for health care from the Department,” wrote the Senators. “A permanent watchdog is needed to conduct thorough oversight and correct this troubling pattern of behavior. As such, we urge you to ensure that oversight of VA is prioritized by nominating a permanent IG as soon as possible,” the Senators continued. The Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE) is responsible for submitting recommendations of individuals for consideration by the president when an IG vacancy occurs, and has made recommendations to the administration for individuals to serve as VA IG. But the president has not yet made a nomination to fill this crucial post. Full text of the Senators’ letter to President Obama is below: September 16, 2015 President Barack Obama The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write to reiterate the serious need for you to nominate an Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as soon as possible. This position is necessary to establish proper oversight and accountability at VA, as well as to start rebuilding the lack of confidence too many Americans have in the Department. This is especially important given the recently released VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) report showing systemic mismanagement, including the 307,000 veterans who died while waiting to be enrolled for health care from the Department. The report documents disturbing failures at VA: a backlog of 889,000 health care applications in pending status; 307,000 veterans dying while their health care applications were pending; 10,000 veteran health records purged or deleted; and 40,000 unprocessed applications lost then rediscovered. Unfortunately, these appalling errors not only display a disappointing history at the Department, but an unacceptable status quo. Of the veterans with pending records, more than 48,000 died within the past four years. However, the VA Office of Inspector General could not accurately define how many veterans may have died waiting for health care benefits because VA “lacked adequate procedures and management oversight.” The departmental shortcomings highlighted by these findings are shocking and inexcusable. We wrote to you on March 24, 2015, regarding the importance of filling numerous vacancies in presidentially-appointed IGs. We also wrote to you on June 25, 2015, specifically to urge you to nominate a permanent IG for the VA Office of Inspector General. While acting IGs may perform commendable work, their temporary status fails to achieve the independence and authority of permanent IG leadership. As you know, there has been no permanent IG at VA for more than 600 days. This lack of leadership and oversight has contributed to VA’s consistently failing to deliver on our promises to veterans. A permanent watchdog is needed to conduct thorough oversight and correct this troubling pattern of behavior. As such, we urge you to ensure that oversight of VA is prioritized by nominating a permanent IG as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention to this important matter. Sincerely, Kelly Ayotte Joni Ernst John McCain Claire McCaskill # # #
09.15.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – This evening, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting to proceed with Senate consideration of the resolution of disapproval on the President’s nuclear deal with Iran: “I am extremely disappointed that my Democratic colleagues have once again undermined the will of the American people and denied them a vote on the President’s nuclear deal with Iran. Earlier this year, a bipartisan group of 98 Senators supported a vote over this nuclear agreement. Now, the same Democrats who initially supported the vote are going back on their word. “There is overwhelming bipartisan opposition to the President’s deal with Iran which gives Iran a pathway to achieve a nuclear weapon; fails to enforce anytime, anywhere inspections; provides Iran, the world’s leading sponsor of terror, with a free pass in this deal to continue its terrorist activities and the oppression of millions of Syrians through its support of the Assad regime. “This is one of the most critical votes of our time that will impact generations to come, and the American people deserve a vote to hold their elected officials in Washington accountable over this major national security issue. I remain committed to rejecting the President’s ill-conceived Iran deal that threatens our nation, our national security interests and our allies in the region.” Sen. Ernst’s Efforts to Shine a Light on the President’s Nuclear Deal with Iran: Last week, Senator Ernst spoke on the Senate floor about the significant failures in the President’s deal with Iran, a deal in which only 21 percent of Americans approve of. Watch her floor speech here. In addition, Senator Ernst penned a column which appeared on CNN.com highlighting the veracity of Iran’s threats against our allies and their support of terrorism, creating one of the most cataclysmic events of this century. In a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing in July, Senator Ernst asked current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin E. Dempsey on whether he advised President Obama that the U.S. must accept the Iran nuclear deal or go to war. During several other Senate Armed Services Committee hearings, Senator Ernst pressed witnesses on whether they agreed with the President’s ultimatum to accept the nuclear agreement or face war. Among the panelists questioned: General Hayden and former U.S. Ambassadors echoed there are other alternatives between the President’s two extremes. Admiral John M. Richardson, the President’s nominee to a top U.S. Navy post, stated that there were options beyond going to war. In July, Senator Ernst voiced national security concerns with the proposal following President Obama’s announcement that a deal had been reached. Read the Senator’s statement on the Iran Nuclear Agreement here. In May, Senator Ernst voted in support of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, certifying that no congressional sanction can be lifted during the review period and safeguards congressional oversight of Iranian compliance, legislation she also cosponsored. This legislation passed the Senate by a vote of 98 to 1. Read more about the Nuclear Agreement Review Act here. In April, the Iowa Senator also took to the Senate floor to call for Congressional review of the deal. Watch her floor speech here. # # #
09.11.2015	“America will never forget those who were lost, and our prayers are with their loved ones who continue to feel the deepest pain of their absence.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following video in honor of the 14th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: We can all remember where we were on that fateful day of September 11, 2001. The world seemed to stop. We saw the agonizing and heart wrenching events unfold 14 years ago, at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and on Flight 93. Americans from coast to coast watched as unspeakable acts of terrorism claimed the lives of thousands of innocent Americans. America will never forget those who were lost, and our prayers are with their loved ones who continue to feel the deepest pain of their absence. On that day our adversaries intended harm, but they were met with unmatched bravery, heroism and extraordinary fortitude. These attacks would not break the resilience of the American spirit. In the midst of such tragedy and sorrow, we saw the best of the American people as our first responders, service members and other heroes within our community rose up to help in countless acts of selfless courage. We did not cower. We joined together in a remarkable bond of strength, love and unity. The fight to protect our freedoms continues today. It is one of my greatest honors to put on our nation’s uniform and stand alongside the fearless men and women of our armed services willing to make tremendous sacrifices to defend our liberties and way of life. Today is a reminder that we must work to ensure that America's greatness will always overcome adversity. Thank you and may God bless Iowa and these great United States of America. # # #

09.10.2015	Booker, Cummings, Johnson, Issa lead Senate and House in announcing comprehensive reform to improve hiring prospects for the formerly incarcerated Bill seeks to reduce recidivism by prohibiting federal contractors & federal agencies from askingjob applicants about their criminal history until final stage of hiring process Walmart, Koch Industries, Target, Starbucks, Home Depot, and Bed, Bath & Beyond have already embraced “Ban the Box” policies Washington, DC – Today, Members of Congress led by U.S. Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Ron Johnson (R-WI) in the Senate and Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-MD) and Darrell Issa (R-CA), in the House of Representatives, introduced the Fair Chance Act, bipartisan, bicameral legislation that would give formerly incarcerated people a fairer chance at securing employment by prohibiting federal contractors and federal agencies from asking about the criminal history of a job applicant until an applicant receives a conditional offer of employment. Sen. Booker and Rep. Cummings were joined by U.S. Sens. Ron Johnson (R-WI), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), and Joni Ernst (R-IA), along with Reps. Darrell Issa (R-CA), Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX), Earl Blumenauer (D-OR), Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ), Cedric Richmond (D-LA), John Conyers (D-MI), and Bobby Scott (D-VA). Nationwide, states and cities have been implementing “Ban the Box” polices to help people with records overcome the barrier to employment of having to “check the box” about a past felony conviction on a job application. Eighteen states and over 100 cities and counties have taken action, giving formerly incarcerated people a fairer chance to secure employment. Additionally, companies such as Walmart, Koch Industries, Target, Home Depot, and Bed, Bath & Beyond have embraced these “Ban the Box” policies to more fairly assess job applicants. “Empowering people with records to become productive members of society instead of repeat offenders is not only fiscally sound, it’s the morally responsible thing to do,” said Sen. Booker. “There are millions of Americans with records who are quickly passed over by employers without considering their skills or qualifications because of their history. Sadly, this approach only increases the likelihood of recidivism at great cost to taxpayers and communities in New Jersey and across the country. The Fair Chance Act seeks to dismantle this unfair barrier in federal hiring to ensure these Americans are given a second chance and a fairer shot at making a better life for themselves." “This commonsense legislation will give those leaving the criminal justice system a fair chance to turn their lives around, and to contribute to our economy in a meaningful way,” said Rep. Cummings. “It is high time for us to build upon state and local policies like those in Maryland and Baltimore. This bill will help us reduce recidivism, break the cycles of crime we see all too often, and make our communities safer in the process.” “Over the last several months, I have had the opportunity to meet with former incarcerated offenders back in Wisconsin,” said Sen. Johnson. “What has struck me most is how challenging we make it for those who truly want to turn their lives around. I want to help make their transition easier. If someone getting out of prison wants to work, wants to be a productive member of society, we should do everything we can to facilitate that. The dignity of work is probably the best way we can keep people from turning back to a life of crime. I’m pleased to work with Senator Booker and Representative Cummings to provide federal leadership on giving people a second chance.” “About nine percent of Americans – roughly 20 million people -- have a felony conviction in the United States,” said Rep. Issa. “Unfortunately, current practice ensures that the 18-year-old who makes a mistake will not only pay for his crime through the justice system, but will continue to be punished for the rest of his life, as he or she is disqualified out-of-hand from consideration for federal employment opportunities, even when qualified for the position. The message we inadvertently end up sending is that those who commit a crime will never be given a second chance.” “Fair hiring practices help ensure that people who have served their time can reenter the workforce without continuing to be punished for their past mistakes,” said Sen. Brown. “All Americans deserve the chance to earn a living and make a positive contribution to their communities. These reforms would ensure that they have that chance and help to restore hope and opportunity to those who have served their time and paid their dues to society.” “Those who have made mistakes and paid their debt to society deserve a chance to move forward and live a productive life,” said Sen. Baldwin. “Yet, far too often, the more than 70 million Americans who have criminal histories face unreasonable employment barriers that stand in the way of contributing to our workforce. This bipartisan effort will help ensure that every American has a fair chance to secure a steady job, support their family and strengthen our communities.” “We are a nation of opportunity and the Fair Chance Act provides a second chance for Americans with a record who have served their time to pursue employment with the federal government or contractors based on personal merit and qualifications,” said Sen. Ernst. “This bipartisan legislation works to prevent recidivism and encourages reintegration within our communities across the country while also maintaining safeguards for employers and proactively working to protect taxpayer dollars.” “One of the most difficult parts of coming into the criminal justice system is the journey of coming out of it,” said Rep. Jackson Lee. “For an individual who has paid their debt, the process of re-entering society is paved with tremendous, and often unsurmountable, obstacles. Despite serving time behind bars, formerly incarcerated individuals and those with criminal records continue to face a lengthy and often lifetime sentence upon returning to their communities. In a nation where one third of our adult population has a criminal record, we must acknowledge and confront the damaging and crippling effects of mass incarceration. This legislation will not prevent the inquiry all together—employers can ask later in the hiring process—but it will allow candidates to get a foot in the door.” “With the largest prison population in the world, we must find ways to restore the lives of individuals, their families, and their communities. If someone has served their sentence and attempts a new start in life, they should be given a fair chance to make a positive contribution to their community. The federal government should lead by example. This legislation removes unfair federal hiring barriers for previously incarcerated individuals to help put a stop to the cycle of recidivism,” said Rep. Blumenauer. “I have dedicated much of my work in public service to reentry issues, and it’s a subject that hits especially close to home having watched members of my family return from incarceration,” said Rep. Watson Coleman. “We can’t expect individuals who have served their time and paid their debts to society to successfully transition back into their communities if their job applications are thrown out before they get the chance to prove their skills. The increased public attention of the past few months has forced us to begin the important work of reforming our criminal justice system ? but that work won’t be complete without changing the way we look at formerly incarcerated individuals once they return to society. This legislation is a vital step, and I’m proud to join my colleagues in supporting it.” “The most effective way to keep people out of jail is to provide them with a job,” said Rep. Richmond. “Ex-offenders must have the opportunity to make a living and provide for their families legally or they will revert to the same destructive behaviors that led them to prison in the first place. The Fair Chance Act removes the unnecessary barriers for otherwise qualified individuals to find employment and sets the right example for employers throughout the country.” “Banning the box is the right thing to do for those fighting for a fair opportunity to show their qualifications. By allowing rehabilitated individuals to provide for themselves and their families, we are helping the national economy, reducing the strain on our justice system, and ensuring that no person’s talents and contributions go to waste,” said Rep Conyers. “Excessive punishment, bias in the criminal justice system, and poor rehabilitative services leaves our society with huge costs. The fact is, about 1 in 100 adults in this country is in prison – more than any country on this planet,” said Rep. Scott. “A criminal record should not be a blanket denial of an opportunity, but should be considered with regard to the nature of the job, and only at the point where the applicant reaches the conditional offer stage.This bill is a step in the right direction to further policies across the nation, including in my home State of Virginia, to help formerly incarcerated people gain employment and re-enter society.” Currently, federal law does not prevent federal employers from asking a formerly incarcerated person about their past crimes at any stage of a job interview. The Fair Chance Act would bring the “Ban the Box” initiative to the federal hiring process and would prohibit federal employers and federal contractors from inquiring about criminal history information of a candidate until he or she is given a conditional offer of employment. Exceptions are made for positions related to law enforcement and national security duties, positions that require access to classified information, or when disclosure before the conditional offer stage is required by law. The Fair Chance Act would: Ban the federal government—including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches—from requesting criminal history information from applicants until they reach the conditional offer stage; Prohibit federal contractors from requesting criminal history information from candidates for positions within the scope of federal contracts until the conditional offer stage; Include important exceptions for positions related to law enforcement and national security duties, positions requiring access to classified information, and positions for which access to criminal history information before the conditional offer stage is required by law; and Require the Department of Labor, U.S. Census Bureau, and Bureau of Justice Statistics to issue a report on the employment statistics of formerly incarcerated individuals. Over 70 million Americans who have criminal histories are faced with the daunting task of securing employment. They face improbable odds in obtaining a job as a result of an arrest or criminal conviction. Studies show that a criminal record reduces the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent for men in general. African-American men with criminal records have been 60 percent less likely to receive a callback or job offer than those without records. For individuals trying to turn the page on a difficult chapter in their lives, a criminal conviction poses a substantial barrier to employment. In May, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), led a bipartisan group of 25 of their Senate colleagues in urging President Obama to expand job opportunities and reduce recidivism by taking executive action and requiring federal contractors and federal agencies to “ban the box” on job applications. The letter can be viewed here. Also in May, Reps. Cummings, Jackson Lee, Blumenauer, Watson Coleman, Richmond, Conyers, and Scott signed a similar letter to the President that included signatures from over 70 House Members. That letter can be viewed here. The Fair Chance Act is supported by the Center for Urban Families, Bend the Arc Jewish Action, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Employment Law Project, and the National Black Prosecutors Association. # # #
09.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement after voting to proceed with Senate consideration of the resolution of disapproval on the President’s nuclear deal with Iran: “Earlier this year, 98 Senators voted for congressional review of the nuclear agreement with Iran and today our Democratic colleagues are going back on their word and denying the Senate – and the American people – a straight up or down vote on the President’s deal with Iran. “This deal falls dangerously short of its intended goal to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program, instead it provides a pathway for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon. In addition, there are no anytime, anywhere inspections that were promised by this Administration and are critical to curbing Iran’s nuclear ambitions. I am also deeply troubled that the administration was willing to leave the negotiating table before securing an end to Iran’s proven support of terrorism. They are the world’s leading sponsor of terror and we are giving them a free pass in this deal to continue those efforts. “Contrary to the President’s claim that the deal will make the Middle East a safer place, Israel has made clear that they believe the agreement will make the region more dangerous. “I have heard from a great number of concerned Iowans that do not trust or support a deal with Iran and therefore remain committed to rejecting the President’s nuclear deal with Iran.” WATCH Sen. Ernst’s Floor Speech on the President’s Nuclear Agreement with Iran: Click here or on the image below to watch. Last night, Sen. Ernst took to the Senate floor of the United States Senate to highlight the significant failures in the President’s nuclear deal with Iran. The Senator reminded members of Congress that “the decision we make on this agreement will have lasting results for our nation, the world, and future generations of Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to reject the President’s bad deal and put the security of the American people, our allies, and the global community first.” Sen. Ernst’s Efforts to Shine a Light on the President’s Nuclear Deal with Iran: Sen.

09.09.2015	"…the decision we make on this agreement will have lasting results for our nation, the world, and future generations of Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to reject the President’s bad deal and put the security of the American people, our allies, and the global community first.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – This evening, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the floor of the United States Senate to highlight the significant failures within the President’s nuclear deal with Iran, and called on Congress to reject the President’s deal. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: As we come together and debate President Obama’s agreement on Iran, I believe it is one of the most consequential national security decisions we may ever face. I have heard my peers talk many times about the things that trouble them. The things that they fear. The “things that keep us up at night.” And I will tell you that this nuclear agreement is one of those things that keeps me up at night, as a mother, as a grandmother, and as a soldier. Having proudly worn our nation’s uniform for over twenty years, and having deployed to the region, I can tell you that protecting and defending this country is something that I take very seriously, and very personally. I had hoped our President would approach the American people with a deal that reflected the high ground our nation has stood on against Iran for decades. Unfortunately, now that I have seen the available details, I believe the President has not negotiated a good deal with Iran. The agreement before us fails to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program and does not end Iran’s support of terrorism. The President has squandered his opportunity to enhance our national security, and the security of our Israeli and Arab allies by failing to live up to his own goal of ending Iran’s capability to build a nuclear weapon. The Administration is asking the American people to accept a deal which will—at best—freeze Iran’s nuclear program for eight years. And that’s if the Iranians actually live up to their end of the bargain. One of the major failures in this deal is the lack of anytime, anywhere inspections to ensure that they do. In April, the President’s own Secretary of Energy—Dr. Moniz—a nuclear physicist who the President often refers to as a leading authority on nuclear programs, he said, and I quote, “we expect to have anywhere, anytime access,” end quote, when referring to what our country needed to ensure Iran was abiding by a nuclear agreement. Well, how can we ever be certain of compliance if Iran decides to cheat and we have a weak inspection regime as part of this deal? I would argue that we can’t. Another part of this debate that has been very troubling to me is that the President continues to tell the American people there are only two options: his agreement or war. During one of his major speeches on this deal, he actually mentioned the word “war” 50 times in an attempt to hammer this false choice home. Despite this misinformation campaign designed to pressure the American people into agreeing on a bad deal, our military leaders and distinguished former Administration officials clearly denied that our choice is either support the deal or go to war with Iran. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey, disagreed with the President’s assessment that the American people face a choice of supporting the agreement or going to war with Iran. Later that same week, the President’s pick to lead the United States Navy, said war was not the only alternative and that “we need to use the full set of capabilities that the joint force and the Navy can deliver to deter that. And the military contribution is also just a subset of a ‘whole of government’ approach along with our allies in the region.” And it’s not just leaders within our military saying this. General Michael Hayden, former Director of the CIA and NSA, said, quote, “There is no necessity to go to war if we don’t sign this agreement. There are actions in between those two extremes.” End quote. Dr. Richard Haas, President of the Council on Foreign Relations, said, “I would echo that …” during the same hearing. Ambassador Edelman, a former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Ambassador to Turkey, said “..I agree with you, I don’t think those are the only alternatives.” Ambassador Nicholas Burns, a former top US negotiator with Iran on its nuclear program and former Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, said “I don’t believe that war would be inevitable...” Rather than misrepresenting the facts and our country’s options, I challenge supporters of this agreement to explain to the American people why they are supporting a flawed and bad deal today when we should be putting our citizens’ interests and their security first. I’d also note that this Administration was willing to leave the negotiating table without securing an end to Iran’s support of terrorism. Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terror—and we are giving them a free pass in this deal to continue those efforts. In addition to the billions of dollars in sanctions relief, which leaves Iran poised to double-down on its support of terrorism, the president also agreed to lift the UN arms embargo for advanced conventional weapons and ballistic missiles. As a veteran of Kuwait and Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom—I am beside myself, as are many other Americans who served in Iraq, regarding the President’s support for sanctions relief for one terrorist in particular—the leader of Iran’s elite covert force, the Quds Force, General Qassem Soleimani. General Soleimani is directly responsible for the deaths of several hundred of Americans and the wounding of thousands more during the Iraq War. Throughout the Iraq War, we lost many Americans killed in action and many more wounded by Iraqi Shia militia who were supported or controlled by General Soleimani. In 2010, Ambassador James Jeffrey, then U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, said, “Up to a quarter of the American casualties and some of the more horrific incidents in which Americans were kidnapped…can be traced without doubt to these Iranian groups.” One of the signature tools to attack American servicemembers was an Improvised Explosive Device IED known as an Explosively Formed Penetrator or EFP. These EFPs were provided by Iran exclusively to groups they controlled in order to kill Americans. If you ask American servicemembers who served in Iraq during the war—they will tell you these types of IEDs used by Iranian supported Shia militias were some of the most deadly and devastating types emplaced by any of the Iraqi insurgent groups—including al Qaeda in Iraq. While many of my colleagues share the concern regarding General Soleimani and Iran’s targeting of Americans during the Iraq War, we seldom hear from Americans who have firsthand experience in fighting these Iranian supported Iraqi Shia militias. My staff recently spoke to a currently serving U.S. Army officer, originally from Waterloo, Iowa, who deployed with the 1st Cavalry Division on a 15-month deployment to Iraq during the Surge. This Iowan described to us the impact Iran’s effort in Iraq had on him and his tank platoon in Baghdad, saying, “the threat of EFPs was quite real during our deployment to Iraq. And I’m quoting him. Understanding the pipeline from Iran into Iraq, the abundance of the munitions and the lethality on US Forces, the sense of peril never left [our] psyche. While I was never fearful of losing a limb, I knew if I was struck, I would follow certain death, one that I welcomed ten months into a fifteen month deployment.” End quote. Removing sanctions on Soleimani is an embarrassment for this Administration and in the words of some of our Iraq veterans, “a slap in the face.” And then there’s Luke, a retired Army servicemember with the storied 101st Airborne Division. While on patrol during the division’s second tour to Iraq, Luke lost his leg in combat after his vehicle was hit with an Iranian made EFP. He told us that, quote, “We come home blown up and try to put our lives back together, only to hear that our country is going to be lifting sanctions that will free up billions for Iran to kill more innocents. We may not be at war with them, but they’re at war with us. I’m a wounded veteran and I spend a great deal of time helping other guys like me. I can assure you that this deal directly affects us. It’s a slap in the face to all veterans. All those who served…” End quote. We owe it to veterans and our current servicemembers who have sacrificed to stop Iran’s support of terror. I urge the President and my colleagues to consider Iran’s true intent, and not to underestimate Iran’s will to enhance its capability to destabilize the Middle East, threaten American security, and the security of our allies in the region and around the globe. Mr. President, in closing, the decision we make on this agreement will have lasting results for our nation, the world, and future generations of Americans. I urge all of my colleagues to reject the President’s bad deal and put the security of the American people, our allies, and the global community first. Thank you Mr. President, I yield back the floor. # # #

08.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At yesterday’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the Military Balance in the Middle East.” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) continued her line of questioning to another panel of witnesses on whether they agreed with the President’s ultimatum to accept this nuclear agreement with Iran or face war. Witnesses on the panel included Professor Walter Russell Mead, Distinguished Scholar in American Strategy at the Hudson Institute and Chace Professor of Foreign Affairs at Bard College; Mr. Michael Singh, Lane-Swig Senior Fellow and Managing Director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; Dr. Ray Takeyh, Senior Fellow for Middle Eastern Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations; Dr. Philip Gordon, Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations; and Mr. Richard Nephew, Fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Watch their responses here. Senator Ernst followed a similar line of questioning to General Hayden and Former U.S. Ambassadorswho echoed that there are other alternatives between the President’s two extremes. The Iowa Senator also asked Admiral John M. Richardson, the President’s nominee to a top U.S. Navy post, if he thought the only alternative to the Iran nuclear agreement is war, and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin E. Dempsey on whether or not he advised President Obama that if we were not to accept the agreement with Iran, we would face war. Senator Ernst also addressed the need to examine regional repercussions if Iran obtains greater means to empower the Shia militia. Dr. Singh responded, “I worry that you’ll see is Iran using some of its resources, using the freedom from sanctions to further strengthen its own militias, which are answerable to Tehran rather than to the government in Baghdad… it doesn’t contribute to our goals and our interests in the region – quite the opposite, in the longer run.” Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here today. This has been one of many of a series of great discussions that we have had on this issue, so thank you for taking the time and providing the input necessary. I’m going to sound a little bit like a broken record – I’ve asked this question over and over again of the last few panels, but I would like to ask each of you. In the middle of July, the President came out and he stated we either sign this nuclear agreement or it’s war. Sign the agreement or it’s war. Not, “We’ll work a little more on diplomatic relations, sanctions,” he said, “It’s war.” So we either go along with this or America’s going to war, evidently. Do you believe that to be true, yes or no? Dr. Mead? PROFESSOR MEAD: No, Senator. SENATOR ERNST: Mr. Singh? MR SINGH: No, Senator. DR. TAKEYH: No, Senator. SENATOR ERNST: Dr. Gordon? DR. GORDON: I don’t think it’s automatically war, but it does, as I tried to underscore, put us in the position of either seeing Iran’s program continue or implementing that credible use of force, which is war. SENATOR ERNST: Okay, and I’ll come back to you in a second, Dr. Gordon, thank you. Mr. Nephew? MR. NEPHEW: Senator, I’d agree with Dr. Gordon. I think that, over time, it will lead to an escalatory spiral that leads us to war, yes. SENATOR ERNST: In time, it could lead to war, but not definitive. Is that correct, Mr. Nephew? MR. NEPHEW: Senator, I would say that I find the likelihood of getting a diplomatic resolution dims dramatically if we reject this deal, so therefore I do believe that we will have an escalating Iranian nuclear program, an ever-expanding one, that sanctions will not be able to control, and I think that leads us to war. SENATOR ERNST: Okay, and Dr. Gordon, I’ll go back to you, because you stated you did work in the administration for a period of years. You were assisting with these efforts for the nuclear agreement, is that correct? DR. GORDON: Yes. SENATOR ERNST: Okay. When I spoke to General Dempsey the other day, who is the president’s senior military advisor, I asked him if he had recommended that to the president, and he stated no, that he had not recommended that. He did believe that – DR. GORDON: I’m sorry, recommended? SENATOR ERNST: That we would go to war if this agreement were not signed, and he stated that he did believe there were other options that could be explored before we automatically made the assumption that the United States would engage in war with Iran. So he rejected that. I asked him if he knew who was advising him on that and he said that he did not know. Yesterday, the panel rejected the notion that war was the obvious solution if we did not sign the agreement. So are you the one that was advising the president that we would go to war or we should go to war if this deal was not signed? DR. GORDON: Senator, I don’t think and I don’t know anyone who thinks that if this deal is not implemented that very quickly Iran makes a dash for a bomb and the United States uses force. That’s not, I think, the realistic way to think about it. I think the realistic way to think about it is there are one of three options if this deal does not go ahead. Either, and ideally, we get a better deal, the Supreme Leader decides that, after all, he can make more concessions, he comes back to the table in three months or six months or a year, and he gives us everything we want. That would obviously be ideal; I just don’t think it’s realistic. If that doesn’t happen, if the Iranians don’t come back and agree to all of the things we would like, then it’s really one of two things: they steadily proceed with their program, as they’ve been doing over ten years, and instead of 19,000 centrifuges they have 30,000; instead of an LEU stockpile of 10 tons, they have 20 tons; they complete the heavy water reactor at Arak; they do their research and development on the IR-8s and then we have to decide. We either watch that happen and have a hearing in a year or two when they’ve done all of that and they’re basically on the verge of a nuclear weapons capability or have one, or we implement the credible use of force to stop them. That’s what I think people mean when they say they’re worried that if we don’t do this deal, there will be a conflict. SENATOR ERNST: I would reject the outright notion that we would go to war. I do think that we need to take a step back and consider this. I want to look at the – because we are talking about regional strategy, I do believe that Iran has a regional strategy and they are a state sponsor of terrorism. I think this furthers their reign of terrorism in the region and around the globe. I think it makes them very powerful. On the other hand, the United States does not have a strategy in that region. If we had a strategy and this nuclear agreement was involved in that, I don’t think it would have been necessary to send Secretary Carter from country to country to talk with our allies in that region to, you know, ease their fears. I don’t see that that would have happened if we had that strategy. I would love to visit more, Mr. Singh, about just very briefly, if I might, Mr. Chairman? Just very quickly. I would like to look at the repercussions in Iraq. Iran is a very powerful nation through its proxies of terrorism, whether it’s in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Lebanon, you name it. What does this do to Iraq with Iran having further means to empower the Shia militia? Does that really lend credibility to a multi-sectarian Iraqi government or do we see that falling apart with greater power going to the Iraqi Shia militia? MR. SINGH: I don’t think that it’s helpful. I think the problem with this alliance of convenience with Iran in Iraq to combat ISIS, even though neither the U.S. or Iran likes ISIS and both would like to see ISIS defeated is that Iran’s actions are meant, I think, to sort of bolster Iranian influence and the influence of Iran’s proxies in Iraq, and so what I worry that you’ll see is Iran using some of its resources, using the freedom from sanctions to further strengthen its own militias, which are answerable to Tehran rather than to the government in Baghdad, as well as to buy political influence. We’ve seen this pattern in places like Lebanon, and it doesn’t contribute to our goals and our interests in the region – quite the opposite, in the longer run. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you very much, that – DR. TAKEYH: Senator, can I just respond to that – SENATOR ERNST: Yes. DR. TAKEYH: – Mr. Chairman, very briefly, because I think there’s been a discussion about this windfall, where it’s going to be felt. I think the ramifications of this nuclear agreement, the economic ramifications – I don’t know how it will affect the trajectory of terrorism. I suspect it will be more, but it will be particularly felt in Iraq and Syria, in terms of prolongation of the Syrian Civil War and the military balance changes in the favor of President al-Assad. And in Iraq, the Iranians are talking about application of the Hezbollah model to the Shia militias. Namely, those Shia militias will be used outside Iraq, whether it’s in Syria or whether it’s elsewhere. So, essentially, the notion is that in due course, you have mini-Hezbollahs being created along that – Lebanon being the model for Iraq, a fragmented state, and Shia militias following the model of Hezbollah in terms of being employed by Iran in various other exigencies in the region. SENATOR ERNST: Okay, thank you. # # #
08.04.2015	SENATOR ERNST: “Simple yes or no. If we don’t sign this agreement, are we going to war?” GENERAL HAYDEN: “There is no necessity to go to war if we don’t sign this agreement. There are actions in between those two extremes.” . . . . DR. HAASS: “I would echo that …” . . . . AMBASSADOR EDELMAN: “Yes Senator Ernst, I agree with you, I don’t think those are the only alternatives.” . . . . AMBASSADOR BURNS: “I don’t believe that war would be inevitable...” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the Military Balance in the Middle East.” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) asked the panel of witnesses about alternatives to signing the Iran nuclear agreement and President Obama’s ultimatum to accept this deal or face war with Iran. Witnesses on the panel included General Michael V. Hayden, Principal at the Chertoff Group and former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency; Ambassador R. Nicholas Burns, Goodman Professor of Diplomacy and International Relations at the Harvard Kennedy School; Ambassador Eric S. Edelman, Distinguished Fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and Former Undersecretary of Defense for Policy; and Dr. Richard N. Haass, President of the Council on Foreign Relations and Former Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State. The Iowa Senator also pointed to the Obama Administration’s failure throughout the negotiating process in discussing options to push back on Iran. To that, Dr. Haass replied, “Violently, I agree with that. And I think we would have had far more negotiating leverage had Congress been involved sooner.” The Senator followed a similar line of questioning to when she asked Admiral John M. Richardson, the President’s nominee to a top U.S. Navy post, on his opinion if the only alternative to the Iran nuclear agreement is war, and a question directed to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin E. Dempsey on whether he advised the President that the only options were the agreement with Iran or face war. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair, gentlemen thank you very much for being here today. This has been an enlightening discussion, I think, very good for all of us to participate in and hear your areas of expertise. It has been brought up a couple of times already today, and I want to make it very clear: a couple of you have affirmed this, but I would like to ask each of you, yes or no, a simple yes or no question, and then we can come back and talk a little bit more about it, but the President made very clear several weeks ago, very, very clear, that it was either this nuclear agreement or war. There was no in between – it was either the agreement, sign it, have it done, or we’re going to war. General Dempsey pushed back on this, Admiral Richardson pushed back on this, they agreed that there are other options available, so just simple yes or no: if we don’t sign this agreement, are we going to war? General Hayden? GENERAL HAYDEN: There’s no necessity to go to war if we don’t sign this agreement. There are actions between those two extremes. SENATOR ERNST: Than you. Dr. Haass. DR. HAASS: I would echo that, but I can’t rule out that Iran would take steps that would force the United States to contemplate the use of military force. We would have to decide what, at some point, we deem to be intolerable. SENATOR ERNST: But do you think there are other options before we get to war? DR. HAASS: Absolutely, from sanctions to covert action of various types and so forth. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. Ambassador? AMBASSADOR EDELMAN: Yes, Senator Ernst, I agree with you. I don’t think those are the only alternatives. SENATOR ERNST: And Ambassador Burns? AMBASSADOR BURNS: I don’t believe that war would be inevitable. Possible, but I do think congressional disapproval would weaken the U.S. and our ability to hold the sanctions regime together, which has been the key factor. SENATOR ERNST: And I think there has been some very good discussion today. I think it’s very, again, enlightening that we have gone from, a number of weeks ago, many people, whenever I would bring up this topic about having other options available, why are we just talking about war? Now we’re having very good discussion about other things that we need to do as the United States to protect not only our population, but our friends in that region and around the world. A number of weeks ago, this was not happening. People were either saying that either we sign this agreement or we’re going to war. There are a lot of things that we can do, and unfortunately I think these discussions should have occurred much more significantly during the negotiations process. Now we’re at a point we either take the deal or not and try and unilaterally come up with things that we can do as a country to push back on Iran. Do you agree with that? DR. HAASS: Violently, I agree with that. And I think we would have had far more negotiating leverage had Congress been involved sooner. I remember, and Senator McCain and Senator Reed and others will remember because we all go way back, we used to have Senators and Congressmen as part of delegations. I would – I think the idea of joint negotiating approaches, so Congress, if you will, is in on the takeoff as well as the landing, because right now, you’re right – we have, I always say, have poor choices and very few of them. It would have been much better to have expanded the range of choices and to improve the quality of the choices, and I think there ought to be some lessons derived for future Administrations and future Congresses about how to conduct negotiations, because we’re leaving ourselves in a very difficult place if we only get to this point after the deal, if you will, is signed, sealed, and delivered. SENATOR ERNST: We are between a rock and a hard place right now, most certainly. Iran’s chief terrorist is, of course, I think, General Soleimani, and we have talked a little bit about this, gentlemen, today, and great article just out by Lieutenant General (retired) Michael Barbero: “Empowering the Iranian who Murdered Americans.” I think 20 percent of the deaths in Iraq have been attributed to the EFPs that the General had put in place, Soleimani. I think it’s good that we remember that this gentleman now is in good standing once this agreement goes into place. And this is a man who I don’t think is going to curb his terrorist activity or his backing of Hezbollah and Hamas and many of these other organizations. How will this deal empower this General? General Hayden, can you speak to that, please? GENERAL HAYDEN: Sure, Senator. In terms of direct impact, he wasn’t going to travel to the United States anyway or show up at the UN, so – but we talked earlier about unleashing resources that can now be put at his disposal to continue doing what he’s been doing, and frankly, it couldn’t possibly come at a worse time. I mean, the man routinely is on the ground in Iraq directing Shia militia, and now we’ve given him additional resources. SENATOR ERNST: Yes, thank you, and I think that it’s wise to remember that all of us that serve in the Senate probably have constituents and families in our states that have members that were killed overseas as a direct result from those EFPs. Thank you, Mr. Chair. # # #
08.03.2015	“I am committed to defending life, because protecting the most vulnerable is an important measure of any society... The American taxpayers should not be asked to fund an organization like Planned Parenthood that has shown a sheer distain for human dignity and complete disregard for women and their babies.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered remarks on the Senate Floor in support of S. 1881 a bill to prohibit federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, in the wake of gruesome footage depicting Planned Parenthood’s role in harvesting the organs of unborn babies. This legislation led by Senators Joni Ernst, James Lankford (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), along with more than 40 co-sponsors redirects federal funding taken from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities that provide health services for women, and guarantees that there is absolutely no reduction in overall federal funding available to support women’s health. Senator Ernst released the following statement after today’s vote failed to proceed but received a majority of support, as well as bipartisan support, in the Senate: “I want to thank my colleagues for their efforts to redirect federal funding taken from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities that provide health services for women. The footage depicting Planned Parenthood employees discussing in gruesome detail the organization’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies is morally reprehensible and raises a number of questions that taxpayers deserve answers to. I will continue to press the Department of Health and Human Services to cooperate with all current and future investigations. I remain committed to getting these answers because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society.” Senator Ernst recently led a bipartisan group of 49 of her fellow senators in a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell. In the letter, the senators drew attention to the issues raised by the footage and called on HHS Secretary Burwell to cooperate with ongoing and future investigations into these questions. The senators are still awaiting a response from HHS. Click here or on the image below to watch Sen. Ernst’s remarks on the floor. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an issue that has shaken the moral compass of our society. The phrase “it’s a boy!” is one we often use when celebrating new life. Instead, this was spoken by a Planned Parenthood employee as the body of an unborn baby boy was picked apart and harvested for organs like a liver, kidneys and heart. We’ve watched as other Planned Parenthood employees talked about “less crunchy” techniques to preserve baby organs for buyers, and grumbled about “war torn” unborn babies before being sold for parts. While it would be easier to ignore these videos, today, we are standing up and shining a light on what is really happening. This is human life and Planned Parenthood – the nation’s single largest provider of abortion services – is harvesting baby body parts. The American people are shocked and horrified by the utter lack of compassion and disregard shown by Planned Parenthood for these women and their babies. This gruesome footage resonates within our collective conscious as it goes against the very principles that we stand for. As a mother and grandmother, the gravity of Planned Parenthood’s callous and morally reprehensible behavior cannot be ignored. I am committed to defending life, because protecting the most vulnerable is an important measure of any society. I am proud to stand before you today - with 45 co-sponsors - and offer legislation that will defund Planned Parenthood, while safeguarding funding for women’s health services. This legislation: Prohibits federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Protects federal funding for women’s health services like prenatal and postpartum care, cervical and breast cancer screenings, diagnostic laboratory and radiology services. And guarantees there is no reduction in overall federal funding available to support women’s health. This legislation redirects federal funding taken from Planned Parenthood to other eligible entities that provide health services for women, like community health centers and hospitals. There would be absolutely no reduction in overall federal funding available to support women’s health. Community health centers provide more comprehensive primary and preventative health care services – except abortion – regardless of a person’s ability to pay. Meanwhile, Planned Parenthood facilities do not perform in-house mammograms. The American taxpayers should not be asked to fund an organization like Planned Parenthood that has shown a sheer distain for human dignity and complete disregard for women and their babies. These videos are hard for anyone to defend and pull back the curtain on Planned Parenthood’s careless practice of rummaging for unborn baby organs to be harvested and sold at a price. I leave you with this one question: who do we want to be as a nation? Before us today is an opportunity to vote for legislation that will protect the most vulnerable and women’s health. Thank you Mr. President, I yield the floor. # # #
07.30.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for passage of the Developing a Reliable and Innovative Vision for the Economy (DRIVE) Act, a six year highway transportation authorization measure: “The DRIVE Act offers the kind of long-term and consensus solutions for our state and local communities to move forward on and implement transportation projects that enhance our nation’s roadways. Iowans and Americans across this country deserve stability and the certainty of safe and secure roads, bridges and other basic infrastructure. “This legislation moves us in the right direction by cutting red tape and streamlining project delivery. Furthermore, it ensures Iowans are empowered to make decisions over where funding is needed most and safeguards the flexibility of our states to determine how infrastructure dollars are spent.” Following passage of the DRIVE Act, the Senate voted on a three month extension of the Highway Trust Fund. The short-term extension allows the House and Senate more time to pass a much needed long-term solution: “While I remain committed to a long-term solution, Congress has a responsibility to ensure our states have the funding they need; we cannot allow a lapse in funding for the Highway Trust Fund. Today, I voted for a temporary extension and I remain optimistic that Congress will come together and agree on a long-term fix as we chart a path forward.” # # #

07.30.2015	SENATOR ERNST: “So a whole of government approach, and I think that’s extremely important that we remember that, that we do not have to sign this agreement and that does not necessarily mean that we will be going to war with Iran. Is that your assessment?” …. ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: “I think that there are other options besides going to war.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Armed Services Committee nomination hearing to consider the President’s nominee for the top U.S. Navy post, Admiral John M. Richardson, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) asked questions regarding the United States’ response to and implications of the Iran nuclear agreement. After asking Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Martin E. Dempsey a similar question yesterday, the Iowa Senator today asked Admiral Richardson his perspective on the President’s statement that the only alternative to the Iran nuclear agreement is war. Senator Ernst also voiced concerns with Iran’s financial gain through the agreement and their increased ability to acquire advanced weapons and equipment. The Senator from Iowa asked Admiral Richardson about his thoughts on weapons and equipment Iran might purchase and stressed the critical nature of this global security issue: “I do think it is something that we have to be ever vigilant about. This is a very serious matter that we are facing today with Iran and its potentially increased military capabilities in that region. This is not an American problem. This is not an Iranian problem. This is a worldwide problem.” Click here or on the image below to watch. FULL TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: …Mr. Chair. Thank you, Admiral, for being here today, and I do want to take special time and thank your father, your wife Dana, and your daughter Rachel for accompanying you today. And Rachel, a special shout-out to you for serving at Walter Reed right now. I have a dear friend that recently went through the amputee center, so thanks so much for all your great service as well. Admiral, in reference to the Iran nuclear agreement, the Obama Administration has continuously said, over and over again, that the alternative to the Iran nuclear agreement is war. The President has made it clear in his statement that the only alternative is war, so as I’m out visiting with other people, that’s kind of the response. It’s picked up, and people are saying “Oh, we have to go to war if we don’t sign this agreement.” In your best military judgement, do you believe that the only alternative to this nuclear agreement is war? ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: Senator, I think – my way of answering that would be that a major mission of our armed forces, the joint force, and certainly the Navy is to use all means necessary to deter that type of war, not only through preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon but also by deterring any kind of – many of the other tools that they use to disrupt activity in that region. So they’ve got considerable conventional forces, ballistic missiles, surface forces, they’ve talked about mining the Straits of Hormuz, they support terrorist organizations throughout the region. We need to use the full set of capabilities that the joint force and the Navy can deliver to deter that. And that military contribution is also just a subset of a “whole of government” approach along with our allies in the region. SENATOR ERNST: So a whole of government approach, and I think that’s extremely important that we remember that, that we do not have to sign this agreement and that does not necessarily mean that we will be going to war with Iran. Is that your assessment? ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: Ma’am, I do support a whole of government approach and – CHAIRMAN McCAIN: Admiral, you were just asked to give your personal opinion if asked for it. The Senator is asking for your opinion as to whether there are other options besides going to war with Iran. ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: I think that there are other options besides going to war. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Admiral. Thank you. And Iran’s, since we’re on that topic, Iran’s military budget is approximately 11 billion dollars per year on defense. It’s posture, however, is bolstered by a variative, asymmetric, and relatively low cost capabilities and tactics including swarming at sea, artillery rockets, ballistic missiles, and UAVs. And as you know through this agreement Iran will gain about $150 billion due to sanctions relief and the ability to purchase more advanced weapons and equipment through the lifting of the UN arms embargo. And even if a small portion of the sanctions relief money is directed towards their military capabilities in Iran what types of weapons and equipment do you believe that Iran would purchase to improve its ability to project force within the Persian Gulf? ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: Well ma’am I think that we would, as we have been throughout, be sensitive to the proliferation market and weapons. So I would be very concerned about them increasing their ballistic missiles force as well as their anti-ship cruise missiles, the mines and the surface combatants that you mentioned as well. SENATOR ERNST: Okay, well I appreciate that and I do think it is something that we have to be ever vigilant about. This is a very serious matter that we are facing today with Iran and its potentially increased military capabilities in that region. This is not an American problem. This is not an Iranian problem. This is a worldwide problem. So, I appreciate your attention to the matter. And I do look forward to supporting you in your confirmation. Thank you Admiral. ADMIRAL RICHARDSON: Thank you ma’am. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair. # # #
07.29.2015	“…for the President to outright reject everything but war is outrageous to me, and I do hope that you are able to better advise him that he needs to be careful with his language because that seems to be the rhetoric we are hearing out there is that we either go to war or we accept this deal and I reject that premise.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed for answers and clarification within the nuclear agreement with Iran at today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “Impacts of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on U.S. Interests and the Military Balance in the Middle East.” Among her questions, Senator Ernst asked Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin E. Dempsey whether he advised President Obama that the U.S. must either accept the Iran nuclear deal or go to war. General Dempsey disclosed that “at no time did that come up in our conversation nor did I make that comment.” To which, Ernst, a Lieutenant Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard, responded that “…for the President to outright reject everything but war is outrageous to me, and I do hope that you are able to better advise him that he needs to be careful with his language because that seems to be the rhetoric we are hearing out there is that we either go to war or we accept this deal and I reject that premise.” Senator Ernst voiced concerns regarding potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in relation to our country’s own inability to protect U.S. networks. Senator Ernst pointed to the recent cyber-attack on the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), and successful cyber-attacks by Iran on U.S. government employees working in nonproliferation, a number of U.S. banks, and a U.S. Marine Corps network. The Iowa Senator highlighted the critical need for the Administration to be able to ensure IAEA can protect technology and equipment designed to detect potential breaches of the nuclear agreement by Iran: “I am very concerned regarding the government's ability to detect, deter and defeat cyberattacks on our government, particularly by China, Russia and Iran… It is vital IAEA has a lock-tight ability to protect its equipment and technology vital to ensuring effective monitoring of Iranian facilities under this agreement against cyberattacks” Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Mr. Chairman and thank you, colleagues. Gentlemen, thank you for being here today. This will be one of the most significant votes that we will take as Members of Congress moving forward. So I believe it is imperative that we get this right. Not long ago the United States discovered that we had a data breach at OPM. Simple. Data, personnel records had been tapped into, so that just is laying the groundwork of where I am going next. Secretary Carter and Secretary Moniz, I am very concerned regarding the government's ability to detect, deter and defeat cyberattacks on our government, particularly by China, Russia and Iran. With respect to Iran in particular, according to the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, Iran has conducted cyberattacks on U.S. government officials involved in nuclear nonproliferation, hacking, which compromised the Marine Corps intranet, Sands Las Vegas Casino and attacks against U.S. banks. In relation to the Iran deal these attacks along with recent successful attacks against OPM leads me to have less than full confidence in our own cyber capabilities, let alone the cyber capabilities of the IAEA. It is vital IAEA has a lock-tight ability to protect its equipment and technology vital to ensuring effective monitoring of Iranian facilities under this agreement against cyberattacks. Just simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’, Secretary Carter, are you concerned regarding Iran's ability to impact the effectiveness of IAEA monitoring equipment through cyber? SECRETARY CARTER: I'm sorry. I can't give you a ‘yes’ or ‘no’ answer to that. I am very concerned about Iranian cyber activity. And you named three countries and I could go on with other ones. This is a big problem. Sadly I share the lack of confidence you have in the adequacy of our defenses, and in the Defense Department you would think with all we have paid attention to protecting our own networks that we would be secure but we're not, and we know that, and it's not just Iran but it's others as well and that's why we are trying to make investments in that area and pull up our socks in the cyber area but I can't reassure you on the cyber. SENATOR ERNST: I am very concerned about this. Secretary Moniz, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ do you share a concern this could be vulnerable? SECRETARY MONIZ: I absolutely share a concern but the IAEA has a robust technologies in terms of – SENATOR ERNST: They are much more advanced than the United States? SECRETARY MONIZ: I didn't say that, no. Cyber is tough. General Dempsey also mentioned cyber is something that keeps us up all the time, and we have to develop our capabilities. SENATOR ERNST: Fantastic. I have no confidence that we would not be able to know if there were tampering and involvement going on as we try to monitor the activities or as the IAEA tries to monitor these activities. SECRETARY MONIZ: The IAEA, Senator, is of course quite aware of this and they do have measures. SENATOR ERNST: And I hope that they improve those measures. I do believe that we are vulnerable as we have seen with our own infrastructure. And General Dempsey, we have heard some other discussions today about the choices that the President has with this agreement. Now, two weeks ago, many of our news outlets, USA Today and others, had quoted President Obama, “the choice is the Iran nuclear deal or war.” This seems to be a military decision. I understand that you advise the President on these issues. Is that what you have told the President is that we either take this deal or we go to war? GENERAL DEMPSEY: No, at no time did that come up in our conversation nor did I make that comment. SENATOR ERNST: Who is advising the President, then, that we must go to war if this deal is not signed? GENERAL DEMPSEY: I can't answer that. I can tell you that we have a range of options and I always present them. SENATOR ERNST: And I thank you for that, because I do think and I think it's imperative everybody on the panel understand that there are other options available out there, and a multitude of options. We're taught in the military about DIME, diplomatic options and information operations and military operations and economic types of sanctions and opportunities that we might have. So for the President to outright reject everything but war is outrageous to me, and I do hope that you are able to better advise him that he needs to be careful with his language because that seems to be the rhetoric we are hearing out there is that we either go to war or we accept this deal and I reject that premise. GENERAL DEMPSEY: As long as we agree that military strikes on a sovereign nation is an act of war, but there are things between here and there. SENATOR ERNST: Absolutely, I agree General Dempsey. Thank you gentlemen, very much. Thank you Mr. Chair. # # #
07.29.2015	“Bottom line, when we have an Administration that turns a deaf ear and a blind eye to the needs of men and women as they’re serving overseas in these agencies, it doesn’t do us a darn bit of good…. “…I want to make sure we’re doing the right thing by our taxpayers, and providing high quality training for our men and women, but I also want to ensure that we have an Administration who understands that when there is a time to engage, we need to allow our men and women to make that decision and engage.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) stressed the need for the Obama Administration to prioritize the security of and responsiveness to the American men and women overseas engaged in diplomatic security efforts at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing entitled, “Avoiding Duplication: An Examination of the State Department’s Proposal to Construct a New Diplomatic Security Training Facility.” The Iowa Senator asked the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security Assistant Secretary Gregory B. Starr if diplomatic security personnel received adequate training at Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, and highlighted the critical need for the Department of State to ensure the well-being and safety of diplomats. Senator Ernst explained “what is more important is that we have an Administration that prioritizes the safety of our diplomats and responds to their requests for additional security in times of need. We can have all of the wonderful enhanced training… but bottom line, if we don’t have an Administration which will allow you to engage or to use that, those techniques and tactics and whiz-gadgets out there, then this does nothing for us.” Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: I appreciate all of you today joining us on this panel. And thank you Mr. Starr, you have provided a little bit of insight on why you believe that the facility should be consolidated in Northern Virginia. But honestly, looking at the cost to our taxpayers of course we want high quality training. That’s the ultimate goal, but a billion dollars for the original plan versus 213 – at Glynco – million dollars, there is a huge, huge difference on where convenience may be nice, but we want high quality training regardless. Do you feel that what you’re receiving right now through DHS and the partnerships with Glynco is not providing that high quality training? . . . . SENATOR ERNST: Well, and thank you, I appreciate it. And I will be looking at those numbers. I do think that is important to take a good hard look at that. And just to follow up on that, I really do appreciate the fact that the Administration is taking a look at this and that they want to improve the training capacities for the men and women that we have engaged in these diplomatic security forces, but I do want to reiterate too that what is more important is that we have an Administration that prioritizes the safety of our diplomats and responds to their requests for additional security in times of need. We can have all of the wonderful enhanced training that we can give you, we can give that to you, we can give you the tips, techniques, practices, we can give you all the gizmos and gadgets – but bottom line, if we don’t have an Administration which will allow you to engage or to use that, those techniques and tactics and whiz-gadgets out there, then this does nothing for us. We want to make sure that these men and women are protected. We’ll look at the numbers and make sure that we are doing the right thing. But bottom line, when we have an Administration that turns a deaf ear and a blind eye to the needs of men and women as they’re serving overseas in these agencies, it doesn’t do us a darn bit of good. So that’s my little jab at the Administration today, is that we have had four Americans killed, I know this came out of the investigations into Benghazi. We can give you all that we give you, but if we have an Administration who refuses to engage, it doesn’t do our men and women a darn bit of good. So, you know, I appreciate that, and we’ll look into this, I want to make sure we’re doing the right thing by our taxpayers, and providing high quality training for our men and women, but I also want to ensure that we have an Administration who understands that when there is a time to engage, we need to allow our men and women to make that decision and engage. I’ll get off my soapbox. Thank you. # # #
07.28.2015	Washington, D.C. – Following Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-KY) announcement of a working group, today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) along with Senators Rand Paul (R-KY), James Lankford (R-OK) and 21 cosponsors introduced legislation to protect women’s health and defund Planned Parenthood, S.1881. This legislation follows gruesome footage showcasing Planned Parenthood’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies. Cosponsors of the bill include Senators John Barrasso (WY), Roy Blunt (MO), John Boozman (AR), Richard Burr (NC) Dan Coats (IN), Tom Cotton (AR) John Cornyn (TX), Ted Cruz (TX), Steve Daines (MT), Mike Enzi (WY), Deb Fischer (NE), James Inhofe (OK), Johnny Isakson (GA), Ron Johnson (WI), James Lankford (OK), John McCain (AZ) Mitch McConnell (KY), Jerry Moran (KS), Rand Paul (KY), David Perdue (GA), Pat Roberts (KS), Ben Sasse (NE), Tim Scott (SC), and John Thune (SD). Leader McConnell stated that the Senate will vote on this legislation before departing for an extended state work period next month. In addition to defunding Planned Parenthood, this legislation ensures the preservation of Federal funding for women’s health services including relevant diagnostic laboratory and radiology services, well-child care, prenatal and postpartum care, immunization, family planning services including contraception, sexually transmitted disease testing, cervical and breast cancer screenings, and referrals. Funds no longer available to Planned Parenthood will continue to be offered to other eligible entities to provide such women’s health care services. “As a mother and grandmother, I find this footage of Planned Parenthood’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies morally reprehensible and vile,” said Senator Ernst. “The American people are horrified by these videos as well. Simply put, this legislation ensures that funding for women’s health is protected and that taxpayer dollars will not go to Planned Parenthood.” “The calloused harvesting of body parts shows a complete disregard for human dignity. We cannot care more about animal cruelty than the inhumane treatment of children in the womb,” said Senator Lankford. “It is self evident that we should honor life and stand against the harvest of human organs. If Planned Parenthood sold unique human organs to research labs, by definition they had to be unique human lives in the womb when they were aborted. It is time for federal taxpayer funding for Planned Parenthood to end and let community health centers use that funding to provide health care services for those in greatest need.” “The horrendous videos of senior executives from Planned Parenthood discussing in callous tones and shocking detail their role in a national scandal requires a congressional response,” said Leader McConnell. “Our constituents demand it; the unborn deserve it. This legislation would ensure taxpayer dollars for women’s health are actually spent on women’s health—not a scandal-plagued political lobbying giant.” “The video footage of Planned Parenthood executives continues to raise deeply troubling questions, and, like most Americans, I am appalled by the disturbing actions these videos describe,” said Senator Blunt. “It is clear that Planned Parenthood is not the right place for any federal dollars. We will ensure every dollar taken away from Planned Parenthood will go toward women’s health care through our community health centers and other providers.” “We need to let Planned Parenthood know that the American people do not support these inhumane practices,” said Senator Coats. “I urge all Senators to support this bill and affirm that life is a sacred and precious gift that must be protected.” "Words are limiting to try to express the moral shock we feel when confronted by behavior so abhorrent as selling dead baby body parts for profit,” said Senator Cotton. “But where words fall short I’m hopeful that we can be united in action: we must put an end to the federal funding of Planned Parenthood. Arkansans’ and Americans tax dollars should not be supporting an organization that condones such activity. To truly honor the God-given rights to life and liberty enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and guaranteed by our Constitution, we should strive to guarantee those rights to the ones least able to defend themselves—the unborn." “Every member of the Senate and every member of the House should stand together and say: under no circumstances should federal taxpayer dollars, your money and my money, be sent to Planned Parenthood,” said Senator Cruz. “I commend my colleagues for introducing this bill and am honored to stand with them in this important fight. I hope we remain vigilant in preventing any group from engaging in this kind of horrifying practice.” "The alarming footage in the Planned Parenthood videos depicts inexcusable, unconscionable behavior," said Senator Daines. "These videos depict a disturbing practice as voiced by calloused Planned Parenthood executives, where the goal is protecting tissue over life and the harvesting of organs is the path to a new car. The federal government should not fund an organization with these appalling practices." “I am disgusted by these revelations and proud to join Senator Ernst in offering legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and put an immediate end to these horrific practices,” said Senator Fischer. “I am shocked at the lack of compassion for these women and their unborn babies.” “The government should not be in the practice of funding Planned Parenthood or any abortions in the first place,” said Senator Isakson. “These videos that have come to light are incredibly disturbing, and we should launch an immediate investigation into this organization’s abhorrent activities. I will continue to fight to ensure Planned Parenthood does not receive another dime from hardworking taxpayers.” “These gut-wrenching videos underscore the serious nature of the situation,” said Senator Purdue. “As a parent, and now grandparent, these actions are unthinkable. Planned Parenthood should not receive any federal funding, period. I will continue defending life and I join many Georgians and Americans in calling for an immediate investigation.” “All life is precious, and to see it treated so callously by Planned Parenthood should make every American’s heart ache,” said Senator Scott. “Taxpayer dollars should not be funding anything remotely related to such activities, and I am proud to join Senator Ernst and my other colleagues as we take this necessary step towards defunding Planned Parenthood.” “Recent reports have uncovered practices at Planned Parenthood that are both appalling and inhuman,” said Senator Thune. “We cannot stand idly by and allow federal funding to continue to flow to this organization. This legislation will continue to give Americans access to needed health services without condoning this repugnant behavior.” About the Legislation: Prohibits federal funding of Planned Parenthood Federation of America or any of its affiliate organizations.

07.26.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for a procedural measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare: “Today's measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare would have been an important step towards achieving a sustainable health care system that puts the focus back on Iowa families and individuals. “The painful effects of ObamaCare cannot be ignored; millions of Americans continue to face uncertainty over their health care, rising premiums, increased out of pocket costs and limited choice of their health care plans and doctors. “I remain committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help Iowans achieve the patient-centered health care they deserve that enhances competition, increases flexibility, constrains rising costs and ensures Americans have a voice over their own health care.” Sen. Ernst previously cosponsored similar legislation as a standalone bill introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), which authorizes full repeal 180 days after enactment in order to allow a six-month window to replace ObamaCare with patient-centered, affordable, quality solutions. # # #

07.23.2015	Resolution recognizes organization’s commitment to empowering women entrepreneurs. (Washington, DC) – U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), Chairman of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), SBC Ranking Member, led a group of bipartisan Senators to introduce a Senate Resolution honoring the National Association of Women Business Owners. “Women-owned businesses are one of the fastest-growing segments of the United States economy,” said Senator Vitter. “Empowering more women entrepreneurs and business owners is important to the economic future of the United States. On its 40th anniversary, I am proud to put forth this resolution honoring the National Association of Women Business Owners.” “I want to congratulate the National Association of Women Business Owners on 40 years of adding to the economic strength of our country by supporting women entrepreneurs and business owners. By empowering women-owned businesses, they have helped improve communities across our country and fostered women business leaders for nearly half a century,” said Senator Shaheen. “The rate at which women succeed is a strong barometer of a country’s economic and social health,” said Senator Ben Cardin, a senior member of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. “Women-owned businesses are at the forefront of job creation and innovation in America. As we celebrate forty years of impactful work by NAWBO, I look forward to continuing to ensure women-owned businesses are given tools and opportunities to thrive in this county.” “I’d like to congratulate NAWBO on their 40th anniversary,” said Senator Gardner. “NAWBO has been a key voice for women-owned businesses, and a force advocating for their interests. Women-owned businesses are a crucial and growing segment of our economy, and unless they succeed, America’s economy cannot." “Women-owned businesses are one of the fastest growing segments of our economy, and over the last 40 years, the National Association of Women Business Owners has worked to promote new opportunities for women business owners and entrepreneurs to grow their companies and create jobs,” said Senator Peters. “I’m honored to join my colleagues in recognizing the National Association of Women Business Owners’ 40th anniversary and their tremendous support of the women business owners and entrepreneurs who help strengthen our communities and grow our economy.” “A big salute from the Equality State to the National Association of Women Business Owners on your 40th anniversary,” said Senator Enzi. “Wyoming ranks near the top when it comes to fastest growth for women-owned businesses and I hope this committee will continue to improve the environment for all American businesses.” “Women-owned businesses are an important economic pillar in Hawaii, where over 42,000 women business owners create jobs and spur economic growth every day,” said Senator Hirono “The National Association of Women Business Owners, celebrating their 40th anniversary this year, provides invaluable support and resources to these entrepreneurs and has been instrumental in creating an equal footing for businesswomen across the country." “As the National Association of Women Business Owners celebrates its 40th anniversary, I’m pleased to honor female entrepreneurs in Iowa and across the country for their work to create jobs, enrich our communities and play an important role in our economy,” Senator Ernst said. “I commend NAWBO for their efforts to promote a positive environment for women focused on success in entrepreneurship and business ownership. We must continue working to ease the regulatory burdens on our small businesses and empower them to grow and thrive.” Founded in 1975, NAWBO boasts a membership of 5,000 members in sixty chapters across the United States. NAWBO’s rich resource center aims to encourage and develop women entrepreneurs through a variety of events and programs and their award-winning Institute for Entrepreneurial Development. Nationally, NAWBO advocates for over ten million woman-owned businesses employing nearly sixteen million individuals. Cosponsors of the Honoring the National Association of Women Business Owners resolution include Senators James Risch (R-Idaho), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ben Cardin (D-Md.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and Ed Markey (D-Mass.). -30-
07.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) led a bipartisan group of 49 of her fellow senators today in a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell following the release of footage by the Center for Medical Progress depicting senior Planned Parenthood Federation of America executives discussing in gruesome detail the organization’s role in the harvesting of the organs of unborn babies. In the letter, the senators draw attention to the legal, ethical, and policy issues raised by the footage and call on HHS Secretary Burwell to cooperate with ongoing and future investigations into these questions. “The footage raises a number of questions about the practices of the organization, including whether they are in compliance with federal laws regulating both the use of fetal tissue and partial-birth abortions,” the senators wrote. “In addition to questions about Planned Parenthood’s compliance with applicable federal law and medical ethics, we believe the footage prompts important policy questions surrounding the issue of abortions permitted so late in a pregnancy – sometimes even later than 5 months – that an unborn baby’s organs can be identified and harvested.” The senators also requested that the Secretary confirm the commencement or immediate initiation of “a thorough internal review of the compliance of the Department and Planned Parenthood – one of the Department’s grantees – with all relevant and applicable federal statutes, regulations, and other requirements.” Senator Joni Ernst also added in a statement, “This footage is morally reprehensible, vile, and raises a number of questions that taxpayers deserve answers to. Today, my colleagues and I are calling on HHS to cooperate with all current and future investigations into these shocking allegations. As a defender of life, I remain committed to getting these answers because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society.” The full text of the senators’ letter can be found here. The complete list of the 50 senators who signed the letter is as follows: Senator Lamar Alexander Senator Kelly Ayotte Senator John Barrasso Senator Roy Blunt Senator John Boozman Senator Richard Burr Senator Shelley Moore Capito Senator Bill Cassidy Senator Dan Coats Senator Thad Cochran Senator Bob Corker Senator John Cornyn Senator Tom Cotton Senator Mike Crapo Senator Ted Cruz Senator Steve Daines Senator Mike Enzi Senator Joni Ernst Senator Deb Fischer Senator Jeff Flake Senator Cory Gardner Senator Lindsey Graham Senator Orrin Hatch Senator John Hoeven Senator Jim Inhofe Senator Johnny Isakson Senator Ron Johnson Senator James Lankford Senator Mike Lee Senator Joe Manchin Senator John McCain Senator Mitch McConnell Senator Jerry Moran Senator Rand Paul Senator David Perdue Senator Rob Portman Senator James Risch Senator Pat Roberts Senator Mike Rounds Senator Marco Rubio Senator Ben Sasse Senator Tim Scott Senator Jeff Sessions Senator Richard Shelby Senator Dan Sullivan Senator John Thune Senator Thom Tillis Senator Pat Toomey Senator David Vitter Senator Roger Wicker # # #
07.21.2015	Tax Credit Helps Small Businesses Provide Differential Pay to Reservists Called to Active Duty WASHINGTON, DC – The Senate Finance Committee today approved a package of tax credit extensions that included a 2-year extension of a provision in a bipartisan bill introduced by U.S. Senators Gary Peters (D-MI) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) that supports small businesses that provide differential pay to military reservists and National Guard members called to serve on active duty. There are over 820,000 reservists and National Guard members in the United States. Peters is a former Lt. Commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, and Ernst continues to serve as a Lt. Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. “Military reservists in Michigan and across the country should never have to worry about whether their families will struggle to make ends meet while they are serving on active duty,” said Senator Peters. “Our reservists stand ready to serve our country in times of need, and it is our duty to support these servicemembers, their families and their employers who want to do the right thing. I’m pleased that the Senate Finance Committee has advanced legislation to extend this tax credit that will lessen the financial strain on military families and the small businesses that provide differential pay.” “This commonsense tax credit benefits our small businesses, military families, and local communities in Iowa and nationwide by lessening the burden on employers who go the extra step to provide differential pay for our National Guard and Reserve servicemembers serving on Active Duty,” said Senator Ernst. “While I would prefer a longer term extension, I am encouraged that the Senate Finance Committee included a two year extension of this small business tax credit in today’s markup. This is a critical step forward for our men and women who deserve the financial peace of mind.” In March, Peters and Ernst introduced the Military Reserve Small Business Jobs Act of 2015 to extend the differential pay tax credit for five years to support small businesses and help provide financial security for reservists and their families while on active duty. Peters and Ernst recently sent a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Finance Committee urging them to extend this expired tax provision and provide more certainty for small businesses and reservists who count on this financial support. Originally enacted in 2008 as part of the bipartisan Heroes Earnings Assistance and Relief Tax Act (HEART Act), the employer wage credit for activated military reservists provides a tax credit for 20 percent of the differential salary payment for small businesses with fewer than 50 employees. For an employee who earns $3,000 per month from their small business employer, but is paid $2,000 per month while on active duty, the provision would provide a $200 credit for the small business to pay the employee’s $1,000 wage difference. The differential pay tax credit is supported by the Reserve Officers Association, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States and the National Military Family Association. # # #
07.20.2015	WASHINGTON – Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) today led a bipartisan group of 36 senators in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to increase the proposed volumes it set for biodiesel production under the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). “While the proposal is a positive step for biodiesel, we remain concerned that the proposed biodiesel volumes for 2016 and 2017 fail to adequately recognize the domestic biodiesel industry’s production capacity and its ability to increase production,” the senators wrote to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. “Biodiesel is the first EPA-designated advanced biofuel under the RFS to reach commercial scale production nationwide. It is exceeding the goals that Congress envisioned when it created the RFS with bipartisan support in 2005, while creating jobs, generating tax revenues, reducing pollution, and improving energy security. We urge you to support continued growth in the domestic biodiesel industry by making reasonable and sustainable increases in the biodiesel volumes for 2016 and 2017 in the final rule.” The senators noted that the EPA’s prior delays in setting biodiesel volumes led to tremendous uncertainty and hardship for U.S. biodiesel producers and thousands of their employees, causing reduced production and even shutdowns, leading to layoffs and lost economic productivity. Also, the agency’s decision earlier this year to allow imports from Argentinean renewable fuel producers to participate in the RFS must be considered, and biodiesel volumes must be set at high enough levels to prevent displacement of domestic production, the senators wrote. The EPA’s proposed volumes for 2014 through 2017 are expected to become final by November 30, giving the agency an opportunity to increase them before then. The public comment period on the current proposal closes July 27. The full list of senators who signed the letter is below. The text of the senators’ letter is available here.

07.17.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C.- Senators Mazie K. Hirono and Joni Ernst (R-IA) are fighting to increase access to telemedicine for Medicare patients in new legislation introduced this week. The bipartisan Telemedicine for Medicare (TELE-MED) Act, is a bill that would allow Medicare patients to seek care from Medicare doctors across state lines through telemedicine services. "As our country confronts a looming physician shortage, those of us in Hawaii are already feeling the pain of a lack of access to medical care in rural and underserved communities,” said Senator Hirono. “Hawaii residents often are forced to drive for hours to see their physician or spend thousands of dollars to fly to Oahu and the mainland to seek care from a specialist. For seniors, these long travel times are difficult and even impossible. The TELE-MED Act will help to eliminate the financial and physical stress of seeking quality medical care by allowing seniors access to Medicare-participating physicians from the convenience of their home or local doctor’s office." “Iowans sent me to Congress to focus on patient-centered health care, and this bipartisan legislation works to address Iowa’s rural health care challenges,” said Senator Ernst. “The TELEmedicine for MEDicare Act utilizes advancements within medical technology to make doctors readily available by expanding where they can provide telemedicine services to Medicare recipients. This legislation is a step in the right direction to provide the kind of health care alternatives Iowans deserve.” The TELE-MED Act is supported by the Health IT Now Coalition, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the U.S. Chamber, Verizon, and the Parkinson’s Action Network. “The success of our healthcare system relies on how well we adapt to the modern era, which allows us to utilize new and innovative technology to patients’ unique needs,” said Joel White, Executive Director of the Health IT Now Coalition. “The TELE-MED Act is a crucial step forward toward achieving this goal by removing state barriers to providing telehealth services to patients.” Representatives Devin Nunes (R-CA) and Frank Pallone (D-NJ) have introduced a companion bill in the House of Representatives. In addition to expanding where Medicare providers could provide telemedicine services, The TELE-MED Act would require the Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary to issue guidance to States to define the term “telemedicine services” to solicit stakeholder input, require the HHS Secretary to submit a report to Congress on plans to develop and expand the use of technology to expand patient access to Medicare health programs, and protect State laws and jurisdiction related to negligence and medical malpractice. # # #
07.16.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for passage of the Every Child Achieves Act (ECAA): “As a mother and grandmother, I believe education is an issue best handed at the local level – by Iowans – and not Washington bureaucrats that employ a top down, one size fits all approach. “The long overdue reforms to fix No Child Left Behind in the Every Child Achieves Act will restore local control, remove the weight of the federal government on our school systems, and empower parents, local educators and school boards to make the best decisions for their students. I voted for several amendments that would have further strengthened local control and improved the bill, and although they were unfortunately not adopted, these should be ideas we continue to push forward. Ultimately, this legislation affords greater flexibility for our individual school systems to design and implement their education and accountability standards as they see fit. “The Every Child Achieves Act is a positive step forward to ensure our students have access to quality education now, and for future generations.” About the Every Child Achieves Act Ends federal accountability standards created in No Child Left Behind Restores state authority to handle and define teacher evaluation and quality Ensures federal Common Core-like requirements cannot be imposed from Washington # # #
07.14.2015	“Iran’s quarter century effort to obtain a nuclear weapon and long-standing support for terrorism will not subside overnight. We also cannot trust that Iran is complying with limitations on their nuclear program without stronger inspections. It is paramount that we are able to verify and enforce every aspect of Iranian compliance in order to confront and contain their nuclear ambitions.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today released the following statement on the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran: “The 60 days will allow Congress and the American people to thoroughly scrutinize every aspect of the agreement with Iran. While I am still reviewing the details, I have very serious concerns that this agreement concedes too much to Iran and will ultimately strengthen the pathway for Iran to achieve a nuclear weapon. The bottom line, Iran must never be allowed to develop a single nuclear weapon – not now or at any point in the future. “Iran is the world’s leading sponsor of terrorism and has aligned themselves with groups that are hostile to the United States and our allies. Therefore, we cannot afford premature sanction relief which has helped to curb Iranian support of terrorist activity. We cannot trust that Iran won’t use additional resources as an opportunity to fund terrorism and other proxy groups which pose a direct threat to our allies and national security interests in the region. “Iran’s quarter century effort to obtain a nuclear weapon and long-standing support for terrorism will not subside overnight. We also cannot trust that Iran is complying with limitations on their nuclear program without stronger inspections. It is paramount that we are able to verify and enforce every aspect of Iranian compliance in order to confront and contain their nuclear ambitions. “Iran is one of the greatest threats to peace and stability of our time, and we have a duty to stand behind our friends and closest ally in the region – Israel. The stakes are too high for the United States to risk any mistakes in an agreement with Iran. I look forward to carefully reviewing this deal in Congress to make sure we preserve our own national security and the pursuit of stability in the world.” In May, Senator Ernst voted in favor of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act which certifies that no congressional sanction can be lifted during the review period and safeguards congressional oversight of Iranian compliance. Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of the legislation and previously spoke on the Senate floor calling for congressional approval of any final deal with Iran. Watch here. Senator Joni Ernst serves as Iowa’s junior Senator. She is a member of the Armed Services Committee; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; and Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. # # #

07.08.2015	“…out of the millions and millions of birds that have been infected and destroyed, two thirds of those birds were from Iowa… I just want to reemphasize it’s not only devastating for these producers, but their employees, those employees’ families, and the communities that are supported by these producers.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) questioned the panel at a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing entitled, “Stopping an Avian Influenza Threat to Animal and Public Health” on the need for a plan to prevent a future outbreak of such magnitude. The Iowa Senator also highlighted the devastating impact of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) on Iowa poultry farmers, producers, and the surrounding communities. Those testifying before HSGAC included Dr. John Clifford, Deputy Administrator of the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); Dr. Anne Schuchat, Director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Mr. Chris Currie, Director of Homeland Security and Justice within the U.S. Government Accountability Office; Dr. Jack Gelb, Director of the Avian Biosciences Center at the University of Delaware’s College of Agriculture and Natural Resources; and Mr. Scott Schneider, President of The Wisconsin Poultry and Egg Association and Owner of Nature Link Farm. The HSGAC hearing comes on the heels of yesterday’s Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing entitled, “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: The Impact on the U.S. Poultry Sector and Protecting U.S. Poultry Flocks”. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Carper, and to our witnesses today, thanks so much. I spent some time with Dr. Clifford yesterday as we met in the Agriculture Committee and discussed a number of these issues as well. I do want to recognize we do have a turkey producer from Iowa in our audience today, Mr. Moline thanks for joining us again today, good to have you here. Iowa was hit extremely hard. If you look, a number of us here up at the – I have a little map here, and you can’t really see Iowa too well. Because out of the millions and millions of birds that have been infected and destroyed, two thirds of those birds were from Iowa. So our poultry, our turkeys, have been infected quite heavily. And so this has been a concern for us for a number of months now. And the economic impact to Iowa will be about $1 billion, very significant. So, Mr. Schneider, I sympathize with you very much. A number of our producers have gone through the exact same thing. I just want to reemphasize it’s not only devastating for these producers, but their employees, those employees’ families, and the communities that are supported by these producers, so thank you for being here today and sharing your story. I appreciate that very much. Dr. Clifford, I would like to go back and visit a little bit more about the vaccination process, we talked about it a little bit yesterday. Is the USDA working on the vaccination process, if you could explain a little bit about the process, where we are with that. I know a number of groups will support vaccinations, some will not. What we want to do is ensure that we are working with trade partners as well. So if you could talk about our trade partners, that would be very helpful. DR. CLIFFORD: Thank you Senator Ernst. Yes, what we’re doing is developing actually a vaccine bank. We intend to go out for a request for proposals soon, to ask companies to bid on that. We have several companies that are in the process of developing vaccines. And, we believe that we will have a vaccine bank available sometime this fall, it may be late fall, depending upon the companies’ ability to get that vaccine manufactured. It’s a tool in the toolbox that, as Dr. Gelb said, that we have to use if we decide it’s the right thing to do in a particular situation. So we’re working on those protocols and we’ll be reaching out this summer to our trading partners to encourage our trading partners under these conditions to not shut off trade. And if we are successful, than that will help us to be able to utilize that one tool, because right now if we use that tool in our toolbox, they will shut us off and we will lose potentially up to $3 or $4 billion additionally in trade. And they’re not talking about a partial shutoff; they’re talking about an entire country shutoff. So, that’s why we have the different - I understand the turkeys and the turkey production, and the use and want to use those – I can understand the layers and especially outdoor or cage free birds, so you’ve got these different groups from the broilers to the genetics groups that you don’t want it used because they impact trade. And we’re trying to balance this, we’re trying to get our trading partners to support its use in a limited way, where it makes sense. An example of use would be in, for example, turkey flocks in Minnesota, that have a very close proximity to a lot of lakes and a lot of potential wild waterfowl. SENATOR ERNST: Very good, no I appreciate that very much. And Dr. Gelb, you had mentioned that of course the growers, there is an indemnity fund, but some of the growers are not seeing the funds flowing their direction. Do you know of any mechanism where we would be able to follow those dollars and find out – we do want to make sure that if the growers are entitled to a portion of that indemnity payment that they are receiving that. Do you know of any mechanism that we might be able to engage for follow-up? DR. GELB: Yes, this is a little bit out of my area, but working with our local trade association, the Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc., and speaking with William Satterfield, the Director of that organization, I think he, for example could be a better – could give a better answer on this, but my understanding is – I indicated earlier that indemnities for contract growers, and there are many contract growers in this country where they don’t own the birds, they provide the facilities, the heat, the ventilation basically to grow them, but the birds themselves belong to a poultry company. Frequently, those indemnities they just go to the poultry company. Some of them will, some of the companies will then share some of the indemnity funds, with the contract grower. So this is kind of a contract grower issue, and I mentioned also the interest and current proceedings now in thinking about moving forward with an insurance program that growers could purchase where those funds would go directly to them rather than to the company. So, yeah, Senator you bring up an excellent question and I’m not sure I’m really the best one to address it. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, well I think – thank you for raising the issue. And just one parting point, and I know Mr. Currie you work with Emergency Management. And as we discussed yesterday in the Agricultural Committee, Iowa did have plans in place should this happen. We had a number of landfills that were willing to accept the carcasses of the birds after they were virus free. But I tell you, even the best laid plans can go awry, because we had really kind of an uprising amongst the people along those landfills and around those routes that said how do we know that our birds won’t be hit by this virus by moving the birds to these landfills. So it was a great concern with the people of Iowa that we weren’t affecting additional farms out there. So even the best laid plans cannot go the way they intended. Thank you very much to our panel for being here today, we appreciate it. Thank you Chairman and Ranking Member. # # #
07.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing entitled, “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: The Impact on the U.S. Poultry Sector and Protecting U.S. Poultry Flocks,” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) highlighted the devastating harm that the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), commonly known as the bird flu, has had on farmers across Iowa and the Midwest. During the first panel, Senator Ernst asked Dr. John R. Clifford, Deputy Administrator to the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) about processes put in place to assist producers affected by the bird flu in the state of Iowa.

07.07.2015	“…considering the fall of the most western part of Iraq to ISIS, that didn't trigger a decision point on the part of the Iraqi government and its commitment to Iraq…I'm not sure what else the Iraqi government needs to fail at before the Administration changes its strategy and how we support our willing partners in Iraq, the Kurdish Peshmerga, they are willing partners. They are. And I think we need to do more for them.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Armed Services Committee hearing entitled, “Counter-ISIL (Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) Strategy,” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter and General Martin E. Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on the urgent need to directly arm the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga, our critical partner in the fight against ISIS. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said early in the hearing “when we provide arms to the Kurds we do it with the consent of the Iraqi government in order to indicate that we support the idea of a single Iraqi government in Baghdad, but we also want the Kurds in the fight and armed and that has not delayed our arming of the Kurds.” Senator Ernst later highlighted the inconsistent answers on the timely support provided the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces, explaining “the President now has come out and said that we will be arming them in an expedited manner… If there were no delays, we don't need to be expediting the process.” In May, Senators Ernst and Boxer (D-CA) introduced legislation which would allow the Obama Administration to directly supply weapons to the Kurds, while remaining in communication with the Iraqi government. The Administration is not required to utilize this authorization, but this option would be at their disposal to respond to ISIS, who is gaining momentum on the battlefield. The Iraqi Kurds are the key partners in defeating ISIS, maintaining an inclusive and unified Iraq, and providing key humanitarian assistance to nearly two million people. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Secretary and Chairman for being with us today. I appreciate your efforts in this area. And Secretary Carter, I would like to start with you because right now I am very confused. You had stated earlier and then you affirmed to Senator Ayotte that we are directly arming the Kurds in consultation with the Iraqi government. Would you state that again, please sir? SECRETARY CARTER: Yeah, although you are using the word directly and she used the word directly and I did, too. But let me just be clear about that which is we do it in a way that doesn't delay the shipments and doesn’t narrow down the shipments at all but is by, through, and with the government of Iraq. We’re sticking with that principle not because we don’t want to help the Kurds and we don’t want to help them in a timely way, but because we also want to stick up for the principle of multisectarianism. So that is the reason. But we’re insistent that it not lead to delays. And as I said I spoke to Mr. Barzani when he was over here, and make sure he's getting the right kind of equipment not just from us, but the Germans and the others are arming him, in a timely manner. And they are getting that equipment and they’re performing extremely well with it. We should see if the Chair wants to add anything about the method of arming. SENATOR ERNST: So we are arming the Kurds, it's not being delayed, I know that was stated earlier, that there are no significant delays, because I do want to emphasize that as you know over the last several months my colleagues, a number of my colleagues and I have been working on legislation to directly arm the Kurds in consultation with the Iraqi government. And I know that you and Secretary Kerry also had very strongly worded letters to the Chairman of this Committee emphasizing that we should not be directly arming the Kurds in consultation with the Iraqi government because there were no delays. And yet the President now has come out and said that we will be arming them in an expedited manner. Well, if there were no delays, I don't understand why now we need an additional you know, several hundred members of our armed services on the ground in Iraq and that we are expediting the process. If there were no delays, we don't need to be expediting the process. So I just needed to clarify that because it was stated a number times that we were directly arming the Kurds, which Secretary Kerry had said last year he doesn't have the authority, the President doesn't have the authority to do. I still believe we need to be directly arming them in consultation with the Iraqi government. Following the fall of Ramadi, General Dempsey, you stated that if the Kurds fail to take measures to be more inclusive with Sunnis, Kurds, or other groups, U.S. support for the central government could be curtailed. And sir, considering the fall of the most western part of Iraq to ISIS, that didn't trigger a decision point on the part of the Iraqi government and its commitment to Iraq – or I'm not sure what else the Iraqi government needs to fail at before the Administration changes its strategy and how we support our willing partners in Iraq, the Kurdish Peshmerga, they are willing partners. They are. And I think we need to do more for them. We cannot defeat ISIS in Iraq by continuing to beg, hope, and pray that the sectarian Iraqi government, which is still overshadowed, we heard it a number times, by previous Prime Minister Maliki in Iran. We don't think there will vigorously defend the Iraqi people equally. I don't believe they will. But we talked also about being more inclusive, that was mentioned again. More inclusive. I hear this time and time again. But what I would like a definition of what does ‘more inclusive’ look like? And how do we measure ‘more inclusive’? Gentlemen, if you would address that, please. SECRETARY CARTER: I would begin by noting the words of Prime Minister Abadi when he was here. I think he used the word ‘decentralized Iraq’. That is one in which there is a central government in Baghdad, an integral state of Iraq. But there is substantial opportunity for self-determination around the country among Sunnis, among Shias, and among Kurds. It seems to me that's a wise way of approaching what multisectarianism means. I think a government in Baghdad that allows the different parties there a degree of self-determination to maintain security within their own territory and to govern themselves, share in things like the oil wealth of the country and so forth, that is what he says he is for. And that's the way he described it when he was here in Washington to all of that. And that is, in my judgment, certainly better than the alternative which is sectarian disintegration. Which could still occur in Iraq, but I think we all looking into that abyss know what resides there. It's further violence for the citizens of Iraq and further opportunity for groups like ISIL that don't -- aren't preoccupied with the long-term welfare of the territories they occupy. They want to use them for further violence. So, that is Prime Minister Abadi’s definition, and I think we are trying to support him in his aspiration to make good on that definition. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. General, anything to add there? GENERAL DEMPSEY: Just militarily what we will be watching for in terms of the intentions of the government of Iraq and its control over groups that are not directly responsive to the Minister of Defense is whether there's retribution. Whether they will allow – it was at that Tikrit that I was speaking about, Senator, as these families come back to Tikrit after it was recaptured, we are watching and it's worth watching on whether they are able to return to their homes or not. I think the same will be true once Ramadi is recaptured. And we'll probably be watching how the campaign in Fallujah unfolds to ensure that the popular mobilization forces propagate a campaign that's not characterized by retribution and dramatic collateral damage. Those are all things to watch carefully. SENATOR ERNST: I think we have willing partners there and we need to assist those willing partners. One further comment to just, very briefly is you stated you haven't seen a request list from the Kurds on the type of equipment and arms that they need, is that correct? SECRETARY CARTER: No, I have seen such requests. We honored such requests. We shipped a lot of equipment. And I should once again repeat it’s not just the United States. There are a number of countries that are equipping the Kurds. And, in some cases they prefer the equipment of other countries. For example German anti-tank weapons. That's absolutely fine with us. The Germans are providing those. SENATOR ERNST: That's one thing I know that President Barzani presented to us during his visit with the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that and they have provided us with a list of equipment. SECRETARY CARTER: They did, we discussed exactly the same list. SENATOR ERNST: Very good. SECRETARY CARTER: And I have discussed it with others who are, for example, the German Defense Minister I mentioned, when I was in Germany a couple weeks ago. Her commitment to do exactly the same, and they have done a great job of equipping the Kurds. And that's an example of a competent ground force. That also governs within the territory that it controls. That's really the -- what we are looking for in that entire region. Going to be hard to get, but it's what we are looking for. SENATOR ERNST: They are there and I know they are willing, so thank you gentlemen very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair. # # #
06.26.2015	“…serious concerns regarding OPM’s management of its new IT project… I can’t overstate the importance of project management, particularly with respect to projects as complex and important as this.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – During the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing yesterday entitled, “Under Attack: Federal Cybersecurity and the OPM Data Breach”, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) cited failures due to poor project management as it relates to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach, and pressed the witnesses on OPM’s management of its new IT improvement project identified by the Inspector General’s flash audit. In addition, Ernst also raised questions over how many more people could have been potentially impacted by the data breach. Those testifying before HSGAC included: Katherine Archuleta, Director of the Office of Personnel Management; Tony Scott, U.S. Chief Information Officer of the Office of Personnel Management; Andy Ozment, Ph.D., Assistant Secretary, Office of Cybersecurity and Communications for the National Protection and Programs Directorate, U.S. Department of Homeland Security; and Patrick E. McFarland, Inspector General for the Office of Personnel Management. In her questioning, Senator Ernst highlighted the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act, which she introduced alongside Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), and passed out of committee earlier this week. The bipartisan legislation safeguards taxpayer dollars by holding the federal government accountable to adopt the program management standards, practices and procedures of high-performing, private sector organizations. In response to Sen. Ernst’s questioning, Committee Chairman Ron Johnson (R-WI) pointed out “we spend $80 billion per year on IT systems in the federal government, so this is a problem of management, it’s a problem of prioritization.” Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Ranking Member, thank you Mr. Chair, very much. This is a significant data breach, we’ll talk about this all the day, but bottom line: we need to see some action on this immediately. Mr. McFarland, thank you for being here today. We’ve heard in your testimony, we have seen your flash audit alert that was released by your office earlier this month. And in that audit alert, you did highlight your serious concerns regarding OPM’s management of its new IT project, the improvement project. And I can’t overstate the importance of project management, particularly with respect to projects as complex and important as this particular project. In fact, just yesterday, in this committee we did approve a bill introduced by Senator Heitkamp and myself, which will focus on improving program management in the federal government. And I would be interested to learn from you just a little bit more detail about your concerns to OPM’s management of this IT improvement project. HON. McFARLAND: Yes Senator, I think a good start here and a good example would be the fact that anyone doing a capital asset in the IT world, at least my understanding, and I could be corrected if I’m wrong, by OMB’s regulation, is to do a business plan known as Exhibit 300. That has not been done by OPM, yet I do hear in the last few days, information that OPM and OMB are working very closely together, and I don’t doubt that. But my concern is, something as simple and straightforward as a business plan, if it’s not completed, and we hear it is completed by OPM, and then our documentation that we’ve requested shows that it’s not been done, I’d like to find out - I don’t necessarily want to use this forum for my question, but it goes to the heart of your question, is what has happened with this business plan, has it been done or not? SENATOR ERNST: And that to me is a significant failure, significant failure that the fact that something so simple as a business plan cannot be produced for this project, which left millions of federal employees and their data at risk. So, Ms. Archuleta, I do want to follow up, because it sounds like now there is a request for additional dollars. And, what we want to ensure is that if the dollars are allocated, that it will actually be put towards this project, and that we do see results, and that it is managed wisely. I can’t say that dollars we’ve put forth so far have been utilized, maybe to the best of taxpayers’ interests. So if you could address that, just give us that assurance that this will be handled. HON. ARCHULETA: Thank you, thank you for that question. In his flash audit, the Inspector General recommended that the completion of a major IT business case document for fiscal year 2017, and I actually look forward to discussing with the Inspector General, the practical implications for such a document for fiscal year 2017. We are in an urgent situation. I do understand though his concerns and I’d like to assure him that all of our decisions are being tracked, documented and justified and that we’re working very closely with OMB. As I mentioned earlier, I think that the flash audit discussions need to occur between me and the IG, and we will do that. We have our staffs are meeting next Tuesday, and I’m sure Mr. McFarland and I will meet immediately following. The important thing is that we address his concerns, but I think the other thing is that we move quickly. As Tony and Andy have already described, we are in a very urgent situation, so we need to balance and make sure that we are doing all the things that IG has described, but as well, we understand the urgency of moving forward aggressively. SENATOR ERNST: I do appreciate that. But this is rather late, and in retrospect, we can’t go and take back the data that has been captured by whoever this person or entity is out there that has gotten into the system – who has breached and gotten this data. One thing that maybe we haven’t discussed yet is the fact that not only do we have millions of federal records, employee records that were breached, but I know when I filled out the applications for security clearances in the military, not only was my personal information on those forms, but I had to list references on those forms. Their information is also included in this. So we not only have millions of federal employees potentially federal employees, but all of their references’ information is there as well. How many more millions of people are we talking about? Have we alerted those people and what’s going to be done to follow up on their information as well? HON. ARCHULETA: Thank you for that question. It’s an important question and I agree with you totally, I’m as upset as you are at the fact that these documents have been breached. Here’s what we’re doing, as I mentioned in my testimony, and why I cannot give a number right now, look at, for example the background investigation. There is a lot of information in that. Some of that contains if there’s a name, some of that does contain PII, some of it doesn’t. And so as we’re analyzing the type of data is in these files, those are the things we’re looking at. Because we care as deeply as you do that we notify those that have been affected by this, and understand that those who have not been affected by this through even though you may have mentioned them in your efforts, FS86, we’re doing a complete analysis of that, and that’s why I’m very hesitant of that, not to put out a number until we are absolutely sure we have looked at the whole range of possible impact. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you today for – yes sir. HON. McFARLAND: Senator, if I may make another point. Is that all right. The funding is a prime example of our concern; it’s all over the board. The situation basically is, in 2015, OPM’s dealing with 32 million dollars, and in 2016, they’re asking for another appropriation of $21,000. In the meantime, DHS is at 5 million, and the other 67 million is going to come, I believe, from what I understand, program areas at OPM. That’s so sporadic, that just doesn’t hold water from our perspective. Funding source ahead of time, for the full program. It’s like playing catch-up and the other part of that is that OPM program offices are going to be tasked to pay for that with our program office funds, for the migration of each of their systems, instead of having a big picture of funding, very clear for everybody. The OMB is very much in favor of having transparency, and this just avoids transparency. It subsumes the money coming from program offices instead of a dedicate source of funding. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you I think that’s an exceptional point. Thank you for allowing the additional response. # # #
06.26.2015	Washington, D.C.—Lawmakers today proposed a new approach to tackling the problems posed by outdated regulations. U.S. Senators Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, introduced S. 1683, the Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome—or “SCRUB”—Act of 2015. This bill establishes a commission-based procedure to reduce the federal regulatory burden on the economy. “The accumulated weight of federal regulations is holding back job creation and hurting family budgets,” observed Sen. Hatch. “Every President since Jimmy Carter has acknowledged the need to get outdated regulations off the books. Nevertheless, both Democrat and Republican administrations have failed to make meaningful reductions in the unnecessary costs that red tape imposes on the economy. To turn this longstanding commitment of both parties into a reality, we need to take the responsibility of reviewing old regulations away from the bureaucrats that keep failing at that task. The SCRUB Act provides a powerful, fair, and proven means of achieving this common-sense, bipartisan goal.” “American households, family farms and small businesses are hampered under the current weight of federal regulations,” said Sen. Ernst. “The SCRUB Act is a common-sense proposal that enacts meaningful reforms to our federal government’s outdated and vast regulatory system, and works to ease the burden on household and small business budgets. This legislation forces Washington to stop and consider the real impact of existing major regulations felt by families in Iowa and across the country. Additionally, the SCRUB Act lays the foundation to find inclusive solutions to unlock the drivers of our economy who have been stymied by unnecessary overregulation, ease the burden on Americans’ pocketbooks, and open up new opportunities lost by a cloud of overregulation.” Unjustified Costs of Old Regulations Federal regulations now impose a burden of $1.88 trillion on the economy, according to a recent study by the Competitive Enterprise Institute. That amounts to roughly $15,000 per household, 11% of the nation’s gross domestic product, and nearly $500 billion more than individual and corporate federal income tax revenue combined. At the end of 2014, the Code of Federal Regulations contained a massive 175,000 pages of regulations in 236 volumes. Nevertheless, retrospective review efforts by administrations of both parties have consistently failed to yield meaningful reductions in the regulatory burden. In fact, one study by the American Action Forum found that the Obama administration’s retrospective review plans actually imposed $23 billion in new costs on the economy. Using Past Successes to Guide a New Approach The SCRUB Act establishes a bipartisan, blue-ribbon commission modeled on previous successes to review existing federal regulations and identify those that should be repealed to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens. The Act sets the Commission’s goal as the reduction of at least 15 percent in the cumulative costs of federal regulation with a minimal reduction in the overall effectiveness of such regulation. Upon the Commission’s review, the legislation requires that annual and final Commission repeal recommendations for presented as Joint Resolutions for expedited consideration and approval by Congress. If the Commission’s recommendations are enacted, repeal is required by law. The legislation prioritizes for review regulations that are major rules, have been in effect more than 15 years, impose paperwork burdens that could be reduced substantially without significantly diminishing regulatory effectiveness, impose disproportionately high costs on small businesses, or could be strengthened in their effectiveness while reducing regulatory costs. It also establishes additional key factors to be taken into account when identifying regulations for repeal—for example, regulations that: have been rendered obsolete by technological or market changes; have achieved their goals and can be repealed without target problems recurring; are ineffective; overlap, duplicate or conflict with other federal regulations or with state and local regulations; or impose costs that are not justified by benefits produced for society within the United States. For any given regulation, the Commission is authorized to recommend either immediate repeal or repeal through a flexible “cut-go” process, whereby agencies would have to offset the costs of new regulations by repealing Commission-identified regulations of equal or greater cost. These procedures allow speedy repeal in the most urgent cases and staggered repeal, modification, or replacement of others to assure a smooth process for agencies, affected entities, and the public. Coordinated Efforts across Capitol Hill Rep. Jason Smith (R-Mo.) has introduced H.R. 1155, companion legislation in the House of Representatives. The House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial, and Antitrust Law held a hearing on the bill on March 2nd, and the full Judiciary Committee voted to approve the legislation and send it to the House floor on March 24th. # # #
06.26.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the United States Supreme Court overturned the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the case of Obergefell v. Hodges. The ruling struck down states’ bans on same-sex marriage and refusal to recognize marriages performed in other states as a violation of a couple's Fourteenth Amendment rights. "I am disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision and its failure to recognize the freedom of our states to make their own decisions about their respective marriage laws. “While it is my personal belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, I maintain that this is an issue best handled at the state level." # # #
06.25.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Supreme Court issued a ruling in King v. Burwell. The court sided with the Obama administration and upheld the IRS regulation that provides subsidies to individuals who buy health insurance on a federal exchange setup by ObamaCare. “Today’s Supreme Court ruling does not change the fundamental reality that ObamaCare is a poorly conceived and reckless law. “As ObamaCare again finds itself under scrutiny of our highest court, it’s further affirmation that we need a workable solution for the millions of Americans who continue to face uncertainty over their health care due to this disastrous law. “I remain committed to working towards a sustainable health care system that puts the focus back on Iowa families and individuals, which is why I support repealing and replacing ObamaCare with affordable, patient centered alternatives. I will continue working to help Iowans achieve the care they deserve that enhances competition, increases flexibility, constrains rising costs and ensures Americans have a voice over their own health care.” # # #
06.25.2015	“Permanent leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General is long overdue” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, a bipartisan group of United States Senators, led by U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), sent a letter to President Barack Obama, urging him to nominate an Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as soon as possible to help rebuild the trust that was lost “through systematic failures in accountability and transparency” at the Department. In addition to Senator Baldwin, the letter was signed by U.S. Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Tom Carper (D-DE), Mike Enzi (R-WY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Gary Peters (D-MI) and Jon Tester (D-MT). “It is imperative that you nominate a permanent IG for the VA to provide stable leadership and oversight of the agency. Over the past two years, the VA has faced well-documented challenges, including the failure to provide timely health care nationwide. A permanent IG would help to address these failures and would play a critical role in auditing and evaluating VA programs, conducting health care inspections and investigating allegations of serious violations of policies and procedures by high-ranking members of the Department,” the Senators wrote. The former Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) left the position in late 2013 and Mr. Richard Griffin assumed the IG duties at the department. However, he is not serving in a permanent capacity. The absence of a permanent IG at the department has raised concerns about shortcomings in accountability and transparency at the VA. The Senators wrote to President Obama, “Providing adequate programs and services for our nation’s veterans is a one of our greatest responsibilities. We hope that you will ensure consistent management and accountability at VA by nominating a permanent IG as soon as possible.” Full text of the letter below: The President The White House Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear Mr. President: We write to urge you to nominate an Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as soon as possible to help rebuild the trust that was lost through systemic failures in accountability and transparency at the Department. On June 3, 2015, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held a hearing entitled Watchdogs Needed: Top Government Investigator Positions Left Unfilled for Years. At the hearing, a number of Senators expressed concerns about the vacant VA IG position and multiple Senators have written to you in the past urging you to nominate a permanent Inspector General for the VA. As you know, the former IG left the position in late 2013 and Mr. Richard Griffin assumed the IG duties at the agency. However, he is not serving in a permanent capacity. Simply put: permanent leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General is long overdue. At the hearing, several witnesses stressed that IGs nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate are viewed as more independent by members of Congress and the public than acting IGs. The witnesses also stated that permanent IGs are more likely to address long-term and sometimes embarrassing issues at the agency. It is imperative that you nominate a permanent IG for the VA to provide stable leadership and oversight of the agency. Over the past two years, the VA has faced well-documented challenges, including the failure to provide timely health care nationwide. A permanent IG would help to address these failures and would play a critical role in auditing and evaluating VA programs, conducting health care inspections and investigating allegations of serious violations of policies and procedures by high-ranking members of the Department. Providing adequate programs and services for our nation’s veterans is one of our greatest responsibilities. We hope that you will ensure consistent management and accountability at VA by nominating a permanent IG as soon as possible. Thank you for your attention to this important matter.

06.25.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee Hearing entitled, “Country of Origin Labeling and Trade Retaliation: What’s at state for America’s Farmers, Ranchers, Businesses and Consumers,” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced Iowa Farm Bureau President Mr. Craig Hill of Milo, Iowa, who testified on the impact and implications of the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) ruling. The Iowa Senator also highlighted the significant effect of the WTO ruling could have on Iowa as the nation’s leader in hog production. Click here or on the image below to watch. SENATOR ERNST: Mr. Chairman, and thank you Ranking Member, I appreciate this, time to give a great introduction to a great Iowan, so thank you to all of our witnesses here today. But I would like to take this time and introduce Mr. Craig Hill. The World Trade Organization’s ruling regarding the Country of Origin Labeling dispute between the United States, Canada, and Mexico is an important issue that could have a major impact on the U.S. economy and on Iowa in particular. Iowa is home to over 20 million hogs, that’s nearly 6 hogs for every person residing in Iowa. Our annual pork sales lead the nation, surpassing the next two states combined. Additionally, our state boasts almost four million cattle and calves on feed, scattered across 88 thousand farms in the state. Almost all of which are family owned. Consequently Iowa is home to a robust meat packaging industry to support all of this production. Today it is my great pleasure to introduce one of the leaders of our thriving agriculture industry. Mr. Craig Hill is a grain and livestock farmer from Milo, Iowa and since 2011 has served as president of the Iowa Farm Bureau Federation. As president, Craig serves as chairman of the board of FBL Financial Group Incorporated, a Farm Bureau Life Companies. Additionally he serves on the American Farm Bureau Board of Directors. Throughout his years with the Farm Bureau, Craig has been involved in a variety of projects, he was instrumental in the development of revenue assurance, a revenue based crop insurance program for corn and soybean farmers. He served as the first chairman of the Iowa Ag State Group, which consists of representatives from all sectors of Iowa’s agriculture. Craig is on the board of directors for the Cultivation Corridor project, which works to enhance the Ag Bioscience Economic opportunities in Iowa. He is also on the board of trustees of the Council of Agricultural Science and Technology. In addition to his successes in farm and business circles, he and his wife Patty have two children. We are excited to have someone with his depth of knowledge and range of experience in the ag industry with us here today. And Craig, it’s really great to see you again – it’s always good to have you here. I appreciate having an Iowan on the panel with the type of knowledge and expertise that you do. So thank you Craig very much for being here with us today. # # #
06.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after voting in support of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA). “Trade Promotion Authority is foundational to opening up new free trade opportunities around the world, and I am pleased to see it is one step closer to implementation. As a net exporting state, Iowa stands to directly benefit from increasing our state’s agricultural exports and reducing trade barriers for our manufacturers. TPA is key to strengthening the role of Congress in trade negotiations, fostering greater transparency so that Iowans are better informed about U.S. trade agreements, and encouraging our negotiating partners to put their best deals forward to ensure that the U.S. gets the best deals possible. “President Obama must now work with Congress to continue moving forward on a robust trade agenda. Opening up more free trade opportunities around the world is vital to Iowa’s future and the health of our national economy. I urge the President to put this trade legislation into action as soon as possible.” Senator Ernst also emphasized the importance of TPA at a press conference last month. BENEFITS OF TRADE FOR IOWA Last month, more than 70 State of Iowa leaders and job creators sent a letter to the Iowa congressional delegation to underscore the importance of international trade to Iowa’s businesses, workers, and farmers. According to the letter: In 2014, Iowa exported a record-setting $15.1 billion in manufactured goods and value-added agricultural products. Nearly 83% of these exports were from small or medium-sized businesses. Iowa farmers exported $3.58 billion in soybeans, $1.99 billion in pork, $1.71 billion in corn, and $1.04 billion in feed grain. In addition, according to the Business Roundtable: Over 448,000 jobs in Iowa – nearly one in every five jobs – depend on international trade. There are 3,367 Iowa-based companies that exported to nearly 190 countries in 2013. Our negotiating partners in the TPP and T-TIP agreements purchased $11.3 billion (64%) of Iowa goods exported in 2013. The elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers with those countries would therefore likely result in a direct benefit to Iowa’s economy. # # #
06.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, the Program Management Improvement Accountability Act, introduced by Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), passed out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously and now awaits further action in the Senate. During the committee markup, Sen. Ernst emphasized that the legislation streamlines federal government projects and safeguards taxpayer dollars. It also holds the federal government accountable to adopt the program management standards, practices and procedures of high-performing, private sector organizations. Click here to read more about the bipartisan Program Management Improvement Accountability Act of 2015. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair, Thank you Ranking Member Carper, I would like to take the time and just talk about the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act and I want to thank both of you for your leadership and assistance on this, but especially to my colleague Senator Heitkamp for also sponsoring this legislation. The Program Management Improvement Accountability Act will ensure that large programs that are being run by the federal government are cost efficient, on budget and on schedule and I think that’s very important to all of us in this committee to make sure that we are being as efficient as possible. So many of our government agencies have literally thrown away millions and millions of dollars with ineffective programs because they weren’t being watched closely, they didn’t have members that were experts on how to develop these programs and ensure they are finishing on time and on budget. So, I just want to thank you for being supportive of this [bill]. I look to working on this in the future, and ensuring that we get our government agencies back on track with these types of programs. So, thank you. CHAIRMAN JOHNSON: Thank you Senator Ernst, I appreciate your leadership on this issue. You know, there’s probably no greater need than as we look at how do we protect our IT assets in the federal government, in terms of having programs that are properly managed. It’s not millions, it’s billions of dollars that are spent ineffectively and inefficiently and we can’t afford that. So again, I appreciate that. # # #
06.19.2015	Members of the Iowa congressional delegation have added their support for Governor Terry Branstad’s request for a federal declaration of a major disaster for the state due to catastrophic losses because of the avian flu outbreak. “The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed,” the members wrote. The disease has wiped out tens of millions of birds and cost producers hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Dozens of poultry farms in the state have been hit by the disease. A copy of the text of the letter is below. A signed copy of the letter can be found here. June 19, 2015 The Honorable Barack Obama President of the United States of America The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear Mr. President: We respectfully ask that you grant the request made by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad for a declaration of a major disaster for the State of Iowa as a result of catastrophic losses due to an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) beginning on April 13, 2015, and continuing. Over 32 million birds have been culled in 18 counties, leading to numerous layoffs in the Iowa poultry and related industries. The counties of Buena Vista, Sioux, Webster, and Wright have been hardest hit by this ongoing and devastating disaster, although additional counties may be added as the outbreak spreads and additional losses are identified. The Governor determined that this incident is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the State and affected local governments to handle effectively and federal assistance is needed. Thank you for your prompt consideration of this request. Sincerely, # # #

06.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – At today’s Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing entitled, “Re-examining EPA’s Management of the Renewable Fuel Standard Program,” U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) highlighted the proven success of RFS to encourage innovation in renewable fuels, drive investment in research and development, increase consumer choice, and boost production and infrastructure critical to Iowa. Senator Ernst pressed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Air and Radiation Assistant Administrator Janet McCabe on an unanswered invitation for the EPA Administrator to visit Iowa and see the impact of the agency’s decisions firsthand. The Iowa Senator also asked Ms. McCabe for an explanation of the agency’s willingness to overlook congressional intent in setting renewable volume obligations (RVOs) within RFS.

TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Mr. Chair, thank you Ranking Member Heitkamp for this wonderful discussion we will be having this morning. I appreciate the opportunity. And thank you Ms. McCabe for joining us today. I would like to start off by saying thanks so much. We do know that you are working very hard in this area, so I appreciate that. I appreciate your testimony. And I believe personally that this is not only an economic issue, but of course a national security issue as well. This Committee does have a history of working together across the aisle on security and good governance matters, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important topic. Clean and renewable energy is a topic that everyone in America can get behind. And over the years, the RFS has proved successful at driving innovation and effective options for consumers at the pump. And, as many of you may know, Iowa leads the nation in biofuels creation, producing 3.8 billion gallons of clean burning ethanol and 230 million gallons of biodiesel, and that’s from our 2013 numbers. We are also home to two state of the art cellulosic ethanol facilities, with another coming into production later this year. Additionally, we boast retailers across the state that offer affordable ethanol and biodiesel blends to consumers. When passed by Congress, the original intent of the RFS was to create consumer choice for clean fuel, by spurring investment in research, production and infrastructure. Unfortunately, the EPA is now using the lack of infrastructure as an excuse for setting biofuels levels lower than originally mandated, which flies in the face of the law. This issue is of critical importance to the state of Iowa, as well as the nation. Ensuring our domestic energy security and promoting innovation in the next generation of biofuels is crucial as we move forward. As you may know, Ms. McCabe, in February I invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to visit Iowa and to see the impact of the delayed release of the RFS volumes. Additionally, last week, the entire Iowa delegation – Republican, Democrat – everyone, sent a letter to the Administrator urging her to hold a hearing on the RFS levels in our state. Can we expect either of these to happen? MS. McCABE: Thank you Senator. I can’t speak for the Administrator’s schedule, but I can certainly take back to her that you raised this, this morning. And her office can respond. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. MS. McCABE: In terms of the hearing, as I mentioned, we are holding a public hearing in Kansas City, Kansas. We have a regional office there. There’s great interest in this issue across the country, and it’s always a challenge for us to choose the location for the limited number of hearings that we’re able to have. And in this case, we felt that having a hearing in Kansas City was well located for many states that are very interested in this issue, and we have the support of our local office there. And we have, as of yesterday, I think we had about 250 people signed up, including a number of people from Iowa, so we’ll look forward to a very good attendance and robust attendance there. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, and if you would just please emphasize to her that that is an open invitation because we do want to see the EPA Administrator in Iowa to just experience some of the difficulties we have had with the lack of action on part of the EPA. If we could move on to infrastructure and congressional intent, in your testimony you cite lack of “available refueling infrastructure” as justification for not setting the RVOs higher. However, when Congress passed the RFS in 2005, only two types of waivers, waiver authorities were included and that was lack of supply and severe economic harm. That conference committee rejected “available refueling infrastructure,” which would have severely limited consumer choice and the ability to get more of those biofuels into the marketplace. Despite a clear direction from Congress, EPA has now decided to use “available refueling infrastructure” as a condition to waive the standard even though Congress expressly rejected that when they set the law. Can you explain why EPA is blatantly overlooking the law? MS. McCABE: Sure, I’d be happy to discuss this. And of course, this an issue on which there are many views as well. I’m happy to explain ours. The language in the statute as you observe gives two reasons for EPA to waive the standards, and the one that we’re looking at here is the one that says, “inadequate domestic supply.” And I understand that there are some activity, there was activity in finalizing those words, but in fact those words are very simple in the statute. And do not, explicitly, say exactly what that means. And is often the case, it’s EPA’s job to reasonably interpret congressional language in implementing the statute. We lay this out at some length in our proposal, and I’d be happy to share that with you if you haven’t seen it. The bottom line Senator, is that our interpretation of that term is that Congress intended for these fuels not only to be produced, but to be used. That is where the value in greenhouse gas reduction and diverse energy supply, and as you say consumer choice, comes. And so when you have a situation where the fuels cannot in fact be delivered to consumers on the time frame that was set out in the statute, and Congress provided this waiver authority, we believe it’s a reasonable interpretation for us to reduce the volumes to a level that still will comply with Congress’ intent to drive the fuels. This was a big thing that Congress did in the RFS. It was calling for big and significant change and the program stretches out over a number of years. And in order to change a system in this dramatic a way, it is taking time. As we believe that looking over the history of this program in the last few years and what we can project forward, to set the standards at the statutory volumes would simply not be appropriate. There is too far a way to go. And so the waiver provision is there for EPA to use in its considered judgment to set ambitious but responsible levels. SENATOR ERNST: I thank you. I know my time has expired. I would argue that we are caught in a very vicious cycle with the producers not knowing what that volume will be, so we actually delayed production and research, and the furthering of those types of fuels. So without the standards being set, we don’t know where to go. So I just continue to state we need reliable energy sources for all of our consumers. We would like them to make that choice. But thank you very much, Mr. Chair. # # #
06.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after passage of the Senate’s Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The legislation will now head to conference between the House and the Senate. “The bipartisan FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act prioritizes what is needed, providing our men and women with the necessary reforms and resources to protect our national security while eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending. “It is critical that we uphold our commitment to all service members, veterans and their families. The NDAA achieves this priority through several means, including improving the retirement system and benefits that are offered. Furthermore, we must also ensure that our service members receive the respect, protection and care they deserve which is why I have been working on and support additional reforms to strengthen policy for prevention, victim support and to stop retaliation in sexual assault cases. The FY 2016 NDAA incorporates further improvements that build on previously implemented provisions to ensure progress and the pursuit of swift justice. Any type of sexual assault or abuse hurts the victim as well as the integrity of a military unit and that’s a significant problem; one in which I take incredibly personally. I remain committed to more concerted efforts to prevent these attacks in the first place by working to change the culture. “The NDAA also outlines the right priorities and puts our military on a strong path forward – ensuring our men and women have the tools they need, placing investment in new technologies amid a surging cyber warfare, fixing a broken acquisition system, and eliminating wasteful and unnecessary spending. “Additionally, this NDAA includes several important amendments that I introduced and which were added during the Senate Armed Services Committee markup such as adding processes to ensure the VA is proactive in its outreach to veterans suffering from mental health issues; urging the Administration to provide the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment needed to combat ISIS without delay; and ensuring that federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule, among many other critical measures. “I will continue working with my colleagues to ensure NDAA becomes law, which is central to our national security and includes long overdue reforms to make the Department of Defense more effective and efficient.” Summary of Ernst Amendments Included in NDAA: An amendment to improve the Clay Hunt SAV Act pilot program by requiring outreach of the VA’s community-based veteran peer support network to our wounded, ill, and injured service members, as well as all service members within 180 days of leaving service. This amendment will ensure the VA will be proactive, instead of reactive, with its outreach to those who have sacrificed for our nation on this important mental health pilot program. An amendment, for the next five years, to provide new or current leases on Army Ammunition Plants, under the Army’s ARMS initiative, the option of extending a 25-year lease for an additional 25-year period. This amendment will attract and retain greater investment, reduce facility sustainment cost, and provide a boost to some local communities - including the Des Moines County Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. An amendment to require, within a year of enactment of this legislation, a joint report to the Senate Armed Services Committee from the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy, a plan to jointly modernize Army and Marine Corps small arms during a 15-year period. This amendment seeks to reduce duplication of efforts between the services, potentially realize cost savings in developing common small arms weapons and technology, and improve the committee’s oversight of the modernization strategies of both of the branches of service whose primary mission it is to fight and win our nation’s land conflicts. An amendment to instill the sense of the Senate on the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq, including Iraqi Kurdistan, and the security and stability of the region and the world. It also shares the sense that the US, in coordination with our coalition partners, provide without undue delay—the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the heavy weapons and equipment, and training necessary to defeat ISIS. This amendment reminds us that ISIS’s leaders have stated they intend to target our Homeland and American citizens, and recognizes the long-term and successful partnership between Iraqi Kurds and the US military during the Iraq War. An amendment to require the DoD to submit a report on ISIS, al-Nusra, and other terrorists group lines of communication through countries bordering Syria, and the threat posed by these lines of communication to the Homeland, our men and women in uniform, DoD installations, and diplomatic facilities located in Europe and Middle East. An amendment, cosponsored by Senators Inhofe and Ayotte, to permanently establish the National Guard State Partnership Program and require the DoD Comptroller to submit a report on establishing a central fund to manage the program under DoD. An amendment to bring much needed improvement to program and project management within the acquisition process at the DoD to ensure federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule. It takes the best practices from high performing organizations in the private sector and implements them at DoD, and it does without impacting current organizational structures or requiring additional resources. This amendment makes it possible for the first time to pinpoint and identify the appropriate personnel responsible for these programs by establishing standards and policies for DoD that are in accordance with nationally accredited standards and guidance for program and project management. # # #
06.15.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The entire Iowa delegation, led by Congressman David Young, today pressed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to host a public hearing in Iowa on the proposed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs). The EPA's long delay in issuing RVOs for 2014, 2015, and 2016, and its decision to deviate from the levels set by Congress has created uncertainty for the biofuels industry and stifled investment. Iowa produced nearly 3.8 billion gallons of clean burning ethanol and 230 million gallons of biodiesel in 2013, but instead of recognizing the importance of Iowa's role as a renewable fuel leader, the EPA uses flawed justification to defend these proposed levels, especially related to ethanol. This hurts producers and consumers in Iowa, and all across the country. "Unfortunately, despite having 18 months to listen to stakeholders and consider comments, the EPA's proposed RVOs fall short. Thus, we strongly encourage you to add a public hearing in Iowa that would enable EPA officials to hear from Iowans who work in and contribute to the biofuels industry," the Members of Congress wrote. "Iowa industry leaders, farmers, retailers and consumers are well positioned to provide valuable information and substantive feedback on how the proposed RVOs will negatively impact the agricultural and biofuels industries, consumer choice at the pump, and future investments in 2nd generation renewable fuels and infrastructure." The Members of Congress hope the EPA will take this request seriously, as it should fully understand the implications of its rulemaking. A copy of the letter can be found here. # # #
06.15.2015	“This bipartisan amendment…provides temporary authority for the president—in consultation with the Iraqi government—and I say again—in consultation with the Iraqi government—to provide weapons directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS should the administration choose to do so.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) spoke on the Senate floor, urging her Senate colleagues to support the bipartisan amendment she authored alongside Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), to grant temporary, emergency authority for the President to provide weapons and training directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces who are a critical partner in the fight against ISIS. This legislation affirms the Administration’s current policy to supply weapons to the Kurds, while remaining in communication with the Iraqi government. The Administration is not required to utilize this authorization, but this option would be at their disposal to respond to ISIS, who is gaining momentum on the battlefield. The Iraqi Kurds are the key partners in defeating ISIS, maintaining an inclusive and unified Iraq, and providing key humanitarian assistance to nearly two million people. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT Mr. President, as we continue to fight against ISIS and their radical allies, I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the Ernst-Boxer Amendment which provides authority for direct assistance to a critical partner in that fight—the Iraqi Kurds. Defeating ISIS is critical to maintaining an inclusive and unified Iraq, and the Iraqi Kurds are the key to that goal—and to help improve the humanitarian crisis in the region through their support and protection of over 1.6 million displaced persons from Iraq and Syria. This bipartisan amendment, also cosponsored by Senators Graham, Tillis, Rubio, and Gardner, provides temporary authority for the president—in consultation with the Iraqi government—and I say again—in consultation with the Iraqi government—to provide weapons directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS should the administration choose to do so. Currently by law, the U.S. must provide support to the Iraqi Kurds through the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, which has often not been timely or adequate in the past. These delays have had a negative impact on the Kurds’ ability to defend Iraqi territory and provide security for those who have sought refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan. The president’s recent decision to expedite arms to the Kurds as a way to improve the Counter-ISIS effort, I believe, speaks for itself. Additionally, last year, Secretary of State John Kerry said to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and I quote, “you said the administration is responsible for sending all these weapons through Baghdad. No, we're not. You are. We're adhering to U.S. law passed by Congress…” Secretary Kerry continued, and I quote again, “We have to send it to the [Iraqi] government because that's U.S. law. If you want to change it, fix it, we invite you...” Well, this amendment does just that. And it does so in a bipartisan, bicameral fashion. It builds upon a similar bill in the House - led by Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel. This bill and my amendment are quite different than the House NDAA language. My amendment provides a three-year authorization to reduce delays and inefficiencies in arming Peshmerga forces to fight ISIS—while ensuring the Iraqi government is an integral is a part of the process. The amendment continues to promote a unified Iraq, and enhances the ability to fight our common enemy—an enemy who ultimately seeks to bring their terror here to our shores. Furthermore, the amendment preserves the president’s ability to notify the Iraqi government before weapons, equipment, defense services, or related training is provided to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. It ensures this emergency authorization does not construct a precedent of providing direct support to organizations other than a country or an international organization. Most importantly to remember, it does not require the president to act—it provides him authorization to do so if he feels the situation warrants it. Beginning in the First Gulf War, the Iraqi Kurds and their Peshmerga security forces have played a vital role in supporting U.S. interests and fostering a free Iraq, despite limited means of doing so. Last week, they not only held their ground, but made some gains against ISIS in Kirkuk Province. There are far too few positive news stories out of Iraq recently, but when there are some—it’s often the Kurds who are making that progress. ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces – our critical partner in the fight against ISIS – need U.S. weapons as quickly as possible. We simply cannot afford future delays at this critical moment in the battle. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this much needed bipartisan legislation to arm the Iraqi Kurds in the fight against ISIS. With that Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. # # #
06.11.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND) introduced the bipartisan Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act of 2015, legislation to streamline federal government projects which in turn would help eliminate wasting resources and would protect and safeguard taxpayer dollars. This bill would hold the federal government accountable to adopt the program management standards, practices and procedures of high-performing, private sector organizations. A recent GAO report revealed many federal government projects are grossly over budget, delayed or fail to meet their projected goals. It is not just one department that struggles with program/project management – these failures and issues plague multiple federal agencies. Reports have found that without proper program management in place, agencies can waste up to billions of dollars to fix a problem that could have otherwise been identified from the onset if program management best practices were used. By utilizing the best practices of the private sector, this legislation provides the framework for effective and efficient management of federal government programs. It identifies the personnel to be held responsible, increases accountability to certify management competencies, and places the necessary focus on processes that are critical to effectively delivering major projects and programs. This legislation leaves current organizational structures in place and gives agencies the flexibility they need to fix this problem. “Iowans expect a government that functions properly and efficiently while also serving as a good steward of taxpayer dollars," said Senator Ernst. "The Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act streamlines efforts and outlines strategies to correct widespread deficiencies, lax oversight and unnecessary cost incurred by preventable delays in meeting stated program goals and deadlines. These much needed reforms ensure that taxpayer dollars are safeguarded by increasing accountability throughout the federal government.” “We can work to instill North Dakota-common sense on the federal level, where our dedicated employees are working to better this country,” said Senator Heitkamp. “This spring, I launched my Cut Red Tape Initiative to help make federal programs more successful by reducing confusing and unnecessary federal regulations that can inhibit the good work they do to keep our communities safe and businesses strong. Today I’m proud to work with Senator Ernst on a bipartisan bill that builds on this initiative by promoting more responsibility and oversight among our federal managers, helping them improve their programs, reducing government waste, and making the government work better.” This legislation is the Senate companion bill to the bipartisan H.R. 2144, introduced by Congressmen Todd Young (R-IN) and Gerald Connolly (D-VA). About the Program Management Improvement and Accountability Act: Requires the Deputy Director for Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to: Adopt and oversee government-wide standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management executive agencies. Issue regulations and establish standards and policies for executive agencies in accordance with nationally accredited standards for program and project management planning and delivery issues. Conduct portfolio reviews of high-risk programs, agency programs. Develop a five-year strategic plan for program and project management, to be submitted to Congress and the OMB by the head of each agency. Establishes: Program Management Improvement Officers (senior executives from each executive agency), to implement program management policies and develop a written strategy for enhancing the role of program managers within each respective agency. A Program Management Policy Council within the OMB to exist as a primary forum to improve agency practices related to program and project management, review high risk programs at the GAO, and advise and assist the Deputy Director of the OMB. Requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in consultation with the OMB to issue regulations that: Identify key skills and competencies needed for a program and project manager within an agency. Establish new job series for program and project management within an agency.
06.11.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst’s request, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry today announced it will hold a hearing on July 7th entitled “Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza: The Impact of the U.S. Poultry Sector and Protecting U.S. Poultry Flocks.” The announcement follows a letter sent by the two Senators from Iowa to Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS) requesting a hearing on the federal government’s response to the ongoing outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). “I’m pleased that Chairman Roberts has granted our request to examine the federal government’s response to the devastating outbreak of the avian influenza and its impact on Iowa producers, consumers, and our agriculture industry nationwide,” said Senator Ernst. “This is an important opportunity to bring leaders and key stakeholders together to review the pandemic spread of this deadly disease, identify areas for improvement within response procedures, and set the stage to ensure we are better prepared in the future." “I appreciate Chairman Roberts agreeing to our request to hold a hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee. This is immensely important to Iowa producers and the Iowa economy,” said Senator Grassley. “We need to learn from the last six months so, in addition to confronting the current epidemic, we’re better prepared to respond at all levels when the disease likely strikes again.” Senators Grassley and Ernst previously urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to deploy all appropriate resources to address the HPAI outbreak. The Iowa Senators also joined the entire Iowa Congressional delegation in a letter to the USDA to provide any assistance under their statutory authority to help contain and prevent further spread of HPAI. # # #

06.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In February, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General (VA IG) requesting an immediate and thorough investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health care programs, treatment provided to veteran Richard Miles, and Mr. Miles’ requests for mental health care and the subsequent treatment received. Today Senator Ernst received a briefing from the office of the VA IG on the report and issued the following statement: “After months of waiting, the VA IG has finally released their report into the findings over their investigation of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health care programs and care provided to Richard Miles. “While I am still reviewing this report, the VA IG identified some of the areas that need to be improved and it’s critical that the VA Central Iowa Health Care System implement those recommended changes. However, equally important is that VA hospitals across the country take a look at what has happened in this case and implement necessary changes to their own programs. Specifically, in the instance of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System, the follow up and outreach to Mr. Miles simply was not sufficient. It is so important that veterans suffering from mental health issues receive the care and attention they deserve. “Moreover, our country lacks mental health care professionals across the VA and we need to prioritize incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the VA and provide our veterans private sector alternatives if they so choose. In addition, I remain concerned about excessive wait times overall. We absolutely can and must do better for our veterans. “I feel deeply for the loss of Richard Miles and my thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. I remain committed to ensuring that we can work to prevent this type of tragedy from happening in the future. It is our duty to ensure our veterans have access to the quality mental health care they deserve.” Click here to read the report from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General’s office. Background On February 23, 2015, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the VA IG requesting an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. The inquiry follows recent news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. On March 4, 2015, the VA IG provided an update regarding Senator Ernst’s request for an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. Senator Ernst’s inquiry followed news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. The Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles. On June 3, 2015, Senator Ernst highlighted the critical need for a permanent VA Inspector General. At a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing, Senator Ernst expressed her disappointment that she has yet to receive an update from the Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office which said months ago that they initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles, an Army and Iraq War veteran who committed suicide in Des Moines, Iowa. On June 10, 2015, Senator Ernst received the report from the office of the VA IG. # # #
06.09.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – As concerning reports surface involving the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs today held a hearing entitled “Oversight of the Transportation Security Administration: First-Hand and Government Watchdog Accounts of Agency Challenges". At the hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) raised the issue of systemic problems and a lack of consistency within TSA, citing a recent report where TSA failed to identify and report 73 people that were flagged under terrorism activity codes. The Senator questioned Department of Homeland Security Inspector General John Roth, Transportation Security and Coast Guard Issues Director Jennifer Grover of the Homeland Security and Justice Team at the Government Accountability Office, and Los Angeles-based Federal Air Marshal Robert MacLean about the best way to empower officers and fix inconsistencies within the TSA. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair and thank you Ranking Member Carper for calling this very, very timely hearing today. And I do want to thank all of our witnesses with us today, and we appreciate your testimony very, very much. Senator Carper, I think, touched on a lot of the questions that I really had. I do believe that there has been an issue with the lack of consistency and I think it’s something that TSA has been suffering for, from across the various aspects of the organization, and its mission, for a while now. But referenced in all of your testimonies, really much, across the board, is varying degrees of lack of certainty and consistency with people, processes, and operations. And these problems, whether it’s the morale of the organization, the personnel or the day to day operations, they’re just so systemic. So you’ve mentioned some ideas on where you’d like to see leadership go, a couple of suggestions for Congress, but bottom line, do you think it’s really more of a management issue for the Admiral? Hopefully he’ll be confirmed shortly, but are these the issues that the Admiral can influence through his management style, or is it something that needs to be addressed through legislation? I’d like to hear the perspective that you have on that. You know, one or the other, or a combination of both. Ms. Grover, if you would start please? MS. GROVER: I think it’s really several issues. I do think that there is a concern about morale at TSA, as was mentioned earlier, morale at DHS as a department is very low, and morale at TSA is even lower. And that does affect people’s engagement to their work. But there are weaknesses in the equipment that TSA uses in terms of it’s effectiveness, and there are challenges in encouraging a workforce of 45 thousand people to do the job properly every day, that’s just a lot of people to manage, so it’s morale, it’s management, it’s attention to the technical specifications of the equipment. And, I would like to see TSA spending less time on standing up new programs, and more time on making sure that the programs that have stood up are working properly. SENATOR ERNST: That’s good advice, thank you, I appreciate that. Mr. MacLean? MR. MACLEAN: Well a big problem with the air marshall mission is that there’s nothing going on. Which is s a good thing. There’s no arrests happening, there’s no casework happening, as you would get in a CBP or a border patrol station, you have hundreds of thousands of arrests, hundreds of drug cases happening, so the managers are busy, they have things to do. But when an air marshall commits an infraction, it causes a huge ripple in the water, and a lot of the local managers don’t want to make a decision on something, so they wait on headquarters to make it for them. So I think a possible solution is to put the air marshals underneath the purview of a pure law enforcement agency. A lot of – there’s a huge amount of border patrol agents and CBPO officers in the Air Marshal Service and they feel like it was when they were under the INS. It was an agency that had conflicting missions – one was to naturalize people, and then at the same time to catch and deport them, so they feel that that’s a problem. And because they feel there’s so little casework, so little to do – which is great because there’s nobody dying – but bored managers are looking for something to do, or they’re afraid to proactively take care of a situation until they get a phone call from D.C. SENATOR ERNST: So, you would say to separate the two programs and empower, really empower those officers to do more? MR. MACLEAN: Well, many air marshals say why don’t we go under the purview of Customs and Border Protection? The facilities are already in all of the airports, and the management is already there, it could be a good transition. It happened once before. The original Air Marshal Director had put the Air Marshal Service underneath Immigration and Customs enforcement, and he did that because he saw the air marshals burning out. They were bored. You hire these high speed, eager beaver guys and gals, and they get out there, and they’re strapped down. So you have, it’s like pressure cookers. Things happen. And he saw it – saw it’s going to be a quick burnout. So he put them into ICE in order for them to have a better career path, and going into making arrests and starting investigations. SENATOR ERNST: Yeah, very interesting, I appreciate that. And then I do want to address some of what Senator Johnson alluded to, in his statements too, about the recent media reports that indicated by Inspector General that TSA failed to identify at least 73 people employed in the industry that were flagged under terrorism related activity codes. And, according to the TSA, part of the reason for this is that the agency is not authorized to receive all of the information under current interagency watch listing policy. I have huge concerns with that, as well as I’m sure most of our public does as well. Employees are often granted special access without having gone through a thorough background check, and Inspector General, if you could speak to that just very briefly. HON. ROTH: We share your concern and the summary of what it is that we’ve found is accurate, there’s the TIDE database, which is the large sort-of Terrorist Identity Datamart Environment. TSA, by law, didn’t have access to some of the codes. In 2014, the administrator asked for access, but again it’s a process that apparently is taking some time, so it isn’t quite there yet. But I think they’re moving quickly on it. SENATOR ERNST: Ok, I thank you all very much for your testimony today. Thank you Mr. Chair. # # #
06.09.2015	(Washington, DC) – Today, U.S. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.), Chairman of the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee (SBC), along with U.S. Sens. Jim Risch (R-Idaho), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), introduced the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act of 2015, which ensures that federal agencies fully consider the interests and input of small businesses when considering the potential impacts of new rules on small entities. “The Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act will protect America’s small businesses at a time when the Obama Administration chooses to deliberately ignore input from small entities when issuing major rules and regulations,” said Senator David Vitter. “My colleagues and I have worked to ensure that this legislation will close loopholes that have allowed federal agencies like the EPA to actively avoid consulting with the millions of small businesses who would be impacted by their expensive, and often unnecessary, rules and regulations, and I look forward to a cleaner regulatory process in which agencies better understand how their actions would affect America’s job creators and small businesses.” “As the Obama Administration continues to roll out more and more regulations, the voices of small business owners are being considered less and less,” said Senator Jim Risch. “A major concern for every small business is keeping up with this growing number of burdensome regulations. I am glad to introduce this legislation that will require federal agencies to carefully evaluate how potential actions will impact small businesses in particular.” “Unnecessary, burdensome regulations hurt job creators of all sizes, but especially small businesses that usually can't afford armies of lawyers, accountants and lobbyists to cut through all the red tape. Small businesses should have a stronger voice in the regulatory process, and bureaucrat regulators in all federal agencies should be forced to listen to small business concerns before finalizing regulations,” said Senator Marco Rubio. “Small businesses are the engines driving our economic growth, and they are increasingly threatened by government regulation,” Senator Cory Gardner said. “When the federal government imposes burdensome regulations on our economy, it’s small businesses that are hardest hit. It’s critical that small business has a voice in the regulatory process, and I’m proud to support this legislation that would force agencies to recognize and account for the impact of onerous federal rules.” “While Iowans are voicing their concerns over major rules and regulations, federal agencies such as the EPA are ignoring their input and are continuing to overreach, expanding its power over family farms, small businesses, ranchers, and other landowners in our rural communities,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “Iowans know what is best for Iowa, which is why it is critical that we hear directly from folks back home. This legislation gives small businesses the ability to voice concerns over these regulations before they are implemented, and forces the federal government to stop and listen to the direct impact they will have on job creators.” “This Administration has demonstrated a willingness to advance its own goals at any cost with very little regard for the businesses and industries it cripples, or the livelihoods lost as a result,” said Senator Mike Enzi. “This bill is about being reasonable. It forces the runaway regulatory agencies to stop and think.” The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act: Clarifies that agencies must measure both direct economic impacts and reasonably foreseeable indirect economic impacts of regulations on small businesses. Eliminates loopholes the Internal Revenue Service uses to avoid complying with the RFA. Requires agencies to provide more detailed information in performing required analyses, including the assessment of cumulative impacts of new regulations on small businesses. Expands opportunities for small businesses to provide early input on new rules through Small Business Advocacy Review panels before rules are proposed. Ensures that agencies periodically review existing regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses and further reduce small business impacts where feasible. Provides relief from the massive amount of regulations imposed on small businesses by suspending fines for first-time paperwork violations without removing obligations. Recent evidence has indicated that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) failed to properly consult the small business community before issuing the controversial “waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule, as required under law. The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Committee recently held a hearing to examine how the proposed WOTUS rule would affect small businesses. During the hearing, a representative from the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) Office of Advocacy testified that the rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and various small business owners from around the country testified as to the burdens they would face because of the rule. Despite these findings, the EPA later moved forward with finalizing the rule. Click here to read more. Click here to read the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act. # # #

06.04.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a letter sent today, U.S. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) urged Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee Chairman Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) to hold a hearing on the federal government’s response to the ongoing outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). Senators Grassley and Ernst stressed the critical, timely nature of this issue, citing the devastating impact of the disease on Iowa poultry farmers and producers, and the need to address federal actions taken once the outbreak has been contained. “Due to the sheer size and scope of this outbreak, we have heard from countless folks in Iowa who are concerned about the lack of certainty caused by this situation – many of whom just want to find resolution to this tragedy and get back to work,” the Iowa Senators wrote. “As you know, it is critical for the vitality of our agricultural economy that key stakeholders – producers, ancillary industries, community leaders, and government officials – have the tools and lines of communication available to work with one another to overcome challenges such as HPAI,” the Iowa Senators added. "A hearing would provide an opportunity to bring these leaders and stakeholders together to review what has happened, identify what response procedures have worked, what has not worked, and set the stage to ensure we are better prepared in the future.” Full text of the letter can be found here. Senators Grassley and Ernst urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to properly deploy resources to address the avian flu situation in a letter to Secretary Tom Vilsack last month, following a letter to the USDA sent by the entire Iowa Congressional delegation in April. # # #
06.03.2015	"I do have the responsibility to ensure that those veterans are receiving adequate care, and we’re living up to the promises we have made to these veterans as a nation… … But the only way we can do this is to have efficient and motivated IGs and especially one in the VA that can be held accountable.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – During today’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing entitled “Watchdogs Needed: Top Government Investigator Positions Left Unfilled for Years”, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) highlighted the critical need for a permanent VA Inspector General. At the hearing, Senator Ernst expressed her disappointment that she has yet to receive an update from the Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office which said months ago that they initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles, an Army and Iraq War veteran who committed suicide in Des Moines, Iowa. Senator Ernst emphasized in the hearing that “the Office of the VA IG has told me on multiple occasions that they would get the report to me. Again, I requested this report in February, it is now June… so it is very frustrating and absolutely unacceptable that it has taken so long.” The Senator questioned Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz, Chair of the Inspectors General on Integrity, Project on Government Oversight Executive Director Danielle Brian, and Cause of Action Executive Director Daniel Epstein on the current status of candidates for the VA IG and reasons for delay. In March, Senator Ernst and a number of her colleagues sent a letter calling on President Obama to take action to address the vacancies of permanent Inspectors General (IGs) in the federal government. This letter has also gone unanswered by the administration. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chair I do appreciate you holding this important hearing. This has been an issue ongoing for quite a while now and before I do get to my questions, I just would like to make a few remarks as to this issue. This is very important to me and particularly with the avenue that I am going to take, particularly to our veterans. I have been concerned our veterans are not receiving the highest quality of mental health care at many VA facilities. And tragically in February, Iraq and Army veteran, Richard Miles, of Des Moines, Iowa, committed suicide. I was deeply troubled by reports from his family, friends, and both local and national media outlets which claimed that Richard may have not have received adequate mental health care from the Department of Veterans Affairs. And that led me to ask the Inspector General to look into Central Iowa VA’s mental health care programs, the care Richard received for his PTSD, and their management of his particular case. That was in February. It is now June. And this has been so deeply troubling to me. I would note that the Office of the VA IG has told me on multiple occasions that they would get the report to me. Again, I requested this report in February, it is now June. They told me they would have the results to me first in April, and after receiving no response, we reached out again. And then they said, “We’ll have it to you in May.” We reached out again at the beginning of this week, still have not received an answer. So it is very frustrating and absolutely unacceptable that it has taken so long. We have many veterans that seek assistance with our VA systems, whether it is for mental health care or other types of care. Especially with our mental health care, we need to ensure that they’re receiving timely and adequate care. And in this case, I have no idea whether that happened or not because we have not gotten a response. As a Senator, I do have the responsibility to ensure that those veterans are receiving adequate care, and we’re living up to the promises we have made to these veterans as a nation. So the VA and its IG need to come forward with information that will provide Iowa veterans a better understanding of the adequacy and management of their mental health care and those programs. So while I am in a position right now that I can no longer do anything for Richard, I am in a position where I can do something for many of our other veterans that are seeking mental health care to help with these invisible wounds. And this could be of any era of veteran. But the only way we can do this is to have efficient and motivated IGs and especially one in the VA that can be held accountable. And thank you for listening to that. But with that I would like though to ask a couple of questions. Mr. Horowitz, you wrote in your testimony that “One of the Council of IGs most important responsibilities, is to submit recommendations of individuals to the appropriate appointing authority.” Would you recommend Mr. Griffin to be the IG for the VA? Have you had any discussion with the White House on a formal nomination process for the VA IG spot? MR. HOROWITZ: I have had conversations, and my understanding is the chair of the panel and the panel itself that we’ve set up has also had discussions in the sense of recommending candidates for the position. When I say discussions, and it’s usually one way discussions, it’s usually us recommending candidates to them. SENATOR ERNST: And have you seen any responses particularly with Mr. Griffin? Is he a candidate for the position? Would he be? MR. HOROWITZ: I do not know if he is a candidate and I have not gotten feedback on where things are as to the candidates we’ve recommended. SENATOR ERNST: Okay, and there in lies some of the problems I think, you know, maybe recommendations are made, but they’re not acted on. That I’m not sure of, I just know that the VA needs an IG, and somebody that will be responsive to these types of situations. And also, Mr. Horowitz, and of course Ms. Brian and Mr. Epstein, last year, Former White House Deputy Chief of Staff, now the VA Chief of Staff, Rob Nabors, said the VA was “crippled by a corrosive culture” and “poor leadership” which negatively impacts the delivery of care at VA. And considering this White House report, VA scandals with systemic wait-time falsification, well we could go on and on. And it’s on the GAO’s High-Risk List, in your opinion, why hasn’t the White House prioritized nominating and getting through the Senate a full-time IG? Are there areas we need to consider? MS. BRIAN: I just can’t speak to why they haven’t prioritized it, it seems so obvious to me that it should be a priority, and I would – in my written testimony I gave some examples of how we’ve had our own experiences, very negative experiences, with the acting IG, so I would hope they find someone else to fill that position. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. MR. EPSTEIN: I can’t speak specifically about the President’s state of mind, but I think there are two things that might shed some light on some of those questions you asked, the first is, and I’d be happy to kind of submit an additional statement on this – the President I believe under the Vacancies Act could, he has done so with the National Labor Relations Board, he could put an IG into a position which wouldn’t have to be past that 210 day timeline, and that couldn’t, wouldn’t have to be a deputy. So I think the President has, is ready, willing and able, well maybe not willing, but has the ability to put someone there. And so it’s a question of the pressure to do that, why do you do that for certain boards that may be politically beneficial, but you don’t do that when it comes to Inspector Generals? Another thing is a lot of what has been discussed; the fact that there would be delays in appointments through that vetting process. But as part of that vetting process, whether it’s the Office of the Presidential Personnel or the President’s Council, get background checks from the FBI. So one thing that, if my organization tried to do this, we would be stonewalled. But hopefully the Senate wouldn’t be, is the Senate could request information whether the records are kept confidential but the number of records aren’t of how many background checks are done for potential nominees through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. How many background checks were done for potential nominees to the Export-Import Bank. Then you can determine, how, in fact, willing was the President to consider nominations. If you can’t get the facts from CIGIE, you can get information concerning how many potential nominees were actually considered, and that could give some kind of sunlight to, whether the President took seriously the need to actually put a permanent Inspector General to prevent a lot of these problems that you discussed at Veterans Affairs. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you and thank you Mr. Chair. And I would say that of all the vacant IG positions, this one literally has lives riding on it. Thank you. # # #
06.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) yesterday raised questions during a Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing entitled “The IRS Data Breach: Steps to Protect Americans’ Personal Information”. The Senator discussed current cybersecurity threats and proposed methods to improve and secure systems with Symantec Corporation Director Jeffrey E. Greene, University of Michigan Associate Professor Dr. Kevin Fu, and Mr. Michael Kasper of Poughkeepsie, New York. Click here or on the image below to watch. SENATOR ERNST: Thanks to our panelists for being here today. This is a very timely issue I’m glad we’re able to discuss it right away. So I thank the Chairman and the Ranking Member for calling this hearing. I do have, as I'm sure most folks do, very serious concerns about the implications of this type of data getting out there, and how easily it seems to be obtained by these people hacking into different systems. So I look forward to learning more about it and hearing your thoughts, additional thoughts on it. What I’d like to find out just from you, either you Dr. Fu or Mr. Greene, are there readily available private sector solutions for this that could be compared, you know the website you talk about, the KBA, and are there private sector firms that use this type of information and what’s the best way to replace what we’re doing now with a better, more secure system? MR. GREENE: So there are security measures, certainly Senator, you can put in place, many of the KBA back ends are provided by the private sector and in fact are used by the private sector. The security that worked three, five years ago isn't working as well today because of the information that was stolen. Through the initial login process when you’re setting up the account, there’s kinda, there are two ways I look at it. One is how do you prevent a fradulent account from being set up? How do you stop it before it happens? And that would be through some form of two factor authentication, improving KBA, and there are different ways to do it, one of which we’ve talked about is the phone or the letter. On the back end, to try to see who’s doing this activity, there are ways to basically take the data log, the servers that are logged in, perform analytics on them and see if you’re seeing a pattern of activity indicative of some level of fraud. Now, to some degree, for a few people, the horse is going to be out of the barn at that point. Because you may already have some false logins, but you need to be looking at it from both ends, and we’re never going to be able to stop 100 percent of it. But as the criminals get more sophisticated, the tools that worked become less effective, and I think that’s where we are with KBA. And there are ways to improve it going forward. SENATOR ERNST: Yes. Dr. Fu? DR. FU: Well, let’s see, I think I have two different responses. One is NIST, So NIST has actually proposed this ten year roadmap, called the NSTIC, the National Strategy for Trusted Identites in Cyberspace. And in fact, they already have given advice to IRS, and there’s a published report. And I think that the federal systems will find better authentication systems if they do engage with NIST, and take the advice of NIST’s independent non-regulatory experts. They have a wealth of information on the technologies, the risks, the benefits, there’s also a number of companies working in the two factor authentication space. I don’t know of any that specifically work on, for instance, protecting taxpayer information, but one company local in Ann Arbor, Duo Security, for instance, uses a mobile phone as a second factor. So when they attempt to have their customers log into a to some kind of service, not only do you need to have a password, but you also need to have a mobile phone present. And the idea is that it is more difficult for an intruder to physically steal your phone if they’re somewhere in a foreign country. There’s also some interesting innovation by a company that I believe had come out of Georgia Tech, Pindrop Security, they actually work for financial services companies. They listen to the audio of the phone calls as people call in and they’re able to actually identify repeat offenders who are calling in pretending to be other people based on the delay in the phone line from the country they’re calling from, some interesting characteristics of the copper wires. You could use some of these advanced technologies not to eliminate, but at least reduce the risk of fraudsters trying to go from one fraudster doing 100,000 accounts to at least making it more dififcult to scale up to so many different accounts from one adversary. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. And Mr. Kasper, I’m sorry you've had to go through this experience as so many others have. You had indicated that the IRS thought that the e-mail account – maybe I had read this somewhere – that the e-mail account was suspicious? Was that from your testimony, or was it somewhere else that I read? MR. KASPER: Yeah, I don’t remember the exact words that I used but when I was on the phone I said “Hmm that doesn’t seem right," or something like that. SENATOR ERNST: Yeah it makes me wonder, especially if these are coming from foreign adversaries, that if they have a different e-mail address that indicates they are coming from, originating from a foreign nation, that that is something that could be flagged for requiring additional information? I don’t know if that’s something else that could be considered. MR. KASPER: Yeah there’s probably some analytics they could do just on the domain name, because they highlighted the 200,000 had these suspicious domain names, but it’s very easy to get a Hotmail or Yahoo e-mail account and automate that and have some type of process for taking advantage of it. There are things that it seems like they weren’t monitoring with those servers and transactions that they could have been doing. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you. MR. KASPER: IP Addresses and all of that. SENATOR ERNST: Exactly. And do any of you know has the IRS has reached out to any private sector providers to try and correct the system that they have now, or done any sort of control measures? Do any of you know? Ok, that’s a question for our next panel. Ok. Well I appreciate it very much. I thank you for your time and hopefully we can get to the bottom of this and find better ways of utilizing our information systems. Thank you. # # #
06.02.2015	"As a soldier and member of both the Homeland Security Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee, I cannot support legislation that hampers important security tools implemented as a part of our original counter-terrorism approach.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting against passage of the USA Freedom Act: “As a soldier and member of both the Homeland Security Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee, I cannot support legislation that hampers important security tools implemented as a part of our original counter-terrorism approach. “During this important debate, I supported a short-term extension of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions which are critical to the safety and security of our country. “I have expressed my serious concerns over delegating responsibility solely to telephone companies. The USA Freedom Act fails to detail how long telephone companies are required to keep metadata records, and there are uncertainties about process delays in the transfer of information from telecom to the federal government. We can and must do better to protect the privacy and security of all Americans. “America cannot afford the potential for systemic and long-term intelligence gaps. This approach undercuts protections previously put in place and opens the door for a false sense of security at such a critical time in the fight against terrorism.” # # #
05.31.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Tonight, the Senate voted to proceed on the USA Freedom Act. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on expiring provisions in the PATRIOT Act that enable the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect metadata. "These provisions included in the PATRIOT Act are critical to the safety and security of our country. I supported a short-term extension which would afford the necessary time to achieve a consensus solution in Congress. “However, I have serious concerns with delegating responsibility to telephone companies. “We are engaged in a global war on terrorism and as this debate continues, we must be mindful not to put ourselves in a position that opens us up to intelligence gaps, especially at a time when we see increasingly complex and dangerous threats around the world. “I remain committed to achieving a solution that provides Iowans and all Americans with the privacy and security they deserve.” # # #
05.29.2015	U.S. Senator Joni Ernst today released the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued its proposed biofuel volume requirements under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) for 2014 through 2016: “I am disappointed by the EPA’s proposal for biofuel volume mandates under the RFS that do not meet the statutory renewable fuel levels originally set by Congress. A strong RFS is critical to our farmers, producers and the entire renewable fuel sector in Iowa. “The EPA's proposal ignores the intent of the law and is 18 months past its deadline. Strong biofuel blending requirements under the RFS encourage innovation in the advanced biofuels sector, increase consumer choice, and drive investment in developing and expanding clean energy alternatives that enhance our rural communities and bolster our Iowa economy. “Today's announcement does create some certainty for producers; however, we can and must do better. I will continue pushing for a strong and long-term RFS as the EPA finalizes its rule for 2014 and beyond, that enables our farmers and producers to conduct and grow their businesses in Iowa and across the country." Last month, Senator Ernst joined Senator Grassley and a group of bipartisan Senators urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue strong biofuels volume requirements for the 2014 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and beyond. The Senators asked the EPA to reverse course on their proposed 2014 rule to achieve the long-term and renewable energy goals originally intended by Congress. Click here to read more. In addition, Senator Ernst commented on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announcement today of a plan to invest up to $100 million in new blending pump installations across the country: “Contrary to the EPA’s faulty proposal on renewable volume levels under the RFS, the USDA today recognized the demand for effective fuel alternatives as this new infrastructure will support higher blends of ethanol and provide consumers greater biofuel choices at the pump.” # # #

05.28.2015	Last week, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2015 to reform the system for providing former U.S. presidents certain benefits and perks. The legislation examines how former presidents are spending taxpayer dollars and, among other things, would set the annual allowances for former presidents at $200,000. Click here to listen to Senator Ernst discuss the new legislation. What They Are Saying: Radio Iowa: “Iowa Senator Joni Ernst is touting legislation to reform the system for providing former presidents with certain perks and benefits.” (Radio Iowa, 5/21/15) Radio Iowa: “Ernst noted in fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses.” (Radio Iowa, 5/21/15) KCAU-TV: “The Presidential Allowance and Modernization Act of 2015 was designed to limit the amount of money taxpayers provide for various benefits such as communications, office space, and staffing and travel expenses. Ernst said today that those were things taxpayers shouldn’t be footing the bill for.” (KCAU-TV, 5/22/15) The Hill: “Ernst suggested that her push to limit money given to former commanders in chief is part of a larger push to rein in government spending.” (The Hill, 5/26/15) The Fiscal Times: “Under a new bill proposed by a trio of Senate Republicans, former U.S. presidents would see their benefits covering travel, staff, and office space cut dramatically, in line with their post-White House earnings.” (The Fiscal Times, 5/26/15) The Fiscal Times: “…the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2015, introduced by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), would scale back the amount of money former presidents receive for office space, staff, and travel expenses to $200,000 per year. That allowance would be further reduced by one dollar for every dollar a former president earns over $400,000 in a given year.” (The Fiscal Times, 5/26/15) Omaha World-Herald: “Every year, taxpayers shell out millions of dollars in allowances to former U.S. presidents. It’s time to tighten those post-presidential belts, says Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.” (Omaha World-Herald, 5/22/15) KMA Land: “Ernst says the bill aims to restore taxpayer trust.” (KMA Land, 5/21/15) Click here or on the image below to watch KCAU-TV’s report. About Presidential Perks And The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act (FPA) designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president. In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. This is the companion bill to the House of Representatives bill, H.R. 1777, introduced by Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) that passed unanimously out of the House Oversight Committee earlier this month. # # #
05.27.2015	U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the White House Office of Management and Budget released the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) finalized “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) rule: “I am still reviewing the lengthy nature of this final rule, however, I remain concerned that the EPA did not seriously consider the comments and perspective from whom this rule will directly effect. The EPA has repeatedly ignored the legitimate concerns raised throughout this process and continues to act as an unchecked federal agency of the Obama Administration. “Iowans have voiced their concern. In fact, just last week Mrs. Darcy Dougherty Maulsby, a fifth-generation farmer and small business owner from Lake City, Iowa, testified before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee on the impact of the WOTUS rule, and shared her personal experience with the EPA’s harmful impact and overregulation in Iowa. “Nonetheless, the EPA wants to continue this overreach, expanding its power over family farms, small businesses, ranchers, and other landowners in our rural communities. Every community wants clean water and to protect our nation’s waterways, but we simply cannot allow mounting unnecessary environmental regulations to overwhelm the common sense voice of hardworking Americans. “I remain committed to fighting for our agriculture communities not only in Iowa, but across this country, and will work to stop any harmful impact this rule will have.” BACKGROUND: Earlier this month, Senator Ernst introduced Iowa farmer and small business owner Darcy Maulsby to testify on the impact of WOTUS before the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee, and share her personal experience with the harmful impact and overregulation by the EPA in Iowa. In February, Senator Ernst invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see the potential impact of overregulation in Iowa. # # #

05.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for final passage of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA): "Today’s passage of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act is a step toward growing export markets and leveling the playing field for Iowa exporters. Trade is critical to Iowa’s future and the health of our economy. As a net-exporting state, Iowa stands to directly benefit from new free trade opportunities that will foster our state’s agricultural exports, reduce trade barriers for our manufacturers, and create jobs. “TPA also helps to ensure greater transparency so that Iowans are better informed about U.S. trade negotiations and can make sure we get the best trade deals possible.” In April, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 passed the Senate Finance Committee by a vote of 20 to 6. This legislation reauthorizes TPA – which expired in 2007 – through July 2018. Senator Ernst emphasized the importance of TPA in a press conference earlier this week, citing a letter signed by more than 70 State of Iowa leaders and job creators supporting the reauthorization. BENEFITS OF TRADE FOR IOWA On Monday night, more than 70 State of Iowa leaders and job creators sent a letter to the Iowa congressional delegation to underscore the importance of international trade to Iowa’s businesses, workers, and farmers. According to the letter: In 2014, Iowa exported a record-setting $15.1 billion in manufactured goods and value-added agricultural products. Nearly 83% of these exports were from small or medium-sized businesses. Iowa farmers exported $3.58 billion in soybeans, $1.99 billion in pork, $1.71 billion in corn, and $1.04 billion in feed grain. In addition, according to the Business Roundtable: Over 448,000 jobs in Iowa – nearly one in every five jobs – depend on international trade. There are 3,367 Iowa-based companies that exported to nearly 190 countries in 2013. Our negotiating partners in the TPP and T-TIP agreements purchased $11.3 billion (64%) of Iowa goods exported in 2013. The elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers with those countries would therefore likely result in a direct benefit to Iowa’s economy. # # #

05.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act of 2015, legislation to reform the system for providing former U.S. presidents certain benefits and perks. Original co-sponsors of the bill include Senators Mark Kirk (R-IL) and Marco Rubio (R-FL). This is the companion bill to the House of Representatives bill, H.R. 1777, introduced by Congressmen Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD). Currently, legislation known as the Former Presidents Act provides former presidents with an annual pension and a series of benefits that taxpayers pick up the tab for. These perks include, but are not limited to communications, office space, staff, and travel expenses. In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act examines how former presidents are spending taxpayer dollars and would set the annual allowances for former presidents at $200,000. The legislation would then reduce the amount of perks available dollar-for-dollar for annual income over $400,000 generated by former presidents the previous year. “Taxpayers should not be on the hook for subsidizing former presidents’ lives to the tune of millions of dollars,” said Senator Ernst. “Although this is a narrow item, this is an issue of restoring taxpayer trust by looking at reforms in the allowances and perks given to these former presidents who generate significant incomes after leaving office. At a time when we are more than $18 trillion in debt, it is critical that we stop talking and start cutting wasteful spending.” "As Americans, we are grateful for the service of former presidents and have seen how many of them can go on to lead active and impactful careers once they've left office,” said Senator Rubio. “But taxpayers no longer need to foot the entire bill for all the endeavors presidents undertake after leaving office, which is why I support Joni Ernst's effort to reform the benefits afforded to former presidents." “Last year, Presidents Clinton and Bush collected $2.2 million from taxpayers. I believe the majority of Americans would prefer to keep that money in the treasury,” said Senator Kirk. About Presidential Perks and the Presidential Allowance Modernization Act: According to the Congressional Research Service, post-presidency funding dates back to 1958 when Congress created the Former Presidents Act (FPA) designed to “maintain the dignity” of former presidents and provide benefits to help cover costs associated with holding the office of the president. In fiscal year 2015, former U.S. presidents cost taxpayers more than $2.4 million in travel, office space, communications, personnel, and other expenses. The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act would: Set former presidents’ monetary allowance and pension at $200,000 each per year. Place reductions on perks if the former president earns more than $400,000 per year in income. Affirm that nothing in the legislation relates to the funding of the security or protection of a former president. # # #
05.19.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) introduced Mrs. Darcy Dougherty Maulsby, a fifth-generation farmer and small business owner from Lake City, Iowa, to the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. Mrs. Maulsby testified before the committee on the impact of the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, and shared her personal experience with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) harmful impact and overregulation in Iowa. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s introduction. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chairman, very much. As the second panel is getting settled, I’ll go ahead and start off by thanking all of you for joining us here today. It is good to have you with us and I do appreciate your testimony and attention to this important widespread economic and regulatory issue. The EPA’s proposed expanded definition of Waters of the United States, or as we fondly call it, WOTUS, will add unnecessary bureaucratic red tape for our producers in the Ag and small business communities. The EPA has stated that the rule has been crafted with the intentions of creating clarity and increasing efficiency for key stakeholders. However, in reality, the proposed rule has only expanded confusion and uncertainty as to how far the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act reaches. It is incredibly important that—before this rule is finalized—we stop it from having any negative consequences on our producers and businesses. And if the EPA still fails to listen to the many voices raising concerns—including those of many of you in this room today—then we should all come together and oppose this rule. Today, it is my great pleasure to introduce one of those voices—Darcy Maulsby is a fifth generation corn and soybean farmer and small business owner from Lake City, Iowa. Her work, both on the farm and in owning a communications and marketing business, has given her a unique opportunity to engage local, national, and world leaders to promote the benefits of agriculture to our economy. Mrs. Maulsby has used her skills in journalism and mass communications to reach untold audiences promoting the importance of improving production and conservation practices and life in rural America. Mrs. Maulsby, Darcy, it is always good to have a fellow Iowan in Washington. And thank you very much for testifying today, your words are going to be very important for this panel. I will not be able to stay for questions, but I will submit those for the record.* And, just so everybody knows, they did have quite an episode a few weeks ago with a tornado that came through Lake City. So Darcy, we appreciate the extra effort that it took for you to come and be with us today. So thank you very much. And thanks to everybody on the panel as well. Thank you. *NOTE: Senator Ernst was not able to stay for questions, due to her responsibilities to preside over the Senate floor. The Senator will submit questions for the record. # # #
05.19.2015	“…it was encouraging to have this letter, again signed by over 70 folks from Iowa supporting TPA…what they were stressing again is how international trade is so important to our businesses, our workers, our farmers.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), and small business owners from Ohio, Wisconsin and Kentucky to discuss the need for Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and its importance to small businesses and industries across the country. Click HERE to watch Sen. Ernst’s comments, which begin at the 10:00 mark. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thanks to the Leader and Senator Warner for being here today. We do know that trade plays an important role in Iowa’s economy, and just as Senator Warner pointed out some of the aspects of business that would be very helped by trade in Virginia, Iowa is very, very different and I would like to share some of the points on why the Trade Promotion Authority would be beneficial to our Iowa economy. We would stand to directly benefit by opening up the international trade that would really boost our agricultural exports, and provide new market opportunities, reduce those trade barriers and for our manufacturers, create more jobs here in the United States. And just last night, I received a letter from more than 70 of our State of Iowa leaders, both in the private industry and also from our Governor and Lieutenant Governor. So, it was encouraging to have this letter, again signed by over 70 folks from Iowa supporting TPA. So, what they were stressing again is how international trade is so important to our businesses, our workers, our farmers. And, according to the letter, and again some really interesting statistics: In 2014, Iowa exported a record-setting $15.1 billion in manufactured goods and value-added agricultural products. Nearly 83% of these exports came from small or medium-sized businesses. And Iowa farmers exported over $3.5 billion in soybeans, nearly $2 billion in pork, $1.7 billion in corn and just over $1 billion in feed grain. And in addition, I want you to consider this too because this is pretty astounding for Iowa, according to the Business Roundtable, over 448,000 Iowa jobs are directly tied to trade. That is nearly one in every five jobs in Iowa directly associated to trade. So we are proud supporters of this TPA. I’ve been encouraged by so many members in Iowa to be supportive of this measure, I am glad to see that we are moving this legislation. We have over 3,300 Iowa-based companies that have exported to nearly 190 countries all around the world. I appreciate your time today, again I want to thank the Leader, thank Senator Warner for joining us, and to our guests here also, we would love to give them plenty of time to give their stories and answer questions. But again this is very important to Iowa and to many, many other states, so would love to see this move forward hopefully this week, so thank you very much for your time. # # #

05.14.2015	“I am pleased to see that seven of my amendments were included in the NDAA which added processes to ensure the VA is proactive in its outreach to veterans suffering from mental health issues, pushes the US and our allies to provide the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment needed to combat ISIS without delay, and ensures that federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule, among many other critical measures.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Senate Armed Services Committee completed markup of the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The bill will head to the Senate floor where it awaits further action. “This year’s National Defense Authorization Act prioritizes what is needed; it provides our military with the necessary resources to protect our national security while cutting wasteful spending. “I am pleased to see that seven of my amendments were included in the NDAA which added processes to ensure the VA is proactive in its outreach to veterans suffering from mental health issues, pushes the US and our allies to provide the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the weapons and equipment needed to combat ISIS without delay, and ensures that federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule, among many other critical measures. “I am honored to have been a part of this bipartisan work on the Senate Armed Services Committee to complete markup of the NDAA and look forward to further discussions on this important legislation on the Senate floor.” Ernst Language Included in NDAA: “Sense of the Senate that the development of gender-neutral Military Occupational Specialties (MOS) standards are vital to determining occupational assignments for all members of the military. Studies being conducted by the US military on a gender-neutral standard should incorporate the best scientific practices available to ensure these studies do not result in unnecessary barriers for service in the US military. All DoD decisions on military occupational standards should be based on objective analysis on tasks required to perform the MOS, and such standards should not reduce the standards of our combat arms units.” Summary of Ernst Amendments Included in NDAA: An amendment to improve the Clay Hunt SAV Act pilot program by requiring outreach of the VA’s community-based veteran peer support network to our wounded, ill, and injured service members, as well as all service members within 180 days of leaving service. This amendment will ensure the VA will be proactive, instead of reactive, with its outreach to those who have sacrificed for our nation on this important mental health pilot program. An amendment, for the next five years, to provide new or current leases on Army Ammunition Plants, under the Army’s ARMS initiative, the option of extending a 25-year lease for an additional 25-year period. This amendment will attract and retain greater investment, reduce facility sustainment cost, and provide a boost to some local communities - including the Des Moines County Iowa Army Ammunition Plant. An amendment to require, within a year of enactment of this legislation, a joint report to the Senate Armed Services Committee from the Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of the Navy, a plan to jointly modernize Army and Marine Corps small arms during a 15-year period. This amendment seeks to reduce duplication of efforts between the services, potentially realize cost savings in developing common small arms weapons and technology, and improve the committee’s oversight of the modernization strategies of both of the branches of service whose primary mission it is to fight and win our nation’s land conflicts. An amendment to instill the sense of the Senate on the severity of the threat posed by ISIS to the people and territorial integrity of Iraq, including Iraqi Kurdistan, and the security and stability of the region and the world. It also shares the sense that the US, in coordination with our coalition partners, provide without undue delay—the Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga with the heavy weapons and equipment, and training necessary to defeat ISIS. This amendment reminds us that ISIS’s leaders have stated they intend to target our Homeland and American citizens, and recognizes the long-term and successful partnership between Iraqi Kurds and the US military during the Iraq War. An amendment to require the DoD to submit a report on ISIS, al-Nusra, and other terrorists group lines of communication through countries bordering Syria, and the threat posed by these lines of communication to the Homeland, our men and women in uniform, DoD installations, and diplomatic facilities located in Europe and Middle East. An amendment, cosponsored by Senators Inhofe and Ayotte, to permanently establish the National Guard State Partnership Program and require the DoD Comptroller to submit a report on establishing a central fund to manage the program under DoD. An amendment to bring much needed improvement to program and project management within the acquisition process at the DoD to ensure federal programs are efficient, on budget and on schedule. It takes the best practices from high performing organizations in the private sector and implements them at DoD, and it does without impacting current organizational structures or requiring additional resources. This amendment makes it possible for the first time to pinpoint and identify the appropriate personnel responsible for these programs by establishing standards and policies for DoD that are in accordance with nationally accredited stands and guidance for program and project management. # # #
05.12.2015	WASHINGTON — Iowa Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst today sent a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack encouraging the department to ensure that resources have been properly deployed to Iowa to fight the ongoing outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The disease has been detected at more than 30 poultry farms across Iowa. Grassley and Ernst have heard from Iowa poultry producers concerned about a lack of direction from the department regarding depopulation and repopulation of their flocks, as well as a possible development of a vaccine to combat the deadly virus. At this time, roughly twenty-four million birds need to be depopulated. “I’ve heard from producers that the current pace at which depopulation is occurring may not be fast enough. There are additional questions about how long producers will need to leave their barns empty once the depopulation process is complete and sites are deemed free of this disease by testing. USDA could help calm a lot of nerves if they provided answers to a few of these questions. The sooner that clarity can be given on timelines for repopulating buildings, the better prepared everyone will be to make decisions about this crisis,” Grassley said. “It’s critical that we work as quickly as possible to stop this outbreak of the avian influenza to safeguard Iowa’s poultry and egg producers. I have heard their concerns and will continue to push the USDA to take the necessary steps in the disposal, cooperation and preventive measures to combat further spread and assist our producers, rural communities and industry nationwide,” Ernst said. The text of the letter is below. A signed copy can be found here. May 12, 2015 The Honorable Thomas J. Vilsack Secretary of Agriculture U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave., S.W. Washington, DC 20250 Dear Secretary Vilsack, As you know, Iowa is currently coping with an outbreak of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) that is devastating to the turkey and egg industries. An estimated 23 million birds in Iowa will need to be depopulated from farm sites to control the spread of this disease. Poultry growers in the state of Iowa whose operations have been affected by the virus have communicated to us several measures that could help their businesses recover from the outbreak. As the U.S. Department of Agriculture continues its collaboration with state agencies on the HPAI response and prepares for the future, we urge consideration of the suggestions we have received from our constituents who are struggling with the impact of the virus. USDA must do everything it can to stop this perilous virus. We have heard from numerous producers in Iowa who are concerned about adequate resources being dispatched to the state. Specifically, producers have raised concerns about the outbreaks in the last two weeks that have overwhelmed the current capacity to humanely euthanize infected flocks to prevent further spread of the disease. As this crisis continues to unfold, we urge USDA to consider ways to expedite humane depopulation processes, possibly allowing qualified non-USDA personnel like local veterinarians to oversee the depopulation of flocks. We are also concerned about the reports from producers who do not know when they will be able to repopulate their flocks after completing USDA’s five step process for containing the disease. We urge USDA to work with state agencies to communicate to farmers a timeline so they can make plans for the future operations and in some cases work out their financing needs. As the HPAI virus continues to impact Iowa farmers, it is critical that we do all we can to prepare for future outbreaks. We understand there are companies working on a vaccine for HPAI, and we hope the Department is exploring ways to expedite development and commercialization of those vaccines should they show promise of stopping this virus. USDA must prioritize research and education on avian influenza. This outbreak of HPAI has already devastated the Iowa turkey and egg industry, and will have a trickle-down effect on the rural communities and our country’s agricultural economy. Farmers are eager to return to business as usual and minimize the disruption to their businesses – We look forward to hearing from you soon on how we can work together to eradicate this deadly disease. Thank you for all your work, and for your consideration. Sincerely, -30-
05.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement in support of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, also known as Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), which identifies congressional trade policy priorities, establishes new notification, consultation and transparency requirements for the Administration, provides for expedited congressional consideration of trade agreements in order to ensure our trading partners put their best offers on the table, and ultimately strengthens Congress’ voice on a final vote of approval on any negotiated trade agreement. “Trade plays an important role in Iowa’s economy, and I’m disappointed that some in Congress are blocking bipartisan legislation to move forward on a trade agenda,” said Senator Ernst. “Iowa stands to directly benefit by opening up international trade that would boost our agricultural exports, provide new market opportunities and reduce trade barriers for our manufacturers and create more jobs here in the U.S. Importantly, passage of TPA would help to ensure greater transparency so that Iowans are better informed about U.S. trade negotiations and ensure we get the best deals possible.” In April, the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 passed the Senate Finance Committee by a vote of 20 to 6. The legislation grants TPA reauthorization until July 2018 after most recently expiring in 2007. THE BENEFITS OF TRADE IN IOWA Over 448,000 jobs in Iowa – nearly one in every five jobs – depend on international trade.[1] Between 2010 and the end of 2014, the value of Iowa’s exports increased by nearly 40% – from $10.8 billion to $15.1 billion.[2] There are 3,367 Iowa-based companies that exported to nearly 190 countries in 2013. 83% of those companies were small or medium-sized businesses.[3] Our negotiating partners in the TPP and T-TIP agreements purchased $11.3 billion (64%) of Iowa goods exported in 2013.[4] The elimination of tariffs and other trade barriers with those countries would therefore likely result in a direct benefit to Iowa’s economy.

05.07.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act: “Passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is a critical step forward to ensure congressional review of any deal with Iran. It certifies that no congressional sanction can be lifted during the review period and safeguards congressional oversight of Iranian compliance. This enables the American people to have a voice. “We must prevent a nuclear Iran which is a threat to our national security interests, our allies and partners in the region, and stability in the world. The bottom line is that Iran must never be allowed to develop a single nuclear weapon, and this legislation moves us one step closer to that goal.” Senator Ernst is a cosponsor of the legislation and previously spoke on the Senate floor calling for congressional approval of any final deal with Iran. Watch here. # # #
05.06.2015	“ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces – our critical partner in the fight against ISIS – need U.S. weapons as quickly as possible. This three-year authorization would bolster efforts against ISIS which is critical to maintaining a unified and stable Iraq, and imperative to our national security interests. We simply cannot afford future delays at this critical moment in the battle.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the Senate floor to speak about the critical need for the United States to provide direct assistance to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in support of the fight against ISIS. The Iowa Senator urged her colleagues to support bipartisan legislation she introduced yesterday with Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) which provides temporary, emergency authority for the President to provide weapons and training directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Read the legislation here. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Mr. President, as we continue to fight against ISIS and those radicalized by them, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join efforts to provide direct assistance to a crucial, critical partner in that fight—the Kurdistan Regional Government. Yesterday, I joined Senator Barbara Boxer of California to do just that. We introduced bipartisan legislation to provide temporary authority for the president to provide weapons directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS. This legislation builds upon a similar bipartisan House effort led by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce and Ranking Member Eliot Engel. The bill’s three-year authorization seeks to reduce delays in arming Peshmerga forces to fight ISIS, while still maintaining consultation with the Iraqi government. Beginning in the First Gulf War, the Iraqi Kurds and their Peshmerga forces have played a vital role in supporting U.S. interests and a free Iraq, despite limited means of doing so. Since August 2014, the Kurds have provided sanctuary to nearly 2 million ethnic and religious minorities in Iraqi Kurdistan, and have been the only force to hold its ground against ISIS in Northern Iraq. Currently by law, the US must provide support to the Iraqi Kurds through the Iraqi central government in Baghdad, which has often not been timely or adequate in the past. This has had a negative impact on the Kurds’ ability to defend Iraqi territory and provide security for those Iraqis and Syrians who have sought refuge in Iraqi Kurdistan. Last November, Secretary of State John Kerry said that if Chairman Royce wanted to change current law—to “fix it”—then he invited him to do so. Well, that’s exactly what this legislation does… It makes it the policy of the United States to provide direct assistance to the Kurdistan Regional Government to combat ISIS. We do that because we believe that defeating ISIS is critical to maintaining an inclusive and unified Iraq and that the Iraqi Kurds are the key in that goal—as well as to helping end the humanitarian crisis in Iraq through their support of over 1.6 million displaced persons from Iraq and Syria. The legislation preserves the president’s ability to notify the Iraqi government before weapons, equipment, defense services, or related training is provided to Iraqi Kurdish forces. It ensures this emergency authorization does not construct a precedent of providing direct support to organizations other than a country or an international organization. Finally, it works toward accountability by requiring a report to Congress on U.S. weapons provided to the Iraqi government which have ended up in the hands of Iranian controlled/supported Shia militias or foreign terrorists groups. ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces – our critical partner in the fight against ISIS – need U.S. weapons as quickly as possible. This three-year authorization would bolster efforts against ISIS which is critical to maintaining a unified and stable Iraq, and imperative to our national security interests. We simply cannot afford future delays at this critical moment in the battle. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this much needed legislation to Arm the Iraqi Kurds in the fight against ISIS. With that Mr. President, I yield the floor. # # #
05.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senators Joni Ernst (R-IA) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced bipartisan legislation to provide for a temporary, emergency authorization of defense articles, defense services, and related training directly to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). Other cosponsors include Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Rand Paul (R-KY) and Marco Rubio (R-FL). This legislation would allow the U.S. to provide direct assistance to the KRG, a critical partner in the fight against ISIS. The companion bill was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and has broad bipartisan support across the ideological spectrum. The legislation provides temporary, emergency authority for the President to provide weapons and training directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces. The three-year authorization seeks to reduce delays in arming Peshmerga forces to fight ISIS, while in consultation with the Iraqi government. “ISIS is deadly and determined, and Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces – our critical partner in the fight against ISIS – need U.S. weapons as quickly as possible. This three-year authorization would bolster efforts against ISIS which is critical to maintaining a unified and stable Iraq, and imperative to our national security interests. We simply cannot afford to have future delays at this critical moment in the battle,” Senator Ernst said. “The Iraqi Kurds have been a steadfast and capable partner of the United States, and this bill will help ensure they have the support they need in the fight against ISIL,” Senator Boxer said. “The United States should empower Iraqi Kurds by providing them with what they need to protect their region from the threat posed by radical Islamic extremists,” Senator Johnson said. “Defeating ISIS requires active participation from our allies in the region. I support sending arms to the Kurdish fighters who are providing the vital boots on the ground. This Administration claims they need the legal authority to arm the Kurds. This bill removes any doubt that they have the authority and the renewed encouragement of Congress to provide our Kurdish allies the support they need to continue their fight against ISIS and radical Islam,” Senator Paul said. “The Kurds are some of our closest partners in the Middle East. The Peshmerga are on the front lines of the battle against ISIL and we need to do all we can to ensure they succeed,” Senator Rubio said. About the Legislation: Since the First Gulf War, the Iraqi Kurds and their Peshmerga forces have played a vital role in supporting U.S. interests and a free Iraq despite limited means of doing so. Approximately one million displaced Iraqis and Syrians have taken refuge in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region. Currently by law, the U.S. must provide support to the Iraqi Kurds through the Iraqi central government in Baghdad. This legislation… Provides a three-year authorization for the U.S. to provide weapons directly to Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the fight against ISIS. States it is the policy of the United States to provide direct assistance to the Kurdistan Regional Government to combat ISIS.

Ensures accountability by requiring a report to Congress on U.S. weapons provided to the Iraqi government which have ended up in the hands of Iranian controlled/supported Shia militias. # # #
05.05.2015	“The A-10 right now is the only air platform that can get up close, get very personal with ISIS, as Senator Isakson said, with those others that are intent on harming our men and women.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Senate colleagues and close air support experts at a press conference to support the effort to prevent the premature divestment of the A-10. The Iowa Senator stressed the importance of the A-10 as a resource for American men and women serving in harm’s way, and noted that the A-10 lacks a comparable replacement. This press conference was held in anticipation of the Senate Armed Services Committee’s markup of the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) next week, and the likely consideration of the NDAA later this month by the full House of Representatives. Click here or on the image below to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Senator Ayotte, and thanks to my colleagues here today for standing up and supporting the A-10 and the efforts to keep that in place. It is an extremely powerful platform. And bottom line, upfront, folks is that my colleagues and I are not here today to fight for a piece of equipment, what we are doing today is fighting for the very lives of our men and women that are serving on the ground in these dangerous areas. I have heard over and over and over again from many colleagues that they would not be here today, with us, if it weren’t for the A-10. We do not have a comparable platform at this time. And bottom line again, we’re not fighting for a piece of equipment, we’re fighting for the lives of our American men and women; special operators, warriors, those that are danger close with the enemy. The A-10 right now is the only air platform that can get up close, get very personal with ISIS, as Senator Isakson said, with those others that are intent on harming our men and women. So again, we need to keep this platform in place, I feel very strongly about this, and I want to thank Senator Ayotte for raising these concerns and pushing this issue here on the Hill. Thank you very much, Senator Ayotte. # # #
05.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after voting for the Congressional balanced budget today: “This joint Senate-House budget agreement is a necessary roadmap to put Congress on the right path toward restoring fiscal responsibility in Washington. It sets the framework to balance the budget, cut out-of-control spending, and helps grow a stronger economy, all while providing our military with the needed resources to protect our national security. “These pro-growth policies are just commonsense, and I’m optimistic about the way in which Washington is getting to work and embracing meaningful reforms that Iowans deserve.” Today, Congress passed the first joint 10-year balanced budget resolution for the first time since 2001. # # #
05.04.2015	Thank you to all who submitted questions! Below are a few of my recent answers to questions Iowans posted on social media. Josh of Iowa – tweeted: In Mills County & within plain view of the giant Google complex but have no internet. Help? Thank you for your question Josh. As you know, we still have a number of rural areas that do not have internet access, and I think it is important folks in rural Iowa have greater access to broadband internet. I agree with Governor Branstad, who has said that we want to make sure every acre of Iowa is connected through broadband. However, we must consider all options before making this a public utility regulated by the federal government. It’s very important that we work to correct government overregulation, and not stifle creative activity and expansion with government intervention. We should not be creating unnecessary and antiquated regulatory constraints or expanding their already powerful role in the lives of Americans. Iowa is becoming a hub for tech companies and is now home to three large data centers – there is more we can do, and I will continue working to expand broadband access across Iowa. Paul of Sioux City – posted on Facebook: I had signed up for your newsletter. I thought your visit dates in Iowa would have been in there. Is there is an easier way to know when you visiting in our areas? Paul, thank you for signing up for my newsletter! It’s a great way to keep updated on what I’m working on in Washington and around Iowa. The best way to learn more about my 99 county tour and events happening across Iowa is by visiting my website: Ernst.Senate.Gov. Please be sure to check back often for updates as to when I’ll be in your area or nearby. Other folks who might be interested in updates on what I’m working on in Washington and around Iowa should sign up to receive my newsletter. To do so, visit my website: Ernst.Senate.Gov, and click the rotating banner on the homepage. Joshua of Altoona posted on Facebook: What are your thoughts of the ESEA reauthorization bill? The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or ESEA reauthorization bill, has gone through the markup process in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Senate Committee, and now awaits action on the Senate floor. I look forward to reviewing the specifics of the legislation and debating this important topic with my colleagues, because ultimately our children need and deserve access to a quality education. Because I firmly believe that Iowans know what is best for Iowa, it has always been my belief that education is best handled by folks at the local level rather than those in Washington, D.C. We need to empower parents and local educators to hold schools accountable, and to restore local control. Althea of Cedar Rapids – posted on Facebook: Now that your first 100 days are over, what's in store for your next 100 months? It has truly been an honor serving as Iowa’s Junior Senator, and I have wasted no time getting to work serving Iowans across our state. My top priority has been to make sure I am meeting with every Iowan possible who comes out to Washington and requests a meeting. Barring some reason like presiding over the Senate floor, I will always do everything in my power to make that happen – and I have already met with well over 1,600 Iowans who have visited. I will also continue visiting every county in Iowa as part of my 99 county tour. I want to hear from Iowans firsthand about their ideas to improve our nation. Here in Washington, I’m focused on implementing real solutions as we chart a new path forward – especially through my committee work. I am honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee; the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee; the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; and the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. I remain committed to helping grow a vibrant economy, cutting spending and balancing the budget, ensuring our veterans receive promised quality care and that our military has the tools to defend and protect our nation. I will continue to advocate for our Iowa farmers and our vital agriculture interests, and work to ensure the federal government runs more effectively and efficiently. # # #
04.30.2015	Washington, D.C. – The bipartisan, bicameral Iowa delegation, led by Congressman Dave Loebsack, today called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide any assistance they can under their statutory authority to help affected states combat the recent outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI H5N2), also known as bird flu. In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, the Members of Congress detailed the vested interest that the USDA has in containing and preventing the spread of this outbreak. As of today, Iowa has had eight confirmed cases and four probable cases of bird flu, affecting more than 10 million birds. Iowa is the nation’s leading egg-producing state. “Iowa leads the nation in egg production, producing approximately 16.5 billion eggs annually, and is ninth in turkey production. Within the past month, the HPAI H5N2 virus has impacted one-sixth of Iowa’s 59.5 million egg laying chickens and over 100,000 turkeys,” the Members of Congress wrote. “While there is no known risk of HPAI H5N2 transferring to humans, stopping the spread quickly is necessary to safeguard our country’s poultry and egg producers and ensuring a stable domestic supply of these foods that are an integral part of healthy diets for millions of Americans. Our nation has a vested interest in containing and preventing the spread to other Iowa communities and states, and ensuring consumers are not adversely impacted by increasing egg and poultry prices.” In the letter, the members of the Iowa delegation called on USDA to: Provide communities battling the avian influenza with all available assistance; Provide Members of Congress with time-sensitive updates on new cases and requests for further resources to help turkey farmers and egg producers; and Inform Congress of the economic impact that the poultry and egg reductions will have on producers and consumers. A copy of the letter can be found here. # # #
04.30.2015	The State Partnership Program helps U.S. military and civilian officials train, coordinate with foreign security forces WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) introduced bipartisan legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the National Guard State Partnership Program (SPP). The State Partnership Program Enhancement Act of 2015, which has a corresponding bill in the House of Representatives, will permanently codify the SPP into law, increase transparency and oversight, and address deficits in funding, coordination, and reporting. “This bill will improve the Program and consequently our relationships around the world, including the special partnership that Vermont shares with Macedonia and Senegal,” said Senator Leahy, co-chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus. “Through streamlined funding and improved coordination our Guard will have the tools they need to execute their tasks more efficiently. They and our regional commanders in the field deserve to have the program made to work better for their practical, on-the-ground needs.” “For more than 20 years, the State Partnership Program has advanced American interests around the world, strengthened our national security, and supported the military capacity of our allies,” said Senator Coons. “Aside from building critical and durable relationships with important allies, the SPP serves as a prime example of America’s commitment to peace and good government around the world. As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have seen the benefits of this program firsthand on many of my trips abroad, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve and extend this vital program.” “The State Partnership Program Enhancement Act is an important step forward for the National Guard’s valued relationship building program that encourages increased collaboration with our allies in support of defense security goals,” said Senator Ernst. “This legislation streamlines the SPP’s process – including ending multi-track funding streams – to make this important program more effective, efficient and ensure its long and successful future.” The SPP is a broadly supported, 22 year old program that is designed to promote American interests abroad by establishing cooperative relationships with foreign security forces and other government agencies to provide military-to-military and military-to-civilian training. The SPP takes advantage of the diverse skill sets of the men and women of the National Guard, who serve the United States as civilians, soldiers, airmen to meet unique U.S. security cooperation goals in countries around the world. In the long-term, it provides Combatant Commanders and Ambassadors with capabilities to achieve U.S. objectives and further demonstrates a commitment to building partner capacity abroad. The State Partnership Program Enhancement Act of 2015 would reauthorize the SPP, which is due to expire in September 2016. The bipartisan bill would also improve the program by enhancing reporting requirements, consolidating arcane funding mechanisms, and increasing cooperation between the Guard, the State Department, and our allies. Other co-sponsors include: U.S. Senators Shelly Capito (R-WV), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Gary Peters (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Patrick Toomey (R-PA), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR). # # #
04.29.2015	“The ever increasing and complex threats we face in the Middle East underscores how crucial it is that any longstanding agreement with Iran must go through Congress.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) took to the Senate floor to call for congressional approval of any final deal with Iran. Senator Ernst emphasized the need to preserve U.S. national security interests, those of our allies, and the need to maintain stability in the world. Click here or on the image below to watch Senator Ernst’s floor speech. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, I rise today to stress the importance of ensuring nuclear negotiations with Iran to preserve our national interests and our security; one that protects the security of our allies and partners in the region and maintains peace and stability in the world. As a member of the Iowa Army National Guard and serving on the Armed Services Committee here in the Senate, I am focused on strengthening our national security, developing strategies to confront terrorism, and discuss ways to support our exceptional military. While I believe Iran’s long-term goal is developing nuclear weapons, its most effective line of effort against us and our allies has been through its unwavering support of terrorism. The Obama Administration should only accept a final deal which prohibits sanctions relief until Iran abandons its support of terrorism. Providing Iran with sanctions relief would only enhance their opportunity to fund proxy groups which threaten our Israeli allies, and whose activities have led to horrible consequences to millions of people in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. While the Obama Administration has been seemingly eager to relieve sanctions in an effort to convince Iran to sign a nuclear deal, Congress cannot stand by and watch as a deal is negotiated that paves the way for Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. We must take a step back and examine their actions, and it is absolutely crucial we understand who is on the other side of the negotiating table. Iran continues to be the world’s lead sponsor of terrorism and a supporter of Syrian President Bashir al-Assad who is responsible for killing hundreds and thousands of his own people, creating the gravest humanitarian crisis in modern history, and who facilitates the continued rise of extremism and sectarianism across the region. Iran has shown unwavering support of terrorism and has aligned themselves with groups that are hostile to the United States, our allies and partners in the region. In fact, Iran continues to fund groups that threaten our Israeli allies who are very concerned about Iran amassing nuclear capabilities and the direct threat they pose to the region. After this long-standing pattern of behavior, I do not believe we can trust Iran will curb its ambitions or support for terrorist activity on their own. Despite any agreement that Iranian President Hassan Rouhani may agree to, I believe Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will ultimately maintain his policy of attempting to obtain a nuclear weapon, and may use any funds obtained through prematurely providing sanctions relief towards that end, as well as to support terrorists. Iran’s more than a quarter century long effort to obtain a nuclear weapon will not subside overnight. It is a faulty assumption to trust that Tehran is on the side of rule of law. Iran has a very troublesome track record when it comes to deception, when it comes to compliance and trustworthiness, which is why we need a deal that ensures America, and the world’s ability to verify and enforce any agreement with Iran. This includes complete and open access, at any time, to all of Iran’s facilities - to hold them true to their word and to verify their actions. We must also have the proper enforcement mechanism in place so that any broken promise garners an appropriate and immediate response. This accountability can be enforced through renewed and strengthened congressional sanctions. Sanctions have been effective in the past and we must keep this option on the table. In fact, these sanctions are what brought Iran to the negotiation table in the first place, so we must not be too quick to suspend them. The ever increasing and complex threats we face in the Middle East underscores how crucial it is that any longstanding agreement with Iran must go through Congress. This enables the American people to have a voice. Congressional review is supported by a bipartisan majority of my colleagues and a majority of Americans - it’s commonsense. We must have more oversight of this process, and the opportunity for thoughtful consideration to ensure we have been very clear about our demands and the framework of any final agreement. There is no doubt the Administration shares my concern, and the concern of many of my colleagues, regarding the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have been murdered with barrel bombs, Sarin gas, indiscriminate shelling of cities, and in prisons or the millions more who have been forced to flee their homes. We must stop Iran from supporting this criminal regime which has helped engulf the region. Sanctions relief without ensuring funds would not go to Assad or to terrorist groups such as Hezbollah, which is key to the survival of the regime, would do nothing to help achieve a favorable political or military solution in Syria. With that in mind, I cosponsored the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act which has bipartisan support and is before the Senate today. This legislation embraces fundamental and core principles that lay the foundation for a good deal with Iran. This deal ensures congressional review of a final agreement. It demands that no congressional sanctions be lifted during the review period, and it safeguards congressional oversight of Iranian compliance. This bill is a good starting point, and I want to praise the good work by the Chairman of the Committee for continuing to push for congressional review. Our ultimate goal must be to curb all Iranian terror, and this will never happen if we do not confront and contain Iran’s nuclear ambitions. I believe a final deal which does not address Iran’s support of terrorism and other groups which subvert recognized governments is not in the best interests of our nation, and an agreement without these assurances will miss an opportunity to provide stability in the region. In closing, the bottom line is that Iran must never be allowed to develop a single nuclear weapon – not now or at any point in the future. A nuclear Iran presents one of the greatest threats to peace and stability in our time. With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. # # #
04.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of Senators urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue strong biofuels volume requirements for the 2014 Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and beyond. The Senators asked the EPA to reverse course on their proposed 2014 rule to achieve the long-term and renewable energy goals originally intended by Congress. In a letter to the EPA, the Senators explained, “When Congress passed the RFS and it was enacted into law, the intent was a forward-looking policy that drives investments in both biofuels production and the infrastructure necessary to bring these biofuels to market.” The Senators added, “With its harmful 2014 proposed rule, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limited biofuels volume requirements based on available existing infrastructure, a condition that falls outside of the EPA’s clearly defined waiver authority provided by Congress in the RFS.” After sending the letter, Senator Ernst noted, “Iowa’s renewable fuel sector – including ethanol and biofuel industries – relies on a strong and long-term RFS so that our famers and producers can conduct and grow their businesses. As the EPA finalizes the rule, I will continue to push the EPA to issue renewable-fuel levels in RFS which encourage investment and innovation.” View the entire letter here. # # #

04.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after opposing the confirmation of Loretta Lynch as U.S. Attorney General: “I have serious concerns with Loretta Lynch’s intention to uphold President Obama’s policies – especially executive amnesty. We need a chief legal advisor who will fairly interpret the law and make independent and objective decisions not based on political motives. After closely reviewing her testimony, I am not confident that Ms. Lynch will act independently from President Obama when the role requires it and therefore could not vote to confirm her as Attorney General.” # # #
04.22.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) voted for the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178), to enhance law enforcement tools and support victims of human trafficking. Senator Ernst released the following statement upon passage: “Today marks an important step to combat the spread of human and sex trafficking. We can no longer turn a blind eye to the human rights crisis happening across the country. “The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act provides the much needed support to victims of this modern day slavery. It also enhances law enforcement’s ability to bring perpetrators to justice and brings forward stiffer penalties for criminals. “As a mother and grandmother, I am deeply pleased to see this bipartisan agreement move forward, and I will continue working to see such violence eliminated.” Senator Ernst has been working to move forward on passage of the anti-human trafficking bill for more than a month. About the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act: The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act provides law enforcement with the tools to crack down on human traffickers while also helping victims restore their lives Improves law enforcement’s ability to target and bring to justice those who purchase sex or labor from a trafficking victim Creates a deficit-neutral Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund Recognizes child pornography production as a form of human trafficking Requires traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pre-trial release, monitoring and detention Streamlines the ability of state and local task forces to obtain wiretap warrants in order to investigate crimes Creates a Human Trafficking Advisory Council composed of survivors to formulate recommendations to the federal government The bill is supported by a number of organizations, including Shared Hope International; Human Rights 4 Girls; Fraternal Order of Police; National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; National Children’s Alliance; National Criminal Justice Association; End Child Prostitution and Trafficking; PROTECT; National Association of Police Organizations; and National Conference of State Legislatures # # #
04.16.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today marks the 100th day since U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) was sworn in to serve as Iowa’s newest Senator. In less than 3.5 months, Senator Ernst has worked tirelessly to meet with and represent the people of Iowa, visiting more than half of Iowa’s counties on her 99 county tour, meeting with more than 1,200 Iowans in D.C., and introducing her first piece of legislation to expand mental health care services for veterans.

LETTER – Sex Trafficking: Senator Ernst signed a letter sent by all women Senators to Senators Grassley and Leahy (Judiciary Committee Chairman/Ranking Member) urging them to hold hearings on the problem of sex trafficking in the United States. A hearing was subsequently held on the matter. LETTER – VA 40-mile rule: Senator Ernst signed a letter asking the VA to review how it calculates the 40-mile rule regarding the Choice Card program. The VA originally calculated if you are within the 40-mile range by air/direct map calculation rather than by driving distance. The letter asked them to take into account driving distance to ensure veterans have greater access to services closer to home rather than being forced to drive great distances to VA facilities. The VA subsequently adopted the driving distance rule. LETTER – CoOportunity: Senator Ernst signed a letter with Senators Grassley and Fischer regarding the situation with CoOportunity Health.

The VA responded via email indicating they are in the pre-award clearance process with an award expected in Summer 2015, which means they expect to be able to start seeing patients in the new facility in Summer/Fall 2017. LETTER – Medicare Advantage Payments: Senator Ernst signed a letter with a group of 53 bi-partisan Senators (including Senator Grassley) urging the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services to maintain current payment levels to providers under the Medicare Advantage program.

LETTER – Renewable Fuel Standard: Senator Ernst signed a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding establishing biodiesel volumes under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

Co-Sponsorship CO-SPONSOR – Workplace Advancement Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation regarding the prohibition of wage discrimination and prevention of retaliation from employers against employees who inquire, discuss or disclose compensation information. CO-SPONSOR – 40-hour Work Week: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation which would change the definition of full-time work under Obamacare to 40-hours per week. Currently the law says it is 30-hours per week, which incentivizes employers to reduce hours to keep the number of “full-time” employees under certain thresholds. CO-SPONSOR – Repeal IPAB: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation which would repeal the Independent Patient Advisory Board (IPAB) created under Obamacare. This board is made up of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who are appointed by the president and are tasked with making substantial changes to Medicare—without full transparency and accountability to America’s seniors and their elected officials—based on arbitrary global budget targets. CO-SPONSOR – NLRB Ambush Election Rule: Senator Ernst co-sponsored a resolution of disapproval against the National Labor Relations Board “ambush” election rule. The rule would shorten the time between a request to organize a labor union and the actual vote, putting businesses at an unfair advantage to make their case against unionization. This legislation was passed by the Senate, but ultimately rejected by President Obama. CO-SPONSOR – Stop IRS Targeting: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the Stop Targeting of Political Beliefs by the IRS Act of 2015. This bill seeks to prevent further IRS targeting of conservative groups by reverting IRS standards and definitions for tax-exempt social welfare organizations under Section 501(c)(4) to the standards and definition in place on January 1, 2010 – prior to the agency’s inappropriate targeting. CO-SPONSOR – VA Accountability: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the Increasing VA Accountability to Veterans Act of 2015. This bill would grant the VA Secretary more authority to properly punish those senior executives who are found to have been involved in the wait list scandal which caused significant delays (and even deaths) within our VA system. CO-SPONSOR – Welcoming Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation welcoming Prime Minister Netanyahu regarding a speech before Congress in March. This resolution reaffirms the Senate's commitment to stand with Israel during times of uncertainty. It reaffirms this body's strong support for Israel's right to defend itself from threats to its very survival. CO-SPONSOR – Iran Sanctions: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the Nuclear Weapon Free Iran Act of 2015. This legislation is sponsored by Senators Kirk and Menendez and would impose new sanctions on Iran if international negotiators fail to reach a final deal by June 30 on Tehran's nuclear program. This legislation is sponsored by half the Senate in a bi-partisan fashion. CO-SPONSOR – LOCAL Level Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored the LOCAL Level Act. This bill strictly forbids the federal government from intervening in a state’s education standards, curricula, and assessments through the use of incentives, mandates, grants, waivers or any other form of manipulation. Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS) is the lead sponsor of this bill. CO-SPONSOR – Small Business Tax Credit: Senator Ernst is the lead Republican co-sponsor on legislation extending the small business tax credit given to employers who pay differential pay to Guard and Reservists called to active duty. CO-SPONSOR – Iran Nuclear Deal Approval: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation by Senators Corker and Menendez that requires Congressional approval of any nuclear agreement with Iran. CO-SPONSOR – Boys Town Commemorative Coin: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation providing a commemorative coin (at no cost to taxpayers) for the 100th anniversary of Boys Town. This legislation was subsequently passed by the Senate. CO-SPONSOR - Federal Vehicle Repair Cost Savings Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation by Senators Peters and Lankford requiring the federal government to use parts on its own vehicle fleet that are equal in safety, but cheaper than, certain on the shelf parts. The goal of the legislation is to ensure taxpayers are saving more money and that the government is not unnecessarily wasting money on parts. CO-SPONSOR – Inspector General Empowerment Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation by Senator Grassley regarding the powers of inspectors general within various federal agencies. It most notably would increase their subpoena power to help better ensure they can do their work effectively. CO-SPONSOR – Balanced Budget Amendment: Senator Ernst co-sponsored Senator Hatch’s Balanced Budget Amendment to the US Constitution. This legislation would require the federal government to have a balanced budget, in addition to other requirements such as a 2/3 vote to increase taxes to ensure that Congress simply does not (easily) choose to raise taxes to balance the budget, and a limitation on spending. CO-SPONSOR – REINS Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation that requires Congressional review/approval of costly/impactful regulations. This legislation is designed to exert more control over the regulatory process. CO-SPONSOR – Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation that would develop a special designation for providers that demonstrate strong knowledge of military culture and of medical treatments focused on the needs of troops and veterans. It would create a joint, searchable online registry of providers that earn this designation and update all DOD and VA online provider lists to indicate providers that have gained this voluntary designation. CO-SPONSOR – Guantanamo Bay Recidivism Prevention Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation to prevent recidivism by encouraging foreign countries to properly monitor former detainees. Specifically, it prohibits foreign assistance provided under the Foreign Assistance Act or Arms Export Control Act to a country if a detainee subsequently appear on the Administration’s detainee recidivist report. CO-SPONSOR - Campus Accountability and Safety Act: Senator Ernst co-sponsored legislation by Senator Gillibrand regarding sexual assault prevention on university campuses. This bill works to improve campus prevention, training, and support for situations surrounding campus sexual assaults. Appointment APPOINTMENT - West Point Board of Visitors: Senator Ernst was appointed by Chairman McCain to serve on the West Point Board of Visitors which reports to the President of the United States on recommendations relating to all aspects of the United States Military Academy at West Point. These can include: morale and discipline, curriculum, instruction, physical equipment, fiscal affairs, academic methods, and any other matters relating to the Academy that the Board decides to consider. # # #
04.15.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement on Tax Day: “Today is another painful reminder for Iowans of the frustrations they face due to our outdated and complicated tax code. Tax filing must be made easier for all Americans. Now is the time for Washington to come together to iron out loopholes to lower rates and create jobs, rather than just paying for more out of control government spending. “Americans deserve a fairer, flatter and simpler tax system, and I am committed to working with my colleagues to achieve commonsense, comprehensive tax reform.” # # #
04.14.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after voting for the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 2) containing a permanent “doc fix” to replace Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) formula for physician reimbursement: “Congress cannot continue its pattern of band-aid fixes for a fragmented Medicare payment system that fails to address the underlying issue. While this bipartisan reform legislation is not perfect, and I would have much preferred that its spending was fully offset, it does move us in the right direction by strengthening Medicare and starting the process of necessary entitlement reform. “I supported amendments that would have mandated this bill’s spending be offset, but regrettably they did not pass. However, I ultimately made the decision to support this bill because it will provide the much needed certainty and stability that our seniors, doctors, and rural community health centers deserve.” # # #
04.10.2015	Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on the EPA’s announced timeline for issuing Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) for 2014 through 2016: “Farmers and the entire renewable fuel sector in Iowa need a strong and long-term RFS to conduct and grow their businesses. While I am thankful to finally see a path forward on RFS, it is unacceptable the EPA has failed to act for so long. “The EPA must also get RFS right and not decrease renewable-fuel levels which would negatively impact consumer choice and Iowa’s critical ethanol and biodiesel industries. “Iowa is a leader in renewable fuels and I will continue to push the EPA to issue strong renewable-fuel standards which encourage investment and innovation." Senator Ernst previously invited EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to see how inaction on RFS directly impacts Iowans. # # #

03.30.2015	Last week, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered her maiden speech on the Senate floor and introduced her first piece of legislation, the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. This bill provides a back-stop to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health care treatment, other than an emergency room, and prioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the VA. What They Are Saying About Sen. Ernst’s Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act Quad-City Times Editorial: “This week, Ernst served veterans and Iowans wonderfully well with specific legislation and a passionate plea to fix a problem she knows better than perhaps any other U.S. senator.” (Quad-City Times, 3/27/15) Quad-City Times: “With strong words and clear resolve, Sen. Joni Ernst introduced her first legislation Monday in a floor speech we wish more Americans would hear.” (Quad-City Times, 3/27/15) Quad-City Times: “We’re among Iowans cheering Ernst’s sensible call to go outside the Veterans Affairs Administration when needed to give veterans faster, closer mental health care when VA hospitals and clinics cannot respond.” (Quad-City Times, 3/27/15) Quad-City Times: “We urge her congressional colleagues to heed the lieutenant colonel. Pass legislation providing immediate mental health treatment to these veterans who have faced the horrors of war for us.” (Quad-City Times, 3/27/15) Des Moines Register: “In her first floor speech since taking office in January, Ernst, an Iraq War veteran, devoted nearly all of her remarks to the needs of military veterans, saying they're not getting enough help transitioning back to civilian life.” (Des Moines Register, 3/23/15) KWQC: “Senator Joni Ernst introduced new legislation to help veterans get quick access to mental healthcare.” (KWQC, 3/23/15) KCAU: “Iowa U.S. Senator Joni Ernst is making the health of the nation's veterans the cornerstone of her first piece of legislation.” (KCAU, 3/23/15) Radio Iowa: “The bill would make hiring more psychiatrists a higher priority for the Veterans Administration, plus Ernst proposes expanding coverage so veterans could seek mental health care elsewhere if they’d have a lengthy wait at a VA facility.” (Radio Iowa, 3/23/15) KWWL: “Senator Ernst, as we all know, is a veteran herself and says that this bill is one that is very close to her heart.” (KWWL, 3/23/15) Support for the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act Senator Ernst discussed the legislation and support on KCRG. KCRG: “Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was quick to praise Ernst’s bill and speech after she yielded the floor. ‘[Ernst is] obviously bringing to the Senate real expertise about the needs that she addressed in her first piece of legislation. I expect it will enjoy broad bipartisan support, particularly with the sponsor having such firsthand knowledge of the needs of these returning veterans,’ McConnell said.” (KCRG, 3/23/15) Watch Leader McConnell’s full remarks here. WHO: “Sen. Ernst’s bill is already seeing support. Several senators have signed on as co-sponsors including Sen. Chuck Grassley. Also, the Wounded Warrior Project and Concerned Veterans for America have both signed on in support of the legislation.” (WHO, 3/25/15) WGEM: “Craig says it wasn't easy for Vietnam veterans like him to get treatment for PTSD through the VA. He says veterans have to wait several weeks to get into a VA clinic. ‘I think her sponsoring this bill is a very positive thing and I think the sooner people can get treatment the better,’ Craig said.” (WGEM, 3/25/15) WGEM: “Quincy psychologist Dr. Frank Froman says the wait is unacceptable. ‘It fills in a major gap obviously, because veterans have sometimes immediate and instant psychological needs and they can't wait for the average 34, 35, 36 days in order to get their first appointment for a screening,’ Froman said. Froman says the VA system is overloaded with veterans returning from Afghanistan and something needs to be done because waiting for care can lead to tragedy.” (WGEM, 3/25/15) Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s maiden speech. # # #

03.27.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Last night, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) voted in favor of the Senate Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2016. Senator Ernst released the following statement upon final passage: “When Iowans sent me to Congress, I pledged to cut wasteful and out of control spending that has consumed Washington and buried our nation in debt. “The budget resolution is an important step toward restoring fiscal responsibility and includes commonsense reforms to balance the budget, rein in government spending and get Washington moving in the right direction, while providing our military with the needed resources to protect our national security. “This balanced budget has the necessary fiscal framework to move our country forward, toward a stronger economy that Iowans deserve.” # # #
03.26.2015	“These amendments are commonsense reforms that uphold my commitment to Iowans to cut wasteful spending and be vigilant with taxpayer money.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) this week offered four amendments to the Senate Budget Resolution. The amendments would: Prohibit taxpayer money from paying for first class airfare; Improve mental health care services for veterans; Reform the allowance and perks available to former U.S. Presidents; and Ensure public comments on federal regulations are utilized more effectively. “These amendments are commonsense reforms that uphold my commitment to Iowans to cut wasteful spending and be vigilant with taxpayer money,” said Senator Ernst. “At a time when our nation is $18 trillion in debt, folks back home expect elected officials to be good stewards of their tax dollars. Examining the frivolous Washington spending from Capitol Hill to former Presidents, reining in burdensome rules and regulations, and ensuring our veterans receive the timely care that they deserve is a start. Rather than repeating the same failed ways of the past several years, now is the time to begin laying the foundation for a better and stronger country that Iowans – and all Americans – deserve.” Prohibit Taxpayer Money From Paying For First Class Airfare: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to prohibit use of taxpayer dollars for first class airplane travel by Members of Congress The American taxpayer deserves that Members of Congress be good stewards of the money they are given, especially at a time when the national debt exceeds $18 trillion. Although there are certain restrictions currently in place, it is important that Congress honor a commitment to spend taxpayer money wisely and not flying first class is just plain common sense. Read the full text of the amendment here. Improve Mental Health Care Services For Veterans: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund relating to improving mental health care services for veterans This amendment improves veterans’ access and choice for mental health care services, including expanding options outside the Department of Veterans Affairs. The average wait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days, while the VA acknowledges there are approximately 22 veteran suicides per day. If a non-VA mental health care professional can reach a veteran one day, one week or even two weeks earlier than 36 days, Congress nor the VA should be an obstacle. Read the full text of the amendment here. Reform The Allowance And Perks Available To Former U.S. Presidents: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund to protect taxpayers by reforming the allowance and perks available to former Presidents The Congressional Research Service (CRS), states that former Presidents received a pension just over $200,000 last year. According to POLITICO: “By Election Day 2016, taxpayers will have paid out more than $16 million to fund Bill Clinton’s pension, travel, office expenses and even the salaries and benefits of staff at his family’s foundation, federal records show. Since he left the White House in 2001, Clinton and his office have received more money through the Former Presidents Act than any other ex-president, according to a POLITICO analysis of budget documents.” Former Presidents are allowed “suitable office space, appropriately furnished and equipped” at any location within the United States - CRS indicates that President Clinton has an office space in New York, NY costing $414,380 annually and President G.W. Bush has an office space in Dallas, TX costing $420,506 annually. It is worth reevaluating how much taxpayers should be asked to provide for Presidential allowances and perks when they have generated significant income after leaving office through book sales and paid speeches. This would not target Secret Service or other security protection. Read the full text of the amendment here. Ensure Public Comments Are Utilized More Effectively: To establish a deficit neutral reserve fund to ensure public comments are utilized more effectively in the Federal rulemaking process The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) requires federal agencies to provide notice and must give “interested persons an opportunity” to comment on the proposed rule. There is growing concern and perception that the public’s comments are not being heard or not being considered in the same manner as others who may have larger influence. Farmers, ranchers, utilities, cooperatives, and small business owners are often those most impacted by rules and regulations. This amendment would help ensure all those who submit public comments are heard, and that all comments carry equal weight and equal consideration in the rulemaking process.

03.24.2015	“Currently, the average wait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days. We can – and must – do better for our veterans.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today announced growing support of the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. Senators Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Thom Tillis (R-NC), and John Cornyn (R-TX) have joined as original co-sponsors of the bill, in addition to endorsements by the Wounded Warrior Project and Concerned Veterans for America. This important legislation puts veterans’ mental health care first and provides a back-stop to U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mental health care treatment, and prioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the VA. “Currently, the average wait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days,” said Senator Ernst. “We can – and must – do better for our veterans. This legislation provides an option for our veterans to receive mental health treatment with VA Choice Act providers, until they can receive comprehensive mental health care treatment at the VA. I’m grateful for the growing support of this important legislation to ensure our veterans have access to the timely mental health care they rightly deserve.” “A veteran at risk for suicide can’t afford any delay in treatment,” said Senator Grassley. “He or she needs mental health treatment as soon as possible. As a matter of common sense, sometimes the first available facility is outside the VA system. This bill is a good idea to help veterans get the care they need when they need it.” “North Carolina is home to nearly 800,000 veterans, and that population is growing every day,” said Senator Tillis. “Unfortunately, we have not even begun to get a handle on the mental health needs of the many brave men and women who have served our nation. This legislation is an important first step towards getting more mental health professionals into the VA system and giving veterans the ability to quickly access mental health services when the VA cannot meet their needs.” “We can’t allow bureaucratic hurdles to stand in the way of veterans receiving prompt, accessible mental health care,” said Senator Cornyn. “When they can’t wait for care, they shouldn’t have to, and this bill will help ensure veterans get the treatment they need.” “The Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act of 2015 addresses the unacceptable wait times for mental health care at many VA facilities by giving veterans more control over their own health care- not VA bureaucrats,” said Pete Hegseth, CEO of Concerned Veterans for America. “It is outrageous that even after the implementation of the Choice Card program, veterans are still waiting on average over 30 days for a mental health care appointment, and we are grateful that Senators Ernst, Grassley, Tillis, and Cornyn are proposing concrete solutions to help get veterans the care they deserve.” About the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act: Amends the Veterans’ Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to allow a veteran instant authorization of non-VA care if the veteran provides an electronic or hard-copy statement in writing that they are not receiving adequate or timely mental health care at the VA. Eliminates the 40-mile and VA wait-time triggers for mental health care only under the Choice Act. Prioritizes incentives for the hiring of mental health care professionals at VA. Uses Choice Act funds to pay for the bill. Provides the VA 90 days to enact the program. # # #
03.23.2015	“Iowans and all Americans deserve real solutions for a quality, affordable health care system” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on the fifth anniversary of ObamaCare: “In the five years since ObamaCare was signed into law, Iowans and folks across the country have struggled with the painful effects of this poorly conceived and drafted law. Many Americans have faced rising premiums, increased out of pocket costs, been forced off of their health care plans, or have lost their doctors. “Iowans and all Americans deserve real solutions for a quality, affordable health care system –– which is why I’m working on reforms that address the many failures of ObamaCare. We must repeal and replace ObamaCare in order to craft and implement real solutions for affordable, patient centered health care.” Senator Ernst previously announced her co-sponsorship of full-repeal of ObamaCare. She also co-sponsored two bills, the Forty Hours Is Full Time Act of 2015 (S.30) and the Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act (S.141), that correct flaws within the failed health care law. # # #
03.23.2015	Introduced first piece of legislation: Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered her first speech, also known as her maiden speech, on the floor of the Senate.

Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s maiden speech. TRANSCRIPT: Mr. President, as we begin this week with the serious and necessary discussions about the budget, I rise today to talk about something that is very personal to me; something that is incredibly close to my heart—the service and sacrifice of our nation’s finest men and women—those that serve in our armed forces. And, as the budget process moves forward, we must ensure that our national security needs are met, and that our veterans can receive the much needed care and assistance they deserve. You see, growing up on a farm in rural southwest Iowa, my parents instilled in my sister, my brother and me the importance of hard work, service and sacrifice. In the summer between my freshman and sophomore years at Iowa State University, I was very fortunate to attend an agricultural exchange in Ukraine when it was still part of the former Soviet Union. The Iowa students and I lived on a collective farm for a number of weeks. In the evening, when the community members came together, we did not talk about agricultural practices like I anticipated. What we talked about was what it was like to be free. What it was like to be an American. Those were the things that the Ukrainians wanted to know. They wanted to know about freedom, our Republic - democracy. Just a few short years later, they became an independent nation. They are a sovereign nation. It was then that I better understood what it meant to have freedom and how much people elsewhere truly desire it. I wanted to do my part to ensure our country always remained free. That realization led me to make a decision when I was 19 years old, to join the Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps, commonly known as ROTC. For over two decades, I’ve had the great honor of wearing our nation’s uniform: today, I serve as a Lt. Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard and I’ve been privileged to have led and commanded at many levels from platoon to battalion. From 2003 to 2004 I served as a company commander in Operation Iraqi Freedom. My unit was tasked with running convoys through Kuwait and southern Iraq. As a solider, I learned firsthand the vital role that citizen soldiers play. Citizen soldiers are folks who train for military duty so they are prepared to defend in the face of an emergency. These men and women take on this task voluntarily and can be called upon to serve at any time. While overseas I had the opportunity to serve alongside some of the finest Americans, our bravest men and women. I saw firsthand how dangerous threats against our nation can be. It is becoming increasingly important that our military: our Active Duty, National Guard and Reserve are always working together as one cohesive unit. We are strongest in numbers, when working together to build one another up and support one another. Our mission is clear and we come from all corners of the country united on the same goal: to defend our freedom. I continue to remain focused on strengthening our national security both in my role in the Iowa National Guard and on the Armed Services Committee, where we discuss ways to support our exceptional military and develop bipartisan strategies to confront terrorism and destroy Al Qaeda, ISIS, and those radicalized by them. Here in the Senate, we also have an incredible responsibility to not only make sure our country is protected but to also ensure we live up to the promises made to our veterans. These men and women are trained and have selflessly sacrificed in defense of our freedoms, and our way of life. However, we must ensure that our veterans are prepared to transition back to civilian life. They deserve nothing less than the benefits they were promised and a quality of care we can all be proud of. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. According to the VA, there are approximately 22 veteran suicides per day. We hear this number from time to time – but think about it: 22 veteran suicides per day. In November 2014 testimony before the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, the VA’s chief consultant for mental health said, the average wait time for a mental health appointment at the VA is 36 days. We can – and must – do better for our veterans. If a non-VA mental health care professional can reach a veteran one day, one week, or even two weeks earlier than 36 days, Congress nor the VA should be an obstacle to affording a veteran potentially lifesaving mental health treatment. Veterans themselves are the only ones who know their mental health limit, and a veteran should receive the benefit of the doubt at where that limit is—not the VA. This is an issue that impacts all eras of veterans. Since coming to Washington, I’ve heard from many veterans on this very issue. One veteran in particular from the Vietnam War era admitted that he had twice attempted suicide. This veteran felt like he didn’t have anywhere to go. We have to do better. Today, as my first piece of legislation in the United States Senate, I am introducing the Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act. This legislation provides an option for our veterans to receive mental health treatment, until they can receive comprehensive mental health care at the VA. This authorization for mental health care treatment provides a back-stop, other than the emergency room, for our veterans. Ultimately, the ER should not be considered a back-stop for delayed mental health care at the VA, as most veterans who seek mental health treatment at emergency rooms do so when they have reached the limits of their suffering. There is no acceptable VA wait time for mental health care for our veterans. The limits to how much suffering a veteran can endure simply cannot be accurately measured by the VA or any medical professional. Specifically, this legislation puts veterans mental health care first and foremost, provides a back-stop to VA mental health care, and prioritizes incentives to hire more mental health care professionals at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The Prioritizing Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care Act does several things: First, it amends the Veterans’ Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to where a veteran is instantly authorized non-VA care if the veteran provides an electronic or hard-copy statement in writing that he or she is not receiving adequate or timely mental health care at the VA. This eliminates the 40-mile and VA wait-time triggers for mental health care under the Choice Act. Second, it prioritizes incentives for the hiring of mental health care professionals at VA. And third, it provides the VA 90 days to enact the program. I hope this legislation will receive broad bipartisan support, because ensuring our veterans have access to the mental health they deserve is not a conservative or liberal concept. It’s not a Republican or Democrat idea. It’s an American value. If we do not stand up for America’s tenacious survivors, who will? Thanks to these brave men and women, we are able to stand on this floor and fight for our beliefs and our ideals. These veterans fought for us and defended us tirelessly. They endured more than some of us can ever imagine. The invisible wounds of war can no longer go unnoticed. Now, it is our duty to do all we can to thank them and ensure they have access to the quality mental health care. The health care they deserve. God bless these men and women, and let us strive to do better for them. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum. # # #
03.18.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement in observance of National Agriculture Day: “As we recognize National Agriculture Day, we commend Iowa’s hardworking farmers and growing agriculture industries that play an integral role in our daily lives and our national economy. Iowa is a leader in corn, soybean, pork, ethanol and wind production – making it possible for one in five Iowans to work directly in agriculture or a related field. “It is an honor to serve on the Senate Agriculture Committee alongside Senator Grassley where I am focused on continuing to identify ways to innovate and enhance Iowa’s agriculture industry through job growth, energy innovation and economic development.” Senator Ernst serves on the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry. She chairs the Subcommittee on Rural Development and Energy. # # #
03.17.2015	“…You can’t dispute that there are still 6.5 million numbers that exist out there and even though they may not be drawing benefits on those numbers, it is still an issue whether it is voter registration or some other fraudulent use of a number so that is a concern.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – During yesterday’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC) hearing, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) pressed U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) Inspector General Patrick O’Carroll, Jr. and Senior Advisor to the Deputy Commissioner for Budget, Finance, Quality and Management Sean Brune on the SSA’s unreliable and inconsistent death master file, as well as the failure to implement prior recommendations to fix existing deficiencies. The hearing follows a recent audit showing 6.5 million active Social Security numbers for persons over 112 years of age. Click here to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Senator Johnson, I appreciate it. And thank you, everyone for your testimony today, I do appreciate it. Bottom line, up front, this is a situation we have to fix. I don't think anybody disagrees with that. So, what I would like to ask Inspector General O'Carroll, if you would please – what I'll do, I'll read this quote that came from the management at SSA, and this was in response to the IG’s findings and recommendations, “The recommendations would create a significant manual and labor-intensive work load, and provide no benefit to the administration of our programs.” Do you feel -- and I think we've talked about this, I heard some mention of this, but do you feel an accurate and reliable death master file is the responsibility of the SAA? MR. O’CARROLL: The easy answer on that is yes. That I think that any data that SSA is providing to the government, to the public has to be accurate. That was pretty much the reason why we identified the 6.5 million, is that anybody knows when you're doing audits and things like that, you're looking for large outliers, and that's what this group was, was a large outlier. So, yes on that, I understand if you ask Sean, what he's going to say is that none of them are getting benefits from SSA and that SSA’s primary responsibility is the benefit, but my point on it is that – I think a good reason for this hearing, is that if there is the attention put on it by Congress that SSA needs to, you know – needs resources or whatever it needs to fix it, that's very important. Because as I said before, is that there's so many other different benefits in the states, in the government, plus what we're looking at with voter registration, and we're looking at driver's licenses, everything else, it's all based on this thing, and this is the only thing that's out there to refute it. SENATOR ERNST: Yes, thank you, I would agree, and I think this is a good start. Yes, it is an easy answer to say yes, but we do know that now we need to move forward, and correct the deficiencies that are out there, there are so many improper payments that are going out, not to mention some of the issues that have been brought up with those not receiving payments, we also have fraudulent voter registrations, we have illegal use of numbers for employment or for government assistance, so many other issues that come with this, and I do believe that you have delivered around 70 recommendations to the Social Security Administration over the past number of years. And can you please tell us how many of those have been implemented over the years? MR. O’CARROLL: Yes, of the 70 that we've recommended, well, first there's two steps to that, the first step is an agreement, we're getting about a 93% agreement level out of SSA. But, out of that 70, probably about 50 have been enacted. And, in fairness on some of them, as Sean just mentioned, is in the last six months, we've made maybe four or five audits with a lot of different recommendations on it, that they haven't had time enough to implement, but as an example on it, is that we watch them very closely, we go back every few years and take a look to see if they agreed with something, whether or not it was implemented, and if it wasn’t, we bring it to their attention. SENATOR ERNST: And then with these recommendations and any others that are coming out, can any of you please to the panel just really give an overall cost estimate, man hours, additional time, any of those parameters that might, might be necessary to make sure that corrections were implemented? MR. BRUNE: Senator, the recommendations that Mr. O’Carroll just mentioned that we agreed with, we're committed to making those changes within our appropriation. I did want to highlight that several of the Inspector General’s recommendations have improved our process. We find high value in following the advice the Inspector General has given us. I did want to close by underscoring the fact that as we stated earlier, in Mr. O’Carroll’s testimony as well as mine, the 6.5 million old records that Mr. O'Carroll looked at identified zero improper payments. In totality, death information for Social Security purposes is very, very accurate. Less than 1% of our benefit overpayments are resulting from death. Our processes have improved tremendously over the years, and the last decade our processes have grown substantially more robust. We're getting more accurate information, more timely, and we're able to intercept over $50 million of benefit dollars from over payments before they even get issued. So $50 million a month does not go out the door because of the accuracy and timeliness of the death reports we receive. SENATOR ERNST: And that is a good thing, however you can’t dispute that there are still 6.5 million numbers that exist out there and even though they may not be drawing benefits on those numbers, it is still an issue whether it is photo registration or some other fraudulent use of a number so that is a concern. MR. BRUNE: Correct. And I was just talking to Mr. O’Carroll before the hearing, and we have committed in our audit response to look at those records before the end of the fiscal year to do a full analysis of what can be used from those records to add dates of death or a death indicator to our database. SENATOR ERNST: Very good, if Mr. Brune, if you were a lawmaker for a day what would your recommendation be, just bottom line, very easy. What would you recommendation be to this Congress? MR. BRUNE: Fund all states to use electronic death reporting. The adoption rate has been steady since 2002 when we started, we only have 37 states and two jurisdictions. We need all states, all jurisdictions in every state using electronic death reporting. It is the most effective, accurate report we receive. SENATOR ERNST: Ok, I do appreciate that. Thank you very much for your testimony today, thank you. Thank you Mr. Chair. # # #
03.16.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of senators in a letter urging U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Sylvia Burwell and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Tom Vilsack to reject the Obama Administration’s Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s inconsistent and misleading recommendations on meat consumption. The proposed guidelines to limit the amount of red meat in a healthy diet would have a negative impact on Iowa’s livestock and pork industries. In the letter, the senators detailed that “This statement ignores the peer-reviewed and published scientific evidence that shows the role of lean red meats as part of a healthy diet. Furthermore, the statement is misleading as it suggests current American diets include too much meat. Government data shows the protein food category is the only food group being consumed within the 2010 daily recommended values.” “Not only do we represent farmers and ranchers who raise animals to provide healthy meat products, but we also represent consumers who enjoy lean meat as an important food in their diet,” the senators added. “The inconsistencies brought forward in the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee’s report are significant.” In addition to the letter, Senator Ernst emphasized, “Rather than using a method based in sound health science, the committee opted to take a political track when determining their recommendation. The authors of the report left out lean red meat as a vital component of a healthy diet, which is very troublesome. This is in direct contrast to the countless number of dietitians and nutritionists who advocate for the consumption of lean red meat, and which would also have significant negative economic impacts on Iowa’s livestock and pork industries.” View the original letter here. # # #
03.13.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C.— Senator Tom Cotton (Arkansas) along with fellow freshman Senators James Lankford (Oklahoma), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Thom Tillis (North Carolina), and Mike Rounds (South Dakota) this evening returned from a trip to the Naval Station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Senators toured the Guantanamo Bay base, observed detention operations, and met with military commanders. "First, the Servicemembers stationed at Guantanamo Bay have a difficult job. They are true patriots who deserve our thanks and praise,” said Senator Cotton. “Guantanamo Bay is a first-rate detention facility that houses some of the world’s most hardened terrorists. It’s one of our most effective counterterrorism tools. After visiting today, I remain firm in my belief that this facility should not only remain open—but that we should not shy away from increasing the number of prisoners held there.” "Having seen the Guantanamo Bay detention facility for the first time, I have even more confidence that our men and women in uniform are performing an important security function for our nation. I thank them for the difficult work they do every day," said Senator Lankford. "It’s important that we keep this detention facility open to keep our nation safe and prevent terrorists from reengaging on the battlefield against America." “Today’s visit provided invaluable firsthand knowledge of its mission to protect our nation from the world’s most dangerous terrorists, and to hear from military commanders about the important role Guantanamo Bay has in ensuring our national security,” said Senator Ernst. “As a National Guard member, I believe it is also critical to see the conditions that our National Guard and Reserve servicemembers face while carrying out this important mission. I am very proud of their service that is given there. More than ever, it is clear how vital it is to our national interest to keep these terrorists at Guantanamo Bay.” “Guantanamo Bay houses some of the most heinous and evil criminals of our time – the worst of the worst -- and my visit today reinforces my belief that we must keep this facility open,” said Senator Tillis. “I thank our servicemembers at Guantanamo Bay for their incredible devotion to our country, and I will work to ensure this facility remains open and continues to play a key role in our nation’s effort to defeat the terrorist threat.” "As terrorism against America and our allies continues unabated, I was pleased to see for myself the work being done at GTMO to protect our country from those who seek to destroy us,” said Senator Rounds. “The men and women stationed at Guantanamo Bay play an important role in counter-terrorism efforts while making sure the detainees are treated humanely. I have no doubt this is the right place to detain them - now and in the future.” Senators Joni Ernst, Thom Tillis, and Mike Rounds are members of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senator James Lankford is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Senator Tom Cotton is a member of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. # # #
03.12.2015	"As the mother of three beautiful daughters, and as someone who as a young woman volunteered my time, my energy at a women's crisis shelter that dealt with many of these forms of abuse, this is important legislation.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Republican Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), Republican Conference Chairman John Thune (R-SD), and Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) in a press conference on Senate Democrats’ partisan obstruction of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S.178). This legislation would aid victims of human trafficking and enhance law enforcement tools. This legislation previously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously and includes ten Democratic co-sponsors. Senator Ernst urged Democrats to end the political theatrics and move forward on this important legislation. Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: First, thank you all for coming today, and Senator Cornyn thank you very much for working so diligently on this legislation. Again, thank you for being here. As the mother of three beautiful daughters, and as someone who as a young woman volunteered my time, my energy at a women's crisis shelter that dealt with many of these forms of abuse, this is important legislation. This legislation is near and dear to my heart. So it is very disheartening to see the partisan politics, the political theatrics that we are seeing this week with this important legislation. Human trafficking cannot be allowed to continue. It shouldn’t exist. And this is essentially modern-day slavery. We have the opportunity to do something about it, and we must do something about it. Senate Democrats in the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to bring this bill forward, and as my colleagues have stated the language that is found in this bill is nothing new. This is language that has existed for 39 years. So essentially, what they are saying is, ‘It was hidden, it was hidden.’ It was not hidden. This is language that again has been in existence. We're maintaining the status quo with this legislation. So Senate Democrats, either failed to read that bill or again they are just playing partisan politics and political theatrics with an important issue. Again, as a mother, as a grandmother, we cannot allow our children to be victimized. And now that we have the opportunity to do something about it, we must push this issue, and we must bring this bill forward for a vote. I want to emphasize again that Senate Democrats voted unanimously to bring this bill out of committee, and as stated earlier, there were 10 co-sponsors, Democratic co-sponsors of this bill. So, I am imploring our Senate Democrats to stop the theatrics. Let's take the opportunity to do something very important for not only our nation's children, but other children that are being brought into the United States. Let’s enforce these laws, let’s bring forward stiffer penalties, and let's protect our children. Again, thank you for being here this afternoon. About the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act: The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act provides law enforcement with the tools to crack down on human traffickers while also helping victims restore their lives Improves law enforcement’s ability to target and bring to justice those who purchase sex or labor from a trafficking victim Creates a deficit-neutral Domestic Trafficking Victims’ Fund Recognizes child pornography production as a form of human trafficking Requires traffickers to be treated as violent criminals for purposes of pre-trial release, monitoring and detention Streamlines the ability of state and local task forces to obtain wiretap warrants in order to investigate crimes Creates a Human Trafficking Advisory Council composed of survivors to formulate recommendations to the Federal Government Democrats are suddenly opposing the Hyde Amendment which is included in the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act. The Hyde language was included in the legislation three months ago and has been the law for almost four decades Ten Democratic co-sponsors have signed onto the bill while all Senate Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to bring this bill out of committee # # #
03.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to President Obama calling for a detailed response regarding circumstances in which? equipment has potentially been provided to Iraqi Shia militia groups supported or controlled by Iran. The letter details Iran’s past efforts to undermine U.S. and Iraqi interests through their relationship with Iraqi Shia Militia groups, and urges the Obama Administration to increase its oversight to ensure Iranian supported Iraqi Shia Militia do not obtain U.S. military support or equipment. “As a veteran who served in both Kuwait and Iraq during the Iraq War and as a Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a duty to ensure neither American taxpayer dollars, nor the efforts of our service members, go toward supporting our adversaries,” Ernst wrote, “I believe the Administration must increase its oversight of the Iraq Train-and-Equip mission to ensure neither U.S. military support, nor equipment, is obtained by Iranian supported or controlled Iraqi Shia militia.” Ernst continued “I would request a detailed response from your Administration regarding the frequency and the amount of equipment we have provided to the Iraqi government which has then been provided to the Iraqi Shia militia groups supported or controlled by Iran. Furthermore, I would request a detailed response to the level of support and equipment provided by the Iraqi government to the Kurdish Peshmerga and Sunni tribal forces, and if that support has been received in a less timely manner than the support provided to Iraqi Shia militia from the Iraqi government.” View the entire letter here. # # #
03.11.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) cosponsored Senator Joe Donnelly’s (D-IN) Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act. This legislation creates a voluntary new designation for health care providers who demonstrate a strong knowledge of military culture and medical treatments focused on servicemembers and veterans – specifically pertaining to mental health. This is especially important for Military Reserve and National Guard servicemembers who primarily rely on non-DoD/VA providers for their health care. The Iowa Senator is the lead cosponsor of the bipartisan legislation. “Our servicemembers and veterans in Iowa and across this nation deserve health care providers who have the know-how to manage the particular needs of the military community – especially when it comes to mental health,” said Senator Ernst. “Senator Donnelly’s voluntary designation would encourage health care providers to utilize existing resources and training to ensure they deliver the quality care that our men and women in uniform deserve.” Senator Donnelly said, “Increased demand for DoD and VA mental health services have required servicemembers, veterans, and their families to increasingly rely on private community providers. In Indiana and around the country, community providers are vital mental and physical health resources for our veterans and servicemembers, especially members of the National Guard and Reserves. I am proud to partner with Senator Ernst on the bipartisan Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act, which would strengthen the quality of care for our servicemembers and veterans by helping improve community provider access to and recognition of military cultural competency training and use of DoD-VA clinical practice guidelines.” The Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act Requires the DoD and VA to: Develop a special designation for providers who demonstrate strong knowledge of military culture and of medical treatments focused on the needs of troops and veterans Create a joint, searchable online registry of providers who earn this designation Update all DOD and VA online provider lists to indicate providers that have gained this voluntary designation # # #
03.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today joined a group of senators challenging the Obama Administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives’ (ATF) proposed ban on the M855 cartridge, an ammunition commonly used in the nation’s most popular rifle, the AR-15. This ammunition has been exempt under the 1986 Law Enforcement Officers Protection Act (LEOPA) due to the AR-15’s classification as “primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes.” Now ATF is seeking to remove this exemption and make it unlawful to purchase the ammunition. In the letter, led by Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), the senators detailed, “Earlier, ATF recognized the proper scope of LEOPA. ATF has always granted an exemption to the M855 5.56 x 45mm cartridge from the LEOPA ban because it recognized that this ammunition fell squarely within the ‘sporting purposes’ test. It did so because factually, as well as legally under the legislative language, such cartridges were and are widely used by millions of law-abiding gun owners for ‘sporting purposes.’ These cartridges are prevalent for one of the most commonly possessed rifles, the AR-15. Congress did not, and did not intend to, ban this form of ammunition.” The senators added, “Second Amendment rights require not only access to firearms but to bullets. If law-abiding gun owners cannot obtain rifle ammunition, or face substantial difficulty in finding ammunition available and at reasonable prices because government entities are banning such ammunition, then the Second Amendment is at risk.” View the original letter here. # # #
03.06.2015	Thank you to everyone who submitted questions this week! Below are my most recent answers to questions Iowans asked me on social media: Caleb from Early, Iowa – posted on Facebook: Every time I talk to younger people that are my age about politics and what's going on with our nation they tell me things like "oh I don't keep up with stuff like that" or "that's not something that interests me." All the while I'm thinking that we are the ones that have to inherit the mess. How can we get them engaged in the process and open their eyes to what's going on? Thank you, Caleb, this is a great question. As President Ronald Reagan once said in a commencement address at the University of Notre Dame: "We need you. We need your youth. We need your strength. We need your idealism to help us make right that which is wrong. Each generation goes further than the generation preceding it because it stands on the shoulders of that generation. You will have opportunities beyond anything we've ever known." I firmly believe America’s greatness comes from the people not government. And to President Reagan’s point, your generation will discover more than my generation can ever imagine. For too long, folks in Washington have had the mentality that they know best. While I have only been in Washington for a couple of months, it’s clear that Washington has a lot to learn from hardworking Iowans. I believe that you, your friends, your family and neighbors know what is best for Iowa -- more than those in Washington. With that in mind, I launched a 99 county tour around Iowa so I can hear from students, young adults, parents, seniors, teachers, farmers, business owners and everyone in between. It is so important to make your voice heard and to stand up for what you believe in. Tell your friends I want to hear from them too. Tell me what you want to see Washington accomplish. As you said, Caleb, your generation will have to live with the decisions made by my generation. Encourage them to speak up now! I list my 99 county tour events on my website www.Ernst.Senate.Gov, but if you can’t make it to an event, send me an email at https://www.ernst.senate.gov/content/contact-joni, or call my office. Remember, I work for you and my door is always open. Thank you for getting involved. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Deena from Western Iowa – tweeted: @SenJoniErnst Contact the ATF and demand they reverse their decision to ban commonplace M855 and SS109 rifle ammunition. I share your concern and am working to reverse the Obama Administration’s efforts to ban M855 ammunition most often used with AR-15 rifles. It is unclear where the Administration’s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) believes it has obtained the authority to oppose or exempt particular cartridges. ATF’s most recent decision seems unfounded, as no federal statutes can interfere with the ability of law-abiding citizens to obtain ammunition commonly used for such legitimate purposes like sporting, target shooting and hunting. Our Second Amendment rights require not only access to firearms – but the bullets we use with them. If law-abiding gun owners cannot obtain rifle ammunition because government entities are standing in the way, then the Second Amendment is at risk. Bryor from Fort Madison, Iowa – posted on Facebook: Senator Ernst, I would like to see initiatives to bring broadband Internet to rural Iowans. I live north of Fort Madison and cannot get Internet even though I live close to 50+ homes and the Internet providers are within a couple of miles. The government needs to offer help to these companies to bring Internet to us. Without it we are left behind with the rest of the world. I would like you to sponsor a bill for this. I look forward to your response! As I’ve mentioned, I believe that Iowans know what is best for Iowa more than those in Washington. Iowa is a rural state so access to broadband internet is very important. Rural Iowans need to have this access to expand their businesses and take advantage of the innovative technology that’s involved with agriculture. I support Governor Branstad’s proposal to expand broadband connectivity in rural Iowa, Connect Every Acre. This would encourage service providers to build networks not just at the endpoints but to rural communities in between. # # #
03.04.2015	Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) co-sponsored Senator Gary Peters’ (D-MI) bipartisan Military Reserve Small Business Jobs Act of 2015, to extend a tax credit for small businesses that provide differential pay to military reservists and National Guard members called to serve on active duty. Senator Ernst, the lead co-sponsor, released the following statement on the legislation: “Our military reservists and National Guard members in Iowa and throughout our nation stand ready to serve and deserve the peace of mind and financial security to provide for their families once they have activated. “This important bipartisan legislation provides a tax credit for small businesses to provide differential pay for our military reservists and National Guard members on active duty. We must support these brave men and women in uniform - and their families - who sacrifice for our nation.” Read the full release here. # # #
03.04.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office has provided an update regarding U.S. Senator Joni Ernst’s (R-IA) request for an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. Senator Ernst’s inquiry followed news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. The Veterans Affairs Inspector General’s office has initiated a review of the mental health care provided to Richard Miles. The VA IG will share these findings with Senator Ernst once they are complete in approximately one month. “I’m pleased that the VA IG has begun initiating a review. We must ensure that our veterans have the access they deserve to quality mental health care. If there are systemic problems that exist, we must work to correct those as quickly and efficiently as possible. I look forward to hearing the findings from the VA IG’s review,” said Senator Ernst. On February 23rd, Senator Ernst sent a letter to the VA IG detailing that “It is tragic our nation lost a veteran who may not have received the mental health treatment he deserved.” Ernst continued, “As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it has made to its veterans. Furthermore, as someone who deployed in support of the Iraq War, it is my top priority to ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve after selflessly sacrificing for our nation. I request your office conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System mental health care programs, treatment provided to veteran Richard Miles, and Mr. Miles’ requests for mental health care and the subsequent treatment received.” View the letter here. # # #
03.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) will attend the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu address to a joint session of Congress. The Iowa Senator is also among 52 cosponsors to the resolution (S.Res.76), welcoming the Prime Minister to the United States in anticipation of his address. “As we face ever increasing global challenges, especially in the Middle East, it is crucial we recognize our relationship with Israel and stand behind our longtime friend, trusted ally and important partner for our nation,” said Senator Ernst. “A nuclear Iran is a threat to Israel – and our nation – and we ought to hear from our best ally in the Middle East on this important issue. The United States must confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions and take the necessary steps to support Israel in their right to defend itself. I look forward to hearing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today.” The Prime Minister will address the joint session at 10 am CT. You can stream live here. # # #
03.03.2015	Today Senator Joni Ernst attended the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s address to a joint session of Congress and issued the following statement: “Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave a commanding speech that needed to be heard by the American people from our closest ally and strategic partner in the Middle East – Israel. The response to today’s speech was overwhelmingly positive from both Democrats and Republicans alike. “I wholeheartedly agree that the United States cannot stand by and watch Iran assemble nuclear capabilities which presents a grave threat to Israel and our nation. This is not an idle threat from Iran. "As I have said, the U.S. must confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions and take the necessary steps to support Israel in their right to defend itself." # # #
02.27.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement regarding the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding and the President’s executive amnesty: “For the last several weeks, I have voted five times to fund the Department of Homeland Security. As a soldier and member of both the Homeland Security Committee as well as the Armed Services Committee, I have made clear that I want to find a meaningful path forward. “I have heard from Iowans throughout the state who adamantly oppose President Obama’s executive amnesty. I agree and voted today on legislation on behalf of Iowans to override the President’s executive amnesty. “We must continue working toward a solution to stop this overreach by the President while also working to preserve our national security. This morning’s vote did not accomplish that in one package and I want to do what we can through this one-week continuing resolution to continue working together toward that goal before funding expires.” The House and Senate tonight passed a continuing resolution to fund DHS for one week at current funding levels. # # #
02.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Congress will send President Obama the Keystone XL Pipeline Act (S.1), a jobs and infrastructure bill authorizing construction of a cross-border pipeline to transport oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), an original cosponsor to the bipartisan legislation, released the following statement: “I urge President Obama to reconsider his previous veto threat and work with Congress on this bipartisan effort to enact the Keystone XL Pipeline jobs bill into law,” said Senator Ernst. “This commonsense legislation would help create thousands of new jobs, grow our economy and provide important energy infrastructure developments to move our country forward. The president has a major opportunity to show willingness to work alongside this new Congress and support this important jobs and infrastructure bill.” President Obama has 10 days to decide whether he will sign the bill or veto it. About The Keystone XL Pipeline Act: The cross-border pipeline will carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast. According to the U.S. State Department, oil will be transported safely with minimal impact to the environment, and cause no disruption to the development of Canadian oil sands. This project contains strong protections and will comply with federal, state and local authorities. The Keystone XL Pipeline sets up basic energy infrastructure for future needs and is necessary to the progress of our country. Construction of the pipeline will stimulate the American economy through the creation of 42,000 new construction jobs and add an estimated $3.4 billion to GDP. This project has been under review for over six years and encountered numerous unnecessary delays by the Obama administration. There is broad-based support behind construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO. On February 11, the House of Representatives passed the Keystone XL Pipeline Act with bipartisan support by a vote of 270 to 152. On January 29, the Senate passed the Keystone XL Pipeline Act with bipartisan support by a vote of 62 to 36. # # #
02.24.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today introduced Iowa farmer Mr. Clay Mitchell to testify before the first Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing of the 114th Congress. Mr. Mitchell is a fifth generation corn and soybean farmer from Tama County who testified on his experiences with the implementation of Farm Bill programs. Click here to watch. TRANSCRIPT SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chairman. First, I wanted to say how excited I am to be part of this committee. Thank you very much for that selection.

And today, I have the pleasure of introducing Mr. Clay Mitchell who is a fifth generation corn and soybean farmer from Tama County, which is just south of Waterloo, Iowa. His studies and techniques have driven innovation in many areas of farming such as wireless farm networking, no-till farming, and grain storage automation. Mr. Mitchell is not only a farmer from Iowa though; he has also participated in the World Economic Forum in Davos and is Managing Director of Fall Line Capital. And on behalf of Senator Grassley and myself, I want to welcome you here today, Mr. Mitchell. And it’s always good to have an Iowan here in Washington, D.C and we look forward to your testimony. Thank you so much. # # #
02.23.2015	“It is critical to hear and see how your proposed changes to WOTUS and failure to put forth required levels for the RFS could, and have, impacted farmers, biofuel producers, and all of the important related industries.” WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today invited Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Gina McCarthy to Iowa to hear how proposed EPA regulations would directly impact Iowans. The invitation follows growing concern over the EPA’s inaction on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and the EPA’s efforts to redefine the Waters of the United States (WOTUS). In a letter sent to Administrator McCarthy, Senator Ernst detailed that while she looks forward to discussing these issues during hearings through the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, she also believes it is critical that the EPA “fully understand first-hand the impact that these regulatory actions are having on everyday Iowans.” “Therefore, I would invite you to visit Iowa and directly engage with the people impacted the most by your regulatory choices. It is critical to hear and see how your proposed changes to WOTUS and failure to put forth required levels for the RFS could, and have, impacted farmers, biofuel producers, and all of the important related industries,” Ernst continued. The letter below comes on the heels of Iowa Governor Terry Branstad’s recent meeting with Administrator Gina McCarthy where he raised these issues with the EPA directly. February 23, 2015 Gina McCarthy Administrator U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. Washington, DC 20460 Dear Administrator McCarthy: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and its regulatory choices have significant consequences on the lives and livelihood of Iowa’s agricultural industry—as well as many others. Inaction on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and your efforts to redefine the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) are of great concern to me and the many Iowa citizens who are impacted. In his meeting on Friday in Washington, I know that Iowa Governor Terry Branstad raised these issues with you directly. I also look forward to engaging you through hearings and oversight from my membership on the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. However, I also believe it is critical for you to fully understand first-hand the impact that these regulatory actions are having on everyday Iowans. Therefore, I would invite you to visit Iowa and directly engage with the people impacted the most by your regulatory choices. It is critical to hear and see how your proposed changes to WOTUS and failure to put forth required levels for the RFS could, and have, impacted farmers, biofuel producers, and all of the important related industries. Thank you for your time and attention to this request. Sincerely, United States Senator Joni Ernst # # #
02.23.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs requesting an examination of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System’s mental health programs. The inquiry follows recent news coverage of the death of veteran Richard Miles in Des Moines. In a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Senator Ernst detailed that “While the law enforcement investigation into Richard’s death is on-going, it is tragic our nation lost a veteran who may not have received the mental health treatment he deserved.” Ernst continued, “As a member of the Senate, I have a responsibility to ensure our nation lives up to the promises it has made to its veterans. Furthermore, as someone who deployed in support of the Iraq War, it is my top priority to ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve after selflessly sacrificing for our nation. I request your office conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the VA Central Iowa Health Care System mental health care programs, treatment provided to veteran Richard Miles, and Mr. Miles’ requests for mental health care and the subsequent treatment received.” View the entire letter here. # # #
02.22.2015	REINS Act Would Hold Elected Officials Accountable To Approve New Major Rules & Regulations Rather Than Bureaucrats U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced she has cosponsored legislation to rein-in federal regulations. The Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act of 2015 (S.226), commonly referred to as the REINS Act, requires Congress to approve major rules issued by federal agencies. The Iowa Senator is among 32 cosponsors to the legislation reintroduced by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY). “Iowans know the burden of red tape and overregulation,” said Senator Ernst. “The REINS Act restores transparency and accountability in Washington by requiring congressional approval for burdensome new rules and limiting the reach of federal government agencies. It’s common sense to hold elected officials accountable to review and approve new major rules and regulations that will have a significant impact on Iowans – and folks across the country – rather than allow nameless bureaucrats unfettered control. We must continue working to find solutions that enable our economy to thrive rather than being stymied under burdensome federal rules and regulations.” About The REINS Act: Designates a ‘major rule’ as any rule or regulation that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) determines to have a yearly economic impact of $100 million or more. Requires passage by a roll call vote in Congress and presidential signature before any new ‘major rule’ can be enacted. Gives Congress the ability to block burdensome new rules and regulations imposed by federal agencies. Restrains the power and broad discretion of federal agencies to impose significant ‘major rules’ without congressional oversight or public discussion. Paves the way for transparency and accountability within the federal rulemaking process. # # #
02.20.2015	February 20, 2015 The Honorable John Boehner Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Office of the Speaker H-232 The Capitol Washington, D.C. 20515 Dear Speaker Boehner: We write to you today to respectfully request that you consider inviting the President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, to speak before a joint session of Congress when he visits Washington, D.C. during the last week of March 2015. To say that a secure and stable Afghanistan is in the vital national security interest of the United States is a tremendous understatement. Afghanistan was the place where the attacks of 9/11 were planned with al Qaeda enjoying a safe haven as the honored guests of the Taliban. Since then, our presence in Afghanistan has served as a front line defense for our homeland and continues to be of vital importance for our nation and the region. Giving President Ghani the ability to directly address the American people is critical to building American support to preserve strategic gains in Afghanistan, which have been won at such great cost and sacrifice by our men and women in uniform. There is no more symbolic platform to address our country than the unique and singular format of a joint session of Congress. Since taking office, President Ghani has impressed us on many levels. One of President Ghani’s first acts in office was to sign the Bilateral Security Agreement with the United States ensuring that the stable partnership created over a decade earlier would continue for years to come. As commander in chief of a nation at war, he immediately focused on the critical role of the security forces and removed impediments to a more robust and effective security partnership with the international coalition. We recently had in-depth talks with President Ghani at the international security forum in Munich, Germany regarding recent security and political developments in Afghanistan, and we believe that his message should be heard by all members of Congress and the American public. The United States, our NATO allies, and partner nations who participated in operations in Afghanistan since 2001, have stood with Afghanistan as it transitioned from a failed state to one that successfully completed its first democratic presidential transition. To continue public support for our partnership with Afghanistan, it is important and appropriate for the American people to hear President Ghani’s commitment to values that will ensure future progress. By extending the opportunity for President Ghani to speak to a joint session of Congress, we feel that he will be able to explain just how much Afghanistan has changed for the better since 2001, how under his leadership it will continue to flourish, and how important American partnership is to Afghanistan’s future security and stability. Sincerely, Lindsey O. Graham, United States Senator John McCain, United States Senator Kelly Ayotte, United States Senator Jeanne Shaheen, United States Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Senator Mike Pompeo, Member of Congress Ted Cruz, United States Senator Joni Ernst, United States Senator Bob Corker, United States Senator Mac Thornberry, Member of Congress Chris Murphy, United States Senator Jim Langevin, Member of Congress Eliot Engel, Member of Congress # # #
02.15.2015	In an effort to rollback parts of ObamaCare, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced her co-sponsorship of two bills that correct major flaws within the failed law. The Iowa Senator has cosponsored the Forty Hours Is Full Time Act of 2015 (S.30) and the Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act (S.141). The Forty Hours Is Full Time Act of 2015 has bipartisan support and was reintroduced this Congress to restore the traditional definition of a full time employee to 40-hours per week. The Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB). Senator Ernst also previously announced her co-sponsorship of full-repeal of ObamaCare. “The failures of ObamaCare need to be addressed head-on. These commonsense reforms are necessary steps to fix the painful effects of ObamaCare,” said Senator Ernst. "That includes removing obstacles for our small businesses and ensuring seniors have control over their health care – not unelected Washington bureaucrats. It is critical that we repeal and replace ObamaCare with real solutions for affordable, patient centered alternatives for Iowans - and folks across the country." About The 40 Hours Is Full Time Act: The Forty Hours Is Full Time Act restores the traditional definition of a full-time employee to 40 hours. A 40-hour work week definition is supported by business groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, National Retail Federation, National Federation of Independent Businesses, and the National Restaurant Association. The companion bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 252 to 172. Concerns With The IPAB & About The Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act: The IPAB is a 15-member board of unelected political appointees with authority to make decisions relating to seniors’ personal health care. The IPAB has the power to make changes to Medicare – without transparency and accountability to America’s seniors. Many insurance provider groups have voiced concern over IPAB, stating that it could negatively impact access for Medicare recipients. The Protecting Seniors’ Access to Medicare Act would repeal the IPAB. # # #

02.12.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after the Senate Armed Services Committee completed markup for S.165, the Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of 2015, a bill to restrict the transfer of detainees from Guantanamo Bay. The Iowa Senator joins 25 cosponsors to the bill originally introduced by Senators Kelly Ayotte (R-NH), John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Richard Burr (R-NC). “Guantanamo Bay is home to some of the most dangerous terrorists and their release to another location poses a serious threat to America and our allies,” said Senator Ernst. “We face increasingly complex and dangerous terrorist threats, and transferring these detainees to the United States or elsewhere only further jeopardizes the safety and security of our country. This legislation includes necessary measures to enhance our national security, and time to develop a long-term strategy.” The Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of 2015 heads to the Senate chamber for full consideration. The Detaining Terrorists to Protect America Act of 2015: Suspends international transfers of medium to high risk detainees Prevents detainee transfers to Yemen Establishes higher standards for international transfers of detainees Extends the current ban on detainee transfers to the United States Prohibits any construction or modifications of US facilities to house detainees Increases transparency of the risk assessments of current detainees # # #
02.11.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA), a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, released the following statement regarding President Obama’s proposed Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF): “Today Congress received President Obama’s Authorization for the Use of Military Force proposal to combat ISIS and those fighting with them. This is a very important decision and is worthy of thoughtful, deliberate consideration and debate. Our mission is clear: we need a serious bipartisan solution to destroy ISIS and those radicalized by them. I look forward to continuing to discuss the President’s proposal and the most effective and efficient path forward with my colleagues and military leaders in the time ahead.” # # #
02.10.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement after the Senate Armed Services Committee passed by a roll call vote the nomination of Dr. Ashton Carter as Secretary of Defense: “I support Dr. Carter’s nomination as he has shown strong support and dedication to our service members and their families. Dr. Carter has proven he is willing to speak candidly to the Senate Armed Services Committee and it is my hope that he will serve as an independent mind and voice within the administration to improve our national security strategy and the welfare of our service members in this time of war, fiscal uncertainty and rising new challenges. If confirmed by the Senate, I look forward to working with Dr. Carter to ensure the Department of Defense has the tools needed to protect our nation, American interests, and to effectively partner with our allies,” said Senator Ernst. The Senate Armed Services Committee nominated Dr. Carter by a vote of 25 – 0. The Senate is expected to vote on the confirmation of Secretary of Defense nominee Dr. Ashton Carter later this week. # # #
02.09.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C – Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Deb Fischer of Nebraska and Joni Ernst of Iowa today pressed the health care agency in charge of federally created health care co-ops for answers on helping the Iowans and Nebraskans who are caught in the bad timing of CoOportunity’s collapse. CoOportunity is the co-op serving Iowa and Nebraska that ran out of money and collapsed in December. “These customers didn’t know CoOportunity was about to collapse,” Grassley said. “If they had, they might have been able to make other arrangements to avoid paying out of pocket costs for 2015 in CoOportunity. Instead, the people who have already paid out thousands of dollars in their deductibles and co-payments for this year are left in the lurch. CMS needs to explain how it will help these individuals.” “I have heard from many Nebraskans who have been negatively affected by the failure of CoOportunity Health,” Fischer said. “These Nebraskans are now forced to decide whether to give up the health care that they chose or lose the subsidies they were promised. Some have already contributed hundreds, even thousands, of dollars toward their deductibles and out of pocket costs only to find their money will not count toward a new plan. I hope this administration will provide a suitable answer for how it plans to help these individuals and how they plan to address these serious problems.” “The failure of CoOportunity Health is very disappointing as thousands of Iowans now face uncertainty over their health care,” Ernst said. “We need answers from CMS regarding their knowledge of CoOportunity’s problems and we need a workable solution for every Iowan who has paid out of pocket costs towards their deductible. I will continue to push for solutions to achieve a sustainable health care system that provides quality, affordable benefits for Iowans – and all Americans.” CoOportunity failed during the customer re-enrollment period for 2015 after the federal government said there would be no additional federal loan money available for the co-op. It’s unclear whether the federal government communicated adequately with co-op and state officials about the lack of available funding. With adequate information and notice, co-op and state officials might have been able to dissuade CoOportunity customers from re-enrolling and thereby avoid out of pocket costs for customers in 2015. Now, these customers are faced with starting over with another plan and paying out of pocket costs for their new plan. Grassley featured the experience of an Iowa family that wrote to him about being caught in CoOportunity’s timing in a hearing with the top federal health care official last week. The senators continue to hear from constituents who have paid their out of pocket costs for 2015 through CoOportunity and are worried about additional expenses through starting over with a new plan. The text of the senators’ letter is available here. # # #
02.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – During yesterday’s Senate Armed Services Committee nomination hearing, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) asked President Obama’s Secretary of Defense nominee Dr. Ashton Carter about the impact that sequestration has had on the Reserve and National Guard. Senator Ernst also addressed rising threats – particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe – and the need to ensure that our Guard and Reserve units maintain their ability to reinforce the active duty component as effectively as they have since our nation was attacked on September 11, 2001. Senator Ernst later asked Dr. Carter about the impact of cyber security threats on our military’s acquisition strategy, and his thoughts on where the government should be in regards to protecting national security versus personal privacy. Senator Ernst emphasized the heavy reliance on networking tools throughout the ranks of the military and timeliness of cyber security threats in the wake of recent attacks. Click here to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Dr. Carter, for being here today. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Also, Senator Lieberman, thank you for joining us today. As we sat down in my office the other day, one thing that hopefully was very clear to you was my passion for the National Guard and the Army reserves, and all Reserve members. Actually. And so we have spent a considerable amount of time talking in this forum about sequestration and the effects on our services, not just our active duty forces but also those that serve as wonderful weekend warriors. So I would love for you to please address the panel, and just talk -- talk to us and explain to us those impacts that you have seen regarding sequestration and how it has impacted those Reserve and National Guard forces, please. DR. ASHTON CARTER: Thank you, senator, and by the way, thank you for your own service. Appreciate it. And I begin by saying that we owe a great debt of gratitude to the Guard and Reserve, for what they've done over the last 12, 13 years. We couldn't have done, I know this from the time I was in the Department of Defense previously, in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were at their peak, we couldn't have sustained the tempo of combat in those two locations without the contributions of the Reserve component of our military. So if there's ever a time when they're value was made clear, it's been in the last 10 to 12 years. And they are impacted, as every other part of the Defense Department is, by sequester. That's the terrible thing about sequester. It's everybody and it hits them hard. And it hits them soon. Which means that we don't have time to adjust. So I think the Guard and Reserve component have borne the impact of sequester as all the rest of the departments have. Sad to say. SENATOR ERNST: And thank you for that. I appreciate that. If confirmed, we do -- we do have a number of rising threats that we see all around the world. And specifically, in the Middle East right now. So considering those threats, with many new possible deployments, coming up, then if confirmed, how do we ensure that our Guard and Reserve units then maintain their ability to reinforce our active duty component, as effectively as they have in the past dozen years? How do we ensure that they're being supported? DR. ASHTON CARTER: Thank you for that. And that is the key issue, as you well know. And I think that the Reserve component forces need to be as prepared to go in to action, if they're called to go in to action, as any active duty element. But you never want to send anybody into harm's way on behalf of the United States who hasn't had the training, and isn't fully prepared, and isn't adequately equipped to do the job. So I think it's important that the Guard and Reserve are at a state of readiness that is commensurate with the need we have for them, and in -- one other thing I'll add is that they also not incidentally at all, very importantly, play a role in responding to disasters in our own country. That's another important and, by the way, also amply demonstrated in recent years, attribute of having them. So both for defense of civil authorities, and for deployment in a national security emergency, they need to be fully ready when we need them. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you much Dr. Carter and thank you Mr. Chairman. Click here to watch. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, Mr. Chair. Again, thank you, Dr. Carter from being here today. As a military we have moved a very long ways away from using the old compass and map. Many of our systems now are very heavily networked. We rely very much on technology for our weapon systems, for our command and control systems and that is really our primary tools for achieving dominance over our adversaries on the battlefield. But what we are seeing now is cyber security threats, cyber attacks that are looming out there. And a number of countries out there including Russia, China, North Korea, probably many others, have very sophisticated means of attacking networks. And how do you see that impacting our acquisition strategy as we move forward? And how do we best protect our equipment, protect our personnel moving forward? DR. ASHTON CARTER: I think you said it exactly the way I see it. You understand, but perhaps others around the country don't understand that not only is our civilian infrastructure susceptible to cyber attack, but we have to be concerned about our military infrastructure because exactly as you say, there's no point in having planes and ships and armored vehicles in today's world if the network, is itself, vulnerable. And I think -- I hope I can work together if I'm confirmed by this Committee on improving our cyber defenses, many aspects of cyber. One is the defense of our own networks in the Department of Defense. That is, not where it should be in terms of making them immune to attack by a potential enemy that would impair our own forces, engaged with that enemy. So that – I agree with you entirely. SENATOR ERNST: Yes, thank you. We rely on networking so very much from the simple ordering of a part for a Humvee to targeting, you know, the enemy on the battlefield. It goes from every level from your squad level all the way up through the ranks. Do you have an opinion on this, just your opinion, because it is more than just the military and the department of defense and our network security, we could look at attacks to our financial institutions, to our utilities as being a security risk for the United States also. Do you have an opinion on where the federal government should be in regards to protecting our national security interests versus the privacy of individuals out there that might be using the network? DR. ASHTON CARTER: I do. I have some understanding of that issue. And I would say that the federal government does have a role in protecting the country from a cyber attack in the same way it has a role in protecting the country from other kinds of attack. And I think it can do a lot more to exercise that responsibility without causing concerns over invasions of people's privacy and so forth. So, for example, the government can share information and knowledge it has collected about threats to private networks with those private parties provided the proper legal safeguards are provided which have less to do with privacy than they do with anti-trust and other aspects that are important. I think that the government can sponsor and conduct R&D that improves the trade craft in network defense for the good of the country. So, I think there's a lot we can do. And we're not anywhere near where we should be as a country. I think if we were as unprotected in some other domain that was more familiar to ordinary people, they would be clamoring for us to do more. I think if people fully understand what you understand about how vulnerable we are in cyberspace, they would want us to do more, not in any way that compromised anybody's privacy but they would want us to be doing do a lot more than I believe we are doing now. SENATOR ERNST: Thank you, I appreciate that. I think this will continue to be a vexing problem for us moving forward. This is a situation that we are dealing with in many of our separate committees but I do appreciate your opinion very much. Thank you very much Mr. Chair. # # #
02.05.2015	“They are a sovereign nation. They are an ally” WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) joined a bipartisan group of Senate Armed Services Committee members in a press conference calling attention to the worsening situation in Ukraine, a sovereign nation and ally of the United States. The bipartisan group of Senators urged President Obama to act with this united Congress to provide lethal assistance to Ukraine. Click here to watch Senator Ernst’s remarks. Click here to view the entire press conference. TRANSCRIPT: SENATOR ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you Ranking Member Reed. It’s great to be here with my colleagues on an issue that we all agree upon. Many, many years ago I was very fortunate and had the privilege of attending an agricultural exchange in Ukraine while it was still part of the former Soviet Union. And we lived, the Iowa students and myself, lived on a collective farm for a number of weeks. And in the evening, when the community members came together, we did not talk about agricultural practices as I anticipated. What we talked about was what it was like to be free and what it was like to be an American, those were the things that the Ukrainians wanted to know. They wanted to know about freedom and democracy. And just a few short years later, they became an independent nation. They are a sovereign nation. They are an ally. So I am in full agreement that we do need to provide lethal assistance to our friends in Ukraine. To President Poroshenko to push back on aggression on coming from President Putin and Russia. So, I would encourage all of you to take this word, show that we are moving as a unified Congress in acting that we provide lethal assistance to our allies. The world will determine if we are friends to our allies around the world, and also in the same token, in protecting our own national security interests. So again Chairman, thank you. Senator Reed, thank you for allowing us to be here today. # # #
02.05.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced she has co-sponsored a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, introduced by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT). “A balanced budget amendment is a commonsense way of reining in Washington’s out of control spending,” said Senator Ernst. “All across Iowa, hardworking families and businesses must balance their budget every day, and the federal government should be no exception. It’s time to restore fiscal responsibility to our government and begin laying the foundation for a better and stronger economy that Iowans – and all Americans – deserve.” Balanced Budget Amendment Requires the Government does not spend any more than it takes in, unless agreed upon by two thirds of both the House of Representatives and Senate Mandates the Government does not spend in excess of 18 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) Requires any legislation that includes a new tax, tax increase or an increase in the overall collection of taxes must pass both the House of Representatives and Senate with a two-thirds majority Prohibits an increase of the federal debt limit, unless agreed upon by three-fifths of both the House of Representatives and Senate # # #
02.04.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) announced her co-sponsorship of S.339 to repeal the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” also known as ObamaCare. The Iowa Senator is among 47 original cosponsors to the bill, introduced by Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), which authorizes full repeal 180 days after enactment in order to allow a six-month window to replace ObamaCare with patient centered, affordable, quality solutions. “Too many Iowa families and businesses have been hurt by the painful effects of ObamaCare – from rising costs, to losing access to doctors, to hampering businesses’ abilities to hire new employees. We must start over by repealing and replacing this disastrous law in order to craft and implement real solutions for affordable, patient centered alternatives,” said Senator Ernst. # # #
02.03.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today voted in favor of H.R. 203, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act, a bill to strengthen mental health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). This legislation is named in honor of veterans’ advocate, Marine Cpl. Clay Hunt, who struggled to find adequate mental health care and later committed suicide. “The invisible wounds of war cannot go unnoticed. The Clay Hunt SAV Act lays the groundwork for improved mental health care that our returning men and women deserve,” said Senator Joni Ernst. “This bipartisan legislation would provide the added support our veterans deserve by building and expanding programs like peer-to-peer support systems; recruitment of mental health professionals; collaboration between the VA and non-profit mental health organizations; and increased oversight of the VA. It is critical that President Obama works with us and signs the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law to ensure that our veterans have the access they deserve to quality mental health care." The Clay Hunt SAV Act passed the Senate by a vote of 99 to 0. The bipartisan bill was re-introduced by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT). About the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans (SAV) Act The bill requires th?e Secretary of Veterans Affairs to evaluate the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ mental health care and suicide prevention programs each year. A measure in the bill establishes a peer-to-peer support pilot program to improve access to mental health services for veterans, and assist veterans in their transition from active duty. A measure in the bill establishes an educational loan repayment program for psychiatrists of the Veterans Health Administration, aimed to attract and retain psychiatrists. The bill increases collaboration between the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and non-profit mental health organizations in the united effort to prevent suicide among veterans. The bill has widespread support from veterans’ organizations across the country, including the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. The Clay Hunt SAV Act passed the House of Representatives earlier this month with unanimous support. # # #
02.02.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following statement on President Obama’s fiscal year 2016 budget proposal which calls for $4 trillion in spending, nearly $500 billion in deficit spending, $640 billion in new tax revenue, and fails to balance the budget: “President Obama’s budget is more of the same tired ideas – it fails to balance the budget while creating more taxes, more spending, more debt and bigger government. The stale mindset of this Administration has led to failed policies without real solutions for the challenges we face. “In Iowa and all across the country, folks elected this new Congress with a clear mandate: to work on behalf of the people. We must balance the budget and move forward on a roadmap that includes meaningful reforms such as simplifying our outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. “Let’s work together to increase accountability and eliminate waste to ensure our government runs effectively and efficiently. I hope President Obama will work with this new Congress to implement the kind of meaningful reforms that hardworking Iowans deserve.” # # #
01.29.2015	WASHINGTON, DC. – Senator Pat Roberts (R-KS), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, named Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) as the Subcommittee Chair on Rural Development and Energy.

We are ready to get to work.” Senator Ernst will also serve on the subcommittees of Nutrition, Specialty Crops and Agricultural Research as well as Livestock, Marketing and Agricultural Security. # # #
01.29.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) today voted in favor of S. 1, Keystone XL Pipeline Act, a jobs and infrastructure bill authorizing construction of a cross-border pipeline to transport oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Iowa Senator is among 60 original cosponsors to the bipartisan legislation authored by Senators John Hoeven (R-ND) and Joe Manchin (D-WV). After working through an open amendment process, the Senate passed this legislation with bipartisan support by a vote of 62 to 36. “The Keystone XL Pipeline will help create thousands of new jobs, add billions to our economy, and provide important energy infrastructure developments,” said Senator Ernst. “President Obama can no longer delay the Keystone XL Pipeline which has widespread support – from members of his own party, unions, and a majority of Americans. I strongly urge President Obama to join Congress in supporting this commonsense, bipartisan legislation to move our country forward.” BACKGROUND The cross-border pipeline will carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day from Alberta, Canada to U.S. refineries along the Gulf Coast. According to the U.S. State Department, oil will be transported safely with minimal impact to the environment, and cause no disruption to the development of Canadian oil sands. This project contains strong protections and will comply with federal, state and local authorities. The Keystone XL Pipeline sets up basic energy infrastructure for future needs and is necessary to the progress of our country. Construction of the pipeline will stimulate the American economy through the creation of 42,000 new construction jobs and add an estimated $3.4 billion to GDP. This project has been under review for over six years and encountered numerous unnecessary delays by the Obama administration. There is broad-based support behind construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and AFL-CIO. ###
01.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. - Last night Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) delivered the Republican Address to the country. Senator Ernst laid out the new Republican Congress’ plans to get Washington back to work for Iowans and people across the country. If you missed it, you can watch the address here. What They Are Saying… Kathie Obradovich, Des Moines Register: “She told the story to illustrate the frugality and hard work of Americans like those in Red Oak, Ia. It was just as charming on the national stage as it was on the campaign trail in Iowa. Ernst delivered her address with polish and a toothy smile, avoiding the pitfalls that have befallen some of her predecessors who have given the GOP response.” (Des Moines Register, 1/20/15) Associated Press: “Ernst, 44, sprinkled her policy prescriptions with a personal touch, recounting her youth on her family's farm in Red Oak, Iowa. She described plowing fields, working mornings at a Hardees restaurant and wearing plastic bread bags over her only pair of good shoes on rainy school days.” (Associated Press, 1/20/15) Yahoo News: “From the outset of her remarks, Ernst’s message and tone conveyed moderation and affability, with a polite but firm challenge to the president to work with Republicans on issues such as tax reform, trade and job creation. ‘Even if we may not always agree, it’s important to hear different points of view in this great country. We appreciate the president sharing his,’ Ernst was planning to say, according to prepared remarks. ‘Tonight, though, rather than respond to a speech, I’d like to talk about your priorities.’” (Yahoo News, 1/20/15) POLITICO: “…a fresh face for the party with a compelling life story and natural political talents, and a symbol of the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill.” (POLITICO, 1/20/15) Roll Call: “Ernst has enraptured Republicans in a way that few other politicians have done. Her friendly, effusive personality has been winning people over.” (Roll Call, 1/20/15) Mason City Globe Gazette: “Ernst offered a big agenda. She called tearing down trade barriers in Europe and the Pacific to ‘sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages and jobs right here at home.’” (Mason City Globe Gazette, 1/20/15) Real Clear Politics: “…leaders find the 44-year-old woman from Red Oak to be among the party’s most refreshing new faces, and hope that viewers who see and hear her in their living rooms or on the mobile devices tonight start to think of people like her when they think of the Republican Party.” (Real Clear Politics, 1/20/15) KWQC: “’There’s a lot of pride in Iowa that somebody from Iowa has been chosen to do it and clearly this is a real opportunity for her and the State of Iowa,’ said Rep. Dave Loebsack, (D) Iowa, 2nd Dist.” (KWQC, 1/19/15) Financial Times: “Ernst… described the President’s ideas as ‘stale’ and sought to grab the mantle of economic dynamism for the new GOP-controlled Congress.” (Financial Times, 1/20/15) Fox News: “Sen. Joni Ernst hammered home the idea of a new Republican Congress ready to champion the middle class in America as well as go after terrorists abroad.” (Fox News, 1/20/15) Reuters: “Republicans who now control Congress will push back against President Barack Obama's agenda with legislation to create more jobs, Republican Senate newcomer Joni Ernst said in her State of the Union response on Tuesday.” (Reuters, 1/20/15) CBS News: “In her response, Ernst -- the first female combat veteran ever to serve in the Senate -- also spoke about the threat from extremists. ‘We've been reminded of terrorism's reach both at home and abroad; most recently in France and Nigeria, but also in places like Canada and Australia,’ said Ernst, who donned a pair of camouflage high heels for the night. ‘Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief... The forces of violence and oppression don't care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them.’” (CBS, 1/20/15) Washington Post: “Freshman Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) offered a smoothly delivered, personal and populist message that sought to draw a contrast with President Obama in the official GOP response to Obama’s State of the Union address.” (Washington Post, 1/20/15) CNN: “And she has another trait that drives Democrats crazy: She seems nice. Not New Jersey nice or California nice, but Iowa nice, which anyone who has ever stepped foot in Iowa knows is really, really nice.” (CNN, 1/20/15) Click here to watch Senator Joni Ernst deliver the Republican Address. # # #
01.21.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) in her first Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Hearing on “Global Challenges and U.S. National Security Strategy” asked about how the U.S. can more effectively engage Turkey to combat ISIS and other threats that exist within the Middle East. The Senator questioned the panel of two former U.S. National Security Advisors: Brent Scowcroft, President of the Scowcroft Group and Dr. Zbigniew K. Brzezinski, Counselor and Trustee at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Click here to watch Senator Ernst question the panel. TRANSCRIPT SEN. ERNST: Thank you Mr. Chairman, thank you gentlemen for being here today, I appreciate your service very much. Today we have talked a lot about ISIS in the Middle East and the fact that we do need partners in that region, we do need those Arab allies to come forward, and you’ve mentioned it, both of you, as more of an aside comment, but I would really like to understand how we can more effectively engage Turkey – which is an ally, which is a friend in that region – How can we engage them more to combat ISIS and those other threats that exist within the Middle East? BRENT SNOWCROFT: The Turks are playing a role, it’s partly worrisome a little, partly very helpful. The Turks have a large minority in their country who are Kurd, and so they have multiple concerns about what goes on. They also have very emotional feelings about Syria. But I think we can help the countries of the Middle East, Turkey is one, with great military capability. As I say, Egypt is another one. Egypt is a large country in any part of the world and they ought to want to shape their own region in the right direction and we ought to encourage that rather than taking their place in forming the region. SEN. ERNST: Thank you – I do agree, and I just would love to know more concrete methods of engaging them. They do have a lot at stake in that region, and I think they could be valuable partners. I just would love to know how we get them to play a greater role in that. Thank you very much gentlemen today, thank you Mr. Chairman. # # #
01.20.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – Following is the full text of the Republican Address to the Nation by Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA), as prepared for delivery: “Good evening. “I’m Joni Ernst. As a mother, a soldier, and a newly elected senator from the great State of Iowa, I am proud to speak with you tonight. “A few moments ago, we heard the President lay out his vision for the year to come. Even if we may not always agree, it’s important to hear different points of view in this great country. We appreciate the President sharing his. “Tonight though, rather than respond to a speech, I’d like to talk about your priorities. I’d like to have a conversation about the new Republican Congress you just elected, and how we plan to make Washington focus on your concerns again. “We heard the message you sent in November — loud and clear. And now we’re getting to work to change the direction Washington has been taking our country. “The new Republican Congress also understands how difficult these past six years have been. For many of us, the sting of the economy and the frustration with Washington’s dysfunction weren’t things we had to read about. We felt them every day. “We felt them in Red Oak — the little town in southwestern Iowa where I grew up, and am still proud to call home today. “As a young girl, I plowed the fields of our family farm. I worked construction with my dad. To save for college, I worked the morning biscuit line at Hardees. “We were raised to live simply, not to waste. It was a lesson my mother taught me every rainy morning. “You see, growing up, I had only one good pair of shoes. So on rainy school days, my mom would slip plastic bread bags over them to keep them dry. “But I was never embarrassed. Because the school bus would be filled with rows and rows of young Iowans with bread bags slipped over their feet. “Our parents may not have had much, but they worked hard for what they did have. “These days though, many families feel like they’re working harder and harder, with less and less to show for it. “Not just in Red Oak, but across the country. “We see our neighbors agonize over stagnant wages and lost jobs. We see the hurt caused by canceled healthcare plans and higher monthly insurance bills. We see too many moms and dads put their own dreams on hold while growing more fearful about the kind of future they’ll be able to leave to their children. “Americans have been hurting, but when we demanded solutions, too often Washington responded with the same stale mindset that led to failed policies like Obamacare. It’s a mindset that gave us political talking points, not serious solutions. “That’s why the new Republican majority you elected started by reforming Congress to make it function again. And now, we’re working hard to pass the kind of serious job-creation ideas you deserve. “One you’ve probably heard about is the Keystone jobs bill. President Obama has been delaying this bipartisan infrastructure project for years, even though many members of his party, unions, and a strong majority of Americans support it. The President’s own State Department has said Keystone’s construction could support thousands of jobs and pump billions into our economy, and do it with minimal environmental impact. “We worked with Democrats to pass this bill through the House. We’re doing the same now in the Senate. “President Obama will soon have a decision to make: will he sign the bill, or block good American jobs? “There’s a lot we can achieve if we work together. “Let’s tear down trade barriers in places like Europe and the Pacific. Let’s sell more of what we make and grow in America over there so we can boost manufacturing, wages, and jobs right here, at home. “Let’s simplify America’s outdated and loophole-ridden tax code. Republicans think tax filing should be easier for you, not just the well-connected. So let’s iron out loopholes to lower rates — and create jobs, not pay for more government spending. “The President has already expressed some support for these kinds of ideas. We’re calling on him now to cooperate to pass them. “You’ll see a lot of serious work in this new Congress. “Some of it will occur where I stand tonight, in the Armed Services Committee room. This is where I’ll join committee colleagues — Republicans and Democrats — to discuss ways to support our exceptional military and its mission. This is where we’ll debate strategies to confront terrorism and the threats posed by Al Qaeda, ISIL, and those radicalized by them. “We know threats like these can’t just be wished away. We've been reminded of terrorism’s reach both at home and abroad; most recently in France and Nigeria, but also in places like Canada and Australia. Our hearts go out to all the innocent victims of terrorism and their loved ones. We can only imagine the depth of their grief. “For two decades, I’ve proudly worn our nation’s uniform: today, as a Lt. Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. While deployed overseas with some of America’s finest men and women, I’ve seen just how dangerous these kinds of threats can be. “The forces of violence and oppression don’t care about the innocent. We need a comprehensive plan to defeat them. “We must also honor America’s veterans. These men and women have sacrificed so much in defense of our freedoms, and our way of life. They deserve nothing less than the benefits they were promised and a quality of care we can be all be proud of. “These are important issues the new Congress plans to address. “We’ll also keep fighting to repeal and replace a health care law that’s hurt so many hardworking families. “We’ll work to correct executive overreach. “We’ll propose ideas that aim to cut wasteful spending and balance the budget — with meaningful reforms, not higher taxes like the President has proposed. “We’ll advance solutions to prevent the kind of cyberattacks we’ve seen recently. “We’ll work to confront Iran’s nuclear ambitions. “And we’ll defend life, because protecting our most vulnerable is an important measure of any society. “Congress is back to work on your behalf, ready to make Washington focus on your concerns again. “We know America faces big challenges. But history has shown there’s nothing our nation, and our people, can’t accomplish. “Just look at my parents and grandparents. “They had very little to call their own except the sweat on their brow and the dirt on their hands. But they worked, they sacrificed, and they dreamed big dreams for their children and grandchildren. “And because they did, an ordinary Iowan like me has had some truly extraordinary opportunities -- because they showed me that you don’t need to come from wealth or privilege to make a difference. You just need the freedom to dream big, and a whole lot of hard work. “The new Republican Congress you elected is working to make Washington understand that too. And with a little cooperation from the President, we can get Washington working again. “Thank you for allowing me to speak with you tonight. “May God bless this great country of ours, the brave Americans serving in uniform on our behalf, and you, the hardworking men and women who make the United States of America the greatest nation the world has ever known.” ###

01.15.2015	WASHINGTON, DC – Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) today announced that U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) will deliver the Republican Address to the Nation following the State of the Union address on Tuesday, January 20, 2015. “Sen. Ernst brings a unique perspective to the Senate. She is a mother, a soldier, and an independent leader who serves in Washington because Americans voted for change in the last election, and Joni understands that middle-class Americans want Congress to get back to work and that they want Washington to get refocused on their concerns, instead of those of the political class,” Majority Leader McConnell said. “Sen. Ernst’s life is a quintessential ‘only-in-America’ story. She built a campaign by listening to the people of Iowa and focusing on their priorities, especially jobs and our still-struggling economy. She knows that our federal government is too big, our spending is too high, and our tax code is broken. And, she knows first-hand the sacrifices our men and women in uniform make to keep us all safe in a dangerous world,” Speaker Boehner said. “I am truly honored to deliver the Republican address. It’s a long way from Red Oak, Iowa, to Washington, D.C. But now that I am here, I am excited to get to work in order to craft and implement real solutions as we chart a new path forward for our great nation. During this Congress, we must help grow a vibrant economy, see to it that our veterans receive promised quality care and that our military has the tools to defend our nation's security, and ensure the federal government begins to run more effectively and efficiently,” Senator Ernst said. In November 2014, Ernst became the first woman elected to federal office from Iowa, and the first female combat veteran to serve in the U.S. Senate. She will now be the first first-year freshman senator to give the Republican Address to the Nation. Born and raised on a farm in Southwest Iowa, Ernst’s parents instilled in her the values that have been important to generations of Iowans: hard work, service and sacrifice — values she is committed to bringing to Washington, D.C. Ernst received her undergraduate degree from Iowa State University where she joined the university’s ROTC program. After graduating in 1992, Ernst joined the U.S. Army Reserves and transitioned to the Army National Guard in 2001. In 2003, she served as a company commander in Kuwait and Iraq, leading 150 Iowa Army National Guardsmen during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Ernst continues to serve as a Lt. Colonel in the Iowa Army National Guard. She resides in Red Oak, Iowa, with her husband Gail and their 15-year-old daughter Libby.

With this experience, the student delegates will be able to learn about government first-hand,” Senator Grassley said. “I congratulate them on this great opportunity and commend them for their hard work.” According to the United States Senate Youth Program “The overall mission of the program is to help instill within each class of USSYP student delegates more profound knowledge of the American political process and a lifelong commitment to public service.

The students will also tour many of the national monuments and several museums and they will stay at the historic Mayflower Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C. “In addition to outstanding leadership abilities and a strong commitment to volunteer work, the student delegates generally rank academically in the top one percent of their states among high school juniors and seniors.” For more information on the program, visit www.ussenateyouth.org. # # #
01.08.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Following her first series of votes on the Senate floor, Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) issued the following statement after voting in favor of reauthorizing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA). This six year reauthorization voted on in the Senate today protects taxpayers by shifting more of the financial burden of potential terrorism-related losses from the government to the insurance market. “This reauthorization provides important safeguards for hardworking American taxpayers and businesses while also rolling back unnecessary regulations hurting our agricultural community,” said Senator Ernst. On Wednesday, the House of Representatives backed reauthorization of TRIA with overwhelming bipartisan support. Authorization for the program lapsed at the end of 2014 after the Senate adjourned without voting on the measure. BACKGROUND TRIA was initially implemented following the attacks on September 11, 2001. The original program ensured the government would act as a reinsurer for insurance companies if the damage surpassed $100 million. This six year reauthorization voted on in the Senate today protects taxpayers by shifting more of the financial burden of potential terrorism-related losses from the government to the insurance market. The program now ensures the government will act as a reinsurer for insurance companies if the damage surpassed $200 million. It also increases the percentage the Secretary of Treasury would recoup from the insurance industry from 133 percent to 140 percent. A measure in the bill ends an existing Dodd-Frank Act interpretation and now allows for non-financial institutions, such as agricultural and energy companies, to be exempt from posting collateral in situations like when using derivatives to mitigate risk. There is broad support for TRIA and the Dodd-Frank fix among businesses and organizations including John Deere and the Chamber of Commerce. TRIA passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 416 to 5. It passed the Senate 93 to 4. # # #
01.06.2015	WASHINGTON, D.C. – Senator Joni Ernst (R-IA) released the following remarks after being sworn-in as the newest United States Senator from Iowa. Click the video below to watch. “Hi, I’m Joni Ernst. I am truly honored and humbled to speak to you today as Iowa’s newest United States Senator. “As I’ve said before, it is certainly a long way from Red Oak to Washington, D.C. But now that I am here, I am excited that I am in a position to bring our way - the Iowa way, with me on this important journey. What does the Iowa Way mean to me? Well, in part, it is about working with our neighbors to find solutions to the many problems we face rather than resorting to politics as usual that most Americans have come to expect from Washington. But let me be clear, I am here to work for you in order to craft and implement real solutions as we chart a new path forward for our nation. “Like so many Iowans, I also believe in the importance of hard work, service and sacrifice. As a mother, soldier and independent voice, I am committed to bringing these very values to Washington. “During this Congress, there is no limit to what can be accomplished when we work together. We must help grow a vibrant economy, ensure our veterans receive promised quality care and that our military has the tools to defend our nation's security, protect Iowa farmers and our vital agricultural interests, and ensure the federal government runs effectively and efficiently. “America’s greatness comes from the people not government. I believe that you know what is best for Iowa more than those in Washington, which is why I am launching my 99 county tour across the state in the next few weeks to ensure I meet and hear from as many of my fellow Iowans as possible. Please also visit my website Ernst.Senate.Gov and tell me what you would like to see Congress accomplish. “Together, we will work together and build an America that ensures that we leave a better Iowa and a better country for our children and grandchildren. I look forward to hearing from you soon. “Thank you and may God continue to bless the great State of Iowa and the United States of America.” # # #
